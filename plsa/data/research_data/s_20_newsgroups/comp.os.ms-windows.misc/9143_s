 note here: the mks toolkit (for dos/windows & os/2) gives you a good
 suite of standard unix utilities.  there are other similar systems from
 other vendors as well.  the emx system for os/2 gives you most of the
 standard unix system calls for recompiling your unix programs under
 os/2.  not quite the same thing as actually running unix programs
 directly in either case, but emx makes os/2 almost as compatible with
 unix systems as many unix systems are with each other.  and, best of
 all, emx is free.  :-)
 
 there is a similar system (go32) for dos, but it doesn't work with
 windows, as far as i know.

 should add in the cost for dos with both geos and windows, neither of
 which is a standalone os at this point.  neither os/2 nor unix requires
 dos.
 
 btw, two of the best unices i've seen for the pee cee are unixware ($300
 for the personal edition) and linux (free).  so i don't agree that "a
 good one costs $400-$700."  :-)
 
 and, if you really want to check out the various options available to
 you, you should also look into desqview and desqview/x.
 
 cheers
