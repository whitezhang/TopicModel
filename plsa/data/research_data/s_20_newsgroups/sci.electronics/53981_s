 : one not-so-quick question to throw out there for you guys...
 
 : for our class project, we need to design and build a power supply
 : to the following specs:
 
 : voltatge:  adjustable from 1-12v
 : current:   *limited* at 1a
 
 : voltage must stay within 2% of designated value for i from 0-1a
 : ac ripple less than 5 mv (rms)
 
 to decide which kind of circuit you must know the initialprecission of
 the limiter-current and the allowed temp-drift.
 
 in the first case, you can use a ube of a transistor as a voltage-reference
 of about 0.7 vdc with a temp-drift of 2mv/k. in the second case its better
 you use a bandgap-ref and a opamp-circuit to detect the maximum-current.
 the output of this opamp controlls the outputstage to limit the current.
