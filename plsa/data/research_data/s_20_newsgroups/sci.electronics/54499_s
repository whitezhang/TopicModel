 i think its a great, but idealistic idea. a reseacher will first of all try 
 to publish a worthy paper in a credible, professional magazine and not in a 
 community like usenet which is infamous for lots (not all) of junk 
 information. the papers that will be "published" here will, in general, be 
 of low quality. also, it is improbable that any credit will be given to a 
 researcher who publish here - and sadly, that is nowadays a main reason for 
 publishing.
 
 usenet is great for informal discussions and free exchange of ideas - keep 
 it like that. a new, specialist group is just not worth it.
