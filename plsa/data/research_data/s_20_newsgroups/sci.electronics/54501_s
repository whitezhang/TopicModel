 laser holes are (or were) used to prevent someone from making exact copies 
 of a disk. you do not want to write to the damaged disk, only read and use

 i remember a program called copywrite that could copy a disk with a laser 
 hole in it. i think it simulates the laser hole. after copying the disk the 
 program is, if necessary, used in conjunction with a program called nokey or
