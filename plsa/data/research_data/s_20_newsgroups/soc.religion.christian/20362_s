 hi...
 
 i'm new to this group, and maybe this has been covered already,
 but does anybody out there see the current emphasis on the
 environment being turned (unintentionally, of course) into
 pantheism?
 
 i've debated this quite a bit, and while i think a legitimate
 concern for the planet is a great thing, i can easily see it
 being perverted into something dangerous.
 
 as evidence, may i quote the wall street journal (of all
 things!), april 2 (editorial page):
 "we suspect that's because one party to the (environmental)
 dispute thinks the earth is sanctified.  it's clear that much
 of the environmentalist energy is derived from what has been
 called the religious left, a secular, or even pagan fanaticism
 that now worships such gods as nature and gender with a
 reverence formerly accorded real religions."  (emphasis mine).
 
 thoughts?  reactions?  harangues?
