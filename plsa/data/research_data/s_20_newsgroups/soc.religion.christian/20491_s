 regarding david wilkerson's prophecies.  while i'm not real sure of
 his credibility, i do remember a book he wrote, called a vision or
 something like that.  he made a prediction that people who bought gold
 would be hurt financially.  at the time, gold was up to about $800;
 now it is less than half that.  this prediction stuck in my mind
 because a lot of people where i worked were buying gold.
 
 the problem is, we tend to remember predictions that come true and
 forget ones that didn't (a la jean dixon).  does anyone know if there
 any of his predictions, perhaps from the book i mentioned, that can
 pretty definitely be said to have not come true?
