 how do you do bus-mastering on the isa bus?

 if we're talking isa (at) bus here, then you can only have 1 dma channel
 active at any one time, presumably transferring data from a single device.
 so even though you can have at least 7 devices on a scsi bus, explain how
 all 7 of those devices can to dma transfers through a single scsi card
 to the isa-at bus at the same time.
 
 also, i'm still trying to track down a copy of ibm's at reference book,
 but from their pc technical manual (page 2-93):
 
 "the (fdd) adapter is buffered on the i.o bus and uses the system board
 direct memory access (dma) for record data transfers."
 i expect to see something similar for the pc-at hdd adapter.  
 so the lowly low-density original pc fdd card used dma and the pc-at
 hdd controller doesn't!?!?  that makes real sense.
