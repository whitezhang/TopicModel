 
 i have a headland technologies video seven vramii board that only
 came with 512k, at the time this was ok but...
 
 i need info or help with upgrading this board to 1 mbyte.  there are
 2 rows of pins over the vram chips, i think for a piggyback board
 of vram.  i would like to hear from anyone that may be able to help
 me upgrade this board.  maybe someone from headland who maybe read-
 ing this has one of these piggyback boards just laying around, please
 please please!
 
 does anyone know of where i could maybe buy the upgrade for this?  i
 would sure love to use this in 800x600-256 color mode but for the time
 being, i can only get 3/4 of the screen with the bottom part a white
 strip, obviously because of the missing vram, actually i'm surprised
 it even works to this degree at all!
 
 as a last resort, i will wind up selling this board :^( and probably be
 getting a 1 mb-et4000 based "dumb frame buffer".  this vramii was editors
 choice in the 9/24/91 pc mag.  so if anyone has any info, please email
 or as a last resort post to this group.  thanks in advance.
