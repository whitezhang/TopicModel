 get back to your vendors, or better yet the board manufactures and get
 some more info:
    where made.
    norton indexes (yeah i know bms suck but whats a mother to do?)
    number of slots, and types, # esia and # 32 bit?
    any ide or scsi on board?
    how easy to upgrade ram, location and # of pins.
    overdrive?
    oscilator kits?
    does it have a 16550 uart?
    who's bios?
 
 these might make you feel better about either system, but i must 
 agree that ares with 7 days of 24 hr tech and 2 year warranty is
 encouraging.
