 i read about the development of eisa-2 some time ago but dismissed it
 in light of the intense interest in vesa and pci.  however, i recently
 was disheartened to hear that isa cannot address more than 16mb of ram,
 a limit that too many of us will hit all too soon.
 
 i recall that eisa-2 will support 64-bit transfer among other enhancements.
 is there such a standard being developed?
