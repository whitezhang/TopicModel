 killed by handgun, or killed?  if i'm dead, i don't much care if it
 was by being shot or stabbed to death.

 i don't think you can get an accurate indicator of how safe england is
 compared to switzerland by concentrating only on handgun murders and  
 completely ignoring murders by other weapons, not to mention the rate of
 other violent crimes.  if there are more guns in circulation, if follows
 that more people will be killed with them 'cause they are available to
 the person intent on committing a crime _regardless_ of whether they
 have to do it with a gun, knife, or bare hands.  
 
 the gun control lobby doesn't seem to understand this point.  if people
 are intent on committing a crime, they will do it with whatever means
 are available to them.
