 
 the atf agent interviewed on "street stories" reported that the raid was
 ill planned, and went ahead even when they (the bd's) knew the atf was 
 coming. why?
 
 i believe this raid was ill planned because they only had 2 days to plan it,
 and it was continued when failure was obvious because it had a bit part
 in the much larger political agenda of president clinton. i would even 
 suggest that the loss of 4 atf agents is inconsequential in this the
 context of his political agenda. it might even be beneficial to his agenda, 
 as it helps point up just how evil these assualt weapons are. further proof
 might be that the atf denied their agents (street stories report) requests
 for sufficient fire power. 
 
 important dates: 
 feb 25th - nj assembly votes to overturn assault weapon ban.
 feb 28th - compound in waco attacked.	   
 
 on feb. 25th the new jersey assembly voted to overturn the assault weapon
 ban in that state. it looked like it might be a tight vote, but the senate
 in n.j. was going to vote to overturn the ban. it would not sit well to have
 an eastern state overturn an assault weapon ban, given clintons stated
 agenda on gun control. i suspect clinton gave the order to get someone or some
 group with assualt weapons and have the press present (they were initially
 at the incident in waco) to record the event for the tv audience. the agent 
 on "street stories" reported that a supervisor was urging them all to "get 
 ready fast", as "they know we are coming". i believe this attack continued, 
 even tho the probablility of failure was high,  because it came from the top 
 down. after the n.j. assembly vote, the atf had a limited amount of time to
 come up with something, and the wackos in waco fit the bill nicely.
