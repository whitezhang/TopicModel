 
 some of the messages here seem to reflect the view that the government is
 listening in on everything and one will have to hide one's clipper messages
 somehow if non-escrowed crypto goes away.
 
 a little perspective might be in order.
 
 the number of court ordered wire taps is pretty low. law enforcement has to
 present pretty good evidence to get even that limited number of
 authorizations.
 
 thus the overwhelming majority of conversations are neither tapped nor
 recorded by the government, and for that to happen they have to:
 a) have a pretty good reason, with evidence;
 b) use this sparingly on highest priority "pretty good reasons."
 
 though the system may be imperfect, it is a long way from the horror stories
 some here seem to believe or anticipate.
