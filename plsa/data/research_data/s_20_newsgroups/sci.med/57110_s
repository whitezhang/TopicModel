 
 i have a 42 yr old male friend, misdiagnosed as having
  osteopporosis for two years, who recently found out that his
  illness is the rare gaucher's disease. 
 
 gaucher's disease symptoms include: brittle bones (he lost 9 
  inches off his hieght); enlarged liver and spleen; internal
  bleeding; and fatigue (all the time). the problem (in type 1) is
  attributed to a genetic mutation where there is a lack of the
  enzyme glucocerebroside in macrophages so the cells swell up.
  this will eventually cause death.
 
 enyzme replacement therapy has been successfully developed and
  approved by the fda in the last few years so that those patients
  administered with this drug (called ceredase) report a remarkable
  improvement in their condition. ceredase, which is manufactured
  by biotech biggy company--genzyme--costs the patient $380,000
  per year. gaucher's disease has justifyably been called "the most
  expensive disease in the world".
 
 need info:
 i have researched gaucher's disease at the library but am relying
  on netlanders to provide me with any additional information:
 **news, stories, reports
 **people you know with this disease
 **ideas, articles about genzyme corp, how to get a hold of
    enough money to buy some, programs available to help with
    costs.
 **basically any help you can offer
 
 thanks so very much!
