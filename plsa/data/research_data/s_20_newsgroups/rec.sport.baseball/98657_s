 i heard that eli is selling the team to a group in cinninati. this would
 help so that the o's could make some real free agent signings in the 
 offseason. training camp reports that everything is pretty positive right
 now. the backup catcher postion will be a showdown between tackett and parent
 although i would prefer parent. #1 draft pick jeff hammonds may be coming
 up faster in the o's hierarchy of the minors faster than expected. mike
 flanagan is trying for another comeback. big ben is being defended by
 coaches saying that while the homers given up were an awful lot, most came
 in the beginning of the season and he really improved the second half. this
 may be ben's year. 
 	i feel that while this may not be mussina's cy young year, he will
 be able to pitch the entire season without periods of fatigue like last year
 around august. i really hope baines can provide the rf support the o's need.
 orsulak was decent but i had hoped that chito martinez could learn defense
 better and play like he did in '91. the o's right now don't have many
 left-handed hitters. anderson proving last year was no fluke and cal's return
 to his averages would be big plusses in a drive for the pennant. the 
 rotation should be sutcliffe, mussina, mcdonald, rhodes, ?????. olson is an
 interesting case. will he strike out the side or load the bases and then get
 three pop outs? you never know.
 the way i see the al east this year (with personal biases mixed in)
 baltimore
 new york
 toronto
 milwaukee
 cleveland
 boston
 detroit
 (the top 4 are the only true contenders in my mind. one of these 4 will
 definitely win the division unless it snows in hell/maryland :). i feel
 that this baltimore's season to finally put everything together.)
