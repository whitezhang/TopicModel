 
 the babe and the pride of the yankees offer very different renditions of
 the sotry about ruth and gherig hitting home runs for the boy in the
 hospital.  can some historian out there explain "history's" version of the
 story.  
 
 i wouldn't put is past either (or both) of the movies to season the truth
 with a little extra spice.
 
 any other comments as to inaccuracies in these two movies?
