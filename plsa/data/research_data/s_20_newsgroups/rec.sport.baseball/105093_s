 i agree. i'll delete more as well.

 still, if the 'whispers' reached san francisco, it is certainly possible they
 were stronger elsewhere. also, it was teammates making the aspersions. in any
 event, i know of no other player to be maligned in the last couple years.

 uh, the original author's point was that black and white players were por-
 trayed differently by "the media", and towards this, he gave a highly selected
 list to "prove" his case. sanders' name showed up eventually. i dispute that
 sanders has ever been called lazy by "the media".

 uh, that poster specifically stated "allow me to be the first". it is not a
 quibble, then, to state that "the media" did not portray canseco as being 
 lazy. if the other person chooses to so accuse him, after my post, that does not
 make it a quibble. and in fact, the media around here tend(ed) to play up his
 time in the wieght room. hardly "lazy", and hardly a "quibble". have you ever
 seen any "mediot" portray canseco as "lazy"? unconcerned with his fielding, yes.
 lazy, no.

 well, canseco has been involved in several felonies, including his high-speed
 record, carrying concealed fire-arms, and of course the domestic violence. 
 clemens had a run-in at a bar. canseco had that, as well, and in both cases, the
 coverage was relatively minimal.

 uh, if the only evidence offered is anecdotal, how can it be objected that the
 counter to it is also anecdotal?

 uh, yes, and i agree with your assesment of boggs, rather specifically. however,
 you did say "everybody who has ever won a batting title" has been accused of
 selfishness. i have not ever, anywhere, heard this said of puckett. pendleton,
 either. similarly, brett, b williams, and others.

 there are others. perhaps they are simply not as outspoken, except in the
 case of the "born-again" types i mention.
