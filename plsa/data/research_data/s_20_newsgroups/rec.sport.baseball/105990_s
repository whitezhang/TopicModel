 	i looked up "might" to see why you selected that particular word,
 and discovered the line ". . . to express permission, liberty,
 probability, possibility . . ."  it also said something about being a
 "polite" alternative to "may."  the presence of "probability, possibility"
 can certainly be used to partially explain your word selection.  
 so, i'd say to all extents and purposes, "yes, you might."  in fact, you did.
 (not that you were asking *me* specifically.)
 
 	the next question is, why would a mailing list be "more" appropriate?
 we don't all get mailing lists.  we surely don't all get mailing lists about
 the teams about which we are most enthused.  so it seems to me r.s.baseball
 is an appropriate place to look for information about teams one doesn't
 necessarily follow day-to-day.
 
 	this is not intended as flamage, but rather is an attempted answer,
 as you posed your post as a question.
