 first of all as far as i know, only male homosexuality is explicitly
 mentioned in the bibles, so you're off the hook there, i think. in
 any event, there are *plenty* of people in many denominations who
 do not consider a person's sexual identification of gay/lesbian/bisexual
 as an "immoral lifestyle choice"

 this is another misconception. you are not being told the whole story.
 
 my former minister is a lesbian, and i know personally and
 professionally several openly gay and lesbian ministers. i am
 a unitarian-universalist and like most others in my denomination,
 am pro-choice. you needn't go looking to the unitarian universalists
 (which is a liberal religion) for acceptance of your sexual
 identification and pro-choice views, however; there are many of us
 who believe in spirituality and freedom of conscience.
 
 good luck on your journey!
