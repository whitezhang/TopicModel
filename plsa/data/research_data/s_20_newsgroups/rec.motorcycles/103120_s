 re: waving...
 
 i must say, that the courtesy of a nod or a wave as i meet other bikers while
 riding does a lot of good things to my mood... while riding is a lot of fun by
 itself, there's something really special about having someone say to you "hey,
 it's a great day for a ride... isn't it wonderful that we can spend some time
 on the road on days like this..." with a gesture.
 
 was sunny today for the first time in a week, took my bike out for a spin down
 to the local salvage yard/bike shop... ran into about 20 other people who were
 down there for similar reasons (there's this great stretch of road on the way
 down there... no side streets, lotsa leaning bends... ;) ... went on an
 impromptu coffee and bullshit run down to puyallup with a batch of people who 
 i didn't know, but who were my kinda people nonetheless.
 
 as a fellow commented to me while i was admiring his bike... "hey, it's not
 what you ride, it's that you ride... as long as it has 2 wheels and an engine
 it's the same thing..."
