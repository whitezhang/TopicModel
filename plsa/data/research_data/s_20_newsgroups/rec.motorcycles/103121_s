 1 hr/drink for the first 4 drinks.
 1.5 hours/drink for the next 6 drinks.
 2 hours/drink for the rest.
 
 these are fairly cautious guidelines, and will work even if you happen to 
 have a low tolerance or body mass.
 i think the cops and "don't you dare drink & drive" (tm) commercials will 
 usually say 1hr/drink in general, but after about 5 drinks and 5 hrs, you 
 could very well be over the legal limit. 
 watch yourself.
