 	what used to peeve me in canada was the cars with bloody _red_ rear
 indicators.  you'd see a single red light come on and think, "now, is he
 stopping but one brake-lamp is not working, or does he have those dumb bloody
 _red_ rear indicators?"  this being survival 101, you have to assume he's
 braking and take the appropriate actions, until such time as the light goes
 out and on again, after which you can be reasonably certain it's a bloody _red_
 rear indicator.
