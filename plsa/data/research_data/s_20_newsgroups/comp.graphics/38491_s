 
 the idea is to clip one polygon using another polygon (not
 necessarily rectangular) as a window.  my problem then is in
 finding out all the new vertices of the resulting "subpolygons"
 from the first one.  is this simply a matter of extending the
 usual algorithm whereby each of the edges of one polygon is checked
 against another polygon???  is there a simpler way??
 
 comments welcome.
