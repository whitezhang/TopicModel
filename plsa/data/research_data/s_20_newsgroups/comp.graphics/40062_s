 hi there,
 
 i am here looking for some help.
 
 my friend is a interior decor designer. he is from thailand. he is
 trying to find some graphics software on pc. any suggestion on which
 software to buy,where to buy and how much it costs ? he likes the most
 sophisticated 
 software(the more features it has,the better)
