 dmorf (dave's morph, i think is what it means) and dtax (dave's 
 tga assembler) are available in the msdos_uploads directory
 on the wuarchive.
 
 they are arjed and bundled with their respective xmemory versions,
 dmorfx.exe and dtax.exe, you can also find a version of aaplay.exe
 there, with which you can view files you create with dta.exe or
 dtax.exe.
 
 i downloaded the whole bunch last week and have been morphing 
 away the afternoons since.  the programmes are all a bit buggy and
 definitely not-ready-to-spread-to-the-masses, but they are very
 well written. 
 
 the interface is frustrating at first, but it gets easy once you
 figure out the tricks.
 
 i have noticed that dmorfx will crash horribly if you try to morph
 without using the splines option.  not sure why, since i don't have
 the source.  i think it was written for tp 6.0.
 
 if anyone else comes up with any other hints on getting the thing 
 to work right, tell me; it took me several hours the first time
 just to figure out that if i just used the durned splines then 
 it would work...
