 greetings all.
 	according to a faq i read, on 30 july 1992, joshua c. jensen posted an 
 article on bitmap manipulation (specifically, scaling and perspective) to the 
 newsgroup rec.games.programmer. (article 7716)
 	the article included source code in turbo pascal with inline assembly 
 language.
 
 	i have been unable to find an archive for this newsgroup, or a current 
 email address for joshua c. jensen.
 	if anyone has the above details, or a copy of the code, could they 
 please let me know.	many thanks.
 					yours gratefully, etc.  myles.
