 
 hello,
      i am looking to add voice input capability to a user interface i am
 developing on an hp730 (unix) workstation.  i would greatly appreciate 
 information anyone would care to offer about voice input systems that are 
 easily accessible from the unix environment. 
 
      the names or adresses of applicable vendors, as well as any 
 experiences you have had with specific systems, would be very helpful.
 
      please respond via email; i will post a summary if there is 
 sufficient interest.
 
 
 thanks,
 ken
 
 
 p.s.  i have found several impressive systems for ibm pc's, but i would 
 like to avoid the hassle of purchasing and maintaining a separate pc if 
 at all possible.
