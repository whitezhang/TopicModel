 
 hello netters!
  
 i have a fairly weak question to ask everybody in netland.  i've looked though
 the last faq for comp.graphics but i didn't find my answer.  thus the post.
  
 i'll keep it short.
  
 question:  how do i display any raster files, gif files, iff or tiff images
 that i have on my "root window" or background?  i have a sun ipc, openwindows
 3.0, sun os 4.1.3 if that helps any.
  
 i've compiled pov for the sun and would like to display some of the work i have
 done as a background/tile.  thanks for any help or information that you
 provide.  have a good day.

 p.s.
 kudo's to the people who provided pov, its great!
