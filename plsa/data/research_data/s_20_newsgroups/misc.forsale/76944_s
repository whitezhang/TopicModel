 most comics are in near mint to mint condition, are bagged in shiny 
 polypropylene bags, and backed with white acid free boards.  shipping is
 $1.50 for one book, $3.00 for more than one book, or free if you order 
 a large enough amount of stuff.  i am willing to haggle.
 
 i have thousands and thousands of other comics, so please let me know what 
 you've been looking for, and maybe i can help.  
 
 i will trade for other comics as well as computer equipment, video
 equipment, etc...  let me know what you want to trade!!
