 kent,
 
 have you ever been part of any activist group or campaign, from 
 amnesty international, green peace, etc onward?  making out form
 letters and handing out copies to others to send is common among
 all of these groups.
 
 you may not like what i have done, but it is hardly unique.
 
 additionally, i certainly wouldn't mind if people wrote their own
 letters.  i offered a template to work from (if people so choose).
 if not, that is fine too.  again, what i have done is make use of a 
 approach as old as this country itself.
