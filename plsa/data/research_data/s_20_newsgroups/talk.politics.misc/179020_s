 this is a very good point.  one that i have held for sometime.  we do not
 allow people to develop on the paths that they choose or desire.  even with
 heterosexuals we tend to leave some hanging in the sense of knowledge and
 information about sexuality and relationships.
 
 it is very difficult for a young person to develop and build a positive
 view of themself when they are constantly being told implicitly and explicitly
 that they are wrong and immoral. 
 
 the concepts about personal relationships are deeply embedded in emotionalism
 and fear- these fears cover a wide range, but mostly jealousy and lack of trust
 seem to be cornerstones of modern day american relationships.  we also set on
 top of this the concepts of madison avenue attractiveness and standards and put
 the pressure on to measure up.
