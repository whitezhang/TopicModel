 on whose authority do you have this and on what grounds was it 
 dismissed?

 one case involved the construction of a conveyance to grantees "jointly, as 
 tenants in common, with equal rights and interest in said land, and to the 
 survivor thereof, in fee simple. . . . to have and to hold the same unto the 
 said parties hereto, equally, jointly, as tenants in common, with equal rights 
 and interest for the period or term of their lives, and to the survivor thereof 
 at the death of the other."
 
 the court held that the survivorship provision indicated an intent to create a 
 joint tenancy.  germain v. delaine, 294 ala. 443, 318 so.2d 681 (1975).
