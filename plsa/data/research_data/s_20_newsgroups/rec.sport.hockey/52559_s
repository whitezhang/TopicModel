 last night during a sharks' broadcast, commissioner bettman was
 interviewed during the first intermission.  he made no bones about it,
 the expansion to 28 is on permanent hold until he is satisfied that
 the current allotment of 26 are fully stable.  this means that cities
 looking for a club in the foreseeable future will have to wait until
 one team in some location fails or looks to relocate.
 
 this is good, imo.  there's no sense in expanding if it only means
 more failing franchises are in the mold.
