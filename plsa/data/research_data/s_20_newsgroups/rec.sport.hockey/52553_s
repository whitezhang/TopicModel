 i would have chosen alex zhitnik for biggest suprise.  they
 did expect that he would become a great defenseman, but i don't
 think anyone knew that he was going to be this impressive in his 
 rookie year.  his speed, skating ability, and puck control is
 exceptional -- he is the one to watch on the kings.
