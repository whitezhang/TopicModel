 actually, it is simple.
 
 a person p has committed a crime c in country x if p was within the borders
 of x at the time when c was committed.  it doesn't matter if the physical
 manifestation of c is outside x.
 
 for instance, if i hack into nasa's ames research lab and delete all their
 files, i have committed a crime in the united kingdom.  if the us authorities
 wish to prosecute me under us law rather than uk law, they have no automatic
 right to do so.
 
 this is why the net authorities in the us tried to put pressure on some sites
 in holland.  holland had no anti-cracking legislation, and so it was viewed
 as a "hacker haven" by some us system administrators.
 
 similarly, a company called red hot television is broadcasting pornographic
 material which can be received in britain.  if they were broadcasting in
 britain, they would be committing a crime.  but they are not, they are
 broadcasting from denmark, so the british government is powerless to do
 anything about it, in spite of the apparent law-breaking.
 
 of course, i'm not a lawyer, so i could be wrong.  more confusingly, i could
 be right in some countries but not in others...
