 it was no criticism of islam for a change, it was a criticism of the
 arguments used. namely, whenever people you identify as muslims are
 the victims of the attacks of others, they are used an argument for
 the bad situation of muslims. but whenever deeds by muslim that victimize
 others are named, they do not count as an argument because what these
 people did was not done as a true muslims. no mention is made how muslims
 are the cause of a bad situation of another party.
  
 double standards.
