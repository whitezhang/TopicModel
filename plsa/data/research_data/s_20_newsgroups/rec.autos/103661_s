 you ford vs chevy people must live in the planet of detroit or droid.
 
 like they say in the airforce, with enough horsepower anything will fly.
 
 i can put a 32valve v-8 with twin garret-4s on yugo and get 7.7sec qm.
 thats useless ... its still a yugo that will loose any race on a track,
 or on the street.
 
 have you detroit beings compared the ultra-long-throw stick shifts of
 the 5.0 with the 93 mr2 turbo or 93 rx7 (i ll buy it in 6 mos) ?
 
 or the torsen differential of the rx7 compared to the differential of 
 the 5.0 that sounds in every hairpin turn ?
 
 and bythe way 5.0 and camaro both have drums on the rear breaks ...
 hello , this is the 90 's ?
