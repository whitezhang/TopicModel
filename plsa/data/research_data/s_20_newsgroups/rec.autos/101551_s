 say, you bought your saturn at $13k, with a dealer profit of $2k.
 if the dealer profit is $1000, then you would only be paying $12k for
 the same car.  so isn't that saving money?
 
 moreover, if saturn really does reduce the dealer profit margin by $1000, 
 then their cars will be even better deals.  say, if the price of a saturn was
 already $1000 below market average for the class of cars, then after they
 reduce the dealer profit, it would be $2000 below market average.  it will:
 
 1) attract even more people to buy saturns because it would save them money.
  
 2) force the competitors to lower their prices to survive.
 
 now, not only will saturn owners benefit from a lower dealer profit, even 
 the buyers for other cars will pay less.
 
 isn't that saving money?
