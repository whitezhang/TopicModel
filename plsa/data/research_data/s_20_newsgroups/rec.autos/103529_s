 agreed!  i own a mercury villager and i'm very impressed with the v6 and
 the at.  in the past, i've been biased towards manual/standard transmissions(i owned
 an aerostar with a 5-speed, it was awesome!), but settled with the at in the
 villager and have been pleasantly surprised with it's performance.
  
 btw, consumers report in their report on the villager, alluded to some
 funny noises from the at, i've been listening for them but haven't noticed anything
 unusual.
