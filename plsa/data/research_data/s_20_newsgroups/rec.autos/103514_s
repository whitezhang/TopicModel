  stay away from geico.
 
  a recent car & driver issue has an article about geico giving free
  laser guns to police departments to increase they're speed limit
  enforcement.  the article also said that if you get a speeding ticket
  your premium will increase dramatically based on how much "over the
  limit" you were.  if i remember correctly, at "more than 20 over",
  you'll get something like a 65% increase. 
 
  if you have a radar detector, you will be denied coverage or dropped
  immediately. 
 
  one accident claim and you will be dropped.
  after many years with geico, my father who had 0 tickets and had made
  0 claims, had an accident and filed an $800 claim.  he was dropped 
  immediately.  since then he has been with state farm for years with
  no complaints.
 
  i have been with state farm for about 20 years - no complaints.
