 sure sounds like they got a ringer.  the 325is i drove was definitely
 faster than that.  if you want to quote numbers, my aw autofile shows
 0-60 in 7.4, 1/4 mile in 15.9.  it quotes car and driver's figures
 of 6.9 and 15.3.  oh, btw, these numbers are for the 325i.
 
 i don't know how the addition of variable valve timing for 1993 affects it.
 but don't take my word for it.  go drive it.
