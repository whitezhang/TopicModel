    i sure don't know what and how they measure in regards to diesel 
  motors in cars, trucks, and busses, but i think they are probably
  measuring the wrong pollutants, or at the wrong time, or both.
 
    i certainly find it offensive to drive behind a diesel bus or
  diesel truck and some diesel cars.  they stink!  and it's always
  roll-up-the-windows panic time when one comes by or ducks in front
  of me when i am driving with my family.
 
    i don't think the combustion mixture is kept under very good
  control in diesel engines, and that's why they stink.  so the 
  invisible, unsmellable pollutants are reduced in diesels.  yeah,
  well so what!?  someone forgot about the visible, stinky kind, and,
  as far as i am concerned, those kind are just as bad.
 
     i am all for de-stinking the diesel vehicles.  it'll keep the
  traffic signs cleaner, too.

  these are my opinions, which should only make you read, think, and question.
