 ethiopian jews and not-quite jews
 
 the israeli press has published items about ethiopian 
 jews waiting in camps in addis ababa for immigration to 
 israel, who are dying of starvation. the following are 
 excerpts from an interview with the former general 
 director of the jdc project for development and welfare 
 of ethiopian jews, kobi friedman (hadashot, 21 april 
 1993), who has stated that "there are people dying in 
 addis ababa, but they are converts to christianity":
 
 "hadashor published the item about the dying jews after 
 viewing a video tape filmed last week in adis ababa. 
 how do you know that they are actually converts to 
 chritianity ?
 
 "if there are jews on the tape, then i don't know what to 
 say. i am speaking from experience when i say that those 
 who remained in ethiopia are christians. i know that 
 there have previously been things published in the press 
 by interesting parties, and there is no connection 
 between them and reality."
 
 "what interested parties ?"
 
 "ethiopian immigrants who want their christian relatives 
 to come here."
 
 "what to you recommend that ethiopian children in israel 
 do, when their parents and the rest of their relatives 
 remain in ethiopia ?"
 
 "i ask if it is the job of the state of israel to bring in the 
 40 relatives who stayed in ethiopia. well, my answer is 
 that it is not. it would be a better solution, economically 
 as well, for that young man to buy a one-way ticket to 
 ethiopia and reunite with his family there."
