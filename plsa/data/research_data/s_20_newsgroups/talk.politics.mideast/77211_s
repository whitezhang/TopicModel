 
 i think there are some generally accepted criteria according to which
 one can evaluate whether certain policies or practices constitute
 racial discrimination. these criteria are to be found for example in the
 1.  international convention for abolition of all forms of racial
     discrimination (ratified by most countries)
 2.   the international covenant of political and civil rights
 3.   the human rights charter
 4.   the european convention of human rights
 
 if one reads carefully how racial discrimination is defined in these
 legally binding instruments, and does not resort to sophistry, it is
 obvious that the state of israel is guilty of racial discrimination.
 
 
 the people suffering the most extreme form of racial discriminatnion
 by the zionist regime are the palestinian refugees, some of whom live
 under israeli military control and others who live in the diaspora.
 
 they are not entitled to return to their homeland for the sole
 reason that they are not jews. international law does not include any
 provisions which permits such denial of rights, under any circumstance.
 israel's actions of denial are totally illegal and immoral. by allowing
 the return of the refugees and permitting them to settle in tel in any area  of
 the state of israel, the state would finally gain its legitimaty under
 international law and could be justified in asking to be recognized. it
 would facilitate the peaceful integration of israel into the middle-east
 and constitute the best guarantee for permanent jewish presence -
 in the area. any attempt to create a separation, formal and human, between the
 israeli jewish and palestinian arab communities, is fraught with
 genociadal implications. i hope that u.s. jews, who sincerely wish that
 peace prevail in israel/palestine, will finally realize this fact.

 zionist racial discrimination are described.
