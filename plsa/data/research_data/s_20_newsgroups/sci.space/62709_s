 hardly.  the keck telescope in hawaii has taken its first pictures; they're

 i believe that this orbiting space junk will be far brighter still;
 more like the full moon.  the moon upsets deep-sky observation all
 over the sky (and not just looking at it) because of scattered light.
 
 this is a known problem, but of course two weeks out of every four are
 ok.  what happens when this billboard circles every 90 minutes?  what
 would be a good time then?
