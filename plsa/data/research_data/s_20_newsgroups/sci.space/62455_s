 the main effect of the spherical aberration problems with the
 primary mirror was to drive the computer engineers to develop the image
 processing software that much faster. when they use the _same_ deconvolution 
 software on the images from the fixed hubble, be ready for some 
 incredible results!  there is every reason to believe that the results will 
 _exceed_ the original specs by a fair margin.  
 
 adaptive optics is a combination of hardware and software.  it works 
 realtime, not after the fact, as is the case with hubble.  you might be
 interested to know this technology has made it to the amateur market, in
 the form of the ao-2 adaptive optics system.  starting on page 52 of the 
 april, 1993 sky & telescope is a three page review of this new product.
 it lists for $1,290.  the article states: "the ao-2 adaptive optics system 
 comes in a handy soft-plastic case that a three-year-old could carry 
 around."  even though this device is really only good for the brightest
 objects, "it could cope with image movements of up to 0.8 millimeter
 in the telescope's focal plane."  now just imagine how well this infant 
 technology will do in a few years, especially in a dedicated system that 
 has hundreds of thousands of dollars, and many man-hours invested in its
 development.
