 constants and equations for calculations
 
     this list was originally compiled by dale greer. additions would be
     appreciated.
 
     numbers in parentheses are approximations that will serve for most
     blue-skying purposes.
 
     unix systems provide the 'units' program, useful in converting
     between different systems (metric/english, etc.)
 
     numbers

 	1 megaton (mt) tnt = about 4.2e15 j or the energy equivalent of
 	about .05 kg (50 gm) of matter. ref: j.r williams, "the energy level
 	of things", air force special weapons center (ardc), kirtland air
 	force base, new mexico, 1963. also see "the effects of nuclear
 	weapons", compiled by s. glasstone and p.j. dolan, published by the
 	us department of defense (obtain from the gpo).
 
     equations
 
 	where d is distance, v is velocity, a is acceleration, t is time.
 	additional more specialized equations are available from:
 
 	    ames.arc.nasa.gov:pub/space/faq/moreequations
 
 
 	for constant acceleration
 	    d = d0 + vt + .5at^2
 	    v = v0 + at
 	  v^2 = 2ad
 
 	acceleration on a cylinder (space colony, etc.) of radius r and
 	    rotation period t:
 
 	    a = 4 pi**2 r / t^2
 
 	for circular keplerian orbits where:
 	    vc	 = velocity of a circular orbit
 	    vesc = escape velocity
 	    m	 = total mass of orbiting and orbited bodies
 	    g	 = gravitational constant (defined below)
 	    u	 = g * m (can be measured much more accurately than g or m)
 	    k	 = -g * m / 2 / a
 	    r	 = radius of orbit (measured from center of mass of system)
 	    v	 = orbital velocity
 	    p	 = orbital period
 	    a	 = semimajor axis of orbit
 
 	    vc	 = sqrt(m * g / r)
 	    vesc = sqrt(2 * m * g / r) = sqrt(2) * vc
 	    v^2  = u/a
 	    p	 = 2 pi/(sqrt(u/a^3))
 	    k	 = 1/2 v**2 - g * m / r (conservation of energy)
 
 	    the period of an eccentric orbit is the same as the period
 	       of a circular orbit with the same semi-major axis.
 
 	change in velocity required for a plane change of angle phi in a
 	circular orbit:
 
 	    delta v = 2 sqrt(gm/r) sin (phi/2)
 
 	energy to put mass m into a circular orbit (ignores rotational
 	velocity, which reduces the energy a bit).
 
 	    gmm (1/re - 1/2rcirc)
 	    re = radius of the earth
 	    rcirc = radius of the circular orbit.
 
 	classical rocket equation, where
 	    dv	= change in velocity
 	    isp = specific impulse of engine
 	    ve	= exhaust velocity
 	    x	= reaction mass
 	    m1	= rocket mass excluding reaction mass
 	    g	= 9.80665 m / s^2
 
 	    ve	= isp * g
 	    dv	= ve * ln((m1 + x) / m1)
 		= ve * ln((final mass) / (initial mass))
 
 	relativistic rocket equation (constant acceleration)
 
 	    t (unaccelerated) = c/a * sinh(a*t/c)
 	    d = c**2/a * (cosh(a*t/c) - 1)
 	    v = c * tanh(a*t/c)
 
 	relativistic rocket with exhaust velocity ve and mass ratio mr:
 
 	    at/c = ve/c * ln(mr), or
 
 	    t (unaccelerated) = c/a * sinh(ve/c * ln(mr))
 	    d = c**2/a * (cosh(ve/c * ln(mr)) - 1)
 	    v = c * tanh(ve/c * ln(mr))
 
 	converting from parallax to distance:
 
 	    d (in parsecs) = 1 / p (in arc seconds)
 	    d (in astronomical units) = 206265 / p
 
 	miscellaneous
 	    f=ma    -- force is mass times acceleration
 	    w=fd    -- work (energy) is force times distance
 
 	atmospheric density varies as exp(-mgz/kt) where z is altitude, m is
 	molecular weight in kg of air, g is local acceleration of gravity, t
 	is temperature, k is bolztmann's constant. on earth up to 100 km,
 
 	    d = d0*exp(-z*1.42e-4)
 
 	where d is density, d0 is density at 0km, is approximately true, so
 
 	    d@12km (40000 ft) = d0*.18
 	    d@9 km (30000 ft) = d0*.27
 	    d@6 km (20000 ft) = d0*.43
 	    d@3 km (10000 ft) = d0*.65
 
 		    atmospheric scale height	dry lapse rate
 		    (in km at emission level)	 (k/km)
 		    -------------------------	--------------
 	    earth	    7.5			    9.8
 	    mars	    11			    4.4
 	    venus	    4.9			    10.5
 	    titan	    18			    1.3
 	    jupiter	    19			    2.0
 	    saturn	    37			    0.7
 	    uranus	    24			    0.7
 	    neptune	    21			    0.8
 	    triton	    8			    1
 
 	titius-bode law for approximating planetary distances:
 
 	    r(n) = 0.4 + 0.3 * 2^n astronomical units (n = -infinity for
 	    mercury, 0 for venus, 1 for earth, etc.)
 
 	    this fits fairly well except for neptune.
