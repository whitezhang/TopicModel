 hello!
 
 we want to configure our x11r5 sytem (i486 33mhz running bsd-like unix)
 comming up with a chooser menu with different machines on it (works) an then
 connect to them. but the only connection works is localhost!
 an 'x -indirect <machine>' works very well!
 the configuration:
 
 		- starting the 'xdm' at boot time with no servers specified
 		   in xservers
 		- starting the x-server at boot time with x -indirect localhost
 
 	     ---> the chooser menu appears with the machines named in
 		  xacces bye
 			'*	chooser <machine1> <machine2> ... broadcast	
 		- the number of users on this machines and the load is 
 		    displayed correct
 
 		- selecting an other machine than my own host the x-server
 		   starts and nothing happens, after a time out the chooser menu
 		   appears again.
 
 i know the xdm bug in x11r4, but all machines running x11r5
 
 please help
