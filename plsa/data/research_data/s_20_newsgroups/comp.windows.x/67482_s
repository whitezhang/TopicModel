 
 	greetings,
 	we have a network of ~20 sun workstations, running sunos 4.1.1
 and openwindows 3.  7 of these are sun 3's that we have modified to
 run seth robertson's xkernel image, effectively turning them into
 xterminals.  we use xdm (x11r4) to manage the displays.
 
 	when we had 3 xkernel machines, things worked fine, but when
 we installed 4 more last weekend, we appear to have found a weakness.
 with 7 clients to 1 sparc 2, the sparc 2 window manager is eventually
 getting munged.  
 
 	let me try to be precise:  the user sitting at the machine
 that does all the actual processing for these xterminals is having
 control of his keyboard and screen yanked away.  (when this was the
 department chair, it was kind of cute).  we poked at xdm for a few
 days and are satisfied that it is not at fault.  our current theory is
 that olwm (the sun version) was not meant for running multiple copies
 on one machine (which is what happens -- the console user runs olwm,
 and every xterminal logged in has olwm running on the xterminal
 server). 
 
 	has anyone had any prior experience with this sort of behavior?
 	can anyone shoot obvious holes in this theory?
 	how about obvious gimmes?
 	and, of course, any ideas on how to solve it?
 
 	any ideas are greatly appreciated.
