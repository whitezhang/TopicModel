 
 hello,
 
 
 our application requires us to capture keypad presses for all windows
 in a number of applications.  we are trying to use action translation
 tables to implement this.  we have only succeeded by assigning the
 translation table to every individual widget in all windows in a single
 application.  the xt calls we make are included below.
 
 it would be much more convenient if we could assign the translation
 table to a class of widgets rather than individual widget instantiations,
 and also accomplish it for multiple applications.  if someone could
 describe how do this it would be greatly appreciated.
 
 platform: sun sparc w/ x11r4 & motif 1.1.4
