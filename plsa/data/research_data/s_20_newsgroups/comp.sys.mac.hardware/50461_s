 i have been playing with my centris 610 for almost a week now.  i must say
 this machine is really fast!  the hardware turn-on feature is annoying, but
 i got powerkey from sophisicated circuits and it works like a charm.
 
 however, i still have a few complaints:
 - when i restart the machine every time, the screen image (the desktop
   pattern) jerks up and down for a few times.
 - the quantum 170 drive is noisy
 
 overall, i highly recommend it:  it is fast, affordable and looks great!
