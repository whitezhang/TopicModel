 
 my wife has one of these.  i have not had much chance to fiddle with
 it, but in comparison to our laserwriters with canon engines, she
 complains that the print is too light for her taste.  the difference
 is quite apparent even when the print setting on the select 310 is
 adjusted to the darkest possible level.  i don't find it
 objectionable, and indeed rather like it, but be warned that some
 people don't care for it and it is considerably different. 
 
 i recall that years ago there were lots of debates over write-black
 vs. write-white engines when dealing with tex drivers.  is something
 like that going on here?
