 yes, and everyone thinks as you do.  no one thinks that he is going to cause
 or be involved in a fatal accident, but the likelihood is surprisingly high.
 just because you are the man on the firing squad whose gun is shooting
 blanks does not mean that you are less guilty.

 you mean that killing is wrong in all but one situtation?  and, you should
 note that that situation will never occur.  there are always other options
 thank killing.  why don't you just say that all killing is wrong.  this
 is basically what you are saying.

 but, most people have found the risk to be acceptable.  you are probably
 much more likely to die in a plane crash, or even using an electric
 blender, than you are to be executed as an innocent.  i personally think
 that the risk is acceptable, but in an ideal moral system, no such risk
 is acceptable.  "acceptable" is the fudge factor necessary in such an
 approximation to the ideal.
