 #i think that you are changing the meaning of "values" here. perhaps
 #it is time to backtrack and take a look at the word.
 #
 #value n. 1. a fair equivalent or return for something, such as goods
 #or service. 2. monetary or material worth. 3. worth as measured in 
 #usefulness or importance; merit. 4. a principle, standard, or quality
 #considered inherently worthwhile or desirable. 5. precise meaning, as
 #of a word. 6. an assigned or calculated numerical quantity. 7. mus. 
 #the relative duratation of a tone or rest. 8. the relative darkness or
 #lightness of a color. 9. the distinctive quality of a speech or speech
 #sound. 
 #
 #in context of a moral system, definition four seems to fit best. in terms
 #of scientific usage, definitions six or eight might apply. note that
 #these definitions do not mean the same thing.
 
 no, i'm using definition (3), or perhaps (4) in both cases.  if there
 is no objective worth, usefulness, or importance then science has no 
 objective worth, usefulness, or importance.  if nothing is inherently
 worthwhile or desirable, then simple theories with accurate predictions
 are not inherently worthwhile or desirable. do you see any flaws in this?
 
 if on the other hand, some things *have* objective worth, usefulness,
 or importance, it would be interesting to know what they are.
 
 #if you can provide an objective foundation for "morality" then that will
 #be a good beginning.
 
 i'm not willing to attempt this until someone provides an objective
 basis for the notion that science is useful, worthy, or important in
 dealing with observed facts.  alternatively, you could try to
 demonstrate to me that science is not necessarily useful, worthy
 or important in any situation.   in other words, i need to know
 how you use the term "objective".
