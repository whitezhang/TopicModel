 wait a minute, doug.  i know you are better informed than that.  the us 
 has never invaded nicaragua (as far as i know).  we liberated grenada 
 from the cubans	to protect us citizens there and to prevent the completion 
 of a strategic air strip.  panama we invaded, true (twice this century).  
 vietnam?  we were invited in by the government of s. vietnam.  (i guess 
 we "invaded" saudi arabia during the gulf war, eh?)  mexico?  we have 
 invaded mexico 2 or 3 times, once this century, but there were no missiles 
 for anyone to shoot over here at that time.  hawaii?  we liberated it from 
 spain.
 
 so if you mean by the word "invaded" some sort of military action where
 we cross someone's border, you are right 5 out of 6.  but normally
 "invaded" carries a connotation of attacking an autonomous nation.
 (if some nation "invades" the u.s. virgin islands, would they be
 invading the virgin islands or the u.s.?)  so from this point of
 view, your score falls to 2 out of 6 (mexico, panama).

 no, it's someone who believes in "peace-at-all-costs".  in other words,
 a person who would have supported giving hitler not only austria and
 czechoslakia, but poland too if it could have averted the war.  and one
 who would allow hitler to wipe all *all* jews, slavs, and political 
 dissidents in areas he controlled as long as he left the rest of us alone.
 
 "is it supposed to be bad to be a peace-nik," you ask?  well, it depends
 on what your values are.  if you value life over liberty, peace over
 freedom, then i guess not.  but if liberty and freedom mean more to you
 than life itself; if you'd rather die fighting for liberty than live
 under a tyrant's heel, then yes, it's "bad" to be a peace-nik.
 
 the problem with most peace-niks it they consider those of us who are
 not like them to be "bad" and "unconscionable".  i would not have any
 argument or problem with a peace-nik if they held to their ideals and
 stayed out of all conflicts or issues, especially those dealing with 
 the national defense.  but no, they are not willing to allow us to
 legitimately hold a different point-of-view.  they militate and 
 many times resort to violence all in the name of peace.  (what rank
 hypocrisy!)  all to stop we "warmongers" who are willing to stand up 
 and defend our freedoms against tyrants, and who realize that to do
 so requires a strong national defense.
 
 time to get off the soapbox now.  :)
