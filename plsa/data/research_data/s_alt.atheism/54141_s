 could an atheist accept a usage in which religious literature or
 tradition is viewed in a metaphorical way?  of course: this is
 essentially what we do with homer, or with other concepts such as
 fate, luck, free will ;-)...  however, there remains the question of
 whether the religious literature of -- say -- christianity is a
 particularly *good* set of metaphors for the world today.  it's also
 entirely unclear, and to me quite unlikely, that one could take a
 contemporary religion like that and divorce the metaphoric potential
 from the literalism and absolutism it carries now in many cases.
