 the online webster gets in some good licks, too:
 
 	1b1: existing only in relation to a knowing subject or willing agent
 
 	1b3: belonging to the sensible world and being intersubjectively 
 	     observable or verifiable esp. by scientific methods of a 
 	     symptom of disease
 
 	1b4: perceptible to persons other than an affected individual
 
 for reason i can't quite pin down, i particularly liked 1b4.
