 this is the story of kent, the archetype finn, that lives in the 
 bay area, and tried to purchase thomas paine's "age of reason". this
 man was driving around, to staceys, to books inc, to "well, cleanlighted
 place", to daltons, to various other places.
 
 when he asked for this book, the well educated american book store
 assistants in most placed asked him to check out the thriller section,
 or then they said that his book has not been published yet, but they
 should receive the book soon. in some places the assistants bluntly
 said that they don't know of such an author, or that he is not 
 a well known living author, so they don't keep copies of his books.
 
 such is the life and times of america, 200+ years after the revolution.
 
 
 cheers,
 kent
