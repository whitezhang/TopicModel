 well here's how i prepared.  i got one of those big beach
 umbrellas, some of those gel-pack ice things, a big coleman cooler
 which i've loaded up with miller draft (so i like miller draft,
 so sue me), a new pair of new balance sneakers, a sony
 watchman, and a couple of cartons of bonton cheddar cheese
 popcorn.
 
 i haven't decided what to wear yet.  what does one wear to an
 eternal damnation?
