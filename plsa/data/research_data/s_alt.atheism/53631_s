 an obvious effect of homosexuality is non-procreation.  that, unlike your
 statement, is a fact.  please prove that (a) homosexuality is defended as 
 means of population control, (b) being atheist causes you to hold these
 beliefs.  i defend homosexuality because (a) what people do with their
 bodies is none of my business (b) i defend the equal rights of
 all humans.  do you?

 prove your statement.  electrons are waves.  electrons are particles.  i 
 believe in both.  i have physical proof of both.  i have no proof of god(tm)
 only an ancient book.  that is not indicative of the existence of a being
 with omnipotence or omnipresence.  and, by your own argument, christians
 don't exist.

 first of all, your earlier statements have absolutely nothing to do
 with your question.  why did you post them?  to show that athiests,
 besides not existing (your view), are more humane than christians/other
 religions?
 
 
 secondly i am very much for the control of population growth.
 
 the logic that you cannot grasp indicates ignorance of contraception.
 but of course, this is 'outlawed' (sometimes literally) by religion
 since if it can't create more followers, it will die.
