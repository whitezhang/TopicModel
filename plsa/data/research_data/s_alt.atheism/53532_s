 i lived in tokyo for a year and a half, and one of the many reasons why
 i intend to go back indefinitely is the freedom one enjoys when one can
 walk anywhere (and i mean *anywhere*) at any time of day or night and not
 feel uneasy, even if one's from an ethnic minority as i was.
 
 clues for bobby (why do i bother?): (i) tokyo is a city, and inner tokyo
 is an inner city; (ii) there is a negligible level of violent crime, and
 a street murder will be a lead item on *national* tv news; (iii) the
 population is almost universally atheistic.
 
 next time i go for a stroll around beirut at night, i'll let you know how
 it compares.
