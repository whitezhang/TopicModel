 if you're talking about this intellectual engagement of revelation, well,
 it's obviously a risk one takes.

 i'm not an objectivist, so i'm not particularly impressed with problems of
 conceptualization.  the problem in this case is at least as bad as that of
 trying to explain quantum mechanics and relativity in the terms of ordinary
 experience.  one can get some rough understanding, but the language is, from
 the perspective of ordinary phenomena, inconsistent, and from the
 perspective of what's being described, rather inexact (to be charitable).
 
 an analogous situation (supposedly) obtains in metaphysics; the problem is
 that the "better" descriptive language is not available.

 this word "reliable" is essentially meaningless in the context-- unless you
 can show how reliability can be determined.
