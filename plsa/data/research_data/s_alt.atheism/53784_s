 its a survival trait.  there are only a fixed number of resources (people)
 for religions to inhabit.  the doctrines of intolerance and not using
 birth control are devices whereby the meme of the (capital-r) religion
 of christianity gains a larger share of the population than its memetic
 competitors.
