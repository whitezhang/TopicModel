 simple.  take out some physics books, and start looking for statements which
 say that there is no objective physics.  i doubt you will find any.  you might
 find statements that there is no objective length, or no objective location,
 but no objective _physics_?  (consider, for instance, that speed-of-light-in-
 vacuum is invariant.  this sounds an awful lot like an objective
 speed-of-light-in-vacuum.)
