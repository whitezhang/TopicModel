 	so, if you were housing a jew in your home in holand, 1942; and
 the ss troopers asks if you are housing a jew, is it objectively better to
 tell the truth, " i am holding a jew ", than a falsehood, " no i am not
 holding a jew"?
 
 	in this case, let us assume that if you lie, the ss trooper leaves,
 never to bother you. either way, nothing is ever done to you- no prison, 
 trouble, etc.
 
 	of course, if you tell the truth, then the jew will be executed.
 
 	is it better to tell the truth, or lie?
 	
 
 
 
 
 	[ in this case, i would consider not saying anything to be a lie.
 or, at the very least, it implies that falsehood is on the same level of 
 telling the truth. or, we can stipulate that the ss have methods to make you 
 say something: only they can not control whether or not you say "yes" or
 "no". only that you will say one or the other. ]
