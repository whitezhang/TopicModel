 are you serious?  two statements, one of which says that use of force
 in the given situation is moral, and the other of which says it is
 not moral "say effectively the same thing?"
 
 would you say this of any two statements, one saying "x is moral" and
 the other saying "x is immoral?"   how would you decided when two 
 statements "x is moral" "x is immoral" actually conflict, and when
 they "say effectively the same thing".

 they might lead you to do the same thing, but the difference is what
 motivates pacifism so they obviously don't lead pacifists to to the
 same thing.
