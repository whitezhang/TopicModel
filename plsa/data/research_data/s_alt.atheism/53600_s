 but it's still happening.  that's the entire point.  only last month, john
 major hailed it as a great victory that he had personally secured a sale of
 arms to saudi arabia.  the same month, we sold jet fighters to the same
 indonesian government that's busy killing the east timorese.
 
 it's all very well to say "oops, we made a boo-boo, better clean up the
 mistake", but the us and uk *keep* making the *same* mistake.  they do it so
 often that i can't believe it's not deliberate.  this suspicion is reinforced
 by the fact that the mistake is an extremely profitable one for a decrepit
 economy reliant on arms sales.

 no, i thought both were terrible.
