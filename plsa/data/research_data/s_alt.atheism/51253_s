 no it in the way it is usually used. in my view, you are saying here that
 driving a car requires faith that the car drives.
  
 for me it is a conclusion, and i have no more faith in it than i have in the
 premises and the argument used.

 no, that's a word game. the term god is used in a different way usually.
 when you use a different definition it is your thing, but until it is
 commonly accepted you would have to say the way i define god is ... and
 that does not exist, it is existence itself, so i say it does not exist.
  
 interestingly, there are those who say that "existence exists" is one of
 the indubitable statements possible.
  
 further, saying god is existence is either a waste of time, existence is
 already used and there is no need to replace it by god, or you are implying
 more with it, in which case your definition and your argument so far
 are incomplete, making it a fallacy.

 where does that follow? aren't observations based on the assumption
 that something exists?
  
 and wouldn't you say there is a level of definition that the assumption
 "god is" is meaningful. if not, i would reject that concept anyway.
  
 so, where is your evidence for that "god is" is meaningful at some level?
