 apparently not.
 
 in response to his claim that it "terrifies" gay people not to be able
 to "indoctrinate children to our lifestyle" (or words to that effect),
 i sent roger a very calm, carefully-written, detailed letter
 explaining simply why the bsa policy does, indeed terrify me.  i did
 not use inflammatory language and left myself extremely open for an
 answer.  thus far, i have not received an answer.  i can conclude only
 that roger considers his position either indefensible or simply not
 worth defending.

 in fact, that's exactly the point: people can control their behavior.
 because of that fact, there is no need for a blanket ban on
 homosexuals.

 you tell me.
