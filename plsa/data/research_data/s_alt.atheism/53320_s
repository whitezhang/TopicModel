 why? how? might makes right? how can they force their morality on me? why 
 can't i do what i want? who are they to decide? what if i disagree?

 good point, but it is being immoral in our opinion.  we don't let them choose,
 we make the decision that their actions are wrong for them.

 i admit to lean toward the idea of an innate moral sense, but have little basis
 for it as of yet.  how far can such a concept be extended?

 do you mean that we could say it would be wrong for us to do such a thing but 
 not him.  after all, he was behaving morally in his own eyes and doing what he
 chose.  on what basis do we condemn other societies besides, here's the buzz 
 words, on the idea that there are some actions wrong for all humans in all 
 societies?
 
   holding that morality is subjective does not mean

 why not? do we have to be objective suddenly?
