 "liberate" is the way an invader describes an invasion, including, if
 i'm not mistaken, the iraqi liberation of kuwait.  never invaded
 nicaragua?  only with more word games: can you say "send in the
 marines?"

 oh, good: word games.  if you let the aggressor pick the words,
 there's scarcely ever been a reprehensible military action.

 that's a convenient technique, much seen on alt.atheism: define those
 who disagree with you according to a straw-man extreme that matches
 virtually nobody.

 very noble and patriotic.  i'm sure the fine young americans who
 carpet-bombed iraqi infantry positions from over the horizon,
 destroyed iraq's sewer and water infrastructure from the safety of the
 sky or further, or who bulldozed other iraqi infantry into their
 trenches [or more importantly the commanders who ordered them to] were
 just thrilled to be risking death (if not risking it by much) in the
 defense of the liberty of ... well, wealthy kuwaitis.  can't have
 those oil-fields under a tyrant's heel if that tyrant is antagonistic
 to us interests...

 having pigeon-holed "peace-niks" (in this context, "people who
 disagree with me about the conduct of the gulf war") into
 "peace-at-all-cost-hitler-supporting-genocide-abetting-wimps", you can
 now express righteous indignation when "they" refuse to fit this mold
 and question the conduct of the war on legitimate terms.  how dare
 they!

 yes, hypocrisy indeed!  those violent peace-niks!  (care to list an
 example here?)

 wow: instant '80's nostalgia!  [of course, "peace-nik" itself is a
 '50's cold war derogatory term equating those who promote pacifism
 with godless pinko communists].  yes indeed, i felt my freedoms
 mightily threatened by iraq...
