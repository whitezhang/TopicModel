 i have read it.  conspicuous by its absence is any evidence or point.

 the onus of proof is on you, sunshine.  what makes you think that
 theist leaders believe what they say?  especially when they say
 one thing and do another, or say one thing closely followed by its
 opposite?  the practice is not restricted to theism, but it's there
 for anyone to see.  it's almost an epidemic in this country.
 
 just for instance, if it is harder for a camel to pass thru' the eye
 of a needle, why is the catholic church such a wealthy land-owner?  why
 are there churches to the square inch in my country?

 indeed i did.  as i recall, i asked for evidence.  what is the correlation

 of course, other people are always fanatics, never oneself.  your
 wish to slur all theists seems pretty fanatical to me.

 truth by blatant assertion.  i've seen as many bogus proofs of the 
 non-existence of gods as i have of their existence.

 i'd like to see this alleged evidence.

 i see.  you have no irrational beliefs.  but then, fanatics never do, do
 they?

 nope, it's not a fallacy.   it just doesn't go to the correlation you
 wish to see.

 excuse me - the holy books?

 a god is neither the easiest way to excuse anything, nor the only way.
