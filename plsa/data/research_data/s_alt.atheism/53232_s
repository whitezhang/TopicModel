 oh, your highness?   and exactly why "should" the quotation
 marks enclose "laws," not "must."

 perhaps the chimps that failed to evolve cooperative behaviour
 died out, and we are left with the ones that did evolve such
 behaviour, entirely by chance.
 
 are you going to proclaim a natural morality every time an
 organism evolves cooperative behaviour?
