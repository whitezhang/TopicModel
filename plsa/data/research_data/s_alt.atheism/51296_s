 no need to correct it, it stands as it is said.

 you miss the point entirely. things defined by contradictory language
 do not exist. though something existing might be meant, conclusions
 drawn from the description are wrong, unless there is the possibility
 to find the described, and draw conclusions from direct knowledge of
 the described then. another possibility is to drop the contradictory
 part, but that implies that one can trust the concept as presented
 and that one has not got to doubt the source of it as well.

 neither am i. but either things are directly sensed (which includes
 some form of modelling, by the way) or they are used in modelling.
 using something contradictive in modelling is not approved of.
 wonder why?
  
 we remain with the question if something contradictory can be sensed
 as contradictory. an important point is that either one manages to
 resolve the contradictions or one is forced not to use or to refer
 to the contradictory part in drawing conclusions, or one will fall
 in the garbage in garbage out trap.
