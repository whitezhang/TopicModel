 there are many indications that would have taken place had saddam
 been wanting or planning on going into saudi arabia.  there were
 none.  this has been openly stated by ex-pentagon analysts.  pull.

 actually, reports from other mid-east countries showed that hussein
 was ready to make concessions due to the sanctions.  we just didn't want
 him to - we wanted to crush him, as well as battle-test all these high
 tech toys we've built over the years.

 we're also hypocrites of the first magnitude.  obviously, we don't give
 a shit about freedom and democracy.  all we care about is our oil.  oh,
 and the excuse, now that the soviets are gone from the board, to keep
 a sizable military presence in the gulf region.  care to make bets about
 when all our troops will come home?
 
 basically, saddam was ok with us.  he was a killer, who tortured his
 own people, used gas on them, and other horrors - he was a brutal
 dictator, but he was our brutal dictator.  once he said "fuck you" to
 the us, he became the next hitler.  the same for noriega.  he was a
 bastard, but he was our bastard...until he changed his mind and went
 his own way.  then we had to get rid of him.
