 well, that's the question, isn't it?  the goals are probably not all that
 obvious.  we can set up a few goals, like happiness and liberty and
 the golden rule, etc.  but these goals aren't inherent.  they have to
 be defined before an objective system is possible.

 it is not too difficult, one you have goals in mind, and absolute
 knoweldge of everyone's intent, etc.

 omniscience is fine, as long as information is not given away.  isn't
 this the resolution of the free will problem?  an interactive omniscient
 being changes the situation.

 well, i was speaking about an objective system in general.  i didn't
 mention a specific goal, which would be necessary to determine the
 morality of an action.
