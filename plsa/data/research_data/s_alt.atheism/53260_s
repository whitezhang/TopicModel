 gregg, you haven't provided even a title of an article to support *your*

 you also have no reason to believe it *is* an anti-islamic slander job, apart
 from your own prejudices.

 why, yes.  what's a mere report in the times stating that bcci followed

 bad, therefore bcci *cannot* have been islamic.  anyone who says otherwise is
 obviously spreading slanderous propaganda.

 that would be a very intellectually stimulating debate.  doubtless that's how
 you spend your time in soc.culture.islam.
