 i'm afraid it's much worse than this! jesus said follow the ten
 commandments and the torah and the prophets. christians on the other
 hand are not only above the ten commandments and the torah and the
 prophets, i.e. they believe that they do not have to follow it, they
 don't even follow the subjective morality of jesus! so, we see that
 christians can't follow the "objective morality" of their own ten
 commandments, they can't follow the "subjective morality" of jesus when
 he said follow the ten commandments, yet they expect the rest of the
 world to do; what? is there any logic here? is there any morality here,
 objective or subjective? is christianity somebody's idea of a joke? who
 could be pulling the wool over the eyes of so many christians? who could
 be such a great deceiver?
