   if i'm wrong, god is free at any time to correct my mistake.  that
   he continues not to do so, while supposedly proclaiming his
   undying love for my eternal soul, speaks volumes.
 
   as for the trap, you are not in a position to tell me that i don't
   believe in god because i do not wish to.  unless you can know my
   motivations better than i do myself, you should believe me when i
   say that i earnestly searched for god for years and never found
   him.
