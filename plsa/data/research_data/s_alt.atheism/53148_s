 yup.  this is me.  i don't know why it crossposted.  i was accessing nn 
 from another system and that might have caused the glitch.
 
 i hold that an objective moral system exists regardless of my knowledge or 
 application of it.  i relate it to the idea that there is scientific truth 
 that is truth even though i may not know about it.  
 
 some morals i wouldn't want to change, and would not consider it progress 
 for
 a society to oneday say that rape and murder are ok.  some underlying 
 themes (morality, honesty, courage, respect, etc.) are used to base 
 actions.  i don't consider the idea that we should have been moral, should 
 be moral now, and should be so in the future a limitation, when it includes 
 such morality.  aberrances in a moral system, i.e. it is immoral to marry
 someone of the opposite sex, it is immoral to listen to rock and roll, etc. 
 seem to be different than the above lists, and if specific actions are given
 moral status i tend to question those morals.

 with new taxes and spending cuts we'll still have 310 billion dollar deficits.
