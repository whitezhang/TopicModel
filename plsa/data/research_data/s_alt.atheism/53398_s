 well i agree with you in the sense that they have no "moral" right to inflict
 these rules, but there is one thing i might add: at the very least, almost
 everybody wants to avoid pain, and if that means sacrificing some stuff for a
 herd morality, then so be it.

 right, and since they grew up and learned around us, they have some idea of our
 right and wrong, which i think must, in part, be incorporated.  very rarely do
 you see criminal behaviour for "philosophical reasons"
