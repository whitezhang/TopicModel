 i would guess that you either mean that you don't have a problem
 swearing aligance to a non-existant being or that you are being
 deliberatily dense (considering what group this is).  
 
 it doesn't come "quite naturally" to nonbelievers such as myself
 or even to followers of other religions.  would you say it would
 be quite natural if you were forced to swear by "allah" or
 "budda"?
