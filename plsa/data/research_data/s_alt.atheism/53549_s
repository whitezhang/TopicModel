 no, i spent a month just reading, too, mainly because i did not know
 much about the way atheists think. i even printed out the faqs and
 discussed it with a friend before i started posting.
 
 alt.atheism deals with religious issues (more appropriately, lack of
 religious beliefs), which are by their very nature very controversial.
 it makes sense to read what is being discussed and how just to make
 sure you are not repeating something others have said better.
