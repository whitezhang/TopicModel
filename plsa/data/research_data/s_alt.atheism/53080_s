 yes it would.  luckily these parameters are fixed by reality.  if i can
 predict with almost 100% accuracy that americans prefer to own their portions of
 the us than an infinitesmal portion of $1, in what sense are these values
 not objective?  i don't think i'm way off beam in saying that "something is
 better than nothing" is a rational and objective valuation. do you agree
 with me then that the assertion "no values are objective" is false?
