 only those you haven't actually read?  sorry, but the irony remains.

 so although you don't agree with the fatwa, and apparently don't think
 rushdie should be killed for his book, yet you think he is not due
 sympathy for being being under this threat.  furthermore you base this
 reaction solely on the fact that he wrote about a particular
 well-known story which -- if true -- might reflect poorly on the
 absolute truth of your religion.  yet, this opinion is formed without
 recourse to actually looking to see how the story is used in context,
 accepting at face value the widespread propaganda on just what this
 book contains and what the author's motivations are.  and then you
 come forward and recommend another book which touches on (presumably
 "plays with") religious/historical material because you find its
 overall presentation neutral!
