 benedikt,
 
 i can't recall anyone claiming that god -makes- anyone act a particlar
 way, i think that you're attempting to manufacture a contradiction.
 god is said to require certain behavior, but the only compulsion is
 the believer's sense of duty. a standard of conduct does exist, but we
 are free to ignore it or misunderstand it or distort it in whatever
 ways we find convenient, but our response to god's edicts can in no
 way be used to question god's existence. the behavior of believers is
 a completely separate question from that of god's existence; there is
 nothing contradictory here.
 
 to say that something defined contadictorily cannot exist, is really
 asking too much; you would have existence depend on grammar. all you
 can really say is that something is poorly defined, but that in itself
 is insufficient to decide anything (other than confusion of course).
 
 your point that there are better reasons for the phenomenon of belief
 than the object of belief may lead to a rat's nest of unnecessary
 complexity. i think i know what you're implying, but i'd like to see
 your version of this better alternative just the same.
