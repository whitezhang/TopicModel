 you know, it just occurred to me today that this whole christian thing
 can be blamed solely on mary.
 
 so, she's married to joseph.  she gets knocked up.  what do you think
 ol' joe will do if he finds she's been getting around?  so mary comes up
 with this ridiculous story about god making her pregnant.  actually, it
 can't be all that ridiculous, considering the number of people that
 believe it.  anyway, she never tells anyone the truth, and even tells
 poor little jesus that he's hot shit, the son of god.  everyone else
 tells him this too, since they've bought mary's story.  so, what does
 mary actually turn out to be?  an adultress and a liar, and the cause of
 mankind's greatest folly...
 
 just my recently-minted two cents.
