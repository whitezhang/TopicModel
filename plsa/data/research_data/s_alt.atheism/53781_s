 
 i saw a 3 hour show on pbs the other day about the history of the
 jews. appearently, the cursades(a religious war agianst the muslilams
 in 'the holy land') sparked the widespread persecution of muslilams 
 and jews in europe. among the supporters of the persiecution, were none 
 other than martin luther, and the vatican.
 
 later, hitler would use luthers writings to justify his own treatment
 of the jews.
 > genocide is caused by theism : evidence?
