 :pthe "corrupted over and over" theory is pretty weak.  comparison of the

 well corrupted the first time is good enough.  seeing that the bible was constructed
 400 years after jesus's death, in the text of merchants (ie-owe this and owe that) i wonder how anyone can take the literal word seriously.  obviously it was not intended for such nonsense, otherwise the authors of the bible would not need to plagerize (sp)
 off of the asians for most of the contents that can be interperated to make sense.
