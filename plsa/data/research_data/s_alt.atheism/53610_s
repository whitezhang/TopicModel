 jim - we essentially agree, except about the definition of "fact."
 the scientific definition of "fact" is not "the ultimate truth," but
 rather "a theory which is so supported by evidence and so predictive
 that it is pointless to test it anymore."
 
 so, we have the fact of evolution and we have theories of evolution
 (just as we have the fact of gravity and theories of gravity, and
 the fact of the atomic nature of matter and atomic theory).  the fact
 of evolution is that the current diversity of life arose through
 common descent:  this is so supported by the evidence that no one ever
 bothers to try to test it anymore.  theories of evolution include
 theories regarding the mechanism of common descent (natural selection
 vs. drift) or the actual "pathways" of evolution, or any number of
 other things.  these are constantly being tested, because the actual
 mechanisms, etc, behind the fact of common descent are still up for
 question.
 
 note that the fact of evolution is still a theory.  in other words, it
 could, theoretically, still be falsified and rejected.  but since it's
 so predictive, and so consistently supported by evidence, it seems
 pointless to explicitly try to falsify it anymore.

 here is where you fail to make an important distinction.  you have
 shoehorned the _facts_ of the _existence_ of gravity and atoms and
 evolution into one category with the _theories_ which have been
 proposed to explain the _mechanisms_.  the existence of these things
 is so predictive as to be considered fact.  the mechanisms, on the
 other hand, are still worth discussing.
