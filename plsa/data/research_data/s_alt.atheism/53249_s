 if a person gives a well-balanced reasoned argument, tammy, then all are
 happy to discuss it with him.  if he makes astounding claims, which are not
 backed up with any evidence then he must be expected to substantiate them.
 if the original author had said that everything was his own opinion and not
 supportable then people would have simply ignored him.  he did not.  he
 claimed many things and his logic was seriously flawed.  his argument was for
 christianity in an effort to try to convince atheists like myself to believe
 him and his message.  i for one will not take things as read.  if you told me
 that pink fluffy elephants did the dance of the sugar plum fairy on the dark
 side of jupiter then i would demand evidence!
