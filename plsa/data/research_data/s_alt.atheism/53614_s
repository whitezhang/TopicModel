 as per various threads on science and creationism, i've started dabbling into a
 book called christianity and the nature of science by jp moreland.  a question
 that i had come from one of his comments.  he stated that god is not 
 necessarily a religious term, but could be used as other scientific terms that
 give explanation for events or theories, without being a proven scientific 
 fact.  i think i got his point -- i can quote the section if i'm being vague. 
 the examples he gave were quarks and continental plates.  are there 
 explanations of science or parts of theories that are not measurable in and of
 themselves, or can everything be quantified, measured, tested, etc.?
