 to repeat what i had said in an earlier post:  evolution is
 a theory.  if you accept it as fact, then that is faith and
 not much different from religion.  if you accept it as the
 theory it is, then there is 0% religion involved and it 
 can be quite useful in the realm of science.
 
 simply put, evolution/creation when each is looked at
 properly -- theory/assertion not fact/fiction -- is a 
 specific example of exactly what separates soft athiesm 
 and science from religion.
