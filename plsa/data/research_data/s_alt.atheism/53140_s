 really>`?

 no, gravity is an inherent system.  you don't need any excess information
 other than observations to determine anything.  it is possible to objectively
 determine someone's guilt or innocence within an non-inherent system.
 i agree that morality is not necessarily inherent (unless you state that
 everything we do has an evolutionary basis), but this does not mean that
 it cannot be objective in theory.

 perhaps it can be objective, but not inherent.  anyway, as i noted before,
 the practices related to mating rituals, etc. among the animals are likely
 the only ones to be considered "immoral" under the previous "definitions"
 of the natural law.  therefore, some revisions are in order, since the
 class of activities surrounding mating seem to pose some general problems.

 it seens that you are objecting to the notion of an objective system
 because perhaps you think that it would imply inherence, which would
 necessitate some sort of grand design?

 i think i have.  it is a code of ethics which basically defines undesired
 behaviors, etc.  an immoral behavior could be unwanted, unproductive,
 or destructive, etc., depending on the goal of the system (that is,
 immoral to what end?).
