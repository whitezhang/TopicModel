 bruce hits the main point simply -- as russell turpin does in more detail
 in his response.  *all* sources are, in modern historiography, to be used
 critically, which is simply to say that any claims deriving from them are
 subject to *specific* examination in the light of motives and other human
 considerations (as well as the physical background).  the critical method
 applies both to the original document and to the uses made of it by others
 (most emphatically *including* the historical researchers themselves.)

 but given the critical principle, what evidence is there that we have
 anything at all from "firsthand" sources about jesus?  paul's letters are
 indeed firsthand evidence about paul and his interactions.  they are, as
 a result, the most historically solid books in the nt.  paul's claims and
 descriptions about his conflicts with jerusalem may not be "wie es eigent-
 lich gewesen" -- but they are most definitely the comments of a participant!
 in other words, we'd evaluate paul's statements more or less as we would
 the testimony of a witness in court.
 
 the gospels are another story altogether.  luke is most assuredly not a
 firsthand witness.  he *claims* to have gathered material that is closer
 to the actual events -- but this is a conventional claim in ancient books
 and luke in fact never names a witness or points to any one thing in his
 book(s) which derive from any source *we* can detect behind luke.  john
 has a concluding remark that it derives from the testimony of a beloved
 disciple (who is not named.)  we are not bound to accept this claim (for
 a long time, some scholars rejected it outright), but even if we do, it
 makes the fourth gospel as we have it *at best* secondhand.  neither mark
 nor matthew make any claims to be firsthand.  later (much later) christian
 tradition associates the first gosple with matthew and a possible aramaic
 proto-gospel, and associates mark with peter as having something like the
 same second-hand status of recounting peter's preaching of the gospel.
 
 such traditional claims run into difficulties if we try to evaluate the
 actual data before us.  luke and matthew both appear to use (differently!)
 an anonymous and not otherwise attested collection of _logoi_ (words and
 deeds) of jesus, as well as to be dependent on mark.  this makes their
 testimony at least thirdhand.
 
 all that said, historians do attempt to glean whatever they can from the
 nt sources, and they are overwhelmingly the obvious and best sources for
 anything about the earliest church.  they are also *extremely* important
 for the light they cast (however refracted through christian biases) on
 the sectarian world of judaism just before and around the time of the
 destruction of the 2nd temple.
 
 the problem of "the historical jesus" is tricky, however.  there is a
 cycle of fashion on this (and we are now near a major "high" in people
 thinking they *can* discern [with historico-critical plausibility] some-
 thing about jesus' life and opinions from the nt.  the difficulty here
 (which dominated thinking 50 years ago, and will probably return to favor
 in another generation :-)) was pointed out by bultmann, after schweitzer's
 treatment at the end of the previous high-point on the cycle -- simply
 because all our sources have passed through at least one layer of quite
 anonymous shaping within the early church, we have no easy and reliable
 way to distribute any part of the material between "real" history and the
 inventions of the church.  there are few "radical skeptics" who think we
 have nothing of history in the gospels [though such a position can be
 maintained], but neither have we any tools that can distinguish "shaping"
 of real historical material by its communal use as opposed to "invention."
