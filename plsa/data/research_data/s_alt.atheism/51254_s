 this (frayed) thread has turned into a patented alt.atheism 5-on-1
 ping-pong game, and i don't have any strong disagreement, so i'll try
 to stick to the one thing i don't quite follow about the argument:
 
 it seems to me that there is a contradiction in arguing that the bible
 was "enlightened for its times" (i.e. closer to what we would consider
 morally good based on our standards and past experience) on the one
 hand [i hope this summarizes this argument adequately], and on the
 other hand:

 that's possibly a good way to judge the use of the bible in teaching
 jewish morality today, but it hardly seems fair to claim that this
 highly-interpreted version is what was "enlightened for its times".
 to (attempt to) extend the analogy, this is like saying that the
 original scissor-makers were unusually advanced at paper-cutting for
 their times, even though they only ever cut cloth, and had never even
 heard of paper.
 
 i'm not arguing that the bible is "disgusting", though some of the
 history depicted in it is, by modern standards.  however, history is
 full of similar abuses, and i don't think the biblical accounts are
 worse than their contemporaries--or possibly ours.  on the other hand,
 i don't know of any reason to think the history described in the bible
 shows *less* abuse than their contemporaries, or ours.  that complex
 and benign moral traditions have evolved based on particular mythic
 interpretations of that history is interesting, but i still don't
 think it fair to take that long tradition of interpretation and use it
 to attack condemnation of the original history.
