 first of all, i have no phobia of objective reality.  i'm simply
 saying that the scientific model of the atom is probably not 
 what is really out there.  i'm not saying that there's no object
 that sources these properties we measure from atomic theory.
 
 take light as another example.  there are two theories: particle and
 wave.  each one fails to predict the behavior of light as some point.
 so which is it: particle or wave?  you tell me.  you're the sensible
 one.
