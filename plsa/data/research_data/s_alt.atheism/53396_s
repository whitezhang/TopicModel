 exactly.  although this may be a dissapointing answer, there has to be an
 interplay of the two.  personal ethos and societal morality.  a person's
 self-generated/learned set of beliefs are usually expressed on a purely
 mental/verbal level, and don't usually find expression in society except in an
 impure (not in the sense of bad :) ) state.  sometimes this has to be so.

 also, what if one feels oneself to be part of more than one society, in a very
 real sense?  to use the obvious example, there is a political society, and a
 racial society, and a gender society, and sometimes they do not always agree on
 every issue...

 yes.  perhaps with an infamous "do what you want so long as it doesn't hurt
 others?"  the problem with this is that it is merely saying what you can do: it
 is not a morality in that it doesn't propound any specifically preferred
 behaviours.

 i'll add a hearty "me two".  however, one could just as well say just because
 certain actions are moral does not make them legal: one still doesn't really
 get an impression of which one is truly "right".
