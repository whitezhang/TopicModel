 don't be so sure.  look what happened to japanese citizens in the us during
 world war ii.  if you're prepared to say "let's round these people up and
 stick them in a concentration camp without trial", it's only a short step to
 gassing them without trial.  after all, it seems that the nazis originally
 only intended to imprison the jews; the final solution was dreamt up partly
 because they couldn't afford to run the camps because of the devastation
 caused by goering's total war.  those who weren't gassed generally died of
 malnutrition or disease.
