 i would rather be at a higher risk of being killed than actually killed by
                               ^^^^                      ^^^^^^^^
 mistake.  though i do agree with the concept that the type d and e murderers
 are a massive waste of space and resources i don't agree with the concept:
 
 	killing is wrong
 	if you kill we will punish you
 	our punishment will be to kill you.
 
 seems to be lacking in consistency.
