 i replied to this query via e-mail, but i think there are some
 issues that are worth discussing in public.

 i would recommend you to take a look at
 
 1) your dictionary
 2) alt.atheism faq files
 
 to notice that atheism is _not_ a belief system, and what is common
 to all atheists is not a belief, but a _lack of belief in deities_.
 i cannot imagine how anyone could do research on atheism without
 paying careful attention to this issue.

 imho, this is a poor method to do any real survey, although i'm sure the
 replies might keep you amused for hours.

 no, i do _not_ know what you mean. if you are surveying our individual
 philosophies, fine, but that's not strictly atheism. atheism is not
 just another, godless version of the theistic explanations for life,
 the universe and everything. it is not a belief system, and it could
 hardly be called a philosophical system.
 
 once more: atheism is characterised by lack of belief in deities. 
 do not twist the meaning, or assume that we have some kind of
 philosophy we all agree on.
 
 some comments on your questions:

 i would also like to hear more about this. have we been able to 'convert'
 anyone?

 this question contains a contradiction in terms. _beliefs_ 
 cannot be acquired rationally - if they could, they would not be 
 beliefs! you also seem to have rather strange ideas of how people become
 atheists - those who are alienated from religion do not necessarily
 become atheists, they just think very little about religion. it seems
 it requires a considerable time of honest inquiry to find out that
 religions are actually intellectually dishonest virtual realities.
 
 those who have never had beliefs will certainly find this question
 quite odd - how can lack of belief be acquired? when did i acquire
 lack of belief in the easter bunny? (i did believe in santa, though ;-))

 this question does not make any sense, since atheism does not deal with
 these issues - it is not a worldview, or a philosophy, or a belief system.
 
 sigh, why haven't i seen a good, well-thought survey in the usenet
 for three years... and what is the point of doing surveys in the net,
 anyway? just to abstract some opinions?
