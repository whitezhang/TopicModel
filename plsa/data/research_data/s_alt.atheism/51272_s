 could you expand on your definition of knowing? it seems a bit monolithic
 here, but i'm not sure that you intend that. don't we need, for example, to
 distinguish between "knowing" 2 plus 2 equals 4 (or 2 apples plus 2 apples
 equals 4 apples), the french "knowing" that jerry lewis is an auteur, and
 what it means to say we "know" what socrates said?

 absurdities merit further exploration...gene
