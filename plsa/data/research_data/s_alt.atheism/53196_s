 that's not true.    i gave you two examples.   one was the rather
 pevasive anti-semitism in german christianity well before hitler
 arrived.   the other was the system of social ranks that were used
 in imperail germany and austria to distinguish jews from the rest 
 of the population.
 
 neither of these were very terrible in themselves, but both helped
 to set a psychology in which the gradual disenfranchisement of jews
 was made easier.
