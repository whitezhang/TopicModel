 leonard, i'll give you an example of this....
 
 my father recently bought a business, the business price was 150,000 pounds
 and my father approached the people in the community for help, he raised
 60,000 pounds in interest free loans from friends and relatives and 
 muslims he knew, 50,000 had cash and the rest he got a business loan, after
 paying off the muslim lenders many of them helped him with further loans
 to help him clear the bank debt and save him from further intrest, this
 is an example of a muslim community helping one another, why did they help
 because of their common identity as muslims. in turn my father has helped
 with people buying houses to minimise the amount of intrest they pay 
 and in some cases buy houses intrest free with the help of those more
 fortunate in the community. 
 
 the fact is leonard it does work without a fluffy bunny in sight!
 ithat is the beauty of islam.
