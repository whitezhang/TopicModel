   nice attempt chris . . . verrry close.
 
   you missed the conspiracy by 1 step. joseph knew who knocked her up.
 he couldn't let it be known that somebody else got ol' mary prego. that
 wouldn't do well for his popularity in the local circles. so what 
 happened is that she was feeling guilty, he was feeling embarrassed, and
 they decided to improve both of their images on what could have otherwise
 been the downfall for both. clever indeed. come to think of it . . . i
 have gained a new respect for the couple. maybe joseph and mary should
 receive all of the praise being paid to jesus.
