 computers are an excellent example...of evolution without "a" creator.
 we did not "create" computers.  we did not create the sand that goes
 into the silicon that goes into the integrated circuits that go into
 processor board.  we took these things and put them together in an
 interesting way. just like plants "create" oxygen using light through 
 photosynthesis.  it's a much bigger leap to talk about something that
 created "everything" from nothing.  i find it unfathomable to resort
 to believing in a creator when a much simpler alternative exists: we
 simply are incapable of understanding our beginnings -- if there even
 were beginnings at all.  and that's ok with me.  the present keeps me
 perfectly busy.
