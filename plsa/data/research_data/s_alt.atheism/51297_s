 "to put it as simply as possible: *i am not a muslim*.[...] i do not
  accept the charge of apostacy, because i have never in my adult life
  affirmed any belief, and what one has not affirmed one can not be
  said to have apostasized from.  the islam i know states clearly that
  'there can be no coercion in matters of religion'.  the many muslims
  i respect would be horrified by the idea that they belong to their
  faith *purely by virtue of birth*, and that a person who freely chose
  not to be a muslim could therefore be put to death."

  the swine.  no thunderbolt arrived to strike me down. [...] from that
  day to this i have thought of myself as a wholly seculat person."

 only a functional illiterate with absolutely no conception of the
 nature of the novel could think such a thing.  i'll accept it
 (reluctantly) from mobs in pakistan, but not from you.  what is
 presented in the fictional dream of a demented character cannot by the
 wildest stretch of the imagination be considered a reflection on the
 actual mohammad.  what's worse, the novel doesn't present the
 mahound/mohammed character in any worse light than secular histories
 of islam; in particular, there is no "lewd" misrepresentation of his
 life or that of his wives.

 don't hold back; he's considered an apostate and a blasphemer.
 however, it's not for his writing in _the satanic verses_, but for
 what people have accepted as a propagandistic version of what is
 contained in that book.  i have yet to find *one single muslim* who
 has convinced me that they have read the book.  some have initially
 claimed to have done so, but none has shown more knowledge of the book
 than a superficial newsweek story might impart, and all have made
 factual misstatements about events in the book.

 i'll keep an eye out for it.  i have a counter-proposal: i suggest
 that you see the viking hardcover by salman rushdie called _the
 satanic verses_.  perhaps then you'll understand.
