   i have always held that there should be no attempt to change a persons
 attitude or lifestyle as long as it makes them happy and does not tax
 anybody else. this seems to be ok for atheists. you don't get an atheist
 knocking on your door, stopping you in the airport, or handing out
 literature at a social event. theists seem to think that thier form of
 happy should work for others and try to make it so. 
 
   my sister is a 
 born again, and she was a real thorn in the side for my entire family
 for several years. she finally got the clue that she couldn't help.
 during that period she bought me "i was atheist, now i'm xtian" books
 for my birthday and xmas several times. our birthday cards would contain
 verses. it was a problem. i told my mom that i was going to send my
 sister an atheist piece of reading material. i got a "don't you dare".
 my mom wasn't religious. why did she insist that i not send it ??
 
    because our society has driven into us that religion is ok to
 preach, non-religion should be self contained. what a crock of shit.
 i finally told my sister that i didn't find her way of life attractive.
 i have seen exactly 0 effort from her on trying to convert me since then.
 
    i'm sick of religious types being pampered, looked out for, and worst
 of all . . . . respected more than atheists. there must be an end
 in sight.
