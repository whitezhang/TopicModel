 if i want to check the original new testament manuscripts for possible copying
 errors or mistranslations, which museum would i have to visit?  if i wanted
 to do this for _alice in wonderland_, i'd visit the british museum where i
 would find the original manuscript and be able to compare it to the printed
 edition that i own (i'd find many differences including a different title).
 likewise, if i had a cast of _archaeopteryx_, i could take it to berlin to
 compare it to the original fossil found at solenhofen.
