 i don't think i've changed my stance at all.  my original stance was that
 a painless execution was not a cruel one.  i didn't say what would be
 considered cruel, only that a painless death wasn't.  now, cruelty must
 involve some sort of suffering, i believe.  i don't think someone that gets
 shot in the head or electrocuted really suffers very much.  even a hanging
 probably produces one sharp instance of pain, but it's over so quickly...

 no.  well, again i stated that a painless death isn't cruel, but i don't
 think i stated that all painful executions *are* cruel.  i think that some
 are cruel, depending on the nature and duration of the pain.

 anything more than an instant, i guess.  any death by suffocation
 asphyxiation, or blood loss would be cruel, i think (this includes the
 gas chamber, and drawing and quartering).  i'd say that any pain that
 lasts, say, over twenty seconds or so would be too long (but this may
 be an arbitrary cutoff, i suppose).
