 as someone who works with protists, this does not strike me as being true.
 are you confusing this with:
 
 1) ciliates which have a macronucleus and a micronucleus, each containing
 dna (but in different amounts). the micronucleus is involved in mitosis 
 and meiosis, the macronucleus seems to be the main "control center" of
 the cell; or
 
 2) two groups of unrelated protists, euglenoids and dinoflagellates, which
 seem to have permanently condensed chromosomes.  how these groups read
 their dna is quite a puzzle, as most models of how genes work involve 
 the chromosomes being unwound.
