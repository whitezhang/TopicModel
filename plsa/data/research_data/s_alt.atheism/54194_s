 i disagree.  in the end, the *individual* is responsible for his/her own
 irrationality.  the individual's belief in some dogmatic religion is a 
 symptom of that irrationality.

 atheists and agnostics, i would imagine, but yes, that was my point.  an
 atheist would theoretically be just as ill-equipped to study the philosophy
 of religion as a christian, and yet there is a persistence of atheists
 among the ranks of philosophers.  therefore, the conflict between one's
 religious beliefs (or lack thereof) and the ability to be a philosopher
 must not be as great as you assert.  the fact that most philosophers may
 be non-religious was a secondary point.

 as opposed to science practiced by theists?  be careful here.
 
 science does have a built-in defence against faith and dogma:
 skepticism.  unfortunately, it is not foolproof.  there is that 
 wonderful little creature known as the "theory."  many of us believe in
 the theory of evolution.  we have no absolute proof that this 
 theory is true, so why do we believe it?  because it "makes more 
 sense than...?"  there is quite a bit of faith involved here.

 well, not all current beliefs are deficient, but basically i agree.

 ideally, this is true.  in reality, though, you have to acknowledge
 that scientists are human.  scientists have egos and biases.  some
 scientists assume a particular theory is true, refuse to admit the
 flaws in that theory because of ego problems or whatever, and proceed
 to spend their time and money trying to come up with absolute proof 
 for the theory.  remember cold fusion?

 not really.  i agree that we spent far too much money on the waco
 crisis ($7,500,000 i believe), especially considering the outcome.
 my point was that mass suicides in the u.s. are rare (jonestown was
 in guyana, incidentally, although we footed the bill for the clean-up),
 and the u.s. has far more important issues to address.  compare the
 number of u.s. citizens who have died in mass suicides with, say, the
 number of u.s. soldiers who died during one week of the vietnam war and
 you will see my point.
