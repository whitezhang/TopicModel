 fred rice answered this already in an early posting:
 "the problem with your argument is that you do not _know_ who is a _real_
 believer and who may be "faking it".  this is something known only by
 the person him/herself (and god).  your assumption that anyone who
 _claims_ to be a "believer" _is_ a "believer" is not necessarily true."
 
 in other words it seems that nobody could define who is a true and
 false muslim. we are back to square one, khomeini and hussein are 
 still innocent and can't be defined as evil or good islamic 
 worshippers.
 
 cheers,
