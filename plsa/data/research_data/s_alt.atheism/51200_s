 craig-
 
 i thought it was derived from a greek acronym.  my greek isn't up to much, but
 it goes something like this:
 
 	jesus christ, god => iesus christos, theos => ichthos
 
 which is the greek for "fish" (as in, eg "ichthysaurus").
 
 apologies for my dreadful greek!  perhaps someone will correct it.
 
 by the way, what does your sig mean?
