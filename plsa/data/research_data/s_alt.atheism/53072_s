 an universe it has created. by the way, can you tell me why it is less
 tyrannic to let one of one's own creatures do what it likes to others?
 by your definitions, your god has created satan with full knowledge what
 would happen - including every choice of satan.
  
 can you explain us what free will is, and how it goes along with omniscience?
 didn't your god know everything that would happen even before it created the
 world? why is it concerned about being a tyrant when noone would care if
 everything was fine for them? that the whole idea comes from the possibility
 to abuse power, something your god introduced according to your description?
  
  
 by the way, are you sure that you have read the faq? especially the part
 about preaching?
