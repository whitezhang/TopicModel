 tammy, is this all explicitly stated in the bible, or do you assume
 that you know that ezekiel indirectly mentioned? it could have been
 another metaphor, for instance ezekiel was mad at his landlord, so he
 talked about him when he wrote about the prince of tyre.
 
 sorry, but my interpretation is more mundane, ezekiel wrote about 
 the prince of tyre when we wrote about the prince of tyre.
  
 cheers,
