 the *basis*, eric, is people peering at the world and saying what
 they see.  i'm talking about uninterpreted facts - observations.  _people_
 do those.  agreement on some observations is a prerequisite for a theory
 that is more than personal.

 you're not comparing apples with apples.  if we all look at the same meter,
 we'll agree.  if we're all in the same situation, that's when we'll
 agree on fundamental values, if at all.  people who say that nobody agrees on
 values to the same extent that they agree on trivial observations seem
 to be unaware of the extent of agreement on either.

 see above.  we sometimes can.  there is also the matter of inertia
 against experimentation.  most, if not all, moral hypotheses are necessarily
 tested by way of thought experiment.  few people will attempt genocide
 or experience a lifetime in jail to find out if it's really as bad as 
 all that.

 #i don't see that it's any evidence at all.
 #as i point out above, i'm really not interested very much in

 firstly, if everyone else said the dial was 1.5 and i saw 3, i'd check
 my lens prescription.  secondly, your observation that people
 disagree shows nothing - people may be looking at different things,
 by virtue of being in different situations.  if i look at an elephant, i'll 
 see an elephant.  that doesn't imply that you will see an elephant if you 
 look at an iguana.    thirdly, i question your assumption that when
 people disagree about how to achieve fundamental or secondary goals, that 
 they therefore do not have the same fundamental goals (that seems to be the 
 disagreement you refer to).
