 andrew,
 
 the myth to which i refer is the convoluted counterfeit athiests have
 created to make religion appear absurd. rather than approach religion
 (including christainity) in a rational manner and debating its claims
 -as the are stated-, atheists concoct outrageous parodies and then
 hold the religious accountable for beliefs they don't have. what is
 more accurately oxymoric is the a term like, reasonable atheist.

 here's a good example of of what i said above. read the post again, i
 said, "acoording to ...", which means i am referring to christian
 doctrine (as i understand it), if i am speaking for myself you'll know
 it. my purpose in posting was to present a basic overview of christain
 doctrines since it seemed germane.

 : 2) there are people who have truly never heard of the bible.

 1) here again you miss the point. the bible itself is not the point,
 it's what it contains. it makes no difference who accpets the bible or
 even who's unaware of its existence, christians hold that it applies
 universally because mankind shares the same nature and the same fate
 and the same innate knowledge of god.
 
 2) see above
 
 3) if you read my post with same care as read the faq, we wouldn't be
 having this conversation.

 as i said, the evidence is there, you just don't accept it, here at
 least we agree.

 : no, human reason hasn't always come back to the existance of

 : in other words, it doesn't generally come back to the xtian

 yes, human reason does always come back to the existence of god, we're
 having this discussion are we not?

 well this is interesting, truth is to be determined by it politically
 correct content. granted it's extremely unhip to be a wasp male, and
 anything european is contemptable, but i thought this kind of
 dialogue, the purpose of a.a, was to get at the truth of things. but
 then i remember the oxymoron, reasonalble atheist, and i understand.
