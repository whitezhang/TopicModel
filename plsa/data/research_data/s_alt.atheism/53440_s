 i'm not sure my new nom d'net is exactly appropriate, but it comes
 very close. considering what i have to wade through before i make one
 of my insightful, dead-on-the-money repsonses, i have to agree that
 something's getting stirred up. i would like to believe my
 characterization of what i respond to would be kinder though, but if
 you insist ...
 
 i am also surprised to find that i have offended anyone, but in some
 cases it's unavoidable if i am to say anything at all. for those to
 whom fairness is important, check out my contributions, haven't i been
 most generous and patient, a veritable paragon of gentility?
 
 oh, btw, i don't mind being paired with bobby; i admire his tenacity.
 how many of you would do as well in this hostile environment - you
 think -i'm- offensive ?! read your own posts ...
 
 love and kisses,
 
 bill
 
 p.s.
 
 my name is conner, not connor. no point in humiliating the innocents.
