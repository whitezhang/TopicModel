 when someone says:
 
 	"so after 1000 years of sightseeing and roaming around its 
 	ok to come back, kill palastinians, and get their land back, 
 	right?"
 
 yes, that's casual antisemitism.    i can think of plenty of ways
 to criticize israeli policy without insulting jews or jewish history.
 
 can't you?
