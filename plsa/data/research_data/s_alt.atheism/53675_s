 i would guess that it probably has something to do with the ease of which
 ideas and thoughts are communicated on a college campus.  in the real world
 (tm) it's easier for theists (well, people in general really) to lock
 themselves into a little bubble where they only see and talk to those
 people who are of the same opinion as they are.  in college you are
 constantly surrounded by and have to interact with people who have
 different ideas about life, the universe, and everything.  it is much much
 harder to build a bubble around yourself to keep everyone else's ideas from
 reaching you.
 
 so, in a world where theists are forced to contend with and listen to
 atheists and theists of other religions some are bound to have a change in
 their beliefs over four years.  there is nowhere to run.... :-)
