 that's your claim; now back it up.  i consider your argument as useful
 as the following:  belief is strongly correlated with fanaticism.  therefore
 belief is *a* factor in fanaticism.  true, and utterly useless.  (note, this
 is *any* belief, not belief in gods)

 if you believe that, you're incredibly naive.

 #that's a straw man. and as usually in discussions with you one has to

 #there is a correlation, and it comes from innate features of theism.
 
 no, some of it comes from features which *some* theism has in common
 with *some* fanaticism.    your last statement simply isn't implied by
 what you say before, because you're trying to sneak in "innate features
 of [all] theism".  the word you're groping for is "some".
 
 #gullibility, by the way, is one of them.
 
 no shit, sherlock.  so why not talk about gullibility instead of theism,
 since it seems a whole lot more relevant to the case you have, as opposed
 to the case you are trying to make?
 
 #and to say that i am going to forbid religion is another of your straw
 #men. interesting that you have nothing better to offer.
 
 i said it reads like a warm up to that.  that's because it's an irrational
 and bogus tirade, and has no other use than creating a nice them/us 
 split in the minds of excitable people such as are to be found on either
 side of church walls.

 o.k., it's oval.  it's still begging the question, however.  and though
 that certainly is allowed, it's not rational.  and you claiming to be
 rational and all.
 
 at the risk of repeating myself, and hearing "we had that before" [we
 didn't hear a _refutation_ before, so we're back.   deal with it] :
 you can't use reason to demonstrate that reason is useful.  someone
 who thinks reason is crap won't buy it, you see.

 #i've been speaking of religious systems with contradictory definitions

 # 
 #an axiomatic datum lends itself to rational analysis, what you say here

 #
 #further, one can test the consistency and so on of a set of axioms.
 # 
 #what is it you are trying to say?
 
 that at some point, people always wind up saying "this datum is reliable" 
 for no particular reason at all.  example: "i am not dreaming".

 imo, any belief about such gods is necessarily irrational.  that does
 not mean that people who hold them are in principle opposed to the exercise of
 intelligence.  some atheists are also scientists, for example.

 peculiar definition of interesting, but sure.  now show that a belief
 in gods entails the further contents of which you speak.   why aren't my 
 catholic neighbours out killing the protestants, for example?   maybe they 
 don't believe in it.  maybe it's the conjunction of "b asserts b" and
 "jail/kill dissenters" that is important, and the belief in gods is
 entirely irrelevant.  it certainly seems so to me, but then i have no
 axe to grind here.
