 read a history book, fred. and tell me why so many religions command to
 commit genocide when it has got nothing to do with religion. or why so many
 religions say that not living up to the standards of the religion is worse
 than dieing? coincidence, i assume. or ist part of the absolute morality
 you describe so often?
  
 theism is strongly correlated with irrational belief in absolutes. irrational
 belief in absolutes is strongly correlated with fanatism.
