   i answer from the position that we would indeed place these people
   in prison for life.
 
   that depends not only on their predisposition towards murder, but
   also in their success rate at escape and therefore their ability
   to commit the same crimes again.
 
   in other words, if lifetime imprisonment doesn't work, perhaps
   it's not because we're not executing these people, but because
   we're not being careful enough about how we lock them up.
