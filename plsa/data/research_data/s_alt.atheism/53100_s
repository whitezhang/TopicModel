 not only are they not objective, but they don't even stay constant
 over time.   a young farmer and an old farmer on the verge of 
 retirement have quite different ideas about the relative values of 
 a piece of land and a dollar bill.
 
 similarly, a person viewing an anonymous piece of land, and a 
 person viewing a piece of land that his family has lived on for
 generations.
 
 these values are essentially subjective, and that's why we have
 markets: to allow people to match their valuations of land and
 dollar bills.
