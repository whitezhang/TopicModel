 any suggestions as to what a better solution might be?  i realize the
 off-hand nature of the numbers i used.  and i can't answer as to what
 an acceptable loss rate is.  however,  as i said in another post,  i
 despise the idea of supporting criminals for life.  it's the economics
 of the situation that concern me most.  the money spent feeding, clothing,
 housing and taking care of people who have demonstrated that they are
 unfit to live in society could go to a number of places,  all of which
 i, and probably others,  would consider far more worthwhile and which
 would enrish the lives of all americans.  give people jobs,  give the
 homeless shelter.  any number of things.
