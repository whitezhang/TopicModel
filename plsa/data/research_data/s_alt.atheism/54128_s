 	the "r us" is not trademarked, but the "backwards r us" is, i

   speaking of proofs of god, the funniest one i have ever seen was in a
   term paper handed in by a freshman.  she wrote, "god must exist, because
   he wouldn't be so mean as to make me believe he exists if he really
   doesn't!"  is this argument really so much worse than the ontological
   proofs of the existence of god provided by anselm and descartes, among
   others?
