 the flat-earthers state that "the earth is flat" is a fact. i don't accept
 this, i think it's an unproven opinion, and i think the round-earthers are
 right because they have better evidence than the flat-earthers do.
 
 although i can't prove that a god doesn't exist, the arguments used to
 support a god's existence are weak and often self-contradictory, and i'm not
 going to believe in a god unless someone comes over to me and gives me a
 reason to believe in a god that i absolutely can't ignore.
 
 a while ago, i read an interesting book by a fellow called von daenicken,
 in which he proved some of the wildest things, and on the last page, he
 wrote something like "can you prove it isn't so?" i certainly can't, but
 i'm not going to believe him, because he based his "proof" on some really
 questionable stuff, such as old myths (he called it "circumstancial
 evidence" :] ).
 
 so far, atheism hasn't made me kill anyone, and i'm regarded as quite an
 agreeable fellow, really. :)
