 riddle me this.  if a god(s) exist why on earth should we grovel?  why on earth
 should we give a damm at all?  what evidence do you have that if such a
 creature(s) exist it deserves anything beyond mild admiration or sheer
 hatred for what it/they have done in the past (whichever god(s) you care to
 pick).  that is assuming any records of their actions are correct.
 
 religon offers a bliss bubble of self contained reality which is seperate
 from the physical world.  any belief system can leave you in such a state
 and so can drugs.  god(s) are not a requirement.  only if you remove such
 useless tappestry can you build a set of morals to build a society upon.
 it is that or keep on exterminating those who don't believe (or converting
 them).
