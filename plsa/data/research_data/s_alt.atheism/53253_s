 you were doing fine until that last sentence.  i believe this too,
 but please prove it.

 impossible. one observes the simple facts, the ones that are likely to
 turn up again.  judgement call.  you can't observe everything, and you
 can't test every hypothesis.  therefore you select.  that's a bunch
 of subjective people judging the importance of obs. and hypotheses -
 can they do this reliably?

 "judged" to be real or noise?  how do i do this?  do you do it the same
 way as i do?  how do we know this?  are we assuming an objective reality
 or something?  gee, maybe we are, and judgement is necessary to find out
 what it is.

 #strawman. you're mixing relativism in value for relativism in observation.
 
 relativism in value => if we all pick different observations to study, it
                        doesn't matter.  we don't know which obs. are
                        important.
 
 relativism in value => if we all pick doctored observations to study, it
                        doesn't matter.  we don't know which obs. are
                        important.
 
 relativism in value => we all pick different systems to examine phenomena, it
                        doesn't matter.  we don't know which system works
                        well.  tarot cards are science too.
 
 no mix-up.  i still don't like the conclusions, which is why i question
 the premise that subjective value judgements can never be assumed to be 
 reliable and therefore correct.

 i've been looking for the separation of church and state in ireland since
 i was 14, and haven't gotten anywhere.  so what?
