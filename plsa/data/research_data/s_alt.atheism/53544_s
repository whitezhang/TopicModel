 i think it may also be worthwhile pointing out that if we
 take the appellation `rabbi' seriously then jesus had a full
 grasp of contemporary `scripture'
 
 mat21:42 jesus saith unto them, did ye never read in the scriptures...
 
 mat22:29 jesus answered and said unto them, ye do err, not knowing
 mat22:29 the scriptures, nor the power of god.
 
 following from this, he would have been in a wonderful
 position to fulfil prophesies, and the nt says as much:
 
 mat26:54 but how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled,
 mat26:54 that thus it must be?
 
 mat26:56 but all this was done, that the scriptures of the
 mat26:56 prophets might be fulfilled. then all the disciples
 mat26:56 forsook him, and fled.
 
 if the books comprising the referred-to `scripture' had not
 been accessible then it probably would be a different
 matter.
