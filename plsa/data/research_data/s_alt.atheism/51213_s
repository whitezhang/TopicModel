 bobby, there's a question here that i just have to ask. if all
 of your posts aren't some sort of extended, elaborate hoax, why
 are you trying so hard to convince the entire civilised world
 that you're feeble minded? you have a talent for saying the most
 absurd things. here's a little sign for you, print it, cut it out
 and put it on top of your computer/terminal.
 
               engage brain prior to operating keyboard
 
 
 (having said all that, i must admit we all get a laugh from
 your stuff.)
