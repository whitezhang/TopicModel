 agreed. but your original posting seemed to me to be just another 
 heisenbergian misunderstanding of what chemists do - heisenberg
 said biologists are treating atoms just like they were solid balls.
 this is what some chemists used to do, too, but this is not how
 chemistry is taught today.

 your original posting shows that you seem to think chemists still think
 this way. it is true that basic chemistry is still taught in terms of
 electron pairs and valences, but this is not what _chemists_ are taught, 
 and this is not how they should think. 
 
 i suggest you take a look at p.w. atkins's classic text _physical chemistry_
 (4th ed., oxford university press 1990) to see how chemistry is taught today.
 
 however, i still agree with your point - concepts must be allowed to
 operate at a pragmatic level. in chemistry, this usually means we must use
 different models for different situations. it is unfair to say that
 chemists simply ignore effects they can't deal with - on the contrary,
 they are quite concerned with the limitations of their models. 
  
 : i remember thinking, the first time i saw the shapes of the electron

 if someone insists that electron is _confined_ inside these shapes,
 it would indeed constitute a joke. the shapes are still important, 
 even though they are only visual representations of the radial and
 angular functions. the surfaces are arbitrary, and not really important - 
 what is more important (in chemistry) are the signs of the wavefunctions.
 
 is there something wrong with the representations?
