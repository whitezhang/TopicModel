 not necessarily, but i believe that some people really are terrorists,
 and some people really are people of peace.  i prefer the peaceful folk
 to the terrorists and even though i don't claim to have lock on which is which, 
 i have hope in our ability to tell them apart, and it would be insane not to 
 try.
