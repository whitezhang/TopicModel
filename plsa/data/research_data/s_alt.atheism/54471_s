 you have demanded harsh punishments of several crimes. repeating
 offenders have slipped in only as justification of harsh punishment at
 all. typically religious doublespeak. whenever you have contradictory
 statements you choose the possibility that suits your current argument.
  
 it is disgusting that someone with ideas that would make theodore kkkaldis
 feel cozy can go along under the protection of religion.
  
 gregg, tell us, would you kill idolaters?
