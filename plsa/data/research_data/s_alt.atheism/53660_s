 if the first rule of humor is never having to say you're sorry then the 
 second rule must be never having to explain yourself.  few things are 
 worse that a joke explained.  in spite of this, and because of requests
 for me to post my list o' nicknames, i must admit that no such list
 exists.  it was simply a plot device, along with me being the keeper
 o' the list, to make the obvious play on the last name of fuller and to
 advance the idea that such a list should be made.
 
 i assumed that the ol' timers would recognize it for what it is.  
 nevertheless, how about a list o' nicknames for alt.atheism posters?
 if you think of a good one, just post it and see if others like it.
 we could start with those posters who annoy us the most, like bobby or
 bill.
