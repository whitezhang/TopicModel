 this is an interesting notion -- and one i'm scared of. in my
 case i'm a finnish citizen, i live in usa, and i have to conform
 to the us laws. however, the finnish government is not actively
 checking out what i'm doing in this country, in other words checking
 out if i conform to the finnish laws.
 
 however, islamic law seems to be a 'curse' that is following you
 everywhere in the world. shades of 1984, eh?
