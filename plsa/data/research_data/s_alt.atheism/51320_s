 i think the problem here is that i pretty much ignored the part
 about the jews sightseeing for 2000 years, thinking instead that
 the important part of what the original poster said was the bit
 about killing palestinians.  in retrospect, i can see how the
 sightseeing thing would be offensive to many.  i originally saw
 it just as poetic license, but it's understandable that others
 might see it differently.  i still think that ken came on a bit
 strong though.  i also think that your advice to masud khan:
 
   #before you argue with someone like mr arromdee, it's a good idea to
   #do a little homework, or at least think.
 
 was unnecessary.

 throughout all your articles in this thread there is the tacit
 assumption that the original poster was exhibiting casual
 anti-semitism.  if i agreed with that, then maybe your speech
 on why this is bad might have been relevant.  but i think you're
 reading a lot into one flip sentence.  while probably not
 true in this case, too often the charge of anti-semitism gets
 thrown around in order to stifle legitimate criticism of the
 state of israel.
 
 anyway, i'd rather be somewhere else, so i'm outta this thread.
