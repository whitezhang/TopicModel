     we are talking about origins, not merely science.   science cannot
     explain origins.  for a person to exclude anything but science from
     the issue of origins is to say that there is no higher truth
     than science.  this is a false premise.  by the way, i enjoy science.
     it is truly a wonder observing god's creation.  macroevolution is
     a mixture of 15 percent science and 85 percent religion [guaranteed
     within three percent error :) ]
