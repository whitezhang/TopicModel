 "correct" overstates the case.  the whole point of the discussions
 has been that it is *reasonable* to assume that there was some brief
 reference to jesus that has been doctored.  by consensus, this is
 the *most* reasonable of the proposed solutions -- but not so much
 so as to rule out complete fabrication.
