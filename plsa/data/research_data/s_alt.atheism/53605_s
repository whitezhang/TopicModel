 why shouldn't i mind? it sounds as if you are proceeding with just
 the sort of obfuscation you have accused me of. i always preceeded
 my statements with "it is my understanding that..." now, i have made
 my claim clear with regard to the issue of both the twelve imams and 
 with khomeini's supposed claim of infalibility. after hearing your
 seemingly more knowledgable claim that khomeini made no such claim
 regarding himself, i have withdrawn that portion of my statement
 regarding that claim. however, i have received _no_ such response
 regarding the infallibility of the twelve imams. there is nothing
 obfuscationist about my claims, which are always made clearly.
  
 i have received no such clear response regarding the twelve imams
 but rather abstruse references to unusual metaphysical natures and 
 other such opaque "concepts" often used by people to camoflage the 
 baselessness of their positions, particularly in matters of theology.
 these are just the sorts of "concepts" used by christian churches
 the perverting of their religion.
