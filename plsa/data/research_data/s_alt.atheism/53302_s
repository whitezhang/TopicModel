 ad hominem, sarcastic innuendo?  absolutely.  forgotten?  hardly.
 bored?  not really.   i try not to confuse "life on a.a." with life.
 
 i just can't overcome the urge to tease/taunt folks who bound faq-less
 onto a.a. with such a chip on their shoulder.  to listen to you,
 one might think we belonged to some church!
 
 i appreciate the patience of others who questioned your posting
 on a line-by-line content basis, though it's hard to know what
 impact that might have had, as compared to, say, "shovelling".

 i think i only lamented that, whatever the initial satisfactions,
 past a certain point circular abuse-heaping was just that.
