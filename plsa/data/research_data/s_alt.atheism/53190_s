 gregg, i'm really sorry if having it pointed out that in practice
 things aren't quite the wonderful utopia you folks seem to claim
 them to be upsets you, but exactly who is being childish here is 
 open to question.
 
 bbci was an example of an islamically owned and operated bank -
 what will someone bet me they weren't "real" islamic owners and
 operators? - and yet it actually turned out to be a long-running
 and quite ruthless operation to steal money from small and often
 quite naive depositors.
 
 and why did these naive depositors put their life savings into
 bcci rather than the nasty interest-motivated western bank down
 the street?   could it be that they believed an islamically owned 
 and operated bank couldn't possibly cheat them? 
 
 so please don't try to con us into thinking that it will all 
 work out right next time.
 
 jon.
