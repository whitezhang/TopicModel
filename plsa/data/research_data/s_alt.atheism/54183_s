 perhaps you have a different understanding of what "physics" is.  if we
 can't measure anything objectively, then the answers we get from physics
 aren't objective either.  that's what i mean when i say there's no objective
 physics.
 
 sure, we can all agree that (say) f = gmm/r^2, but that's maths.  it's only
 physics when you relate it to the real world, and if we can't do that
 objectively, we're stuck.  (of course, this displays my blatant bias towards
 applied science; but even theoretical physics gets applied to models of real
 world situations, based on real world observations.)

 it's an axiom that it's invariant.  but if the two of us measure it, we'll
 get different answers.  yes, we call that experimental error, but it's not
 really "error" in the conventional sense; in fact, if you don't get any,
 that's an error :-)
 
 you could argue that the value of c is "objective, to within +/- <some
 value>".  but i'd call that a rather odd usage of the word "objective", and
 it opens the way for statements like "murder is objectively wrong for all
 people, to within 1% of the total population."
