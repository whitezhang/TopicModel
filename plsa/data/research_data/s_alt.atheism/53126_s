 you're closer than you might imagine.   i certainly despised living
 under the soviet regime when it purported to organize society according
 to what they fondly imagined to be the "objective" conclusions of
 marxist dialectic.
 
 but i don't hate physics so long as some clown doesn't start trying
 to control my life on the assumption that we are all interchangeable
 atoms, rather than individual human beings.
