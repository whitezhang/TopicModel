 well, yes.  this is the real mystery of the matter, and why i am rather
 dubious of a lot of the source theories.
 
 there are a number of places where the masoretic text (mt) of the ot is
 obscure and presumably corrupted.  these are reproduced exactly from copy to
 copy.  the dss tend to reflect the same "errors".  this would appear to tell
 us that, at least from some point, people began to copy the texts very
 exactingly and mechanically.  the problem is, we don't know what they did
 before that.  but it seems as though accurate transmission begins at the
 point at which the texts are perceived as texts.  they may be added to (and
 in some situations, such as the end of mark, material is lost), but for the
 most part there are no substantial changes to the existing text.
 
 you're basically trying to make a mountain out of a molehill.  some people
 like to use the game of "telephone" as a metaphor for the transmission of
 the texts.  this clearly wrong.  the texts are transmitted accurately.
