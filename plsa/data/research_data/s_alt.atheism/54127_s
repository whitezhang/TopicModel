 the "r us" thing is trademarked.  i don't know if charles
 lazarus is dead or alive, but i'd be careful, because with
 a name like lazarus, he might rise again just to start a

 (i knew an architect once who, i swear, was employed to design
 the signs for the toys r us and kids r us stores.  the signs.
 the things they stick over the store or up on a big pole so they
 can be seen from the highway.  what a job.  all those hours in
 school studying to be an architect so you can tell them to move
 the pole ten feet closer to the highway.)
