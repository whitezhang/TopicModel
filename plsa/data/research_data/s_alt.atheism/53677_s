 ah! excellent. so why doesn't she appear to me? i'm a little weak in the
 blind faith department. (besides, she doesn't even really need to appear:
 how about, oh say, a little tip - something like "put your all on #3 in the
 7:30 at the dog races" ... perhaps in a dream or vision.)

 i'm afraid i don't know arabic; i have only read translations. i wouldn't
 know it if it were well-written. (consistent, though, is one thing the quran
 is not.)  and have *you* read it in arabic?  besides, some of my best
 writing has been done under the influence of, shall we say, consciousness
 altering substances.

 yes, so? how do we know they *weren't* very good? (again, assuming that the
 quran is beautfully written.)

 ok, i retract this point. (although i might still say that once he knew, he
 should have done something about it.)

 i haven't interviewed all muslims about this; i would really like it if this
 were false. but i can't take it on your say-so - what are your sources?

 what other basis do we have to judge a system? especially when we can't get
 a consistent picture of what islam "really" is. do i believe khomeini? do i
 go by the imam of the mosque in mecca? or perhaps the guy in new jersey? or
 perhaps you say i should go only by the quran. ok, whose translation? and
 what about things like "and wherever you find idolators, kill them"?
