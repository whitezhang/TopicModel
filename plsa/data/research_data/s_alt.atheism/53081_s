   if the emphasis is on the "in general", then of course you're
   correct, since you haven't really said anything.  if we restrict
   our observations to practiced religions, there are lots of
   examples of god mandated genocide.  just ask the canaanites.  the
   point is that if you believe in a god, and if you believe he has
   ordered you to eliminate an entire race, you will likely make the
   attempt.  after all, if it was ok in the past, it could surely be
   ok in the present.
