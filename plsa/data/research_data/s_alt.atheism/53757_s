 it is all written in _the_wholly_babble:_the_users_guide_to_invisible_
 _pink_unicorns_.
 
 to be granted faith in invisible pink unicorns, you must read the babble,
 and obey what is written in it.
 
 to obey what is written in the babble, you must believe that doing so is
 the way to be granted faith in invisible pink unicorns.
 
 to believe that obeying what is written in the babble leads to believing
 in invisible pink unicorns, you must, essentially, believe in invisible
 pink unicorns.
 
 this bit of circular reasoning begs the question:
 what makes obeying different from believing?
