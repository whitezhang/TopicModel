 okay all humans are direct descendents of of a bunch of hopeful
 monsters. the human race didn't evolve from one set parents, but from
 thousands. do you really base your atheist on -this-?
 
 : considering that something like 4 out of 5 humans on this planet don't know instinctively that the christian god exist, the claim of instinctive knowledge doesn't look like it hold much water.  or are you saying that the 4 billion non-christians in the world must fight this instinctive urge to acknowledge god and jc.
 
 did i say that people were christians by nature or did i say that
 christians hold that everyone knows of the god the christians worship.
 i would have thought the distinction obvious, sorry. read my post
 again and see what i -really- said; from what you've written, i think
 you are just being agumentative. also your word-wrap is screwed up or
 you need to shift to 80 columns text ...
