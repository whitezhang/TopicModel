 on re-reading this, i decided there was something else i'd like
 to add to my earlier comments...
 
 please forgive me if i get any attributions wrong here...
 
 also, this isn't really appropriate to talk.origins, but i hope
 you all will excuse me just this once, as they say...

 it seems to me that you are mis-using physical intuition here.  my point is
 that you are talking about global conditions influencing local phenomena
 inappropriately.  remember that there is no such thing as a "global" frame
 of reference for time.  our minds like to pretend that there is, and we 
 imagine things like the calendar on alpha centaury being approx. 4 years off 
 from ours on earth.
 this is simply wrong.  there is no global "time" which can be applied to
 events on alpha centaury concurrently with events on earth.  this is what
 special relativity has taught us.  if i am travelling past the earth at
 a high rate of speed toward a.c. i can even have a different view of the 
 _order_ of the occurance of events on a.c. versus earth.  thus, the answer to 
 the question, "what's happening on alpha centaury now?" is not well-defined, if
 asked on earth, until you specify all the relevant parameters such as relative
 velocities and the like; and it will have different answers for different 
 values of these parameters.
 now, in the vicinity of a black hole, the curvature of spacetime becomes 
 important enough that this lack of a global frame of reference becomes 
 very important.  in particular, the frame used by a distant observer is quite 
 different from the frame appropriate to the falling object.  our minds just 
 don't seem able to easily deal with the idea that time itself could be 
 behaving differently in these two locations, but the equations of relativity 
 say that it does.  we would _like_ to say "the falling object is hovering
 above the horizon, now", for an object whose frame has rotated wholly "away"
 from ours.  in a very real sense, once the object has fallen into the hole
 its gone forever from our ken.  unless you volunteer to jump in after it,
 that is... :-)
