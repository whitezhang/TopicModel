 if there is truly no alternative, then you have no basis whatsoever
 for your claim.  the usual line here, which you call "a prejudgment of
 atheism", and dispute, is that reason is all we have.  here you admit
 that you have no alternative, no possible basis for the claim that
 there is anything other than reason or that reason is inapplicable in
 religious knowledge, except possibly that reason conflicts with
 "religious knowledge".
 
 this sounds very much like "i can't provide a rational defense for my
 belief, but prefer to discard rationality rather than accept that it
 may be false".  i hope it makes you happy, but your repeated and
 unfounded assertions to this effect don't advance your cause.
