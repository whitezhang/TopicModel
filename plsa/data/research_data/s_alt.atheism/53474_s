 well, as i remember jacoby's "mythmaker" talks about this to cite
 one source -- but i'm not sure if all christians have read this book.
 in addition my social experiences is from being raised and educated
 as a lutheran, having a lot of christian friends, and i even
 have played in two christian rock bands!
 
 so, over to you, do you have any counter claims, sources et 
 rest that shows that christianity does not have the concept
 of a social promise that is independent on the social status?
 
 cheers,
 kent
