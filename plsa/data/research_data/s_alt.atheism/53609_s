 it's not a fallacy - note the if.   if a supermajority of disinterested people 
 agree on a fundamantal value (we're not doing ethics yet benedikt), then what 
 is the difference between that and those people agreeing on a trivial
 observation?
 
 #for one, you have never given a set of morals people agree upon. unlike
 #a football. further, you conveniently ignore here that there are

 #does not hold.
 
 i have, however, given an example of a value people agree on, and explained
 why.  people will agree that their freedom is valuable.  i have also
 stated that such a value is a necessary condition for doing objective
 ethics - the if assertion above.  and that is what i'm talking about, there
 isn't a point in talking about ethics if this can't be agreed.
 
 #one can expect sufficiently many people to agree on its being a football,
 #while you have to give the evidence that only vanishing number disagrees
 #with a set of morals you have to give.
 
 i'm not doing morals (ethics) if we can't get past values.  as i say,
 the only cogent objection to my 'freedom' example is that maybe people
 aren't talking about the same thing when they answer that it is valuable.
 maybe not, and i want to think about this some, especially the implications
 of its being true.
 
 #further, the above is evidence, not proof. proof would evolve out of testing
 #your theory of absolute morals against competing theories.
 
 garbage.  that's not proof either.
 
 #the above is one of the arguments you reiterate while you never answer
 #the objections. evidence that you are a preacher.
 
 name that fallacy.
