 how does one falsify god's existance?  this, again, is a belief, not a scien-
 tific premise.  the original thread referred specifically to "scientific
 creationism".  this means whatever theory or theories you propose must be
 able to be judged by the scientific method.  this is in contrast to
 purely philosophical arguments.
