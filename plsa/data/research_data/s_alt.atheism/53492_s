 thanks jon.  i had forgotten about the 1912 and 1927 invasions (if i had
 ever learned of them.  i mean i *really* forgot!)  but i read the context
 as more recent, such as when the sandinistas were expecting an "imminent"
 invasion from the u.s. which never happened.
 
 i stand corrected.  thanks.
