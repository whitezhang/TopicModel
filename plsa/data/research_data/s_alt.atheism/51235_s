 i don't think we need to argue about this.

 yes, but also many people who are not trying to make government recognize
 christianity as the dominant religion in this country do no think
 the motto infringes upon the rights of others who do not share their
 beliefs.
 
 and actually, i think that the government already does recognize that
 christianity is the dominant religion in this country.  i mean, it is.
 don't you realize/recognize this?
 
 this isn't to say that we are supposed to believe the teachings of
 christianity, just that most people do.

 if you agree with me, then what are we discussing?

 no, but i hear quite a bit about christmas, and little if anything about
 jesus.  wouldn't this figure be more prominent if the holiday were really
 associated to a high degree with him?  or are you saying that the
 association with jesus is on a personal level, and that everyone thinks
 about it but just never talks about it?
 
 that is, can *you* prove that most people *do* associate christmas
 most importantly with jesus?

 i think the numbers *do* matter.  it takes a majority, or at least a
 majority of those in power, to discriminate.  doesn't it?
