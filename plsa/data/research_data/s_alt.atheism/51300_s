 i see, it is not rational, but it is intellectual. does madness qualify
 as intellectual engagement, too?

 exactly why science uses mathematics. qm representation in natural language
 is not supposed to replace the elaborate representation in mathematical
 terminology. nor is it supposed to be the truth, as opposed to the
 representation of gods or religions in ordinary language. admittedly,
 not  every religion says so, but a fancy side effect of their inept
 representations are the eternal hassles between religions.
  
 and qm allows for making experiments that will lead to results that will
 be agreed upon as being similar. show me something similar in religion.

 with the effect that the models presented are useless. and one can argue
 that the other way around, namely that the only reason metaphysics still
 flourish is because it makes no statements that can be verified or falsified -
 showing that it is bogus.

 haven't you read the many posts about what reliability is and how it can
 be acheived respectively determined?
