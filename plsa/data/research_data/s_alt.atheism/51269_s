 well, it's obvious that you *don't* attempt, otherwise you would be aware
 that they *don't* all "loudly [claim] to be the one true christian".
 
 i've tried to avoid using the phrase "is/is not christian" because of these
 ownership issues; instead, i've tried the phrase "nicene christianity" in an
 attempt to identify the vast majority of "christianity" which has roughly
 similar viewpoints on the core theological issues.  the jws do not fall
 within this group and in fact espouse a position known as arianism, which is
 rejected by all the nicene churches and virtually everyone else as well.
