 what atheists are you talking about?  
 
 imnsho, abortion is the womans choice.  homosexual sex is the choice of 
 the people involved.  war is sometimes necessary.  
 
 this leaves capital punishment.  i oppose capital punishemnt because 
 mistakes can happen (yes this thread went around with no resolution
 recently).
 
 as far as poplulation control, i think contraception and education are
 the best courses of action.

 that's because you are again making the assumption that all atheists
