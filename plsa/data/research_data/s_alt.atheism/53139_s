 your posting provoked me into checking my save file for memorable
 posts. the first i captured was by ken arromdee on 19 feb 1990, on the
 subject "re: atheist too?". that was article #473 here; your question
 was article #53766, which is an average of about 48 articles a day for
 the last three years. as others have noted, the current posting rate is
 such that my kill file is depressing large...... among the posting i
 saved in the early days were articles from the following notables:
 
 >from: loren@sunlight.llnl.gov (loren petrich)
 >from: jchrist@nazareth.israel.rel (jesus christ of nazareth)
 >from: mrc@tomobiki-cho.cac.washington.edu (mark crispin)
 >from: perry@apollo.hp.com (jim perry)
 >from: lippard@uavax0.ccit.arizona.edu (james j. lippard)
 >from: minsky@media.mit.edu (marvin minsky)
 
 an interesting bunch.... i wonder where #2 is?
