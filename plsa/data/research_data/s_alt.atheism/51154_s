 there are definitely quite a few horrible deaths as the result of both
 atheists and theists.  i'm sure bobby can list quite a few for the atheist
 side but fails to recognize that the theists are equally proficient at
 genocide.  perhaps, since i'm a bit weak on history, somone here would like
 to give a list of wars caused/led by theists?  i can think of a few (hitler
 claimed to be a christian for example) but a more complete list would
 probably be more effective in showing bobby just how absurd his statement
 is.

 on a side note, i notice you always sign your posts "peace".  perhaps you
 should take your own advice and leave the atheists in peace with their
 beliefs?
