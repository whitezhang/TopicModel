 as much as i considered some of the (so-called) islam-related dialogue
 here a total waste of time, i somehow can't restrain myself in this
 instance, so, gregg, try this:
 
 20:52 p.s.t.  i come to my senses and accept the all-knowing
 wisdom and power of the quran and allah.  not only that, but allah 
 himself drops by to congratulate me on my wise choice. allah rolls a
 few bones and we get down.  then allah gets out the crisco, bends 
 over, and invites me to take a spin around the block.  wow.
 
 20:56 p.s.t.  i realize that maybe allah is looking for more of a 
 commitment than i'm ready for, so i say "man, i've got some
 programming to do.  gotta go.  i'll call you."
 
 20:59 p.s.t   thinking it over, i renounce islam.
 
 btw, gregg, allah said he still thinks of you.
