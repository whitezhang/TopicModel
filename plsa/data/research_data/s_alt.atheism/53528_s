 what if any, historical reference do we have to abortion at this time?  did
 the ancient jew have appropriate reference to understand abortion? (i am
 truly asking, not making a point veiled as a question).  if there is 
 little understanding of the medical procedure we know as abortion, it is
 not surprising the bible makes little reference to it, as it makes little
 reference to nuclear power and contamination.
 
 while your interpretation is a reasonable one, i see no reason to reject
 the other out of hand.  the king jimmy translation says "if there is no
 further mischief."  this does not necessarily imply to the woman.  i know
 if my wife we expecting and someone cause her to spontaneously abort, we
 would feel that a life was truly taken, not simply a process halted.
