 i tend to agree.  i came here when it first started and watched it grow
 from the roots on talk.religion.misc.  it seemed to take a while for enough
 atheists to come forward to get past the "let's trash xians" and such.
 now there's a stable core, and frankly there's a feeling that this is
 _our_ group.
 
 if we go mainstream, we're going to be in a lot more places.  and every
 fucking fundy loonie freshman will be dumping on us to find jeesus! and
 warn us that we're all going to hell.
 
 want to see what we'll get?  go real alt.fan.brother-jed and imagine that
 those imbecilic tirades will be here.  all the time.  every other post.
 
 i'm being selfish.  i find i really learn a lot here and the s/n isn't too
 bad.  the browns and the boobys are a distraction, but they are few enough
 that they even bring in some of the leavening needed to offset them.  but
 i greatly fear that mainstreaming would basically put us at the swamping
 level of the conners of the world.
 
 regards,
 dew
