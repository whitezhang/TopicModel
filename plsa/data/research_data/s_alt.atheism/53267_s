 correction: _hard_ atheism is a faith.

 get a grip, man.  the stalin example was brought up not as an
 indictment of atheism, but merely as another example of how people will
 kill others under any name that's fit for the occasion.

 so hard atheism has nothing to prove?  then how does it justify that
 god does not exist?  i know, there's the faq, etc.  but guess what -- if
 those justifications were so compelling why aren't people flocking to
 _hard_ atheism?  they're not, and they won't.  i for one will discourage
 people from hard atheism by pointing out those very sources as reliable
 statements on hard atheism.
 
 second, what makes you think i'm defending any given religion?  i'm merely
 recognizing hard atheism for what it is, a faith.
 
 and yes, by "we" i am referring to every reader of the post.  where is the
 evidence that the poster stated that he relied upon?

 bzzt!  by virtue of your innocent little pronoun, "they", you've just issued
 a blanket statement.  at least i will apologize by qualifying my original
 statement with "hard atheist" in place of atheist.  would you call john the
 baptist arrogant, who boasted of one greater than he?  that's what many
 christians do today.  how is that _in itself_ arrogant?

 with your sophisticated put-down of "they", the theists, _your_ serious
 misinformation shines through.
