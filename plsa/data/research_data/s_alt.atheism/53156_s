        since you have referred to the messiah, i assume you are referring
         to the new testament.  please detail your complaints or e-mail if
         you don't want to post.  first-century greek is well-known and
         well-understood.  have you considered josephus, the jewish historian,
         who also wrote of jesus?  in addition, the four gospel accounts
         are very much in harmony.
