 it would probably help your education if you actually read some
 of eldridge's books, instead of quoting excerpts from some fact sheet.
 
 yes, eldridge doesn't go along with gradualism 100%.   however,
 in time frames he relates how one can sometimes trace the gradual
 development of a feature - in this case trilobite eye - over time
 scales as long as millions of years.
