 no, and begging the question.  see below.

 again, incorrect, and question-begging.  see below.

 i don't see yours.  it seems to rest on the assertion that everything
 is either a subject or an object.  there's nothing compelling about that
 dichotomy.  i might just as well divide the world into subject,object,
 event.  it even seems more sensible.  causation, for example, is
 an event, not a subject or an object.  
 
 furthermore, if subject/object were true dichotomy, i.e.
 
 	everything is either a subject or an object
 
 then, is that statement a self-evident truth or not?  if so, then it's 
 all in the mind of the beholder, according to the relativist, and hardly 
 compelling.  add to that the fact that the world can quickly be shoved
 in its entirety into the "subjective" category by an idealist or 
 solipsist argument, and that we have this perfectly good alternate
 set of categories (subject, object, event) [which can be reduced
 to (subject, object, quality) without any logical difficulty] and why
 yes, i guess i *am* denying that self-evident truths are all in the mind of 
 the beholder.

 all of it.

 i'm referring to ethical nihilism

 i've responded over there.  btw - i don't intend this as a strawman, but
 as something logically entailed by relativism (really any ethical system
 where values are assumed to be unreal).  it's different to say "relativists
 say..." than "relativism implies...".
