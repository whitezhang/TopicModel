 i think c.s. lewis has argued that medieval people did not all think the
 world is flat.
 
 however, this argument goes both ways. pretend someone telling plato that
 it is highly probable that people do not really have souls; their minds
 and their consciousness are just something their brains make up, and
 their brains (their body) is actually ahead of their mind even in 
 voluntarly actions. i don't think plato would have been happy with this,
 and neither would paul, although paul's ideas were quite different.
 however, if you would _read_ what we discuss in this group, and not
 just preach, you would see that there currently is much evidence in
 favour of these statements.
 
 the same applies to the theory of natural selection, or other sacred
 cows of christianity on our origins and human nature. i don't believe
 in spirits, devils or immortal souls any more than in gods.

 ah, you said it. you believe what you want to. this is what i had assumed
 all along.

 you might be as well planting satan's seeds, ever thought of this?
 besides, you haven't yet explained why we must believe so blindly,
 without any guiding light at all (at least i haven't noticed it).
 i don't think this is at all fair play on god's part. 
 
 your argument sounds like a version of pascal's wager. please read the
 faq, this fallacy is discussed there.

 and i failed to get help from the hs because i had a wrong attitude?
 sorry, dan, but i do not think this spirit exists. people who claim to have
 access to it just look badly deluded, not gifted.
