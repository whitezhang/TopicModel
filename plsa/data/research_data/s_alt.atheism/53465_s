 good statement! should we apply empirical measurements to define exact
 social morals? should morals be based on social rules? on ancient
 religious doctrines? it seems there will *never* be a common and single
 denominator for defining morals, and as such defining absolute
 and objective morals is doomed to fail as long as humans have 
 this incredible talent of creative thinking.
