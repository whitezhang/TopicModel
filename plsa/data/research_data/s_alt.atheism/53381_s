 hmm, usenet got it's collective hooks into me around 1987 or so right after i
 switched to engineering.  i'd say i started reading alt.atheism around 1988-89.
 i've probably not posted more than 50 messages in the time since then though.
 i'll never understand how people can find the time to write so much.  i
 can barely keep up as it is.
