 but you haven't taken into the account of propoganda.  remember, if you
 asked germans before wwii if the jews shoudl be slaughtered, they would
 probably answer no, but, after the propoganda machine rolled through, at
 least some were able to tolerate it.
 
 you see, it only takes a small group of fanatics to whip up a general
 frenzy.

 well, they haven't managed to outlaw abortion due to the possible objectivity
 of the courts.  but, they have managed to create quite a few problems for
 people that wanted to have an abortion.  they could create similar problems
 for us.  and, it could be worse.  they can try to stop abortions by blocking
 clinics, etc., but imagine what they'd have to do to stop atheism.

 so, you are able to convince them individually, but could you convince a
 whole room of them?  a whole nation?

 yes, i'd be glad if it were gone to.  i've never supported it.  however,
 i think that it is a minor problem that can be easily ignored, contrasted
 with what *could* happen (an what may be likely).

 well, i am not clear on the religious convictions of francis scott key (the
 motto can be attributed to him), but it is at least clear that he believed
 in a god.  and, surely there are a few christians that think as you say,
 but i don't think that most do.  do you think that all christians actively
 despise other religions?  most that i have met haven't and don't do so.

 well, i have asked a hindu, moselem, and a few jews, and all of them think
 that it is applicable to them.  of course, i can't say that these people
 (just some that i know pretty well) are accurate representations of their
 faiths.

 well, i'd really like to, and i've tried, but i really don't know where to

 out here?

 only in the sense that neither can probably convinced to change their beliefs.

 so, are you saying that they redesign the plates each year?
 
 anyway, your whole argument (conveniently deleted i see) was that the motto
 somehow costs us all a lot of money.  this is just not correct.

 that is to say, the religion of this country, and the non-religion of
 the ussr.  that was what most of those quotes were about, and some included
 all atheists, in general, as well.  i don't think that any of the quotes
 (although i seem to have lost them) mentioned anything at all about jesus.
 they advocated religion over non-religion.  a specific religion was not
 mentioned.

 so, you are saying that all christians must believe that all other religions
 should be outlawed, just because they think they are wrong?  that's silly.
 i think the flat-earthers are wrong, but i don't advocate their banishment.

 i think that any such cost would be insignificant.  i mentioned the slight
 cost because you said that the motto was costing us a lot of money by
 being on our currency.
 
 >disregarding the digression of the other motto...if it is used for

 well, mottos in general don't really have purposes...  i don't think it
 should be removed because i think the benefit would be outweighed by the
 consequences.

 then you should be concerned with the opinion of the entire congress.

 why not?  it is the majority that put it there.

 but do they remember the debate surrounding the motto?  do they remember
 that some people intended it to be a message against atheists?  why don't
 you include this in your little survey that you were conducting?
 
 [...]

 what?  should i ask some scientists the probability that something einstein
 said about relativity is worthy?  i mean, if einstein said it, there's a
 good chance that it was right (at least at the time).

 you need not agree with them all of the time, but you would certainly think
 that their decisions would be good evidence in favor of some point.

 no, i think that it would be clearly inappropriate for a supreme court
 justice to testify before congress during the consideration of a
 constitutional amendment.
 
 and, in order for the court to rule on something, a case usually must be
 presented.

 yes, some mushrooms can be planted.  and, i don't appreciate mushrooms on
 my pizza, either.

 who was forced to put the motto there?  what do you mean?
