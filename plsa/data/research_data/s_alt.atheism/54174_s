 cute characterization bill; however, there is no inconsistency between 
 the two statements.  even if one believes that religion is "primitive, 
 simple-minded and unscientific, anti-intellectual and childish", one
 can still hold the view that religion also adds an unnecessary level of
 complexity to the explanation.  the ideas themselves don't have to be
 complex before being excised by occam's razor, they only have to add 
 unnecessarily to the overall complexity of the description.

 i think the non-essential part of an explanatory system is one that
 adds no predictive capability to the system.
