 so? no fun, but i must have met the minority then.
 and "given by god" refers to any action whereby a god
 god causes or better effects something.
  
  
 rob, i am not intimate with jewish theology, but i understand
 that you are a messianic jew. correct me if i am wrong, but
 it appears that the views of messianic jews on metaphysics
 is different to that of the majority of jews. while jewish
 theology overall is quite distinct from the christianic god
 views, i have heard that it is possible for jews to attribute
 evil to their god, an no-no for christians, the bible is
 still seen as effect of the interaction of some god with man.

 the context was metaphysics, even when the process of adapting
 the commandments is not transcendent, the justification of the
 process lie in metaphysic specualtion. i wonder how you break
 out of the shackles of having metaphysics in your system.

 is is in a book that commands to commit genocide among other
 reprehensible deeds. the context is repulsive, and it is
 foul play, imo, to invoke some relatively enlightened passages
 as an example for the content of the whole book.

 no, not the interpretation of some laws, but the interpretation of
 the bible. as in the example that sodom and gomorrha mean argue
 with god. the whole idea that it is metaphorically and yet allows
 you to argue with a god (whatever that means, that alone is a theo-
 logic question) is proof of a theology used.

 it is an important question in the light of what for instance the
 passage witrh sodom and gomorrha means. either there is some connection
 between the text, the fact that it exists, and your interpretation of
 it, or it is purely arbitrary.. further, the question is why is has
 one to carry the burden of biblical texts when one could simply write
 other books that convey the message better. you might answer that one
 can't becuase  some peculiar biblical information might be lost, but
 that holds true of every other book, and the question remains why has
 the bible still a special place? can't it be replaced somehow? is it
 ok to bargain the dangerous content of the bible against some other
 message that is included as well?

 sorry, but there are worse systems does not say anything about if
 one could not have a better system.

 if we read two stories in the bible, one that god commands people
 to kill children for being idolaters and another where god kills
 children directly, what is more important to resolve, the message that
 children are to be killed or if it has  to be done by god?
  
  
 and the argument you have given is a fallacy, while it may not be important
 in the context you have given to find out if god is corporeal or not, it
 can be crucial in other questions. religious believers resolve contradictions
 with that they choose one of the possibilities given in an arbitrary way,
 and have the advantage of being able to attribute their decision to some
 god.
  
 one cannot resolve questions by the statement do what is good when what
 is good depends on the question.
