 issued by khomeini it shouldn't be relevant to anyone. but issued
 by an honest and learned scholar of islam it would be relevant to
 any muslim as it would be contrary to islamic law which all muslims
 are required to respect.

 anyone sufficiently well versed in islamic law and capable of reasoning,
 if you are talking about a weak sense of "excuse." it depends on what 
 sense of "excuse" you have in mind.
 
 
 > and who cares if you think it is inexcusable?
 
 only someone who thinks my opinion is important, obviously.
 obviously you don't care, nor do i care that you don't care.
