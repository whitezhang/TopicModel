 right on, jon!  who cares who or whose, as long as it works for the individual.
 but don't try to impose those beliefs on us or our children.  i would add the
 well-funded group tries also to purge science, to deny children access to great
 wonders and skills.  and how about the kids born to creationists?  what a
 burden with which to begin adult life.  it must be a cruel awakening for those
 who finally see the light, provided it is possible to escape from the depths of
 this type of ignorance.
