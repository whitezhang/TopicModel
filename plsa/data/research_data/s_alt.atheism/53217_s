 see, there you go again, saying that a moral act is only significant
 if it is "voluntary."  why do you think this?
 
 and anyway, humans have the ability to disregard some of their instincts.

 you are attaching too many things to the term "moral," i think.
 let's try this:  is it "good" that animals of the same species
 don't kill each other.  or, do you think this is right? 
 
 or do you think that animals are machines, and that nothing they do
 is either right nor wrong?

 those weren't arbitrary killings.  they were slayings related to some sort
 of mating ritual or whatnot.

 yes it was, but i still don't understand your distinctions.  what
 do you mean by "consider?"  can a small child be moral?  how about
 a gorilla?  a dolphin?  a platypus?  where is the line drawn?  does
 the being need to be self aware?
 
 what *do* you call the mechanism which seems to prevent animals of
 the same species from (arbitrarily) killing each other?  don't
 you find the fact that they don't at all significant?
