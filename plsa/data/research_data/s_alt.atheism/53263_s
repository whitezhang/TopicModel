 but how does one handle the nonrepeatability of the experiment? in many types ofexperiments the "prediction" is that the observed phenomena will happen again
 and be capable of being observed. for example, in chemistry someone may predict
 the outcome of a chemical reaction and then actually observe that reaction 
 repeatedly. you can't repeat or ever know for sure the original conditions that
 produced life. so it seems we could never say, "that's exactly how it happened."as far as we know that event was unobserved. (at least no one has admitted
 it. :-) ) so unlike the chemistry experiment repeatability and observability,
 strictly speaking, are lacking.
