 seems he didn't understand anything about realities, liar, lunatic
 or the real thing is a very narrow view of the possibilities of jesus
 message.
 
 sigh, it seems religion makes your mind/brain filter out anything
 that does not fit into your personal scheme. 
 
 so anyone that thinks the possibilities with jesus is bound to the
 classical lewis notion of 'liar, lunatic or saint' is indeed bound
 to become a christian.
