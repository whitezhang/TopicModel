 so, let's see. if some guy writes a piece with a title that implies
 something is the case then it must be so, is that it?

 this supports nothing. i have no reason to believe that this is 
 piece is anything other than another anti-islamic slander job.
 i have no respect for titles, only for real content. i can look
 up this article if i want, true. but i can tell you bcci was _not_
 an islamic bank. seeing as i'm spending my time responding to
 propaganda (in responding to this little sub-thread) i really
 don't feel a deep need to do more than make statements to the
 effect that the propaganda is false. if someone wants to discuss
 the issue more seriously then i'd be glad to have a real discussion,
 providing references, etc.
