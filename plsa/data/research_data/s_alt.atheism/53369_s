 in what manner?  if you argue that the universe was created with a higher
 `truth` than science (btw i would love to see you define `truth` in this
 arguement) then you must state how you know this and what it is.  to subbornly
 state that there is a "higher truth" and that it isyour god, i would ask you to prove it.
 this, obviously, you cannot do.  besides, if i assume for the moment that
 there is a 'higher truth' then how can you prove it is your god and not 
 another religion's?  what makes you so arrogant to push forward your idea
 of creation over many peoples' study of the laws of nature, ie science?
 
 science is the study of nature.  it is open-minded: if the theory doesn't fit the
 facts then trash the theory and try to construct one which does.  it is *flexible*!
 your definition of science presupposes that science ignores this god 
 character altogether.  if this is so, then it is only because no evidence 
 can be found of him.

 so do i.  fortunately i am not mentally shackled into constructing my
 scientific conclusions by placing god, jesus and the holy ghost into every
 paragraph in a sycophantic manner.

 indeed it is a wonder observing the random effects of creation.  this, of
 course, assumes a definition of aethetics which you don't forward!
 
 
 as to "macroevolution":  please give references and more information.  from
 where do you get your figures?
 
 adda.
