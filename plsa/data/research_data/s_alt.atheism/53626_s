 well, that's the end-point problem again.   being able to 
 distinguish some egregious terrorist from some saintly man 
 of peace does not mean that you have a method for telling
 who's a terrorist in general.
 
 of course we *try* to tell them apart, but for my money
 it's better to try with the full awareness that we all
 bring bias to the judgement than to imagine that we are
 using some objective test.
