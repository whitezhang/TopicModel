 kent sandvik and jon livesey made essentially the same response, so this
 time kent's article gets the reply:

 this begs the question of whether it ever "started"-- perhaps because
 accuracy was always an intention.

 it makes little difference if you have eyewitnesses or people one step away
 (reporters, if you will).  as i said earlier, the "telephone" metaphor is
 innately bad, because the purpose of a game of telephone is contrary to the
 aims of writing these sorts of texts.  (also, i would point out that, by the
 standards generally asserted in this group, the distinction between
 eyewitnesses and others is hollow, since nobody can be shown to be an
 eyewitness, or indeed, even shown to be the author of the text.)
 
 there is no evidence that the "original" texts of either the ot or the nt
 are largely lost over time in a sea of errors, "corrections", additions and
 deletions.  in the case of the nt, the evidence is strongly in the other
 direction: the textus r. and the nestle-aland text do not differ on more
 than a low level of significance.  it is reasonable to assume a similar
 situation for the ot, based on the nt as a model.
