 	you and mr. bobby really need to sit down and decide what
 exactly islam  *is* before posting here.
 
 	according to 'zlumber, one is not a muslim when one is doing evil. 
 [ a muslin can do no evil ] according to him, one who does evil is suffering 
 from "temporary athiesm."
 
 	now, would the members who claim to be "muslims" get their stories 
 straight????
