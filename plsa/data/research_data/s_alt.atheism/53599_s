 "i'm afraid i'm going to have to kill you.  don't worry, though; as a loving
 christian, i guarantee that i will regret the fact that i have to kill
 you, although i won't regret the actual killing."

 false dichotomy.

 that's because they weren't even attempted.

 you want to know why it bothers me that thousands of innocent people were
 maimed or killed by bombing at the end of ww2, when it was far from clear
 that such bombing was necessary?

 no, just the ones that have oil.  or the ones that look like they might make
 a success of communism.

 i don't see that getting un forces to east timor is any harder than getting
 them to iraq.

 fine.  write to your congressman and to president clinton.  china's status as
 "most favoured nation" comes up for renewal in june.  point out that the us
 shouldn't be offering favourable trading terms to such a despicable regime.
 
 i doubt anything will happen.  clinton's keener on trade sanctions against
 europe.

 any idea how many kill files you just ended up in?

 the same tired old misunderstanding.  moral relativism means that there is no
 *objective* standard of morality.  it doesn't mean you can't judge other
 people's morals.  christ on a bike, how many times have we tried to hammer
 that into your head?

 obviously not, as i am an atheist.  i don't think you'd get on with jesus,
 though; he was a long-haired lunatic peace-nik, was he not?

 right.  unfortunately for you, it turned out that my opinions on the matter
 were entirely consistent in that i condemned the bombing of dresden too.
 
 i think you're being a bit glib with your explanation of the blanket bombing
 policy, too.  you make it sound as though we were aiming for military targets
 and could only get them by destroying civilian buildings next door.  as i
 understand it, that is not the case; we aimed deliberately at civilian
 targets in order to cause massive damage and inspire terror amongst the
 german people.

 oh, come on.  with wars like the falklands fresh in people's minds, that sort
 of propaganda isn't going to fool anyone.

 yes?  and what about the millions of casualties the russians suffered?  it's
 hardly surprising the us didn't lose many men in ww2, given that you turned
 up late.
