 so the only way you can tell a false hadith from a true one is
 if it contradicts the quran?  what if it relates to something
 that isn't explicitly spelled out in the quran?
 
 also, the quran wasn't written down during the life of muhammed
 either.  it wasn't long after, but 20 years or so is still long
 enough to shift a few verses around.
