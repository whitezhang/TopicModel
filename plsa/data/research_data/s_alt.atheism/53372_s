 not true. consider the case of a coin. i flip it and do not look
 at it. it is either heads or tails. it is entirely possible
 for me to simply choose to believe that it is heads or tails and
 be right. now, there is a procedure for ensuring(more or less)
 that my belief will be correct, but it is quite possible for me
 to be correct without following it.

 no, i don't. i can do perfectly good science without valuing
 the procedure. but you're just overloading the term "value"
 again. judgement of the validity of a procedure is not the
 same as judgement of how preferable a certain action is, and
 just because the word "value" can be applied to both doesn't
 make it so. you might as well assert that "number theory is
 based on values."

 huh? this is a complete non sequiter.

 you're just overloading the word value, again, i suspect.

 i don't understand your point here. what do you mean by "not quite-sure
 observations?" it gets observed all the time that if you don't
 buy into a whole series of assumptions about how science is
 done, the results become meaningless. 
 
 if you're suggesting that because science is allegedly chosen
 'subjectively' the results have to be inconsistent, that's
 silly.

 this is just truth by blatant assertion. your "in any important sense"
 seem to be just weasel words. imagine that i have a box which
 accepts 16 bytes and uses the first 8 to ecb the second 8.
 it still does a perfect job of desing, whether or not any input
 is being made at the time--whether or not anyone values mathematics..
