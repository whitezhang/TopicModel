   i doubt the death penalty was supposed to be a "deterrent" to crime. if so,
 why doesn't every crime carry a death penalty ? that would be effictive
 wouldn't it ???
 
   the death penalty is a punishment, much like a $50 fine for speeding is
 a punishment. anyway, somebody with murder on the mind doesn't much care
 about the consequences. i think another problem is that people dont think
 they will get caught. if i wanted to kill another person, i wouldn't 
 care what the penalty was if i didn't think i would get caught.
 
   if it was to be strictly a deterrent, it should have been more along 
 the lines of torture.
