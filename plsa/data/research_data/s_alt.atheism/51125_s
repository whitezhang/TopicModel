 yes.

 well, for example, the goal of "natural" morality is the survival and
 propogation of the species.  another example of a moral system is
 presented within the declaration of independence, which states that we
 should be guaranteed life liberty and the pursuit of happiness.  you see,
 to have a moral system, we must define the purpose of the system.  that is,
 we shall be moral unto what end?

 well, murder violates the golen rule, which is certainly a pillar of most
 every moral system.  however, i am not assuming that our current system
 and the manner of its implementation are objectively moral.  i think that
 it is a very good approximation, but we can't be perfect.

 well, "objective" would assume a system based on clear and fundamental
 concepts, while "arbitary" implies no clear line of reasoning.
