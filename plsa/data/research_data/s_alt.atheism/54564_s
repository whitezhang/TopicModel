 "isaac asimov read creationist books.  he read the bible.  he had ample
 opportunity to kneel before his creator and savior.  he refused.  in
 fact, he sent out a strong promotional letter urging support of the
 american humanist association, shortly before he died."
 
    --excerpt from ken ham, "asimov meets his creator," _back to genesis_
      no. 42, june 1992, p. c (included in _acts & facts_ vol. 21, no. 6,
      june 1992, from the institute for creation research).  this is one
      of the most offensive articles they've ever published--but at least
      it argues *against* a deathbed conversion.  there's a part of the
      article even worse than what i've just quoted, in which an excerpt
      from a reader's letter says that if asimov is burning in hell now,
      "then he certainly has had a 180-degree change in his former beliefs
      about creation and the creator."  (a post-deathbed conversion.)
