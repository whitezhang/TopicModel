 i don't necessarily disagree with your assertion, but i disagree with
 your reasoning.  (faith = bad.  dogma = bad.  religion -> (faith ^ dogma).
 religion -> (bad ^ bad).  religion -> bad.)  unfortunately, you never 
 state why faith and dogma are dangerous.  
 
 if you believe faith and dogma are dangerous because of what happened in
 waco, you are missing the point.  
 
 the branch davidians made the mistake of confusing the message with the
 messenger.  they believed koresh was a prophet, and therefore believed
 everything he said.  the problem wasn't the religion, it was the 
 followers.  they didn't die because of faith and dogma, they died because
 of their zealotry (or, in the case of the children, the zealotry of their
 parents).

 so christians are totally irrational?  irrational with respect to their
 religion only?  what are you saying?  one's belief in a christian god does
 not make one totally irrational.  i think i know what you were getting at,
 but i'd rather hear you expand on the subject.

 again, this statement is too general.  a christian is perfectly capable of
 being a philosopher, and absolutely capable of changing his/her mind.  faith in
 god is a belief, and all beliefs may change.  would you assert that atheists
 would make poor philosophers because they are predisposed to not believe in a
 god which, of course, may show unfair bias when studying, say, religion?

 so, christianity is a prison, eh?  ever heard of parole?  you have read far
 too much into this subject.  a christian is one who follows the religion
 based on the teachings of a man named jesus christ.  nowhere does this
 definition imply that one cannot change one's mind.  in prison, however,
 you can't just decide to leave.  one is voluntary, the other is not.  the
 two are not compatible.

 i prefer to think of religion as a water pistol filled with urine. 8^)
 seriously, though, some (but certainly not all) religions do condemn
 groups of people.  the common target is the "infidel," a curious being
 who is alternately an atheist, a non-<insert specific religious
 affiliation here>, a person of a different race, or an egyptian. 8^)
 
 please explain how "just because" thinking kills people.  (and please
 state more in your answer than "waco.")

 i'll see your conscientious peacenik and raise you a religious 
 zealot with bad acne. 8^)  by the way, i wasn't aware mass suicide
 was a problem.  waco and jonestown were isolated incidents.  
 mass suicides are far from common.
