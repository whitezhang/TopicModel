 this is fascinating. atheists argue for abortion, defend homosexuality
 as a means of population control, insist that the only values are
 biological and condemn war and capital punishment. according to
 benedikt, if something is contardictory, it cannot exist, which in
 this case means atheists i suppose.
 i would like to understand how an atheist can object to war (an
 excellent means of controlling population growth), or to capital
 punishment, i'm sorry but the logic escapes me.
 and why just capital punishment, what is being questioned here, the
 propriety of killing or of punishment? what is the basis of the
 ecomplaint?
