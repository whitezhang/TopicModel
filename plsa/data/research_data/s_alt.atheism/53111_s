 don't listen to this guy, he's just a crank.  at first, this business
 about being the "one true god" was tolerated by the rest of us,
 but now it has gotten completely out of hand.
 
 besides, it really isn't so bad when people stop believing in you.
 it's much more relaxing when mortals aren't always begging you for favors.
