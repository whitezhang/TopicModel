  how about this description: "an object that is, at one time, both a
 euclidean square and a euclidean circle"? i hold that no object satisfying
 this description could exist. the description is inconsistent, and hence
 describes an object that could not exist.
  now, suppose someone pointed to a bicycle, and said, "that object is,
 at one time, both a euclidean square and a euclidean circle." this does
 not mean that the bicycle does not exist, it measn that the description
 was incorrectly applied.
  
  the atheist says, "the descriptions of god that i have been presented with
 are contradictory, and hence describe something that cannot exist."
  now, your position (so far as i can gather) is that god exists, but the
 descriptions atheists have been presented with are simply bad descriptions
 of it.
  this is roughly analogous to someone who has never seen a bicycle, and,
 when they ask for a description from people who claim to have seen one,
 are told that it is a "euclidean circle-square". can they be blamed for
 doubting rather strongly that this 'bicycle' exists at all?
