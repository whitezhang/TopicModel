 i'm not saying this at all - it requires no faith on my part to
 say the car drives because i've seen it drive - i've done more
 than at in fact - i've actually driven it. (now what does require
 some faith is the belief that my senses give an accurate representation
 of what's out there....) but there is no evidence - pro or con -
 for the existence or non-existence of god (see what i have to
 say below on this).

 sorry if i remain skeptical - i don't believe it's entirely a
 conclusion. that you have seen no evidence that there is a god
 is correct - neither have i. but lack of evidence for the existence 
 of something is in no way evidence for the non-existence of something 
 (the creationist have a similar mode of argumentation in which if they 
 disprove evolution the establish creation). you (personally) have never 
 seen a neutrino before, but they exist. the "pink unicorn" analogy breaks
 down and is rather naive. i have a scientific theory that explains the 
 appearance of animal life - evolution. when i draw the conclusion that 
 "pink unicorns" don't exist because i haven't seen them, this conclusion
 has it's foundation in observation and theory. a "pink unicorn", if
 it did exist, would be qualitatively similar to other known entities.
 that is to say, since there is good evidence that all life on earth has
 evolved from "more primitive" ancestors these pink unicorns would share 
 a common anscestory with horses and zebras and such. god, however,
 has no such correspondence with anything (imo). there is no physical
 frame work of observation to draw any conclusions from.

 i disagree with you profoundly on this. i haven't defined god as
 existence - in fact, i haven't defined god. but this might be
 getting off the subject - although if you think it's relevant
 we can come back to it.

 you are using wrong categories here - or perhaps you misunderstand
 what i'm saying. i'm making no argument what so ever and offering no
 definition so there is no fallacy. i'm not trying to convince you of
 anything. *i* believe - and that rests upon faith. and it is inappropriate
 to apply the category of logic in this realm (unless someone tells you
 that they can logically prove god or that they have "evidence" or ...,
 then the use of logic to disprove their claims if fine and necessary).
 
 btw, an incomplete argument is not a fallacy - some things are not
 even wrong.

 i don't follow you here. certainly one can make observations of
 things that they didn't know existed. i still maintain that one
 cannot use observation to infer that "god does not exist". such
 a positive assertion requires a leap.

 once again you seem to completely misunderstand me. i have no
 evidence that "'god is' is meaningful" at any level. maybe such
 a response as you gave just comes naturally to you because so
 many people try to run their own private conception of god down
 your throat. i, however, am not doing this. i am arguing one, and
 only one, thing - that to make a positive assertion about something
 for which there can in principle be no evidence for or against
 requires a leap - it requires faith. i am, as you would say, a
 "theist"; however, there is a form of atheism that i can respect -
 but it must be founded upon honesty.
