 when you say, "by definition", what exactly is being defined;
 certainly not omnipotence. you seem to be saying that the "rules of
 nature" are pre-existant somehow, that they not only define nature but
 actually cause it. if that's what you mean i'd like to hear your
 further thoughts on the question.
