 	(wouldn't it be nice if subject: lines had something to do
 with nessage bodies!)
 
 	i wonder if the universe would look like a black hole
 from "outside"? how could we posit an "outside", whether called
 desitter space, hyperspace, parallel universes, whatever?
 
 	suppose that such a space existed, and that our universe
 looked like a black hole in it. then our universe could be open
 to it through hawking radiation, the same way black holes are
 within our universe. note this is all the purist speculation
 and noone knows what laws govern qm beyond the event horizon
 of our universe. can laws change at such boundaries of space-time?
