 "relativism isn't keen"???    up there someone says that relativism
 doesn't mean that all moral systems are equal.  so, what *does*
 relativism mean?  never having to say you're sorry?  :-)
 
 specifically, i'd like to know what relativism concludes when two
 people grotesquely disagree.  is it:
 
 (a) both are right
 
 (b) one of them is wrong, and sometimes (though perhaps rarely) we have a 
     pretty good idea who it is
 
 (c) one of them is wrong, but we never have any information as to who, so
     we make our best guess if we really must make a decision.
 
 (d) the idea of a "right" moral judgement is meaningless (implying that
      whether peace is better than war, e.g., is a meaningless question,
      and need not be discussed for it has no correct answer)
 
 (e) something else.  a short, positive assertion would be nice.
 
 as i hope you can tell, (b) and (c) are actually predicated on
 the assumption that values are real  - so statements like these
 _can't_ consistently derive from the relativist assumption that values
 aren't part of objective reality.
