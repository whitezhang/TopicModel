 mike,
 
 i've seen referrences to "creation vs evolution" several times in a.a
 and i have question. is either point of view derived from direct
 observation; can either be scientific? i wonder if the whole
 controversy is more concerned with the consequences of the "truth"
 rather than the truth itself. 
 both sides seem to hold to a philosophical outcome, and i can't help
 wondering which came first. as i've pointed out elsewhere, my view of
 human nature makes me believe that there is no way of knowing
 anyhthing objectively - all knowledge is inherently subjective. so, in
 the context of a.a, would you take a stand based on what you actually
 know to be true or on what you want to be true and how can you tell
 the difference?
