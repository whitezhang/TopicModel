 so that still leaves the door totally open for khomeini, hussein
 et rest. they could still be considered true muslims, and you can't
 judge them, because this is something between god and the person.
 
 you have to apply your rule as well with atheists/agnostics, you
 don't know their belief, this is something between them and god.
 
 so why the hoopla about khomeini not being a real muslim, and the
 hoopla about atheists being not real human beings?
