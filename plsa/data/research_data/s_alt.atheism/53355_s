 if the good is undefined (undefinable?) but you require of everyone that
 they know innately what is right, you are back to subjectivism.
  
 >(2) by defining the good solely in terms of evaluative terms.
  
 ditto here.  an evaluative statement implies a value judgement on the
 part of the person making it.

 please explain how this helps.  i don't see your argument.

 this makes no sense either.  flew is arguing that this is where the
 objectivist winds up, not the subjectivist.  furthermore, the nihilists
 believed in nothing *except* science, materialism, revolution, and the
 people.

 and also not the position of the subjectivist, as has been pointed out
 to you already by others.  ditch the strawman, already, and see my reply
 to mike cobb's root message in the thread societal basis for morality.
