 well, yes, but that belongs in the other group, there is a interpretation
 found for everything. however, allowing any form of interpretation reduces
 the information of the text so interprteted to zero.
  
 by the way, i have checked the quote and i think the lines preceding those
 quoted above are more interesting:
  
    21:32 where mountains are set on earth in order to immobilize the earth.
    21:33 where the skies (heavens?) are referred to as well supported.
  
 the lines given above are  21:34 after my edition.

 that sun and moon move and the earth is immobile sounds geocentric to me.
