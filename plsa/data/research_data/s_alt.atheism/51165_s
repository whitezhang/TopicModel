      which begs the question: if satan in this case is
      metaphorical, how can you be certain allah is not
      the same way?

      this is why i asked the above.  how would you then
      know god exists as a spirit or being rather than
      just being metaphorical?  i mean, it's okay to say
      "well, satan is just metaphorical," but then you
      have to justify this belief and justify that god is
      not some metaphor for something else.
 
      i say this because there are many, many instances of
      satan described as a being (such as the tormentor in 
      the old testament book of job, or the temptor in the
      new testament gospels).  in the same way, god too is
      described as a being (or spirit.)  how am i to know
      one is metaphorical and not the other.
 
      further, belief in god isn't a bar to evil.  let's
      consider the case of satanists: even if satan were
      metaphorical, the satanist would have to believe
      in god to justify this belief.  again, we have a 
      case where someone does believe in god, but by
      religious standards, they are "evil."  if bobby
      does see this, let him address this question also.
