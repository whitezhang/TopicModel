 i guess i'm delving into a religious language area.  what exactly is morality 
 or morals?  i never thought of eating meat to be moral or immoral, but i think
 it could be.  how do we differentiate between not doing something because it is
 a personal choice or preference and not doing something because we see it as 
 immoral?  do we fall to what the basis of these morals are?
 
 also, consensus positions fall to a might makes right.  or, as you brought out,
 if whatever is right is what is societally mandated then whoever is in control
 at the time makes what is right
