 it's partly as you say: the reason why people do science is that they value it's
 results.  if one follows relativism to the letter, then, the theories
 and predictions which are the results of science can only be subjectively
 valued as 'objective', 'correct', or anything else.  one cannot attach
 any objective worth to the results of science,  for the simple reason
 that one cannot attach objective worth to anything.  
 
 however, not only are the outputs of science subjectively valued, so are
 the inputs.  more problems.  which facts to observe?   what
 is a fact?  when am i justified in valuing sensory input as signal rather
 than noise?  how do i know that everyone makes the call the same as i
 do?  as a loyal relativist, i must assume that what's signal for me
 may not be signal for you.  the objectivity postulate should not sit
 well with me.
 
 so the relativist attends to a system, designed at whim, fed with what should 
 be assumed to be conflicting data, in the expectation of results which need 
 satisfy no-one.  gigo.
