 note that i _never_ said that depression and the destruction of the
 nuclear family is due _solely_ to extra-marital sex.  i specifically
 said that it was "a prime cause" of this, not "the prime cause" or "the
 only cause" of this -- i recognize that there are probably other factors
 too, but i think that extra-marital sex and subsequent destabilization
 of the family is probably a significant factor to the rise in
 psychological problems, including depression, in the west in the 20th
 century.
