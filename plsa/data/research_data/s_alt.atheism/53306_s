 	we only need to ask the question: what did the founding fathers 
 consider cruel and unusual punishment?
 
 	hanging? hanging there slowing being strangled would be very 
 painful, both physically and psychologicall, i imagine.
 
 	firing squad ? [ note: not a clean way to die back in those 
 days ], etc. 
 
 	all would be considered cruel under your definition.
 	all were allowed under the constitution by the founding fathers.
