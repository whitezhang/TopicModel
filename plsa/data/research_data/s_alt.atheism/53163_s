 of course, if you're planning to pull a rushdie then declaring one's
 leaving the religion is little to be concerned about compared to one's
 other plans.
 
 
 in rushdie's case, the one under discussion, one can. it is tragic that
 in _some_ "islamic" countries this is so. there are, however, islamic
 countries (whose constitutions contains statements that islamic law is
 to be incorporated), e.g. kuwait, where one can freely make such
 statements without fear.

 this story has become tiresome. the conditions are clear. if you care to
 make your point clear then make a chronology and show that he had made
 public statements about leaving islam prior to his writing of _tsv_. if
 he did make such statements then he should have made _that_ clear rather
 than trying to rejoin islam or go on talking about his personal
 feelings.
