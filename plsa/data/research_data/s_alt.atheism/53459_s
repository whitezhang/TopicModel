 i know of a similar incident about 3 years ago.  a climatologist( ithink 
 that was his profession) named iben browning predicted that an earthquake 
 would hit the new madrid fault on dec.3.  some schools in missouri that were 
 on the fault line actually cancelled school for the day.  many people 
 evacuated new madrid and other towns in teh are.  i wouldn't be suprised if 
 there were more journalists in the area than residents.  of course, teh 
 earthquake never occured.  how do i know about his?  i used to live in 
 southern illinois and the lican middle school was built directly on the 
 fault line.  no we still had school... we laughed at the poor idiots who 
 believed the prediction. :):):):)
 
 bob, if you're wanting an excuse to convert to christianity, you gonna have 
 to look elsewhere.
