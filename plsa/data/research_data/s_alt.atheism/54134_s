 no wonder that we don't see any detail for this claim. it is good to
 remember that you have answered the statement that you are a theist
 by another correspondent with that you are not a member of a denomination.
 it is either stupidity or an attempt at a trick answer. not unlike the
 rest of your arguments.

 i am extremely wary of the way you use words. like in this case, there
 are broader definitions of gods used by persons who are considered by
 themselves and others theists. i have pointed to that in my post. you
 use one of them.
  
 your use of definitions seems to rest on the assumption: because my
 moral is objective/absolute or the other buzz words you are so fond
 of, everybody will know it, and there is no need to define it more
 exactly.
  
 and as a user has shown recently, the easiest way to dispell you is
 to ask you for definitions.

 since you are the only one seeing them, and many correspondents
 point to the flaws in your reasoning respectively discussing, i
 can't say i am impressed.
