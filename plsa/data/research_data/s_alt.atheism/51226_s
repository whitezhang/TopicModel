 :pfirst, i would like to say that atheism is in fact a belief.  it is a beilief
 :pbecause a belief in something you hold to with ador and faith.  an atheist says there are no gods.  this cannot be proven. therefore you are excepting this on
 :pfaith alone.  that is a belief.  secondly, you complain so much about how the 
 :pfundamental christians are trying to force their beliefs on you, but you don't
 :pmention anything about how the atheists, such as; madamme murry o'hare(founder
 :pof the atheists association in austin texas), and robert sherman(from the       chicago area) have been trying to force their beliefs on everyone by trying to  get rid of god from our society by banning religious paintings from parks during chistmas,  forcing cities to change their town seals if there is any mention of god in it (like sherman has done), or trying to get the slogan "in god we trust" off of the american currency? you also talk about creation "myths" as if they are in fact myths and tha
