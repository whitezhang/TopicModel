 +last night, while watching the 2a.m. rebroadcast of jerry springer (a
 +talk show) i heard this jewel of a thought from a 12 year old racist. 
 +the focus of this show was on these kids and their hatred for the jewish
 +religion, and why.  
 
 [some stuff deleted]
 
 +interesting (and scary) no?  they went on to say how the jews had 
 +killed their god, and how in the end of time that all the races would
 +go to their homelands (of course, they would remain in america, which
 +is new jeruselem, as it says in gen 2??? (what another kid said) but
 +the rest of the races would go home) and then the great battle or plague
 +or whatever revel. says would happen, and the jews would be killed.
 +
 +the most interesting thing about this was that my roomate is catholic, 
 +and had the kjv of the bible on his desk.  he immediatly opened it up
 +and began to search for the quoted passages (gen, rev, and john) to 
 +look for himself, and couldn't find what they said they saw.  i don't
 +know
 
 i saw this show a while back, and when i heard these kids
 quote the bible to justify their racist claims, i looked up
 that quote about jesus hating jews (since jesus himself was a
 jew, my curiousity had been piqued by such a claim).
 the jist of the passage (and i am sorry but i can't recall
 which passage it was exactly) was that jesus was condemning
 the pharisees for being corrupt.
 of course, the pharisees were jewish too, but it wasn't jews
 as a whole that jesus was condemning, just the powers that be.
