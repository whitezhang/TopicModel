 least i'm not the only one.

 yes, this took some getting used to -- of course not having an indian
 connection, no knowledge of hindi, etc., this was not trivial for me.
 i did have, thanks to the wonders of the net, "a glossary to *satanic
 verses*", posted to rec.arts.books by vijay raghavan, which explains a
 lot of the indian english constructions, indian culture references,
 even the islamic references ("jahilia", "submission", the context of
 the satanic verses incident, etc.) -- what i have only covers the
 first couple of hundred pages, but it helped me get into the flow of
 the novel [i can mail this to anyone interested; if anyone has
 portions after part i, if they exist, i'd like to get those].
