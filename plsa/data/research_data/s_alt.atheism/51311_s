 jim,
 
 i think you must have come in late. the discussion (on my part at
 least) began with benedikt's questioning of the historical acuuracy of
 the nt. i was making the point that, if the same standards are used to
 validate secular history that are used here to discredit nt history,
 then virtually nothing is known of the first century.
 
 you seem to be saying that the bible -cannot- be true because it
 speaks of the existence of god as it it were a fact. your objection
 has nothing to do with history, it is merely another statement of
 atheism.
