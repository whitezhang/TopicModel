 i used to have full figures on this including the tons of bombs dropped
 and the number of cluster bomblet munitions used. i had heard the 90% of
 the laser-guided weapons hit, which is an unprecedented rate of success.
 25% of the iron weapons hit, again unprecedented. the following is a rough
 estimate, but this means of the 80,000 tons of bombs dropped by us aircraft
 around 56,000 tons *missed*. i'm not sure what proportion of this was
 dropped of baghdad rather than troop concentrations in iraq and kuwait.
 much of the tonnage dropped was cluster munitions, as were all the mrls
 rounds and many of the artillery rounds. napalm and fuel air explosives
 were also used (remember how we were told that weapons of mass destruction
 such as fae were very naughty indeed?)
