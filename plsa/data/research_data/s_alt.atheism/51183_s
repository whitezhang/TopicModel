 the poster casually trashed two thousand years of jewish history, and 
 ken replied that there had previously been people like him in germany.
 
 that's right.   there have been.    there have also been people who
 were formally nazis.   but the nazi party would have gone nowhere
 without the active and tacit support of the ordinary man in the
 street who behaved as though casual anti-semitism was perfectly
 acceptable.
 
 now what exactly don't you understand about what i wrote, and why
 don't you see what it has to do with the matter at hand?
