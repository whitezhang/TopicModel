 which is what, exactly?

 i've addressed "it" (your caricature is not my "favourite point", needless
 to say) at length in a previous outing, and am currently discussing it with 
 eric rescorla.

 i do? curious, since i believe that was the first time i've ever made it.
 not that repetition would imply much more than your seeming inability
 to understand; you ask me the same question, i'll give you the same
 answer, especially when in this case, i know the answer to be true.  i
 do my best to give everyone the courtesy of a reply, but if everyone is
 making the same points, and i'm pushed for time, then i try to respond what i 
 believe are the strongest formulations of those points.  if that doesn't
 include your post, tough; this is usenet, and life is tough all over.

 i've only debated this issue twice in a.a, and occasionally in t.a.  the
 first was in response to simon clippingdale's positive assertion that
 disagreement about moral values inexorably acknowledges that morals
 are relative.  it doesn't.   now, simon has dropped out of the debate
 for some time; i take that to mean that he is either busy, or bored
 with the topic.  i certainly do not accuse him of dishonesty.  do you? 
 
 #>(d) i can't always understand what you say
 #

 usually, one does.  usually you're clear, but sometimes you aren't 
 and i ask you what you mean; other times you seem to get extremely uptight 
 and i feel that i'm debating against line noise.  sometimes i get tired, and 
 sometimes i have other things i'd rather do.  again, this is usenet, and
 life is tough all over.  you're going to have to deal with it.
 
 #>(e) you're starting to get personally insulting; i may not even put your name

 #
 #that's supposed to be a threat?
 
 no, that's a simple statement, and an assertion that i am not answerable
 to those who offer me baseless insults.  for example, those who accuse me 
 of lying about my personal beliefs, while also complaining that i don't answer
 their questions.

 i have no problem with the second statement.  i have provided an
 argument that almost everyone senses that freedom is valuable - the
 only cogent objection to this came from jon livesey, and was offered
 by some other people too: essentially, that people disagree about
 fuzzy concepts such as freedom.  it's a good point, and i'm thinking
 about it.
 # 
 #your trick is to say, i feel a is not right, and so do many i know,
 #therefore a is absolutely right. it neglects the possibility that
 #these people consider a to be right as an effect of the same process,
 #restricting the claim of its absoluteness to those who have been subject
 #of that process. in other words, refutes it. you make the ontological
 #claim, you have to prove it.
 
 nonsense.  my "trick" is to say:  i feel that a is better than b and so 
 does almost any disinterested person i ask.  best evidence is therefore 
 that a really is better than b, subject to the assumption that we
 can establish to our mutual satisfaction what we mean by a and b, and
 that the resulting system of values is self-consistent.
 
 now get this:  "really is better" is an idealisation, a fictional model,
 in the same sense that "real material existence" is a fictional model. it
 may or may not correspond to something true.  it is nonetheless a useful
 _assumption_.  far more useful than the equally assumed relativist 
 "trick", to wit:
 
 i feel that a is better than b, and so does almost any disinterested person
 i ask.  however, if even one person disagrees that a is better than b,
 or if even one person dissents from mutually agreed definitions of a and b,
 then it is the case that b is better than a for that person, and nothing
 more can be said.  
 
 i say this is useless because it inexorably implies that a supermajority
 seeking to maximise a cannot morally take action against someone seeking to
 maximise b (e.g. a terrorist).  to do that would be to claim that 
 a supermajority's carefully considered morality would be better than the 
 terrorist's - which would, of course, be true, but a no-no for an ethical
 relativist.  to claim that ethical relativism implies anything else is
 simply weasel words, and an example of compartmentalisation to rival
 anything in the world of religion.

 i've done this: freedom, with the proviso that i still have to 
 answer jon's objection that fuzzy concepts like freedom have no
 objective meaning.
 
 #further, in order to make morality absolute, universal, or objective,
 #you would have to show that it is independent of humans, or the attributes
 #above look quite misleading.
 
 not really.  what evidence is there that _anything_ exists independently
 of humans?  you'll be hard pressed to find any that isn't logically
 equivalent when applied to values.

 #>
 # 
 #no. morals are a matter of belief so far. the people still believe that the
 #shortest way is through the main entrance. no agreement on *belief* here.
 #and in order to have an analogy you would have to show that there is a
 #shortest way and that there is a method to convince everyone of that it
 #is the shortest way indeed. in other words,  your analogy works only when
 #one assumes that your  premises are right in the first place. if not, it is
 #a fallacy.
 
 and if this were an argument for objectivism, you'd be right.  it isn't,
 though, it's a demonstration that the argument you gave me is neither argument
 *against* objectivism, nor argument *for* relativism.  your gimmick is to
 assume in the first place that values aren't real, and to use this to "prove"
 that values aren't real.  in other words, you beg the question against me.
