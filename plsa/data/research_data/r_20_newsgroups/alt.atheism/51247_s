<Annotation text=" tony lezard tony@mantiscouk writes  my opinion is that the strong atheist position requires too much belief for me to be comfortable with any strong atheists out there care to comment as far as i can tell strong atheists are far outnumbered on altatheism by weak atheists  at the cost of repudiating the faq i think too much is made of the strong vs weak atheism issue although in the context of altatheism where we're continually attacked on the basis that strong atheists believe in the nonexistence of god i think the separation is a valid one  to cover my arse what i'm trying to say is that there is an infinitely grey area between weak and strong as well as between strong and the unattainable mathematical atheism i wish  whereas i _logically_ can only support the weak atheist position in effect i am a strong atheist and wish i could be a mathematical one  to justify my strong atheist position i believe i need only show that the evidence presented in favour of any of the gods under scrutiny is faulty  if i read the faq correctly no argument for the existence of god generic as represented by mainstream theologians has ever been found to be unassailable  to me this is adequate evidence that the _real_god_ is undefinable or at least no definition has yet been found to be watertight which in turn i accept as sufficient to base a disbelief in each and every conceivable god  i'm a little fuzzy on the edges though so opinions are welcome but perhaps we should change the thread subject   lucio de re lucio@proximaaltza  tab stops at four " confidence="0.2" support="20" types="" sparql="" policy="whitelist">
