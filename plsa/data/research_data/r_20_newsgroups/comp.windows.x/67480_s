stimpy we may have to send it back to the x server bit by bit  dvx will do its level best to only redraw that small area but in some unusual cases the entire screen may need to be  repainted  assuning a 1024x768 screen with 4 bits per pixel that's 3145728 bits that has to be sent  worst possible case you're looking at about 50 seconds in reality it would never be this bad since the screen will always have parts  that will be tranlatable into higher level x calls    it all really depends on what the programs are doing ie you're going to see a slowdown from xbandwidth a lot sooner if your apps are all doing network things also    what do you mean by network things  i vision using ms windows and other windows applications over the network were the processes are running on the server and all i am getting are the displays  i am wondering how  good is the x and subsequently dvx protocol in transferring these  images with xcalls and displaying them on a client's machine  x was designed from the ground up to be efficient across a network  it's  pretty good for this  x programs are best dos text programs are almost as good since we conert them to x easily  something like winx is a hybrid we intercept the calls windows makes to it's graphics driver mouse driver keyboard driver and convert them to x  the calls windows is making are in no way designed to be efficient on a packet switched network  we go to a  lot of trouble to convert them to the highes level xlib calls we can but we are somewhat limited because we only know what windows and its applications tell us  ++ |   quarterdeck office systems                    _____________________   | |         gary rich  problem resolution dept    ___________________\  | |  _____________________________________________  _________________\  | |   anonymous ftp site = qdeckcom                _______________\  | |          for          write to      _____________\  | |    pricingordering info   info@qdeckcom      ___________\  | |     technical questions   support@qdeckcom    _________\  | |         quarterdeck bbs  310 3143227        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\  | ++  " confidence="0.2" support="20" types="" sparql="" policy="whitelist">
