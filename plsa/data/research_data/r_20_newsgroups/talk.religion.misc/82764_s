<Annotation text=" someone writes i found a list of biblical contradictions and cleaned it up a bit but now i'd like some help with it    i'm curious to know what purpose people think these lists serve lists like this seem to value quantity over quality an argument from article length  and the list you have here is of poorer quality than most  since the quotes seem to be taken from an online bible i doubt that there will be much problem with verses quoted inaccurately  but that isn't the problem here  i've known a lot of fundamentalists in my life but none who denied that there were errors in transmission etc  and many of the contradictions here  solomon having 40000 horse stalls in one verse and 4000 in another  are just the sort of contradiction that fundies don't have a problem with in my experience  so how do these sorts of contradictions amount to anything more than attacking a straw man  some of the others are just silly or rely on taking quotes out of context or have reasonable explanations  but even the ones that are genuine contradictions need to have more said about them than what is given here  at the very least some effort should be made to understand and respond to the common replies given by fundies  look for example at the research that dave butler put into an article examining a false prophecy about tyre that would be an excellent start for an antiinerrancy list that would have some teeth  one wellresearched and documented contradiction is worth more than one hundred quotes taken out of context and thrown together in a list  lists like this that just toss a bunch of quotes together to make a bible verse salad just don't cut it  those of us who want to argue against inerrancy should find this sort of thing as embarassing as the fundies should find josh mcdowell  dj  ps you can find some good material at ftprutgersedu in pubsocreligionchristianotherscontradictions  the quality is very uneven on both sides of the argument it is just a compilation of things many people have written but some of it would be useful in an antiinerrancy faq  after exams i might be willing to help put it together " confidence="0.2" support="20" types="" sparql="" policy="whitelist">
