(if they are real sources at &gt;all, some are not.)  when will they ever learn to do real research, instead of &gt;believing the drivel sold in the christian bookstores. &gt; &gt;rh&gt; righto, dan, try this one with your cornflakes... &gt; &gt;rh&gt; the book says that muhammad was either a liar, or he was &gt;rh&gt; crazy ( a  modern day mad mahdi) or he was actually who he &gt;rh&gt; said he was. some reasons why he wouldn't be a liar are as &gt;rh&gt; follows.  who would  die for a lie?  wouldn't people be able &gt;rh&gt; to tell if he was a liar?  people  gathered around him and &gt;rh&gt; kept doing it, many gathered from hearing or seeing  how his &gt;rh&gt; son-in-law made the sun stand still.  call me a fool, but i &gt;rh&gt; believe  he did make the sun stand still.   &gt;rh&gt; niether was he a lunatic.  would more than an entire nation &gt;rh&gt; be drawn  to someone who was crazy.  very doubtful, in fact &gt;rh&gt; rediculous.  for example  anyone who is drawn to the mad &gt;rh&gt; mahdi is obviously a fool, logical people see  this right &gt;rh&gt; away. &gt;rh&gt; therefore since he wasn't a liar or a lunatic, he must have &gt;rh&gt; been the  real thing.   &gt; &gt;nice rebutal! &gt; &gt;                   alan &gt; " confidence="0.2" support="20" types="" sparql="" policy="whitelist">
