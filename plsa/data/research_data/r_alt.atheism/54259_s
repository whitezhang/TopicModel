<Annotation text="  br&gt; from: wpr@atlanta.dg.com (bill rawlins) br&gt; newsgroups: alt.atheism br&gt; organization: dgsid, atlanta, ga  br&gt;         the problem is that most scientists exclude the br&gt; possibility of the         supernatural in the question of br&gt; origins.  is this is a fair premise?         i utterly br&gt; reject the hypothesis that science is the highest form of    br&gt;      truth.  it is better than the crap that the creationists put out.  so far all they have been able to manage is distortions and half-truths. (when they are not taking quotes out of context...)  br&gt;         some of these so-called human-like creatures were br&gt; apes.  some were         humans.  some were fancifully br&gt; reconstructed from fragments.   the genetic code has shown more about how man is realted to primates that the fossil record.  (a little detail the creationists try and ignore.)  br&gt;            good deeds do not justify a person in god's br&gt; sight.            an atonement (jesus) is needed to atone br&gt; for sin.  who says?  your bible(tm)?&#9;i would be surprised if *any* christian followed all of the rules in the bible.  (most of them just pick and choose, according to the local biases.)  br&gt;      my point: god is the creator.  look's like we agree.  where is your proof?  how do you know it was *your* god?  br&gt;      i'll send you some info via e-mail. br&gt;      regards, bill.  why not post them?&#9;i would be interested in seeing them myself.                     alan  " confidence="0.2" support="20" types="" sparql="" policy="whitelist">
