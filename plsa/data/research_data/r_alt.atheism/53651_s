(consider, for instance, that speed-of-light-in- &gt;vacuum is invariant.  this sounds an awful lot like an objective &gt;speed-of-light-in-vacuum.) &gt;--  or, you can try not confuse a construct with the constructor.  if you take a look at quantum mechanics, many objective observations can be made as well.  however, physics is not objective.  bohr said the randomness of atomic motion is inherent in the motion itself.  einstein said that  nature is deterministic; it is our method of observation that inserts the randomness.  they were talking about the exact same results.  depends on how you look at it, i guess.  --   jim halat         halat@bear.com      bear-stearns       --whatever doesn't kill you will only serve to annoy you--    nyc             i speak only for myself     " confidence="0.2" support="20" types="" sparql="" policy="whitelist">
