[some stuff deleted]  +interesting (and scary) no?  they went on to say how the jews had  +killed their god, and how in the end of time that all the races would +go to their homelands (of course, they would remain in america, which +is new jeruselem, as it says in gen 2??? (what another kid said) but +the rest of the races would go home) and then the great battle or plague +or whatever revel. says would happen, and the jews would be killed. + +the most interesting thing about this was that my roomate is catholic,  +and had the kjv of the bible on his desk.  he immediatly opened it up +and began to search for the quoted passages (gen, rev, and john) to  +look for himself, and couldn't find what they said they saw.  i don't +know  i saw this show a while back, and when i heard these kids quote the bible to justify their racist claims, i looked up that quote about jesus hating jews (since jesus himself was a jew, my curiousity had been piqued by such a claim). the jist of the passage (and i am sorry but i can't recall which passage it was exactly) was that jesus was condemning the pharisees for being corrupt. of course, the pharisees were jewish too, but it wasn't jews as a whole that jesus was condemning, just the powers that be.  -- nancy o'connor&#9;&#9; + psychology undergrad     +         the opinions i express simon fraser university, +         are my own. burnaby, b.c.            + canada&#9;&#9;&#9; + " confidence="0.2" support="20" types="" sparql="" policy="whitelist">
