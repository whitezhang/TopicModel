TENNENT's Lager today announces plans for a new service that will ensure punters looking for a quick pint need only go as far as their own kitchen sink.
The scheme, called T-Tap, will allow lager fans to pour themselves Scotland’s favourite pint straight out of a tap in their own home.
Lager will be piped direct from Tennent’s world famous Wellpark Brewery in Glasgow, giving those who opt in to the service the options of hot water, cold water or Tennent’s on tap at their kitchen sinks.
The first phase of T-Tap will see homes situated within two miles of the brewery getting lager on tap by the summer.
Tennent’s hopes that fans will be gushing about the new service across the country, with plans to roll out from the borders up to the Highlands of Scotland by 2018 already well advanced.
Tennent’s are confident that the service will also be popular overseas and are currently in talks with council officials in Europe about the launch of ‘Le Tap’ in Paris, and ‘Das Tap’ in Berlin.
Jane Cannon, Tennent’s Lager Marketing Manager added: “Everyone loves a pint at the pub, but if you can’t make it out and still fancy a cold one, the T-Tap is the perfect solution.
&quot;The idea of Tennent’s straight from a tap in your home is something we’ve been working on for a while now and we’re thrilled to be rolling out the first phase in Glasgow 2015.
&quot;Research revealed there was huge support for the T-Tap, and we’re confident lager fans will go with the flow and sign up!”
