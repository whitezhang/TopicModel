A FAMILY who faced being torn apart by &shy;immigration chiefs were given fresh hope yesterday.
 Scot Martin McGuire and his American fiancee Mary Beard were previously told she could be deported back to the US within a fortnight . 
But after an appeal hearing in Glasgow, the couple have been told the deportation order by a judge in London has been “set aside”.
They have been advised to apply for a new visa, which under current rules would give Mary “a 10-year route to settlement”.
The couple, who have been engaged for three years, have a daughter Molly, two.
Mary has a second child, Brianna, five, from a previous &shy;relationship. She calls Martin “dad” but faced being departed with her mum.
Yesterday, Martin, 30, and Mary, 27 – whose plight was first highlighted by the  – said they were “happy but confused”.
Martin said: “The judge in Glasgow told us he wasn’t giving us any &shy;guarantees but in his view we would meet ‘little or no impediments’ if we applied for a new visa.
“We are very confused about it but are pleased that we have another avenue to explore and above all the family won’t be split up for the time being.
“I’m happy because it could have been much worse.”
Now the cash-strapped couple will have to pay more than &pound;1000 for a new visa.
Mary said: “On one hand, I’m happy the Home Office have alerted us to a new way to hopefully be granted a visa.
“On the other, we’re back in limbo and don’t have any guarantees. I feel like this isn’t a step forward or a step back, more like a step sideways.
“I’m happy we are still together for now. It’s a very hard thing to deal with emotionally. You’re relieved but still anxious.
“But thanks to the  for everything you’ve done for our family. Hopefully this next visa will be the last.”
