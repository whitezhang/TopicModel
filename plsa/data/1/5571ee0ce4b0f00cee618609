SCOTLAND'S ski resorts are gearing up for a bumper Easter weekend.
Recent days have seen fresh snow on hills, providing excellent runs at some of the country’s centres.
And the unseasonal conditions are expected to attract thousands of winter sports enthusiast.
At the Nevis Range, more than 18 inches of snow has fallen in the last seven days while almost 2ft has come down at Glencoe, creating excellent conditions for boarders and skiers.
Nevis Range managing director Marian Austin said: “The situation is very good. It snowed a lot earlier this week for three or four days really and packed in a lot of new snow on to the runs.
“We’d love to think there would be a few thousand boarders and skiers but it’s hard to get people to realise that there’s snow at this time of year.
“We’re certainly expecting a couple of thousand over the weekend but we don’t expect to be that busy because people are doing other things.
“It’s a great opportunity for people to ski when it’s so quiet and with good conditions.”
Angela Dingwall, the resort manager at Glencoe, said: “The conditions are very good at the minute. We’re expecting thousands over the weekend, especially on Sunday.
“For this time of year it’s great. On the same date last year we weren’t that busy, but it wasn’t very nice.”
Nevis and Glencoe are holding an Easter fun day tomorrow, including an egg roll at 2150ft at Nevis.
At CairnGorm Mountain the Ptarmigan Slopestyle jam will be taking place.
CairnGorm marketing manager Ross Coulter said: “We are hoping Saturday is going to be a pretty big day.
“The slopestyle are our biggest competitions of the year so it’s working out well with the snow over the last few days.”
However, not all of Scotland’s ski centres have had as much fresh snow. At the Lecht, a spokeswoman said: “We will have a few runs open if we can hold on to the snow we have. Visitors should check the website.”
