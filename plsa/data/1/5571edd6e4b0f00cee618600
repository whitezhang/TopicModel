An inmate has died after he allegedly tried to attack five prison officers.
Warders were forced to restrain 30-year-old Allan Marshall who it’s claimed became violent at Edinburgh’s Saughton Prison.
Jail bosses fear he may have taken a lethal legal high which sparked his outburst.
Toxicology tests are being carried out as part of the police death probe.
After the clash, Marshall was rushed to the city’s Royal Infirmary with breathing difficulties.
 

He fell into a coma and died last Saturday after a five-day battle for life.
It’s understood all five officers suffered injuries, including bites, while restraining him.
Sources say Marshall’s violent conduct was out of character. He had no record of violence and was said to be a model prisoner.
An inquiry has been launched by Police Scotland, the Scottish Prison Service and the Crown Office into Marshall’s death, which is being treated as unexplained.
A prison source said: “He appears to have acted in a very uncharacteristic and violent way. He certainly put up a fierce fight and for no apparent reason.
“We do not know whether or not he took something, but there is a suspicion that he did.”
Marshall ran his own business, Marshall PART Recycling in Govan, Glasgow, and he was awaiting trial after an incident outside a nightclub in Hamilton.
At the time of his arrest he was on bail for an unrelated incident involving a former partner. He had several convictions for minor offences.
His solicitor Matthew Berlow said yesterday: “I am very shocked to hear about this.
“Allan was essentially a good person. He had ongoing matters which I was dealing with but they were not of a serious nature.”
Yesterday Marshall’s partner Maryanne Stewart declined to comment. No other members of his family could be contacted.
Tributes on Facebook included one from brother Jamie, 24, who said: “Gone far too soon, my brother, but now your suffering has ended and one day we will meet again.”
