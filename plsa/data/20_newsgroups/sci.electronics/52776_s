 no, it is independent of the speedometer. the gun processes two doppler
 returns--the speed of the car relative to the pavement and the speed
 of the target, taking the difference between the two. some guns with
 a "moving mode" actually have a split beam with one beam aimed
 preferentially at the pavement.
 
 car and driver had a good article on traffic radar, but it was back in
 1985. i used its contents and references to defend myself against a bogus
 radar-measured ticket. it detailed "moving mode," which is easier to
 defend against because of the increased amount of variables.
