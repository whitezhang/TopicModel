           and of course you older folks on the net will remember 
           way back when adcom got its rave reviews and kudos (ca 
           1985  or  so)  their  555 amp and preamp were not only 
           designed here but built here in  the  usa.  then  they 
           went  to  mexico  and then to taiwan right after their 
           sales  skyrocketed   because   of   their   stereopile 
           review!!!  if you have units that old look for made in 
           --- stickers on your unit.
