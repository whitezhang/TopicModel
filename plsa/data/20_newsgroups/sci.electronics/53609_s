 this is vague, so i am posting it in case anyone else knows more.
 
 i recall reading of a phonograph which used mechanical amplification.
 compressed air was squirted out of a valve which was controlled by the
 pickup.  the result was noisy and distinctly lo-fi, but much louder
 than a conventional phonograph.  it tended to wear the disks out
 pretty quickly though.
