 i think the hangup with digital scopes is that you have to know so much
 more about them and how they work on a scope-by-scope basis, and
 some of the functions are typically presented, in my opinion,
 in a counter-intuitive fashion (hp has made some strides in their
 54600 series, imo). automatic setups are fine for simple,
 repetitive waveforms, but can give you some crazy results on more
 complex events where you need to understand how the scope is
 actually measuring/processing the event. for example, is the scope
 in "equivalent time" or in "real time" sampling mode (equivalent time
 being a mode where samples are built-up slowly by adding a delay to
 the trigger event each sweep)? what was the scope's actual sampling
 rate at the time? how is the data being massaged after capture but
 before display, etc. one common misconception is the speed of the scope.
 
 is the hp scope you're using really a 100 mhz scope? or is it a 20 mhz
 sample rate scope (~5 mhz single shot significance) whose front
 end including s/h can support 100 mhz waveforms (important for
 equivalent time sampling)? the 100 mhz input in this case really
 only helps you when your waveform is repetitive, or on a single
 sample, when you get lucky and hit a transient event during a sample time.
 
 so, there are a lot more variables in understanding how to get
 useful information from a digital scope. i prefer an analog scope for
 general use and the digital for events where i need storage for
 later analysis or comparison, when the event is within the capability
 of the scope. now, for the price of true 100 mhz digital scopes to
 fall...
