 are you sure that he needs a two way converter? if he wants only
 rs232->ttl i would suggest the mc1489, its very cheap (0.80 dm in
 germany). this chip needs only +5v. the mc1488 ttl->rs232-converter
 uses +12v and -12v.
 
 btw... the max232 and compatibles seem to be expensive in the usa...
 i paid 2.95 dm for a its80272 (made by harris), its absolutely
 compatible with the max232 or the icl232.
