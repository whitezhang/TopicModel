  
         on an a/d board i've got, i'm using the a/d lines.  it measures 
 the voltages properly, ie: with a 7v power supply it reg's 7v and with 
 5v, it reg's 5v.  problem is when i've got the input voltage, and i wish 
 to lower it via a resistor.  the sensitivity of the board is so great 
 that i can triger it with holding the 5/7v wire in one hand, and touch 
 the probe and it will register the full input voltage.  a 1m resistor 
 only lowers voltage by .1v so this is not too feesable. 
  
                 what could the problems be and what else could i use
 to lower the input voltage?  (btw i've got it grounded correctly)
