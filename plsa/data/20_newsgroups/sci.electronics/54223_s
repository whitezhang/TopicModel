 the lead-acid secondary cell releases energy (electricity) with the following
 chemical reaction:
  
 pb + pbo2 + 2h2so4 --> 2pbso4 + 2h20
  
 lead and lead (iv) oxide and sulfuric acid produce lead sulfate and water
  
 the standard heats of formation at 25 c (77 f) of the various compounds are:
  
               heat of formation
 compound      at 25 c, kcal/mole
 --------      ------------------
    pb               0.00
   pbo2            -65.0
  h2so4           -193.69
  pbso4           -218.5
   h20             -68.3174
  
 the heat of reaction at 25 c is therefore -60.6 kcal per mole pbso4 produced.
 note that lead sulfate is not very soluble (0.0048 grams per 100 grams water
 at 25 c), and it will thus precipitate out of solution where the reaction is
 occurring, or the cathode (positive terminal) of the battery.  (i am almost
 sure it is the positive terminal where the precipitate forms, but i may be
 wrong.  oh well, i don't have a corroded battery to corrobate, and i don't feel
 like thinking through it right now.)
  
 what is important to notice here is that the reaction, as you knew it would be,
 is exothermic, or energy discharging.  if moisture with dissolved electrolytes
 (acid rain) condenses on the battery, a conductive path between the terminals
 may form.  this will discharge the battery as the chemical reaction proceeds.
 the reaction is reversible, if electricity (from an alternator or battery
 charger) is put back into the battery.
  
 lead-acid batteries must change in chemical composition to discharge.  each
 cell has all the reactants necessary for the reaction.  the non-reacting posts
 (terminals) of the lead-acid battery are there to remove (or add) electric
 energy during a discharge (or charge).  because the reaction is exothermic, it
 has a tendency to happen, though quite slowly under normal circumstances.  so
 while keeping the battery dry is a good idea, it is not a total solution.
  
 to understand why lead-acid batteries do indeed discharge faster when stored on
 concrete as opposed to wood or earth (dirt), one should recall lechatelier's
 principle, which can be paraphrased as:  anything subjected to some stress will
 act to move to a more comfortable position.  here are the thermal conductivities
 of a some selected materials:
  
                                               thermal conductivity

 maple (across grain)            50                   0.11
  
 note that the thermal conductivity for "dirt" (diatomaceous earth) goes down
 with temperature.  also, 204 c is about 400 k, and the values for earth powder
 are on the same order of magnitude as natural earth.  the thermal conductivity
 of concrete is around a factor of 10 greater than that of dirt, and is 2-4
 times greater than wood.
  
 it is these differences in thermal conductivity that cause the battery on
 concrete to discharge faster than that on dirt or wood.  at any instant the
 discharge reaction is occurring, energy is being released, either as electricity
 or heat.  (thermal conductivity of air is about 0.015 btu/(hr-ft-ft)(f/ft).)
 during storage, except for the trickle that passes through any condensate on
 the battery, this energy is mostly released as heat.  the higher conductivity
 surface will remove the heat proportionately faster than the lower conductivity
 surface.  thus, if you perfectly insulated a dry battery on all but the bottom
 surface, at any given battery temperature above the storage surface temperature,
 the battery on a concrete surface will be discharging about 10 times faster
 than that on dirt.
  
 this is where lechatelier's principle comes into play.  removing energy from
 the exothermic reaction will drive the reaction further to completion.  if the
 reaction normally occurs at room temperature, keeping the battery at that
 temperature requires the removal of any heat produced.  a concrete surface is
 a better heat sink than a dirt or wood surface.  store a battery in the corner
 of a poured concrete basement, and you have 3 surfaces removing energy, which
 "pulls" the reaction along.
  
 also, if water evaporates from the battery, that elevates the ratio of sulfuric
 acid to water.  this will tend to drive the discharge reaction.
