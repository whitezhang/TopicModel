 triquint (beaverton, oregon), has been selling an 8 bit, 1 ghz d to a
 for several years.  i have used it and it works well, faster settling
 time and smaller glitch area than any video d dacs i have seen.  also,
 they have been developing a more precise version that may be for sale
 now - it's somewhere in the 10 to 12 bit area at 1 ghz.
