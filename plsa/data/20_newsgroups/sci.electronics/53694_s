 when the utility gave up on that cinnci, oh plant (zimmer?) and
 announced they were going to convert it to a coal-fired scheme, the
 turbines were already in place, and they were the low-temp type. so the
 plan was: install a second set of high temp turbines, and feed the
 low-temp ones with the output of the new ones.
 
 never saw anything more on this. did they ever really build it?
