 yes, you could.

 well, letsee (whipping out hp-48sx, soon to be gx): 6 inches/3*10^8 m/s=.5
 nanoseconds resolution.  hmm.  that'll be rather difficult!
 
 the more standard (read: better) method is to use ultrasound, generally
 somewhere around 40khz.  sound travels a heck of a lot slower than light
 (radio waves), and is therefore much easier to deal with.
 
 >what frequencies would be best for this? or does matter?
 
 it might be easiest to visit a hardware store and look at the numerous
 "sonic estimator" type devices that do what you want here.  many are pretty 
 cheap too -- <$30.  (in fact, for awhile the stanley estimator was selling
 for something like $8.  that's the one i bought! :-) )
