 does anyone know the details of the interface (5 wire din) for the
 ir remote sensor & (2 wire ir repeater) for the adcom gtp-500ii
 preamp?  the adcom part numbers are the xr-500ii, spm-500ii, and 
 ira-500ii.
 
 a cursory physical examination of the pre-amp connector indicates
 that the connector (5 pin din) may provide: (viewed from connector front)
 
       |
    5     1     (pin ?) +?v @ ???ma
     4   2      (pin ?) +/-?v @ ???ma
       3        (pin 3) signal ground
                (pin ?) demodulated signal ?v-pp, ? polarity, ? ma drive
                (pin ?) signal to drive repeater led (drives through 150ohm
                        resistor) ?v-pp
 
 i assume that the repeater connectors (mini-plugs) drive the ir repeater
 led's directly.  true?
 
 can anyone fill in the ?'s.  thanks.
