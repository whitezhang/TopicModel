 no, the 6551a is able to operate in a 2 mhz system, the 6551 can only
 take 1 mhz without problems.
 
 if you see a 8551 made by mos or csg, take it, its a 6551a.

 i know no fixed version of the 6551. there are different possibilities
 to work around this bug. the easiest is to tie _cts to gnd and
 use _dsr or _dcd as _cts. it should be easy to fix the software,
 _dsr is bit 6 and dcd ist bit 5 of the status register (read 6551
 with rs1 = low and rs0 = high).
 
 using the _cts-line can lead into big trouble. the 6551 _instantly_
 stops transmission if _cts goes high. this means, that you may
 get only a half byte...
