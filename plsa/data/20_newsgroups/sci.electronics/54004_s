 i would like to hook up some cameras that were recently donated to our
 local community cable tv station which have sync inputs in the form
 of horizontal and vertical drive. our station sync is a black burst
 which works fine with other boxes with "genlock" style inputs. can
 anyone point me at a design, article, or whatever showing how to produce
 the horizontal & vertical drive signals? thanks in advance.
