 the father of a friend of mine is a police officer in west virginia.  not  
 only is his word as a skilled observer good in court, but his skill as an  
 observer has been tested to be more accurate than the radar gun in some  
 cases . . ..  no foolin!  he can guess a car's speed to within 2-3mph just  
 by watching it blow by - whether he's standing still or moving too!  (yes,  
 i realize that calibrated guns are more accurate than this, but . . .).   
 his ability is not that uncommon among people who watch moving things for a  
 living, i have heard . . ..
 
 so what good is a radar detector except to give you a split second warning  
 that the guy who just cut you off to pass the guy ahead and to your left  
 is about to panic stop from 85 on a crowded freeway???
