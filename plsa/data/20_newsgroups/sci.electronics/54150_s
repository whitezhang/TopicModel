 i'm doing some work on the mac iisi and need some information on the cpu.
 i have the motorola mc68030um/ad rev. 1, but i fear it is out of date as it
 does not have the characteristics for the cpu package type used in the iisi.
 
 what i need is the theta (jc) thermal characteristic (the junction to case
 thermal resistance) for the _plastic_ fe style package.
 
 if you have this info, i would appreciate your sending it by email as postings
 suffer a few days delay here.
 
 if you are keen on this stuff, i am also interested in a more accurate value
 for the typical power dissipation. i'm assuming 2.25 watts (using the 2.6 w
 maximum at 0 c decreased the way the pd drops in the 6801x as ta increases).
 if your manual has a chart of power dissipation, i'd like to know what it
 reads at 25 c and 40 c.
 
 thanks for reading!
