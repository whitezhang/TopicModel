 i am making a search for a cad program that does a decent job
 of making schematic drawings.  the program needs to be in
 ms-dos, windows if possible.
 
 what i want the cad program to do is to draw diagrams by
 dragging elements onto the screen, and in this the elements
 needed are as diverse as vacuum tubes to ics (case with pins).
 it also needs to have provision for adding legends to the
 components as well as their values.  in other words i want to
 produce quality drawings.  printout would be to either 24 pin
 dot-matrix and/or laser printer.
 
 if you know of such a cad program that is of reasonable cost,
 please respond.
