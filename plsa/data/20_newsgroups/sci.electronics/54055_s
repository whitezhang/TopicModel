    i would also be interested in the application here.  i work with a dance and
    technology program, and want to build something to track dancers on a 30 foot
    wide stage from 50 feet away.
 
 
 could make for some interesting choreography... light and sound could be 
 controlled directly by the position of a dancer on stage, or by the number
 of dancers on stage. neat.
 
 you could even build a spotlight that follows the dancer around on stage!
 
 can you tell us more about what you're doing? sounds like a very cool program.
