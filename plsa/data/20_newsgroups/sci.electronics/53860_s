  
         since i'm not all too keen on this area of hooking them up, i'm 
 asking for help.  i know better than to hook a 12v, 1a stepper line to 
 one, unless it can take it; however what about if i've got a 24-60v 
 stepper.  what sort of curent limmiting circuitry would be involved (a 
 small schematic would probably be helpfull).  
         also, i've looked into the tipc2701n by ti, and i was wondering 
 if i should use the same suggested (by you replying to this message) 
 current limiting circuitry on each of the 7 mosfets in the package as 
 that illustrated in the schematic (which you the replyer would hopefully 
 help me with).
  
                                 ... hmm... different request... 
  
                 thanks.
