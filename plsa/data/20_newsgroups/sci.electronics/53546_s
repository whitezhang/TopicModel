 paper, and i read that one researcher flashed hidden messages on the
 tv screen at 1/200ths of a second.  is that possible?  i thought the
 maximum rate the tv was even capable of displaying images was 1/30th
 of a second.  (or 1/60th of a second for an image composed of only odd
 or even scan lines)
