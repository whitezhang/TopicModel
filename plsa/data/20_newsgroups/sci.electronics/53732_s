 for your information:
 
 i hooked up my imagewriter i to my com1 serial port and used the c-itoh
 8510 driver in windows 3.1.  the cable i am using is a straight-thru
 cable connected to a null modem adapter i got at radio shack (catalog
 #26-1496a) for $4.95.  it seems to work fine with both dos and windows.
 i used the following command in dos
 
 	c:\dos\mode com1:9600,n,8,1,p
 
 and set up the port the same way in the windows ports setup.
 
 the null modem connections are as follows:
 
 	1	to	1
 	2	to	3
 	3	to	2
 	4	to	5
 	5	to	4
 	6+8	to	20
 	20	to	6+8
 	7	to	7
 
 i printed from several applications and all seems ok.
