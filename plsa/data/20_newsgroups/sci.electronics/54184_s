 
 	here is a list i get when i was combing through some microfilm one
 day here at drexel while completely board.  most of these circuits are
 pretty easy to constuct and can be done by a novice.
 	this is basically some stuff that could prove useful to you without
 having to sit down and either design or buy the stuff (not a good word, but i'm
 tired right now).
 	hope you enjoy!
 
 	if you have any additions send them to me and i'll add them to the list
 .  they don't have to be from this particular magazine, they just have to be
 interesting!

 -- from what i could see, you can order the circuit kits, finished or unfinished
 	or you can order the parts that you can't get through a normal store
