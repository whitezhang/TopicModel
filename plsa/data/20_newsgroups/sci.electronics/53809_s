 check out xicor's new goodie in the april 12th edition of eetimes
 x88c64 - an 8k * 8 e2prom with built in latch and bootloader setup.
 you hook it directly to your '51, power it up, the prom initialises the
 serial port on the '51, you load in your code via rxd, this gets blatted
 onto the e2prom, then you reset and run - i'm sure dallas also does
 something like this too, i suppose it would boil down to relative
 prices, and the dallas part freeing up p0 & p2 completely. i wonder
 if anyone has ever managed to design a single sided pcb with an
 8051, 573, eprom, sram and >>no links<< ?
 cheers
 mike.
