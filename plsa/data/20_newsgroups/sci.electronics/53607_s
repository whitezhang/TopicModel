 we have a setup with with 13 polaroid transducers and rangefinders. we
 would like to fire these three at a time with about 5 ms between
 firings. the three that are being fired do not fire in the same
 direction. 
 
 to further explain the situation, assume we are firing sonars a,b,c
 5 ms apart each other. we should normally see an echo on a that
 corresponds to the distance. however, sonar a detects the init line
 of sonar b! the detection is actually through the transducer of sonar a;
 we can see a very faint 50khz signal on the transducer, exactly at the
 time the init line of sonar b is activated. 
 
 we feel that there is some ground coupling that is causing this interference.
 we came to this conclusion since we are using a separate power supply
 for sonars b and c. 
 
 has anyone else had any problems with these particular units and
 this type of experience? your suggestions for remedies will be greatly
 appreciated.
