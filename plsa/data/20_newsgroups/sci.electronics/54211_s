 i recently took apart my color sony tv to clean the volume pushbuttons and
 when i put the beast back together, the flyback whine got much louder.
 
 is this easy to fix? which part is resonating? i have heard rumors of a
 spray that will fix the noise.  is this a simple thing for a tv repairman
 to fix?
 
 	thanks,
