 my beckman died a few days ago, thanks do about a 4 or 5 foot drop onto a
 lab table.  !@#!@$#!@$@#$  probably not indicative of anything, but i've
 already filled out the requisition for a fluke 87. :-)
 
 oh yeah, and sometimes our measurements here do count.  not often, but often
 enough that i want at least _one_ good meter!
