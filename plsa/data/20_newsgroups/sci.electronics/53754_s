 it appears as if the problem is related to the 68882/50's need for very fast
 (and clean) signal transitions.  i got some email (vielen dank, thomas) stating
 that motorola provides a solution for this problem in their 68030 manual.  
 since my manual (1989) predates the 50 mhz 68030/68882s i couldn't find it.
 could someone please email me the specifics?
 		thanks
