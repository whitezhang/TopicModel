 if you can modify the design of the dtmf decoder, the ideal comunications
 would be over a multi-drop system, like rs-485.  rs-485 boards are available
 for pc's, probably cheaper than a bunch of rs-232 channels, and rs-485 is
 cheaper to build onto your satellite modules, using only a single supply
 8-pin dip driver chip.  software at the pc end would be similarly complex
 for either rs-232 or rs-485, in my opinion.  the higher data rates possible
 with rs-485 would permit quasi-simultaneous data transmission.
 hope this helps.
