 good point...also, i wouldn't be surprised that the components
 they use off-shore are of inferior quality.  as long as it was
 properly designed and robust, premium components are used, it
 shouldn't matter where it is assembled.

 an amp that runs hot has no bearing on how it's gonna sound.
 the amp you have probably is running class-a the whole day.
 
 actually, i'd be wary of excessively hot amps, 'cauz even though
 the components inside may be rated to run that way, excessive 
 heat will dramatically shorten the life of *any* electronic component
 regardless of quality.  in fact, an amp that does run hot to the touch is
 because either the engineer or manufacturer of that amp wanted
 to skimp on heatsinking or cooling to save costs!  hmmmmm....
