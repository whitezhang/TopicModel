 well, the fastest, crudest mixer (aside from just physically connecting
 all your inputs together directly) is to run each signal through a 
 resistor to a common output.  the resistors give some isolation so the
 signal sources aren't driving directly into each other. 
 
 taking a wild, seat-of-the-pants guess, i'd say that if you are mixing
 high-impedance sources like some dynamic mikes, electric guitar pickups,
 etc., your resistors ought to be maybe 5k - 10k or so.  if you are mixing
 line-level stuff or the outputs of a walkman, or such, i'd go with 1k.
 
 input 1 --/\/\/\/ -------------+--- output
                                |
 input 2 --/\/\/\/\-------------+
                                |
 input 3 --/\/\/\/\-------------+
