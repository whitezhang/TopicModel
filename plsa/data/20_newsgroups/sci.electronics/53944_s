 you can learn how to build a deyhdrator very easily from the book, "the
 hungry hiker's guide to good food," by gretchen mchugh.  the heat source
 is a 100 watt light bulb.  basically, it's a vertical wooden box with
 ventilation holes in the top and bottom (lots of them, you want the air
 to flow).  the light bulb goes in the bottom, and wire cake racks are
 spaced every 6" starting about 10" above the bulb.
 
 or, at a slightly higher cost in electricity, you can do what i do:  use
 your oven.  (note - i do this in an electric oven; some gas ovens may
 not have a low enough setting).  put food to be dried on cookie tins or
 racks in the oven.  set oven to 140 degrees (the lowest setting on my
 oven - if yours goes down to 120 that's probably even better.)  stick a
 wooden spoon or something across the front corner of the oven and close
 the door on the spoon so that it stays open about an inch - this allows
 for airflow.  leave the stuff in the oven for 6 to 8 hours; check it
 often, since this dries it much faster than the dehydrator.  if you are
 using cookie sheets instead of racks, turn the stuff over halfway
 through.
 
 if you want more info, e-mail me since this isn't really the right sub
 for this stuff.
