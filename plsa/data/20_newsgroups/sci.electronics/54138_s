 i'm looking for some specs for a toshiba ta6267-bp.  it appears
 to be a power amp housed in a 7-pin inline package and is used
 in my mitsubishi vcr, circa 1985, as a dc motor controller for
 the tape drive.
 
 checking in the oldest ic master i have (1990), i don't see it
 listed, and it appears to have been discontinued.  if anyone
 has anything on this part, i'd be *greatly* indebted!
 
 thanks in advance,
 
 aaron
