 
    i looking for someone with the schematics to a technics 1200
 turntable -- i need to get a hold of them as soon as possible 
 (by fax maybe?) or is there someone out there who has experienced:
 	- a platter that spins backwards slowly
 	- a strobe that goes out then flickers if the platter is
 spinning?
 
 get in contact with me as soon as possible
