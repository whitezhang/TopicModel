 i've found this works pretty well on noisy laminated power
 transformer cores and windings (the 60hz kind). likewise, if
 anybody has tried this on a flyback i'd like to hear about it.
 
 i would suspect it would not be as effective as it was on power
 transformers as the material wouldn't damp as well--something
 i suspect would be critical at the frequencies involved (in other
 words, you want absorption rather than prevention which would be
 real difficult at 15 khz).
