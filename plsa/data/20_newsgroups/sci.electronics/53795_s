 i was looking at the amps diagram for sony 1090/2090 receivers, and i
 was amazed to find a difference between the us and canadian model
 on the capacitor(s) that hangs off the output to the speakers:
 
                          ------\/\/\----- to speaker (identical both models
 from amp ---------------|
 (idnetical both models) >
                         <  10 
                         >
                         |
                        -----                        
                       |     |                        
         0.022        ---   ---        canadian model only!
      us model        ---   --- 0.047 
      and world-wide   |     |
      model only.      |    ---        candian model only!
                       |    ---  0.047
                       |     |
                        ----------- gound
 
 the board itself is also identical, with room for all three caps. the
 us/can versions is clearly indicated in both places.
 
 how does that make sense? 0.047/2 is 0.0235, essentially 0.022 for caps
 (there are just standard caps, no special w/type/precision). 
 
 please explain this
