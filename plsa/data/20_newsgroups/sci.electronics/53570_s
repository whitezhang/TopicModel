 water. nuclear stations don't generate electricity directly from the
 reactor, they use the reactor to generate heat. the heat is then used to
 heat water just as in a conventional oil or coal station, and the
 resultant steam drives the turbines.
 
 the cooling towers are used to cool the steam and recondense it into water
 to continue the cycle
