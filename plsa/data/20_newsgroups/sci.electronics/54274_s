     i have a mystery part labeled nec ac100.  it's from the low voltage
 supply of an nec multisync i monitor.  it's a three lead part in a
 square package like a volate regulator or power transistor.  the board
 is labeled cr691 where the part goes.  (possibly an scr?)  the pin
 labeled g on the board goes to a zener diode (reference voltage?); the
 pin labeled t1 goes to the negative lead of a capacitor in the power
 supply, and the pin labeled t2 goes to the negative side of the bridge
 rectifier in the supply.
 
     if anyone can tell me what this is, or better yet, where i can buy
 one just like it, please email me at ck3i@andrew.cmu.edu.  i've called
 nec's "monitor repair number" and not only do they not know what the
 part is, but they don't think that they can find one to sell to me... 
 it makes no sense to me...
 
 thanks
