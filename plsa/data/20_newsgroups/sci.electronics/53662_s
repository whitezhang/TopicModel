 a verrrrrry long time, like on the order of days.  i had the pleasure of
 doing that once (playing with the speedo cable) and with my b&d heavy duty at
 full speed (600 rpm) all the speedo ever got up to was 30 mph.  now if you go
 a high speed drill and ran it at say 4000 rpm, you could get 200 mph out of
 it.  (if you speedo doesn't burn out.)  anyways, to roll a 100000 mile
 odometer would take 22 days or so.  much easier just to take the speedo
 apart.
 
 thought i'd share.  btw, all this info was obtained legally  :-)
