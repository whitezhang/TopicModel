 the only explanation i can think of is that two capacitors in series
 can handle twice the output voltage. sometimes two elco's in antiseries
 (you know, positive sides facing eachother) are used to obtain a large
 capacitor that can handle positive and negative voltages as well.
 
 so there probably is no design-philosophical reason, but a production-cost
 one.
