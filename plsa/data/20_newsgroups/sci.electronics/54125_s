 there are a number of inaccuracies here:
 1) in fact, a colder battery will self-discharge more slowly.  this is why
    batteries should be stored in a cool, dry place.
 2) an battery placed on concrete does not become colder than one placed
    on wood.  the battery, the wood, and the concrete will all be at the
    same general temperature (ignoring temperature fluctuations) and thus
    none will effect the other.

 there is no need to 'exercise' the battery.  just keep it charged.  (a trickle
 charger will do the job.)
