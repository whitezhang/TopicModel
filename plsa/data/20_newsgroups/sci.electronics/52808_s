 just a suggestion:
 take a motorola mc14536b set it up to give you a pulse once every sec or ten
 secs with either a rc or xtal clock input. then feed to a mc14521b as clock
 input and decode output for 1,209,600 sec output ,might have to add a few 'and'
 gates or decoder chips to get output and reset pulse back to the'521 to restart
 cycle... trigger a oneshot from the decoded riseing edge ;the one shot then
 goes to a mosfet to drive the mechanism to fire the pellet launcher..
 these ckts require uamps of current,between 5 - 15 volts, so a 12 volt
 gel cell of a few amphours would last the six weeks.
 then take the ckt board & battery wrap in 3" or 4" of foam or build a box
 of out of the stuff...with plywood or metal exterior...
 build a small heater out of 10-50 watt resistors in series to keep the battery
 and ckts warm.
 2nd thought use 2 batteries one for heater one for timer and pellet trigger.
 
 insolate-insolate.......even though the chips state that the - al
 rated devices are good to -55 c.. the batteries have a considerable reduction
 in capacity...oh make sure the area inside has minium air leakage..
 
 hope this helps
