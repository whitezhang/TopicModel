 from what i know, protection is necessary, esp. if you plan to route
 the cables into an unknown environment (out of your control). things
 like accidental shorts between the signal lines and power cables, or
 even lightning strikes are very likely and i don't think you like to see
 the sight of your computer going up in smoke! [even ethernet cards are
 protected. i've looked at the one in my pc and the connector is
 protected by a gas discharge tube!]
 
 {but if you plan to use the serial cables for internal routings (i.e. in
 controlled environments), it should be reasonably safe not to have
 them.}
 
 suggestion: look in the rs data book. they have several rs232
 transceivers that have overvoltage protection. among them include the
 lt1080, lt1081 and max250 and max251. the maxims are suppose to be
 electrically isolated ones but still need opto-isolators to work (don't
 ask me why. i've never used them before.
 
 another alternative is an rs232 surge protector. two are listed in the
 rs catalogue. if you need additional info (i.e. stock nos.), just e-mail
 me.
