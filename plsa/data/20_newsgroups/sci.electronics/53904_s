 well, they claim they are the only radio broadcaster with this
 information.  but the city's cable channel (35 in cablevision areas)
 shows this information map during travel times (6-9am and 4-7pm, i
 believe).  most of the major la freeways are covered.  the
 computer-generated map shows green, yellow, red, or flashing red
 (respectively: <40mph, 25-40mph, >25mph, and "incident"--i might be off
 a little on the speeds, since this is from memory).
 
 i often look at this display in the morning to see if i really want to
 fight the traffic on the sepulveda pass or work from home for a little
 while to wait for it to clear.
 
 another poster explained the origin of the information: sensors (embedded
 wire loops) in the pavement near ramps and every half mile or so.  caltrans
 has had a "big board" driven from this data in their traffic control center
 for some time.  i don't know if they are selling the data or if anyone
 with the equipment necessary for its transmission and display can have
 it.
