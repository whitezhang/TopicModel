 greetings..
 i'm a novice in this area. i'm trying to gather info. on standard
 phone line settings.
 quick questions :
       > if i just want to send out a beep over the phone lines,
         can i do it with some function generator & tie it up to
         one of those phone wires ??
       > which one of those wires should i connect to my dtmf chip
         as audio in ??
  
 any help would be much appreciated..
