 here in switzerland, the situation is exactly the same. the cable tv companies  
 even tried to stop amateur radio in switzerland in the beginning of cable  
 tv(they seem to be too stupid to know anything about international frequency  
 conferences or so). even today, they use the cheapest possible coax running  
 into problems they can't solve anymore. as bill noted, the only way is to look  
 for a solution with the neighbours *before* calling for the cable tv guys or  
 the fcc. the chance to find neighbours with some sense for reason is by far  
 bigger than with these people (especially the first ones). as anywhere in an  
 administration people don't like, if you tell them to work for the money they  
 get...
 the problem is, that radio amateurs don't have the power to put trough their  
 rights in all cases. so let's hope they start soon with optical fibers and get  
 out of our freqencies.
