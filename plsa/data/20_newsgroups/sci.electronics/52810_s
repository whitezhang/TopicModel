 i got a question from my dad which i really can't answer and i'd appreciate
 some net.wisdom.
 
 his question is about some 18-24" diameter balls which are attached to
 electric power lines in his area.  he's seen up to a half dozen between
 two poles.  neither of us have any experience with electric power distribution.
 my only guess was that they may be a capacitive device to equalize the
 inductance of the grid, but why so many between two poles?.
 
 anyone know what they really are?  is there a related faq for this?
 is there a better group to submit to?
 
 we'd both appreciate some enlightenment.
