 
 	where can i buy or build a device that will convert 20 ma
 current loop signals to rs232 voltages?  i know some old terminals
 came with that option, but none of the ones i own have that.  anyway,
 i want to connect a computer to this old industrial computer to use
 the computer with communications software as a console instead of
 an old decwriter.  please e-mail me if you have any info that would
 point me in the right direction.
