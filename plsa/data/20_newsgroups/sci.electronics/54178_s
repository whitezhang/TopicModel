 hi,  i have a few questions about laying out a pcb. i am using easytrax for dos
 which is a great program. but what my question is when laying out traces what
 thickness should they be? i am mainly designing low voltage low current boards
 for micro controller apps. what should pad sizes be for resistors? i will be
 turning to a commercial pcb maker to produce 1's of these boards and i was
 wondering what is the minimum distance traces should be from each other. well
 any info would be great. thanks.
