 does anyone know if a source for the tcm3105 modem chips (as used in the
 baycom and my pmp modems)?  ideally, something that is geared toward 
 hobbyists:  small quantity, mail order, etc.
 
 for years, we've been buying them from a distributor (marshall) by the
 hundreds for pmp kits.  but orders have dropped to the point where we can
 no longer afford to offer this service.  and all of the distributors i've
 checked have some crazy minimum order ($100, or so).
 
 i'd like to find a source for those still interested in building pmp kits.
 any suggestions?
