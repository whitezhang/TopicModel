 the make some amazing irled's.  the really high-powered devices are arrays of
 3, 6, or 9, led's on a to-66 header.  the 9-chip model puts out 6.5 watts in
 response to a 5 amp, 10 us. pulse at a .5% duty cycle.  i think  these are
 designed as illuminators for ir vision systems.
 
 i would also be interested in the application here.  i work with a dance and
 technology program, and want to build something to track dancers on a 30 foot
 wide stage from 50 feet away.
