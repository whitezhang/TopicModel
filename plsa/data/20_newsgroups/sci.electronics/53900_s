 ok, here could be the first question or answer or something:
 
 q: i want to copyprotect a program i wrote.  how should i do it?
 a: you would be wise not to copyprotect that program.  you see, those 
    people that wants to get a cracked copy of your program will go to 
    various length to crack your program, and some of those crackers 
    are good, and know the common tricks.
    so, the copy protection wouldn't stop those.
    ok, then.  what about legitimate users?  copy protection can be a hassle
    for legitimate users, and can hinder them in their work, expecially
    if there is some "key" item that can get lost.
    so, the copy protection wouldn't help much of the legitimate users, but
    would make life somewhat of a misery for them.
 
 
 
 (this is my opinion, and i speak as a legitimate user :-)
 you are of course free to have your opinion about this subject....
