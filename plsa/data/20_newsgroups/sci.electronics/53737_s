 this was the pathe you are thinking of, although there were other imitators.
 it didn't wear the disks any more than conventional acoustic designs, but
 it did have a high noise level due to the continual hiss of escaping air.
 there are a lot of them still operating, and they are pretty ingenious.
 
 there was a pneumatic amplifier designed by alexander graham bell, as well,
 but i don't know if it was ever constructed.
