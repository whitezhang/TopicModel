 now there's a good idea ! all you need is 20 amps dc for a few minutes, and
 a good (wetware) memory (was i using wp or autocad or ...). i thought of the
 same idea myself a few days ago. i've got a fairly new car battery that i take
 along in my 4x4 when i go camping, and it sits around useless when i'm home.
 i wish i could get a batteryless ups to use it with, or use it with a heavy
 duty 5-volt regulator to supply the pc. but i guess you'd need -5v and -12v 
 (and +12) too (2 more batteries ?).
 
 an alternative would be to leave a 40 amp battery charger hooked up to the battery
 and run a 12vdc to 110vac converter running all the time, and when the power
 goes out, voi-la ! the 110vac converter keeps on running off the battery ! and
 then i could take the 110vac converter and my computer on the camping trips !-)
