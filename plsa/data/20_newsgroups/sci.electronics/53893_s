 you were right the second time, it is knx. believe it or not, i also
 listen to knx in the evenings here in colorado! it's kind of fun driving
 through the country listening to traffic jams on the 405. back to your
 original question. yes, there are sensors just past every on-ramp and
 off-ramp on the freeways. they're the same sensors used at most stoplights
 now (coils in the pavement). you might want to give caltrans a call or
 even ask bill keene (knx's traffic reporter). i doubt if just anyone can
 get the information, but it would be worth asking just in case you can
 get it.
