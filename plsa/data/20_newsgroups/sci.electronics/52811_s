 
 	i've got an rgb mistubishi monitor and on the back it has 5
 bnc connectors labeled like this:
 
     composite
   hd          vd
   +           +        +       +       +
              sync     red    green    blue
 
 	i've used it as a straight rgb monsitor but i can't figure out
 how to use it for composite.  could someone explain what these markings
 mean?  thanks for any help.
 
 	tom
