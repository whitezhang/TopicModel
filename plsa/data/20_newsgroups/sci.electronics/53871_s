 here's the scoop.  when you get your home brew receiver working, would
 you be willing to share it with the rest of us?  i always wanted to
 build my own but never have the time to fool around and design it.
 
 pin 1:  signal ground
 pin 2:  signal
 pin 3:  always hot +6 volts
 pin 4:  +6 volts, hot only when preamp is turned on
 pin 5:  infrared repeater connectors
 
 the infrared repeater jacks on the back of the preamp are not connected
 to anything inside the preamp except the 5 pin connector pin #5.  there
 is a 150 ohm resistor between the two jacks, with a 1.5k from pin 5 to
 ground.
 
 the signal pin #2 in the preamp is summed with the built in ir receiver.
 they use a chip called cx20106a and a bjt to amplify the signal.  i would
 imagine the logical way would be to duplicate this circuit and use
 it as the external receiver.
 
 if you need more info, let me know.
