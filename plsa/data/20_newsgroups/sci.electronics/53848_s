 	yes there is.  not common for cb.  the pattern is different (sort of
 	a cloverleaf, with four main lobes.

 	use of anything under 1/4 wave for transmitting is very uncommon.  (the
 	usual "rubber duck" uses a coil to fool itself into looking like a
 	quarter wave.
 	i reccomend the arrl antenna handbook, or a good basic book.
