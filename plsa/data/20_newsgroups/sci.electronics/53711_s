 the switches have a non-negligable on resistance (up to 1k ohm when
 powered by 5 volts) and a maximum current and a maximum static
 voltage across switch.  not a good bet for ttl.  should work for
 cmos, but slow things down a bit.  there are 74hc versions that
 have better specs. but lower max voltage.
