 
 i am interfacing some simple circuits that run on 9v to my
 cpu board which runs at 5-6v.  the optoisolator is a 4n35.
 on the led side, i put the signal i want through a 10k resistor
 to the base of a 2n2222.  on the transistor side, i tie my
 cpu input line to the collector which has a pull-up resistor
 of 47k.
 
 it functions ok, but seems very slow.  i can detect pulses
 that occur at about 2khz, but not much faster.  isn't the
 rise/fall time of this device, something like 5us?  i should
 be able to detect my target of 40khz, but i can't get 16khz.
 this is done using wire-wrap and the wires going to the cpu
 and to the test pin are about 8 inches long, but i'm not
 doing anything high-speed.
 
 in the art of electronics, it mentions tying the base of the
 phototransistor to ground through a resistor to improve the
 speed.  is that what i need to do?  how do i calculate the
 resistor value?
