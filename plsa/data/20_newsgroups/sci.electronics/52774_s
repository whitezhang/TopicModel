 yes, but in a fairly reproducible way. -40 is only a smidgen of the
 distance to absolute zero. and in any case you're going to have to
 borrow freezer space from a bio lab or someone to test/calibrate this
 darling anyway. btw, you're probably going to want those big capacitors
 you found to fire the solenoid -- high current drain on frozen batteries
 can be an ugly thing.
