 you are quite correct in your understanding.  the filtering is not
 interpolation, as that would distort the frequency content of the signal
 you are listening to.  generally, these players run the samples thru an
 all-pass filter network.  i have done this for ecg waveforms from a person's
 heart, and the effect is rather spooky.  it actually reconstructs peaks
 that weren't there (correctly, too!) and fills in the gaps with the
 properly computed values, just as if there had been a real sample taken at
 that point.  i use a cpu to do all the math.  it takes a decent (but not
 unreasonable) amount of cpu time to do this.  you can keep up with things
 in realtime if you write efficient code.
 
 in case you care, the filtering method uses an fir (finite impulse response)
 filter.  i'd guess that cd makers use the same kind of method.  anybody out
 there know the real answer?  i'd say that they use a tapped delay line with
 resistor/op-amp weighting to accomplish the filtering.  this strikes me as
 the most cost effective method for volume production runs.

 actually, i think the only reason they do this is so that they can say that
 they have a marketting gimic.  i would guess that it is acutally cheaper to
 filter an oversampled signal than not.  you can use sloppier components and
 give the filter a roll-off that isn't so sharp.   it's too bad that they
 charge more for something that (i think) is actually less costly to build.
 
 i seriously doubt that the filters cost the same but are better.  they are
 built to a price spec, and that spec says "cheap as possible!".
