 
 this has been an interesting thread to follow... and obviously this group
 wasn't intended as a forum for the discussion of piracy... has anyone seen
 any estimates of the lost revenue due to pirates?  i was wondering if
 piracy is more rampant in home or corporate computing environments.  i would
 tend to think that business environment "piracy" is the major contributor to
 this form of lost revenue.  so many companies will purchase a few copies of a
 software package and then employees will internally distribute them as if they
 owned a site-license!  what do you guys think?
