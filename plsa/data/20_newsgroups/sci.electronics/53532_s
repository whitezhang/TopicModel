 paul,
 
 unfortunately, there are not too many retail outlets that'll stock
 just about every chip made.  the stuff they will stock are the ones
 that'll sell, like standard dram's, 80386's, 68000's, etc,etc.
 i.e.  i cna't think of any 'one-stop-shopping' store.
 
 the closest you can get is to pick up a copy of byte magazine or
 the circuit cellar, popular electronics, and the like and flip
 through them.
 
 distributors like wyle electronics, hamilton avnet, pioneer electronics,
 etc, etc, don't normally deal with end-users like ourselves where
 we only a couple of everything...they only deal with people who buy
 by the hundreds or more.  each distributor represents and sells a variety of
 different non-competing manufacturers.  what do i mean by this?
 suppose abc electronics sells intel 80386's.  it's a pretty good
 bet that they won't be selling any of amd's 386's, or vice-versa.
 they also can obtain just about *any* chip you want from a manufacturer
 they represent.
 
 who knows?  you might be lucky to be able to buy from one of them.
 but i'd be suprised if you do.  also bear in mind that the 1 or 2
 qty prices they will charge you will be *much* greater than what
 a mail order outlet will charge.
 
 my advice?  if you're gonna be designing anything, try to stick
 with off-the-shelf stuff.  you're going to get stuck if you use
 too many esoteric parts sooner or later.
 
 good luck,
 
 aaron
