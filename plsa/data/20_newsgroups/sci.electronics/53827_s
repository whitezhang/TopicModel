 i've had my fluke 8060a here at work for just over 10 years now.
 it is a wonderful meter.  several colleagues here have some of the
 newer fluke meters, though i still would just as soon hang on to my
 8060.  the 8060 a is the 1980s digial "analog" to the simpson 260
 analog dmm of the 1950-1960s.  there was/is (?) an 8060b that had
 extended frequency response.
 
 i've got a nifty little pen shaped meter made by soar that i keep
 in my toolbox at home.  i've had that for six or seven years now
 and only replaced the batteries a couple of timees; it is more than
 adequate for day-to-day hobby use.  i think soar oems their stuff
 for a number of vendors.  some of jdr microdevices' stuff looks
 rather similar to soar's.
