 in practice there is little difference in quality but more care is needed 
 with inkjet because smudges etc. can happen.

 a cheap laser printer does not manage that sort of throughput and on top of 
 that how long does the _first_ sheet take to print? inkjets are faster than 
 you say and in both cases the computer often has trouble keeping up with the 
 printer. (i have a 486/33 and a lot of drivers cannot keep up with the 
 printer)
 
 a sage said to me: "do you want one copy or lots of copies?", "one", 
 "inkjet".

 paper cost is the same and both can use refills. long term the laserprinter 
 will need some expensive replacement parts (consumables) and on top of that 
 are the amortisation costs which favour the lowest purchase cost printer.
 
 hp inkjets understand pcl so in many cases a laserjet driver will work if the 
 software package has no inkjet driver. 
 
 there is one wild difference between the two printers: a laserprinter is a 
 page printer whilst an inkjet is a line printer. this means that a 
 laserprinter can rotate graphic images whilst an inkjet cannot. few drivers 
 actually use this facility.
 (there is also the matter of downloadable fonts and so on)
