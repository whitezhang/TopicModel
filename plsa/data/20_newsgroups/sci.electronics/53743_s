 
 some weeks ago, someone posted an article telling when and where
 a hamfest and computerfest was going to be help in dayton, oh.
 unfortunately, i lost the article and i was wondering if someone
 could repost it.
 
 i believe it was being held the 23,24,and 25 of this month at
 the dayton convention center but i'm not sure.
 
 any help and more details would be greatly appreciated.
