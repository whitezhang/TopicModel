 i have written a program and i want to market it.  i would like certain degree
 of protection, since my main custmers are individuals and not the 
 cooperations.   i know laser hole burning method, and hardware key method,
 however, my  software is going to cost only $15.00, so i can not afford that.
 also, at this low price i can not afford people make too many copy of my
 software. well, i guess say upto %20 illigal copying is ok by me.
 
 however, i do not want someone to get a copy of pctools and copy my software.  
 off course, i never meant to forbid the true hackers from copying, since they
 can develope a better program anyway.
