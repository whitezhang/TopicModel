 the simplest and cheapest soft uv bulb is an ar-1 argon bulb (or other argon
 bulb).  it works like a neon bulb except it glows purple.  it will cause
 stuff to fluoresce.  it requires very little power, just a battery, an
 oscillator, and a step-up transformer to about 100 volts.
 
 electronic goldmine (602) 451-7454 has several uv lamps, both as pre-built
 units and kits.  ask for their catalog.
