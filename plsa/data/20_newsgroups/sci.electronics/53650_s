 td>is a good choice for a cb? 1/4 or 1/8 wave?
 td>  i read the installation instructions on a 1/4 wave antenna,
 td>and they suggested that i use an swr to tune it at channel 12

 td>12 and 32?
 
 the best antenna is one that will let out the most wave (probably not the 
 best explanation, but the rest makes sense) a one wave will cancell itself 
 out (btw no such beastie) . the best is a 1/2 wave antenna, followed by 
 1/4, then 1/8 etc.
 
 as for swring in, what you actually do is trim the antenna to the correct 
 length for the specific wavelength you will be transmitting on. since the 
 wavelength varies with the channel you use, then it's recommended to swr 
 in using the middle channel of those you are going to use.
 anyway in the beginning of cb's, all new antennas had to be swr'ed in, 
 nowdays manufactures trim the antennas almost spot on, so that there's not 
 much point in swring. then again you may be a fanatic and whish to do it 
 anyway.
