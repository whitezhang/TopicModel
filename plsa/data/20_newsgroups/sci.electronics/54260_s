 oh yes, the good ol' deutsche bundespost.  shortly after moving to germany,
 someone told me that "post" is an acronym for the "public organization for
 the suppression of technology".  stimmt, oder?
 
 i miss a lot of things about germany (yes, including the bier vending
 machines at work that were subsidized by the firm), but the phone system
 is not one of them.
