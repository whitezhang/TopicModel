 one of the easiest, and really very used ways of copyprotection, is to mark 
 a specific sector on the installation disk bad. this is very easy to get 
 around, though, if you have any knowledge of hw-hacking, but most 'normal' 
 users (yes those lowly key-punchers) don't. whatever you do, please do 
 _not_ use a hardware key. these were very popular a few years ago, and they 
 stink!!
