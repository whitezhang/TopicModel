 imprecise. this description
 
  1. ignores the role of the ballast,
  2. misrepresents the heating effects in the starter.
 
 the bimetalic strip cools down immediately after the contacts
 short circuit, because the neon discharge stops, and much less
 heat is generated from the i^2r loss in the metal as compared to
 the neon discharge.
 
 the starter contacts open before the tube fires.  actually,
 the tube fires as a result of the back-emf generated in the ballast
 because of this immediate opening of the starter's contacts.
 
 a capacitor is connected in parallel with the contacts to prevent
 excessive arcing during the firing.  the neon reionizes but does not draw
 sufficient current to prevent firing of the tube itself.
