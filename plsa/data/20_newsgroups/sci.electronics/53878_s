 i wouldn't bother with the copy protection, if i were you.  if you program
 is any good, the pirates will have stripped the protection and will be
 distributing the stripped version is well under a week.
 
 hardware methods prevent j. random loser from using his copy ii pc to pirate 
 your software, but doesn't stop anyone who knows a few people with enough 
 connections to "real" pirates who _will_ be able to defeat your "check for the 
 hole" code.
 
 you may want to price your software (depending on what it is) a tad
 higher... a price change from $15 to $25 probably would turn off very few
 potentials buyers, and that way you could tolerate more pirates (whose
 numbers don't change with the price).
 
 as for the 20% pirating figure... ha, ha.  of course, a lot of pirates just
 have this "thing" about having pirated software, even if they never use it,
 so perhaps that really wouldn't count towards 20%.  even so, 20% is awfully
 low.

 p.s. -- i assume you're talking pc software.  if you're talking unix,
 hp-48, or something else somewhat obscure, copy protection might be a
 slightly more viable alternative.
