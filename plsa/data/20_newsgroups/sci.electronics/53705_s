 we're looking at a series of chips by wsi, the psd3xx series. they have
 _mega_ address decoding logic on them, various rom sizes (upto 1mbit),
 various ram sizes (upto 16 k), and 19 i/o ports which can be chip select
 lines, i/o or the buffered address lines.
 
 cute chip, 44 pin plcc package.
 
 second sourcing may be a problem though :-(
