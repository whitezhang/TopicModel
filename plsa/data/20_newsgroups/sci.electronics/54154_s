 when will people learn!
 
 the trouble is the ballast in the concrete and as every fool knows ballast 
 resistors are used to discharge batteries. furthermore it is very silly to 
 store the battery with the terminals downwards as you must have done to 
 contact the ballast. 
 
 seriously: self discharge (the actual problem, as stated by others) does vary 
 greatly with certain types and freaks show low self discharge. i have in 
 fact seen ordinary automotive batteries which have effectively held full 
 charge for > 2 years so it must be possible.
 
 if your garage is heated, store the batteries somewhere cooler but above 
 freezing (flat batteries freeze more easily). occasionally charge it (once a 
 month?) or even leave it on 'float' charge permanently (special charger, 
 don't do this unless you know what you are doing, seriously dangerous).
 
 anouther point is the unsuitability of automotive batteries for things like 
 electric mowers -- they are not generally designed to be repeatedly deep 
 discharged and their life may be greatly shorted. some early zero maintenance 
 automotive batteries in fact responded to a full discharge with total failure 
 shortly afterwards but modern ones are superb. (6yrs, 95000 miles and 
 counting)
