 bubblejets often splatter a little bit, whereas laserjets (given half-way decent
 toner, like hp's "microfine" stuff) don't.  both produce very good output,
 but you don't have to look too closely at the two to tell that laserjet
 output is definitely superior.  
 
 on the other hand, laserjets which haven't been maintained properly and use
 the cheapest toner the owner could find often produce awful output, much
 worse than a bubblejet. :-)
 
 one other thing... there are bubblejets, and then there are bubblejets.
 there are a few bubblejets out there that produce rather mediocre output
 (such as hp's dinky little bubblejet), whereas most produce really good
 looking output (such as hp's deskjets).  ibm and canon both produce some of
 the really good style bubblejets.

 p.s. -- if you're in the market for a portable bublejet printer, i can
 highly recommend the hp portable deskjet, although i've heard the portable
 canons are good too (i needed pcl support, myself).  with the deskjet
 portable, you even get an undocumented pcmcia card slot!
