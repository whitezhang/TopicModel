 check the station's master sync generator.  you'll probably find that
 it already has horizontal and vertical drive outputs that just aren't
 being used.  a couple of cables and you're in business.
 
 another possibility is to find a genlockable sync generator with hd and vd
 outputs - genlock it to station sync, and then feed hd and vd to the
 cameras.
 
 if neither of these is possible, then you'll have to build a sync
 separator.  look at the circuit diagrams of your existing sync generators -
 they probably all include circuitry that does what you want.
