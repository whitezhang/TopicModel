 but... if you are in the habit of trying to repair old and obsolete
 machines, the old data books are a goldmine of information you can
 not get anywhere else. if you are trying to find a modern replacement
 for an obsolete part, the original specs really come in handy. design
 out of the new books but save the old ones (or donate them to a ham).
 
 if anybody in phoenix disagrees, i'll drive over and help them 'get rid'
 of all their old data books.
