 gee, i got the idea from somewhere that devices like this were in common
 use in wwii, so that commanders on board ships could bellow at the troops
 landing on a beach, for example.
 
 which reminds me of an anecdote from the mid-60s.  at a communications
 conference a marine corps communications officer said he didn't care
 much for all the spread-spectrum multi-access expensive communication
 systems that people were talking about at the time; what he wanted
 was a kilowatt broadcast transmitter on the ship and a $4.95 japanese
 transistor radio stuck in the ear of every marine hitting the beach.
