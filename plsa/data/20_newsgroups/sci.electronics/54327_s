    this is called silver bearing solder.   it is used to solder to
 devices that have silvered contacts.   one application is soldering
 to the ceramic terminal strips used in the old tektronix scopes.   these
 were notched ceramic strips that were silver plated in the notches.
 if you used ordinary solder the molten metal would disolve the silver
 off of the ceramic.   the silver was quite thin.   the 2% is a saturated
 solution of silver in tin and lead.    thus, no more silver can be
 disolved in the solder solution.   other devices that use silver contacts
 are quartz crystals and ultrasonic transducers.
