 i've been wondering about this myself.  the house wiring thing is really
 hokey.  there is no doubt that high pressure ultrasound is annoying, but to
 whom?  given that these devices have been advertised to be effective against
 everything from insects to rodents to nasty dogs, what is to say that my
 insect repeller won't just annnoy my dog and give me headaches?  could there
 be that much selectivity in frequencies?  have there been any studies
 on the effects of various pressure levels, bands, and sweep patterns on
 various life forms?
 
 and how effective could they be?  i certainly would not want to tell anyone
 that they are safe from nasty dogs because they were carrying a piezoelectric
 buzzer...
