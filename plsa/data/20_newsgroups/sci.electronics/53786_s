 i've got the same problem; i can't dig up any info on the jumper settings
 on the hd 3.5" drives.
 
 can anyone recommend a reference book(s) on the subject, rather than a
 "quick fix" type answer??  i was going to start hooking up things and
 logging the results, but the prospect of a ten second smoke test deters
 me...
 
 thanks, kirk cowen.
