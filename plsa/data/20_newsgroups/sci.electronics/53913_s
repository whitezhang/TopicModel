 the point is that the original poster was talking about connecting
 ground and neutral in the *outlet* box (big no no), and you are talking
 about them being connected in the breaker box (as things should be).
 
 if this is not obvious, the point is that there should be current
 flow in the white, i.e. neutral/return wires when things in the
 house are operating.  there should not be any flow in the ground wires
 unless there is a fault condition.  notice also that in the breaker box
 there is a wire leading from the above-mentioned junction to earth ground,
 usually a pipe or spike driven into the ground.
