 i, some years ago, almost became a victim of this.  squirted a fair amount in
 an old model 15 teletype which was acting up, then turned it on.  the eruption
 when the motor starting contacts broke was mighty spectacular... i almost got
 my eyebrows singed, the plastic (old ones had safety glass) cover over the
 platen, etc flew across the room, and several people in the room almost had
 heart attacks.  beware the explosive properties of wd40 vapor.
