 hi there,
 i have a mac 512 with a burned out part which looks like a voltage
 regulator.  the part number is bu 406 and i believe the vender is
 sgs thomas judging by teh sgs logo printed on the package.  if anyone
 has teh spec for this part i would greatly appreciate an email with
 the import info so i can find a replacement.  thanx in advance.

 btw i don't need people telling me to throw the computer away.  if
   i had the money the thing would be in the trash in a second, but
   it does make a good terminal if nothing else.
