 
 i have a spare fluke 8062a.  this is a true rms digital meter with
 4.5 digit display.  it's in "average" condition (been used) but 
 works fine - which is what fluke's are all about.   btw - according
 to the fellow who designed these meters, they can be converted to 8060a
 function by clipping a jumper, and adding the 2 extra switches..
 like i said $115 seems fair - these sell for $300+ new.
