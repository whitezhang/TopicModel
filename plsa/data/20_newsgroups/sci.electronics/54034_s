 i need to make a power supply that can take input from a 
 cigarette lighter in a car (12v dc) and drive 7.5 volts
 at up to 3.0 amps. i know enough to know that a simple
 voltage divider with two resistors won't do it right. can
 such a thing be made from radio-shack-able parts without
 too much difficulty?

 p.s. i've looked for premade things like this at radio shack but
 none of it seems to go any higher than about 800ma.
