 ok, so your a ham.   well, tune in 10.7mhz or 455khz.  these numbers sound 
 like some you have herd before?   thats right, you guessed it, they are 
 common if numbers.   every super-het receiver has a local oscillator(s)
 which generates an if.  this is what your detector detector is detecting (the
 local oscillator). 
 
 some of these have two or more local oscillator which generate more ways to
 receiver you.  if you want to receiver something at say 10.525ghz you must 
 generate a local oscillator signal of 10.525ghz - 10.7mhz = your local osc
 frequency.  this 10.7mhz if is then fed into a normal agc ckt.  
 the detector is keyed uppon the agc voltage (your mileage may vary).  since
 the agc is a negative feed back device, a positive voltage sets off a ...
 i think you get the picture.
