 thought it means global positioning system. there are two precision levels, one  
 for army applications (killing has to be very accurate today) and one for civil  
 ones. the civil precision is about 20 to 30m (correct me, if i'm wrong),  
 though, it may be insufficiant for mapping buildings. but there is a way with  
 an additional reference point (e.g. one fixed gps system in a house) to get the  
 same high precision as the military version, but it gets pretty complicated  
 then. if you use a microwave system (actually this means some type of radar),  
 you need quite a lot of number crunching to get accurate vectorized data out of  
 your original signals. so the gps system seems to be the better (and running)  
 idea for your application(there have been discussions in this newsgroup, don't  
 know of an address anymore).
