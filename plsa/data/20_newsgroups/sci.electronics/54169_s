 sorry charlie...
 
 i have a dozen, very blue led's on my bench right now. they have
 a clear plastic case and when lit, are absolutely blue. the hue
 is sort of a "summer day cloudless sky blue" but make no mistake,
 they are blue.
 
 you can buy them from digikey, circuit specialist, jameco (i think),
 led-tronics, stanley optoelectronics, and others. the current price
 is around $2.50 each for small quantities. i will also be selling
 them through my mail-order company in the near future (4 weeks).
 write for details if interested.
