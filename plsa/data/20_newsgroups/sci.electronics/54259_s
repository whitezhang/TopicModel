 i know this is a long shot, but does anyone know what solvent i should 
 use to clean duct-tape adhesive from carpet?
 someone taped wires to the carpet, and now it is time to move out.
 
 is the solvent the same as what's used to clean up the goop in coax?
 (whatever that is ... but it just barely ties this query into 
 sci.electronics)
 
 thanks for your help
 best regards,
 ruck
