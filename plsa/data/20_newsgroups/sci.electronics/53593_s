 
 hello,
 
 i am looking for carbon-doped rubber.    or an highly elastic material that changes its resistivity, or some
 other electrical property when streched.
 
 if you could email me any info you may have on material names or companies that make the stuff
 it would be highly appreaciated.
 
 thanx
