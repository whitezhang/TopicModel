 i've recently picked up some til311 display chips, but i can't find
 any information on them.  it seems they are no longer made by ti, and
 i don't have an old enough data book.  :-(
 
 it appears to have a dot-matrix led display capable of showing one hex
 digit.  it is in a 14 pin dip package, but pins 6, 9, and 11 are not
 present.
 
 if you have any information on this part (pinout, power requirments,
 functions, ...) please send me e-mail.
 
 thank you,
