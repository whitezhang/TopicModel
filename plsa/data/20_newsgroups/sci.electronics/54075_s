 hi,
 i am looking an integrated circuits for my z80-based 
 computer.
 the circuit is called z80-sti (serial timer interrupt), 
 mk3801, and
 made by mostek. mostek is called sgs thompson today.
  
 i have been in contact with sgs thompson, unfortunately 
 they me told that z80-sti is obsolete.
  
 so, my question is if anyone know if i can get hold of that 
 circuits. are there any companies that specialize in selling 
 circuits that are no longer in production? i have contacted 
 several electronic brokers in
 sweden, but without any success. i would appreciate if you 
 could give me hint where i should continue looking. even 
 companies in the united states would be fine, since this 
 circuit is pretty crucial to me.
  
  
 thanks in advance.
