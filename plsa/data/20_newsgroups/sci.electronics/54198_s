 back in high school i worked as a lab assistant for a bunch of experimental
 psychologists at bell labs.  when they were doing visual perception and
 memory experiments, they used vector-type displays, with 1-millisecond
 refresh rates common.
 
 so your case of 1/200th sec is quite practical, and the experimenters were
 probably sure that it was 5 milliseconds, not 4 or 6 either.
