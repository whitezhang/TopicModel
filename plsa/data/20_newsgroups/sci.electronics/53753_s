 
 does anyone know what frequencies the wireless transmitter/receiver
 microphone systems that radio shack sells operate at?  i've tried
 everything short of opening one up (not actually owning one makes
 this difficult...) and just looking..  any help would be greatly
 appreciated..  these systems are designed for wireless pa systems, etc..
  
  
 					thanks,
