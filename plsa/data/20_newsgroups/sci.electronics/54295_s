 i've come across a circuit from integrated circuit systems inc
 called a gsp500.   this chip genlocks a vga card to a dual input
 ntsc signal.  
 the output from this chip is basicly a pixel clock, and has various 
 speeds.  i notice that it outputs a 28mhz clock..  can this output be 
 used on an amiga system?
 and must it be ntsc/vga  or can it be ntsc/ntsc  ?
  
 any simple circuits to boost an ntsc to a vga signal?
 need to genlock a laser disc to my 31khz video.
