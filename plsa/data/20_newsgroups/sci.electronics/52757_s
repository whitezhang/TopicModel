 
 we've just been donated a large machine for use in our
 robotics lab. this device is complete with a 286 based
 controller, running the intel rmx operating system.
 
 unfortunately, we don't have any documentation on rmx.
 
 can anybody out there in netland help?
 
 please reply via email; i don't regularly catch up with
 the news.
 
 thanks,
