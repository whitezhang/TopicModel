 several years back one of the radar detectors manufacturers, in
 defiance to virginia's law against radar detectors, passed out
 thousands of fake cardboard radar detectors at truck stops near
 the virginia state lines.  at that time there were no radar
 detector detectors!  i am not sure of the impact but i would
 imagine that enforcement of the law by visually sighting a
 radar detector became difficult - if not impossible!
 
 as i said earlier, efforts to throw out or eliminate the va law
 against radar detectors has been in vain.  in fact, effective
 jan. 1, 1993, the fine for possession of a radar detector
 accessable to the driver of a vehicle in va is now $250.00.  
 
 i have noted an interesting anomality with my alinco dr-100 2
 meter ham transceiver.... it will make a *cheap* radar detector
 scream!  i am not sure of the range, but it is obvious by the
 brake lights that it can be at least 50 feet at 50 watts! :-)
