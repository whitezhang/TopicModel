 acetone will likely damage the carpet. first solvent to try is denatured
 alcohol. do not waste your time with rubbing alcohol. you can use methyl
 alcohol instead of denatured alcohol. if you want to have a cocktail while
 you are removing the goo, use pure grain alcohol :-). if the alcohol does
 not work try carbon tetrachloride. if neither of these work you may need to
 try a stronger solvent, but the alcohol works for most adhesives. good luck.
