 you can design for ramp shutoff, brick-wall current limit or even 
 fold-back cutoff....sounds like you want "brick-wall" current limit.
 
 your lead is correct to pull down the bias to the series regulator base 
 drive. in order to get the brick -wall, you need enough voltage gain on 
 the current sensor.  normally a darlington on the current sensing 
 resistor will be adequate, but for infinite gain.. use an op amp to sense 
 the current releative to a stable voltage reference and use a driver to 
 turn off the base bias on the series-pass transistor.  phase compensation 
 may be necessary with this closed loop control system if yopu have more 
 than 180 degrees phase shift in your feedabck circuit at unity gain ok??
