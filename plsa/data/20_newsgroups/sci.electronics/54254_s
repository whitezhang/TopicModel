 the 9144w4 is the date code but none of my books list a w03563.
 what is it out of and can you tell us what kind of circuit it is in?
 
 in the odd case that 9144w4 is not the date code, nte says a 9144-60
 is an am reciever subsystem and a 9144-61 is an fm subsystem, but these
 are both in 16 pin packages.
 
 more info, please!
