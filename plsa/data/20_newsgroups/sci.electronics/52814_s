 march '93 circuit cellar has part one of an article about
 dimming 120vac lamps, but it seems to lead into phase-
 control as the best method for controlling brightness.
   i've always hated phase-control for the rfi, buzzing
 filaments and non-linear adjustment range. i had
 heard that you can modulate the ac line on a cycle by
 cycle basis to get better results. to cut the lamp's
 power to 50% you would givemsay 20 cycles of ac, then
 nothing for another 20 cycles. i wonder if anyone has
 tried this or knows what the pro stuff is using. any
 advice is appreciated!
