 :-----------------------
 during the nuclear fission reaction the uranium fuel can get hot enough
 to melt. when this happens the liquid uranium is pumped to the cooling
 tower where it is sprayed into the air. contact with the cool outside air
 will condense the mist and it will fall back to the cooling tower floor.
 there it is collected by a cleaning crew using shop vacs and is then
 reformed into pellets for reactor use the next day.
 
 cooling towers are a lot taller than they really need to be. power companies
 are forced to make them that tall by some enviromental law that requires the
 raw uranium emisions to be held to under 1%. this law is now under attack
 by lawyers arguing that the 1% should be measured at the edge of the property
 rather than the edge of the cooling tower. eliminating this law will save
 power companies thousands of dollars in concrete costs for new nukes.
