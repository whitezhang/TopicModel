 how do you spell "tuna helper" ? 
 
 i gather by off-shore assembly you mean that adcoms are built by 
 blue-fin tuna's who are into that squid-fi sound?  (i agree on that one). 
 my adcom 555 preamp did sound better after installing the famous  
 "running the chips class "a" resistor mod", and replacing the metal 
 bottom cover with plexiglass,, too bad the factory could not make em sound 
 better,, but better sound, unfortunately, does not appear to be a priority 
 with adcom, else the mods would neither have been necessary, nor would they 
 have improved what was already touted as superlative state-o-d-art le'sound. 
 i really want to hear from all those people out there who have traded up  
 from an sp9ii (even an sp3a!) to a gfp-555/etc., or maybe from those that 
 have dumped their forte' amps for a gfa-555/etc....
