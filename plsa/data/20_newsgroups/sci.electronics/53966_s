 actually detecting a break is done by watching for a "character" containing
 all zero bits with the framing error resulting from its receipt.  this
 means that the line stayed in the zero bit state even past the stop bit
 time slot, which basically indicates a break.  there is no special way to
 detect break that i have found other than this -- there's no magic signal
 generated by uarts, etc.
