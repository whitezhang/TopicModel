 not entirely true. a friend of mine was having trouble finishing the game
 gods and asked me for help since he could not find a "trainer" (small
 patch that lets you play without losing lifes). the game is compressed but
 i did find *one* byte which when changed in the original *compressed* file
 would not affect the decompression and would also prevent the "shield" in the
 game from being tured off turning therefore making you invincible.
 
 there are many other progs whose copy protection was defeated one way or
 another and i have seen examples of this with my own eyes. the copy
 protection schemes defeated were various such as using protected mode,
 compressed executables, progs that load and execute other progs (possibly
 compressed), dongles, key disks, etc...
 
 i believe that persistence overcomes even the very best copy protection
 schemes.
