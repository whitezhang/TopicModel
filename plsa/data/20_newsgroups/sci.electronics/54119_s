 
 hi folks,
 
 i borrowed a vhs tape from a friend and it has a warning in the begining saying
 that attempts to copy the tape will result in destroying the copy and the
 original. i found this unbelievable as playing and recording are two different
 processes. however, i've never seen this tape being sold anywhere so i don't 
 want to take the chance even it's small.
 
 anyone has experience in this kind of self-destructing video tapes?
 
 thanks in advance.
