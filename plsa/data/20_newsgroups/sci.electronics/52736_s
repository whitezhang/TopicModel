 i'm still not sure how this is supposed to work, since the .zip files
 took up about 2.5mb, so it must be a tight squeeze on those floppies...
 
 however, i managed to install pads and i'm pretty impressed.  i created
 a couple of schematics without problem, but whenever i try to 
 create a pcb layout from one of *my* circuits (rather than the demos)
 it doesn't work.  i'm wondering if maybe a file isn't where it should
 be...
 
 can anyone who has a printed manual comment on whether the registration
 fee is worth paying?
