 
 hello, i'm curious what sort of neat features exist on high-end
 answering machines today. in particular, i'm interested in
 features of digital answering machines. also, what is the
 typical amount of storage(in minutes) for these digital answering
 machines?
 
 the reason? i'm hacking together an answering machine program
 for my zyxel modem and i'm wondering if i'm missing something
 on my wish list.
