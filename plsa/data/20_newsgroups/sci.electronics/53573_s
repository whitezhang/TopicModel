 an easy way to solve the problem is to use two op-amps to form the
 balanced low-z output, but this solution does not provide any
 galvanic isolation between keyboard (or whatever plugged) and
 mixer. if no tight requiremets are demanded and some hum, snap,
 crackle and pop sounds (formed by ground loops) can be tolerated,
 the op-amp solution is just what you are looking for! (it is
 cheap...somewhat $10/di-box).
 not sure, but craig anderton did introduce one di-box project
 in guitar player mag years ago (transformerless).....
