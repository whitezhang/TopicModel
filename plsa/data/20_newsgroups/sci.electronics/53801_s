 device?).  a lot of older minis used it.  sun still does on their server
 models.  there are several different speeds of smd, and i think that the 
 fuji drive you have is rated at about 24 mb/sec (thats megabits).  there
 used to be several companies that made couplers for the pc (interphase in
 texas being one), but i think that the market pretty much has dried up.
 controllers for this type of drive are readily available for vme buses
 though.  rumor has it that there is a smd to scsi adapter available, but
 i think that it was designed for slower smd devices.  in other words,
 if you have a pc or mac, that drive is pretty much dogmeat.
 cheers,
 corwin
