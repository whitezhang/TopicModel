 not according to the nec nor the cec, as explained in the electrical wiring 
 faq, which i posted here separately.  note the material under the headings

 of course, as they said -- "local codes may vary".

 i'm not sure about this.  if the ground connections on the outlets are
 connected to anything, they should be connected to a wire that runs back to the
 main panel, where it is bonded to the neutral connector and to the house ground
 rod.  a connection to a local earth ground would not necessarily meet one of
 the goals of the ground wire, which is that if a short develops from hot
 to the ground wire, enough current would flow to trip the breaker.  
 
 hmmm.  how are those orange "isolated ground" outlets (often used in
 computer rooms) wired?
