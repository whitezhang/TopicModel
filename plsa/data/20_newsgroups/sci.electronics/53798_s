 
 i am having trouble obtaining the specified standby current drain from
 a mc146818a real time clock.  has anyone out there had some experience
 in doing this?  the specs call for a few sequences to be met before
 standby mode is activated, and are a bit hard to decipher on that, but
 i thought that i had it worked out.  however, with a 32khz crystal the
 lowest current drain i can acheive at 3.7v vcc is 150ua.  this is
 three times the specified maximum under the conditions i am attempting
 to create.
 
 i have done the following things:
 
 1) made sure that reset/ is asserted for trlh after powerup, and as is
    low during this time.
 
 
 2) made sure that there is a cycle on as after the negation of rd/ or
    wr/ during which stby/ was asserted.
 
 what am i doing wrong?
 
 thanks very much,
 
 martin.
