 	i'd like to see this info as well.  as for wavelength, i think
 you're primarily going to find two - 880 nm +/- a bit, and/or 950 nm
 +/- a bit.  usually it is about 10 nm either way.  the two most common
 i have seen were 880 and 950 but i have also heard of 890 and 940.
 i'm not sure that the 10 nm one way or another will make a great deal of
 difference.
 
 	another suggestion - find a brand of tv that uses an ir remote,
 and go look at the sams photofact for it.  you can often find some very
 detailed schematics and parts list for not only the receiver but the
 transmitter as well, including carrier freq. specs. and tone decoding
 specs. if the system uses that.
