 you are correct; the fastest "complete" image that could be presented on
 tv would be one field, which is 1/60 of a second (approximately).  of course,
 the phrase "tv screen" is often thrown around in reference to any crt
 display, so perhaps this researcher wasn't using normal tv rates.  might
 even be a vector ("strokewriter") display, in which case the lower limit
 on image time is anyone's guess (and is probably phosphor-persistence limited).
