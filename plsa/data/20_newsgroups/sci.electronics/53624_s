 may i respectfully suggest you not do this??  the ground is
 supposed to be a protective ground, and though what you suggest
 looks good on paper, it's dangerous to rely on the same wire for
 power and protection.  it'd never meet code, and if you now own
 the property and later sell it, you may end up with liabilities
 you don't want, and if you _don't_ now own it, well...
 
 there's a "wiring" faq that i think addresses this.  i believe
 an alternative is use of a gfci, but i'm really not sure what
 current code allows in this area.  the gfci senses alternate
 (unwanted) current paths, and doesn't rely on a specific
 protective ground wire, at least not beyond the gfci in the
 protected circuit.  gfci breakers are available (but expensive).
