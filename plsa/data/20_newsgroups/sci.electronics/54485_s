    two things to watch for:
    in germany (and i think the same holds for sweden) only some
    of the connections can handle tone dialing, so make sure the
    phone can be set to pulse dialing.
    in sweden, the '0' is the first digit and all other digits
    are pushed "down" by one position; this makes dialing (and
    in the process converting numbers) an interesting task.
    otherwise, it is technically no problem to connect a foreign
    phone to either the german or swedish phone system.
    otoh neither you nor i would ever try that, as it is of course
    illegal.
 
 as the phone uses dtmf dialing, which by some magic all telecom
 operators seems to have agreed on, this is a complete non-issue.
 
 i don't think there are any switches in sweden that can't handle dtmf
 dialing. most switches are now digital and thoses that aren't have
 been retrofitted with "magic fingers" that converts from dtmf to pulse
 dialing.
