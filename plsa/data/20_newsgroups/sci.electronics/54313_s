         yes, it is possible.  i'm making a 7 stepper controller board, 
 with 7 digital inputs, and (up to) 18 digital outputs from the // port.
    one main thing that will tell you whether the // port is 
 bi-directional or not is the bus tranceiver on it.  look for a chip 
 numbered 74ls245.  if you don't have this, then it's probably a 74ls244, 
 which will do you no good for reading in.
   
           now, if you do have the '245 then do the following:
   first, find the address of the port, (decimal) either 888, or 632.
   in pascal, you would "write(port[xxx]);" where xxx is the address in 
 either hex or decimal.  the status lines, pins 14, 16, 17, as well as the 
 strobe, pin 1, are bi-directional lines, and are read by base address +2, 
 so for 888, to read from status, then read from 890.  you can also output 
 to these lines in the same fashion as to the data lines.  in pascal, 
 do "port[xxx]:=value
 ".
  
                 hope this helps.
         let me know if you need more help.
