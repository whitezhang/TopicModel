 if the set is direct line powered, try checking the [likely to be
 there] hybrid regulator module down stream from the 170 volt
 supply.  several sets i've looked at use a 135 volt regulator.  the
 regulators have a tendency to short out, making the safety circuits
 shut down the eht supply section.
 
 try putting the set on a variac or adjustable transformer and lower
 the ac input voltage to the set to about 90 volts.  if the set
 operates nromally, then you know you've got a shorted regulator.
 
 there are myriad other areas for problems, but i've seen the one
 above several times.  also, if the set uses one, the trippler
 module may be shot; that's fairly common.
