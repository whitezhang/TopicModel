 hmm - i don't think you and i are thinking of the same thing. i was the
 original poster, btw. the accelerator that i'm talking about almost
 certainly uses a 68hc000, according to the footnotes in the supra ad. it
 only costs $199 list, so i really doubt if it has a 28 mhz 68030 inside.
 
 it's called the supra 28, or supra turbo 28.
 there's an external a500 model, and an internal a2000 model.
 
 btw, does anyone know if a 28mhz 68hc010 exists?
