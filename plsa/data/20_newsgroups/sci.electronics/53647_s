 i just installed a motorola xc68882rc50 fpu in an amiga a2630 board (25 mhz
 68030 + 68882 with capability to clock the fpu separately).  previously
 a mc68882rc25 was installed and everything was working perfectly.  now the
 systems displays a yellow screen (indicating a exception) when it check for
 the presence/type of fpu.  when i reinstall an mc68882rc25 the system works
 fine, but with the xc68882 even at 25 mhz it does not work.  the designer
 of the board mentioned that putting a pullup resistor on data_strobe (470 ohm)
 might help, but that didn't change anything.  does anybody have some
 suggestions what i could do?  does this look like a cpu-fpu communications
 problem or is the particular chip dead (it is a pull, not new)?
 moreover, the place i bought it from is sending me an xc68882rc33.  i thought
 that the 68882rc33 were labeled mc not xc (for not finalized mask design). 
 are there any mc68882rc33?
 
 thanks
