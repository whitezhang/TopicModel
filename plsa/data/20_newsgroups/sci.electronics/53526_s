 i had the insturment panel go out in my car (a 1990 lincoln contenintal) which
 is a digital dash. they replaced the whole thing with a 1991 dash (thank god it
 was under the warrenty ! :-) anyway, the odometer was reading the exact milage
 from the old panel. it must have a eeprom of some sort in it that is up-dated.
 seems to me that removing the battery would erase it, but it doesn't. so i
 guess they swapped the nvm chip (non-volitile memory) and installed it in the
 new dash. no, they wouldn't let me have the old dash to tinker with :-(
