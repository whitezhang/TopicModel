 is there a fast 'n dirty way to kill the line spiking that occurs when
 an inductive load is turned on sometime other than at zero-crossing of
 the ac cycle?  a capacitor kludged in somehow, etc?
 
 i've got a microcontroller that is running a bunch of valves and pumps
 in a big instrument washer, and almost everything is being switched with
 zero-crossing solid state relays, so that stuff stays "quiet", ac-wise.
 but there's one steam valve that gets turned on by a mechanical relay
 in the water tank fill/thermostat system, and it's not under control
 of my ssrs, and it does sometimes generate/radiate a spike that resets
 one of my peripheral chips.  my software times out and tries again, but
 i'd love to just tack in a magic spike-killing fix that would avoid having
 to do some major rewiring/redesign.  a varistor would help but might not
 be sufficient.  ideas?
