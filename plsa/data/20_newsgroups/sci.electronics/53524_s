 since the digital transmission schemes include error correction and
 concealment, the performance remains about the same down to a very low
 carrier-to-noise ratio, below which it degrades very quickly.  hence,
 digitally compressed tv is supposed to be less susceptible to interference
 than amplitude modulated tv.
