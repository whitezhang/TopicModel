 comments about "who needs backup copies"?  and "you do" deleted....
 
 i'll toss in my 2 cents worth - i've begun to think that distribution
 disks are made on some of the least reliable floppy disk stocks available.
 we've been especially plagued by borland's distribution disks.  i'm 
 lucky if i can install from them as many as 3 times before they crap 
 out on me.  so definitely, as a matter of course we always make copies
 to do our installations with.
