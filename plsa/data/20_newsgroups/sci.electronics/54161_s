 i have a deskjet 500 and i thought i'd give a little info.  the deskjet 500 will
 do landscape mode like the hp laserjets.  i can't say if other inkjets do
 though.  also the deskjet can do downloadable fonts only if you buy a softfont
 memory cart for it.  oh!  you said the laserjet can rotate a graphic image!
 hmmmmm!  the deskjet can only rotate text.  nevermind!
