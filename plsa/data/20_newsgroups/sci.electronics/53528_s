 i'm looking to build a microphone preamp that has very good low-noise characteristics,  large clean gain, and incorportates phantom power (20-48 volts (dc)) for a pzm microphone.  i'm leaning towards a good, low-cost (??) instrumentation amplifier to maintain the balanced input from the microphone, for its good cmrr, internal compensation, and because i can use a minimal # of parts.  
 
 does anyone out there have any experience, suggestions, advice, etc...that they'd like to pass on, i'd greatly appreciate it.
