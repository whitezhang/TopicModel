 we use it as starting fluid for jet ski's. the fact that its a lubricant 
 works very well since jet ski's are 2 cycle. it also helps when a ski
 floods with water because we clean the spark plus with the stuff.

 i have an office/studio in my garage with a phone in it. our wireless phone
 has a page feature where you can make the phone or hand set ring to get
 the attention of the other person. is there a simple circuit that i can use
 over the second pair of wires (or the first pair) to emulate this effect
 with the phone in the garage? (ie push a button to make the phone ring in the
 house or push a button to make it ring in the garage.)
 
 
 
 thanks
