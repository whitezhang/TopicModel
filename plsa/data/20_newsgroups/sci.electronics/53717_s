 i, too, have a xc68882rc50 math coprocessor, which i installed
 succesfully in my mega midget racer (clocked at 33 mhz). i have tried
 clocking my fpu at 28 to 50 mhz and it all worked just fine. i have a
 mc68030-33 cpu. i don't know why my fpu has an xc (my original 33mhz fpu
 was label mc68882-33), but it seems to work fine on my system. maybe you
 just have a bad chip.

 p.s. or does it mean experimental chip instead of motorola chip? .-)
