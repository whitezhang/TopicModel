 i need help on 4 components:
 
 bat85 diode
 -----------
 i know digi-key or newark sells them, but the minimum order is 25!
 does anyone know where i can get smaller orders of this diode, or
 an equivalent replacement?
 
 bc546b transistor
 -----------------
 ditto for this transistor.
 
 74hc239 chip
 ------------
 digi-key, newark and mouser do not appear to carry ths chip - does anyone
 know what this does and where i can obtain it?
 
 ym3623b chip
 ------------
 this yamaha chip decodes s/pdif data (from cd or dat). where can i obtain
 one of these?
 
 thanks in advance,
 - ian
