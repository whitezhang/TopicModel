 there are two more reasons to save old databooks and then beyond two
 years--obsoleted parts and better application notes and tutorials.
 
 when a part is dropped from future production planning, such as the
 national mm-series white noise generators, camera sync generators, etc.,
 it will disappear from current databooks although it still may be produced
 for a short time (or be available from stock somewhere). now, if you
 have some old plans calling for such a device, or you have a dead
 gadget on your workbench and it has such a part in it, you'll know
 the functions so you can troubleshoot and substitute as necessary.
 
 the old ge thyristor data books contain real good tutorials on
 scr and triac applications that are not found elsewhere, for
 example.
