 as a general rule, no relay will cleanly switch audio if you try to tranfer
 the circuit with the contacts.  the noise you hear is due to the momentary
 opening and closing of the path.
 
 the noiseless way of transfering audio is to ground the circuit.  in high
 impedance audio circuits a resistive "t" is constructed close to characteristic
 impedance of the circuit.  grounding the imputs (connected to the t) transfers
 the audio.
 
 in low impedance circuits transformers are usually used, and the inputs are
 shorted out or grounded.  secondaries are paralleled at the characteristic
 impedance.
 
 sometimes if it is necessary to actually switch audio, a second contact is used
 to momentarily short the circuit output for the duration of the switching time.
 
 telephone relays are handy, because contacts can be adjusted to "make before
 break and vica versa" but i haven't seen any of these for years.
 
 nowadys switching is done electronically with op amps, etc.
 
 a novel circuit i used to build was a primitive "optical isolator".. it consists
 of a resistive photocell and a lamp, all packaged in a tube.  when the lamp is
 off the cell is high resistance.  turn the lamp on and the resistance lowers
 passing the audio.  once again this device in a "t" switches the audio.  varying
 the lamp resistance give a remote volume control.  use 2 variable resisters and
 you have a mixer!
 
 lots of luck!
