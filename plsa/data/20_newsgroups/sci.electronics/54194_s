 wrong, wrong, completely wrong (and a little misleading, too).
 
 white noise is random noise whose energy density is constant for a
 constant bandwidth. that is, a 5 hz wide band at 20 hz will have precisely
 the same amount of energy as a 5 hz band at 20 khz.
 
 pink noise is random noise whose energy density is constant for a constant
 precentage bandwidth. thus, a 5% wide band of noise at 20 hz (whose
 bandwidth is 1 hz) will contain the same energy as a 5% wide band at 20
 khz (whose bandwidth is 1000 hz wide). 
 
 white noise is often used with spectrum analyzers that have constant
 bandwidths, pink noise is used with audio-type real-time analyzers whose
 bandwidths are centert-frequency dependent (often described as "1/3
 octave" or "1/2 octave" or some such terminology).
 
 white noise, relative to pink noise, has more energy at high frequencies
 (at a rate equal to 3 db per octave). pink noise, relative to white noise,
 has more energy at low frequencies (at a rate equl to, again, 3
 db/octave).
