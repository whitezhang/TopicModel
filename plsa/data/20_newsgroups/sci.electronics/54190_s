 this definately gets the car going, but... wd-40 is highly flammable. explosive
 even in the right conditions, like a vapour sealed inside a distributor for
 eg. and contact points tend to arc a tiny bit :)
 
 i once saw the alternator/points cover blow completely off a motorcycle after
 it had been restored to life with wd-40... fun to watch
 (it was a honda mr-50 minibike and the cover is only held on by large rubber 
 grommet, so it wasn't really a big blast.)

 ps as a more serious aside, it is apparently also conductive, so it is best 
 to exercise caution with it around mains wiring.
