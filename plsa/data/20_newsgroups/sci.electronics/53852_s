 he ones i have seen are all fluorescent tubes. maybe you could find a
 small tube to go in one of those hand-held fluoro lanterns?

 blue lights. ultra-violet (by definition?) goes from the blue end of the
 spectrum that people see to the radio spectrum (x-rays, cosmic rays etc).
 
 possibly you could get light at the fringe of visibility (which people
 with false eye-lenses can see easily, since it's your lenses that soak up
 most of the uv), however since most people use uv to get other things
 to `glow', and the near-blue is less energetic, it would probably not
 work as well, if it worked at all. (lecture on basic atomic physics
 fits in here, about electron transitions (quantum leaps) and stuff.
