 for an upcoming project i want to use 4 megs of dram configured as two 2
 meg banks of 16 bit data.  i was wondering if anyone out there knows of a
 dram controller which will handle refreshing the data.  it's ok if the
 controller doesn't handle bank switching - that part is easy.
 
 the only controllers i know of are the ones out of the national
 semiconductor dram management handbook (1988 edition) eg. dp8429.  i would
 like to know if another manufacturer produces one which may be easier to
 implement in my circuit.
 
 btw, if anyone is wanting to hook up dram to a microcontroller, dallas
 semiconductor makes a neat chip: the ds1262 serial dram nonvolatizer
 chip.  it uses the spi (i2c) bus and refreshes/controls up to 16mx1 of dram
 memory.  it can use an external battery to refresh the dram when the
 power is off.  price is $11.75 from dallas (quan 1).  i wish i could use
 this chip but its maximum spi clock rate is 1 mhz (too slow for me...).
 
 thanks in advance,
