 not any more.  about 2 years ago they all closed.
 when ramco/electronics city closed, it took weeks and many
 dumpsters to clear everything out (so i heard).
 there are a few places that sell connectors and phone wires,
 but no chips, capacitors or discrete stuff.
 
 sylvan/wellington is still on broadway and canal, but they're
 not cheap, and not surplus.  it's mostly a tv repairman's store.
