 i would appreciate some help in locating a telephone controlled power bar
 for my pc. the unit would power up the pc when the telephone rings and
 keep it up as long as the telephone connection is present.
 
 i also need to be able to power up this same pc through the use of an external
 timer. i can supply power or a contact closure to do this.
 
 i will summarize and post the results of this query here.
 
 thank you.
