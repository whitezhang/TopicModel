 this board would be most appropriate.
 i was wondering about those massive concrete cylinders that
 are ever present at nuclear poer sites. they look like cylinders
 that have been pinched in the middle. does anybody know what the
 actual purpose of those things are?. i hear that they're called
 'cooling towers' but what the heck do they cool?
 i hope someone can help
