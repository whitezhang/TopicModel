 can anyone offer a suggestion on a problem i am having?
 i have several boards whose sole purpose is to decode dtmf tones and send
 the resultant in ascii to a pc.  these boards run on the serial interface.
 i need to run * of the boards somwehat simultaneously.  i need to be able to ho
 ok them up to a pc>  the problem is, how do i hook up 8+ serial devices to one
 pc inexpensivley, so that all can send data simulataneously (or close to it)?
 any help would be greatly appreciated!
