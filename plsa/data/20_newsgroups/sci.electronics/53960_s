 
 i've used on-chip capacitors to reduce ground-bounce noise on a small
 systolic array chip that had 50pf loads on the clock lines.
 (design was in 2-micron n-well cmos, using the mosis scalable design rules.)
 here are some thoughts on the bypass capacitors:
 
 1) they don't help much with simultaneous output switching--there is
 	still a large inductance between the bypass capacitor and the
 	load capacitor (on both the signal line and the ground
 	return), so you still get ground and power line bounce. 
 
 2) they do help a lot with on-chip loads, as i had with the high load
 	on the clock lines. 
 
 3) the transients you are trying to suppress are really high
 	frequency, so forget about large areas of poly-thin-oxide-diff
 	capacitors, since the rc time constant is too large.
 	what i did is to make a metal2, metal, poly, diff sandwich,
 	but put a lot of holes in the poly layer, allowing frequent
 	diff-metal1 contacts.  i forget exactly how wide the poly
 	lines were.  if i were doing this design again, i'd probably
 	omit the diff altogether, and use a solid poly sheet instead,
 	using just m2, m1, and poly (and substrate, but that has such a high
 	resistance it can be ignored at these speeds).
 
 4) you are probably better off trying to tune your circuit to run with
 	slightly slower edges and lower voltage swings (especially for
 	output signalling), than spending chip area on capacitors.
 	i had spare space on the die since the circuit was too big for
 	a mosis tiny chip, and the next size up was twice as big as i
 	needed.

 due to budgetary constraints the light at the end of the tunnel is
