      hello, 
 
    let me introduce a problem:
 
    when i measure a sinusoidal wave (voltage) with a digital voltmeter, using 
 ac mode, my output is an rms value (a peak value over 2 squared). / right? / 
    when i measure a square wave in the same mode (ac), my output is equal 
 to a peak value, actually, to the upper flat boundary of the wave.
    i assumed, that a digital voltmeter makes some kind of integration of the 
 input value, and divides it over the wave period. / right?/
    now, i used it to measure the same  square wave as above, but distorted 
 by high-frequency harmonics. ideally, output should be the same, but...
 the output value was only about 10% of the previous one! 
    why? what is the nature of this output value? what does the voltmeter 
 actually measure? and what does it show?  
 
    related question (less important to me):
    what are advantages and disadvantages of digital voltmeters to compare with 
 analog ones? 
 
    thank you for your attention, you could mail me your opinion at
 avm1993@zeus.tamu.edu or open a discussion here. i would appreciate either 
 way.
