 i am interested in finding a supplier for an array of leds on material which is
 transparent when nothing is lit.
 
 i'm not quite sure what lcd screens are like away from the laptop but i would 
 guess they are not too clear.
 
 an ideal item would be an led array for which each led is about 1/2" square.  
 (yes very course)  this is for distance viewing, but on a window.
 
 any pointers of suggestions would be much appreciated.
