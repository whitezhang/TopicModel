 	typical (in the old 2x-oversampling units) was a thirteen-tap
 fir, implemented as a dedicated hardware addition circuit.  at this kind
 of speed (slow, by digital standards) such an adder is much less
 expensive than analog components of comparable precision.
 
 	i gleaned this information from a hardware manual for
 an old cd player design; where one would find similar info for
 a particular cd (the digital filter is an interesting component,
 from my point of view), i have no idea.  the digital filter
 is a kind of interpolation scheme (read a book on numerical 
 analysis, to see just how broad the term 'interpolation' is...),
