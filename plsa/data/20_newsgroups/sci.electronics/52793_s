 i've seen several references to split- or separate-beam radars, which i
 claimed didn't exist.  gotta eat some crow here - i wasn't aware of them.
 all i really knew was that it can be done with one beam.
 
 i believe the rest of what i said is accurate, though.
 
 mmmmmmm....crow.... (oops-wrong group)
