 refer to patents by james harris rogers:
 958,829; 1,220,005; 1,322,622; 1,349,103; 1,315,862; 1,349,104;
 1,303,729; 1,303,730; 1,316,188
 
 he details methods of underground and underwater wireless communications.
 for a review, refer to _electrical_experimenter_, march 1919 and june 1919.
 
 rogers' methods were used extensively during the world war, and was
 unclassified after the war. supposedly, the government rethought this
 soon after, and rogers was convieniently forgotten.
 
 the bottom line is that all antennas that are grounded send half of
 their signal thru the ground. the half that travels thru space is
 quickly dissapated (by the square of the distance), but that which
 travels thru the ground does not disapate at all. furthermore,
 the published data showed that when noise drowned out regular
 reception, the underground antennas would recieve virtually noise-free.
 
 if you find this hard to believe, then refer to the work of the
 man who invented wireless: tesla. tesla confirmed that rogers' methods
 were correct, while hertzian wave theory was completely "abberant".
