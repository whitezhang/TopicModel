 here in the uk, the bandwidth restriction apparently only apply to 
 local lines.. ie those used by the average domestic client. private
 lines which are run from the local exchange to the leasing client are 
 usually capable of a higher bandwidth if the exchange is digital.
 
 don't quote me on that..... but i think i remember a bt engineer 
 saying something to that effect when i was doing some work
 shadowing a few years ago.
 
 byeeeee !
