 i have a thermal fuse from a apple laserwriter ii power supply (made
 by cannon) that i need to replace.  the fuse is not the standard
 tubular thermal fuse like those found in hair driers etc, but is a 
 rectangular plastic package, much like a transistor or diode.  it
 is about 0.2"x0.2"x0.1", with both leads coming out of one of the
 0.1"x0.1" sides.  i have been told that it was made by miti, a asian
 company, but i can find no information as to a supplier.  this fuse
 is rated at 1a, 130c.  does anyone have a source for this fuse?  i
 only need 5 or so, which means that the manufacturer wouldn't even want
 to talk to me, let alone, deal with me.
 
 please advise via e-mail.
 
 thanks,
 pat
