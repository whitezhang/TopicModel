 here's a question for all you electrical engineers out there:
 
   i bought an 'infrared detector module' at radio shack for $3.95 - it is a 
 little gizmo that senses infrared remotes and produces an output signal. then
 i hooked the output through a transistor to an infrared led. the circuit works
 like a minature remote control extender in my car - all remote commands are
 relayed to the cd player hidden in the glove compartment. it works fine with
 my denon cd player, but when i tried to build the same circuit for a friend's
 vcr, it didn't work.
   the circuit appears to work for other remotes (you can see infrared with a
 sony ccd camcorder) but coincidentally it only seems to work for my cd
 player...
 
 	any advice would be appreciated....
