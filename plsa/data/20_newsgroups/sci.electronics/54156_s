      i have recently used the 4066 to switch a bipolar signal.  i simply
 ran the 4066 off a bipolar supply, +/- 8v in this case.   as long as your
 analog input signal stays between the supply rails, the 4066 will work fine.
 of course, your control (logic) input must use -8v as the logic low and
 +8v as the logic high reference, so that either (1) all your driving logic
 must be 4000 cmos with the same bipolar supply or (2) you must provide
 some kind of voltage level shifting circuit between the 4066 and the
 control logic.  in my case, i was able to use the bipolar supply all the
 way.
