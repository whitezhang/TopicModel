 
  pink noise and white noise are equal amounts of all frequencies.  this
 is in most cases around the 20-3.3k hz range.  pink/white are used to
 adjust for room dynamics and stuff like that.  there are a few eq's out
 on the market that have pink noise built in.  most all from audio
 control have them i know the c-101 does.
