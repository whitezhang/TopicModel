 i think it's because the lead gets coated with lead oxide if the battery is
 not being charged or discharged. i remember some advice from an ancient car
 manual guide my father had, which was to use car batteries to power a garage
 clock or something similar when they're not in a car. this is supposed to 
 prevent the oxidation but i've no idea if it really works. the concrete floor
 connection is a red herring.

 this may contribute to discharging but would be reversible.

 well, this is off-topic, but back in the days when i used to drive bangers
 i never found wd-40 to do anything that wiping with a dry cloth did'nt do.
 i think the effectiveness of wd-40 is a myth invented by the guy who owns
 the company.
