 i was wondering if anyone knows of a chip that that is similar to
 the internal timer 0 on the intel 80c188?  i want a timer that has
 a maxcount a and b and the output should the same as intel's timer.  i called
 intel and they told me that they don't make such a chip.  any suggestions
 are welcome.  thanks in advance.
