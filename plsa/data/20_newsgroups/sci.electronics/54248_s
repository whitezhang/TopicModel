 what are people's opinions about laser detectors?  escort makes a
 laser detector, the passport 1000, and claims it works fine.  however,
 i've talked to some people who have said that it will only work if you
 are lucky - i.e. if the cop happens to point his laser at a car in
 front of you, and the laser beam happens to reflect back to your
 detector.  otherwise it won't work.  regular radar, of course, travels
 in all directions; hence it is more detectable.  any comments?
 
 escort has a deal (till the end of april, i think), where if you buy
 their wideband (passport 3200 - x, k, ka) and laser detectors, you'll
 save $60 off of buying them separately.  in this case, the addition of
 the laser detector over the passport 3200 is only $40 (i.e. passport
 1000 normally costs $100).
