 you might try looking at whats available in laser locating systems. they
 work best for close work( 1 mile and under).
 
 rf is used for much longer distances in two major modes. transponder and
 phase measurment. transponder requires you send a pulse to another station
 and it returns it to you and you measure the round trip time minus the
 receiver time.
 
 phase measurements require two or more transmitting stations sending the
 same frequency signal multiplexed in time. a receiver can pick them up and
 measure the phase shift between signals. maps can be drawn that plot the
 lines of position that correspond to a certain phase shift between two
 stations.
