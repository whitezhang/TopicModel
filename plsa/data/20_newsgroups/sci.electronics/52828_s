 from my rather rusty knowledge of radio, most radio receivers use a superhet 
 circuit, so that the incoming signal is mixed with a local oscillator, giving 
 a fixed intermediate frequency (if) that is more easily amplified. the
 detector detectors work by picking up if re-radiated from your radar 
 detector. in britain, where one has/used to pay for a tv licence, there 
 are/were tv detector vans prowling the streets, looking for people who hadn't 
 paid their licence fee. they had a couple of long solenoid antennae on the
 roof, and i believe could triangulate an operating tv from the if. 
 
 i wonder how much of the if is radiated back from the detector antenna, and 
 how much from the rest of the module. it might be worth putting the detector 
 in a proper rf shielded enclosure.
