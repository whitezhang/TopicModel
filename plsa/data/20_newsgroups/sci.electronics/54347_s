 i know for sure that the everex magic i/o ev-170a can be jumpered
 for a printer mode, or for a general purpose bidirectional i/o mode.
 
 also, i know for sure that the ibm technical reference says the following
 about the monochrome display & printer adapter and the ibm parallel printer
 adapter:
 
     it is essential that the external device not try to pull these
     lines [referring to the data lines] to ground.
 
 and later:
 
     if an external device should be driving data on these pins (in
     violation of usage ground rules) at the time of an input, this
     data will be `or'ed with the latch contents.
 
 i will accept no responsibility if you incur damages of any kind
 as a result of my saying, ``i do not know for sure, but i think
 you should be able to use a traditional parallel port as an input
 port by writing 0x to the data lines, and then reading from the
 data lines, while an external device drives them.''  the input
 data will not be latched, so noise could make this infeasible.
