 hi !!!
 
 is there somebody using a 56001 dsp from motorola ???
 i am searching for programms concerning audio effects.
 i built a 4 channel mixer (4adc + 1dsp) for audio signals.
 i built some digital filters and echos, but now i want to
 include some effects like harmonic equalizer or chorus.
 the problem is, i dont know how these effects work (so i cant
 write a programm).
 so if someone has programms or just knows how such effects work,
 please contact me in the newsgroup or via e-mail.
 (also if there are books about this problem)
 
 thanks in advance
