 i need a off-the-shelf method of transmitting small amounts of data up to
 300 feet.  the data is low speed and can be encoded as needed.  low power
 on the transmitting end would be a plus.  an fcc certified product would
 be prefered.
 
 if you have any pointers to products or companies i'd appreciate hearing from
 you.
 
 thanks,
 ken
