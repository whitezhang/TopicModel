    two things to watch for:
    in germany (and i think the same holds for sweden) only some
    of the connections can handle tone dialing, so make sure the
    phone can be set to pulse dialing.
 
 most (if not virtually all) swedish exchanges can handle tone
 dialling. many older electromechanical exchanges have been modified
 accept tone dialling.
