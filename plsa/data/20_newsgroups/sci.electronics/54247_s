 i don't know much about phones in germany, but this is what i know: i bought
 a phone in the u.s. for my mother who lives in bratislava, slovakia and it
 works just fine. the problem is they don't have wall jacks like we do here.
 there is a wire without any jack at the end sticking out of the wall. so you
 need to connect the wires (i'm not sure if they have wall jacks in western
 europe - they may). hope this helps. dagmar kniha@carson.u.washington.edu
