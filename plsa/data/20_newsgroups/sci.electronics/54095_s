 when trying to choose a resistor with a tolerance better than 1%, you 
 need a trimmer or to screen devices, it can't be made from adding 2 
 resitors of 1% value in parallel, since the smaller device will have the 
 error of 1% to cope with. 
 you have 3 choices;
 a) live with the error of 1% tolerance devices for low q circuits or low 
 sensitivity designs
 b) buy resistors with better than 1% tolerance (vishay/dale)
 c) use trimmers or sot's (select-on-test)
