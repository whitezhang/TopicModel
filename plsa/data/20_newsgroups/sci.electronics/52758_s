 good gravy! decibels are all *ratios.* the question that remains in
 any ratio is the reference unit used. sometimes, this will be a reference
 power, such as 1 milliwatt (given a certain circuit impedance which
 should also be included in the fine print or known, like 50 ohms
 in an rf circuit of that impedance), leading to an accepted
 notation of dbm. maybe it might be dbv, disregarding the impedance of
 the circuit and power developed, using 1 volt as reference *amplitude*
 (rather than reference power). or, it might have an arbitrary or omitted
 reference that is not included in the notation, leading to just plain db.
 so. look at it this way--'db' has an implied reference while notation
 such as 'dbm' has an explicit reference.
 
 for power:
 
   db = 10*log( p(measured)/p(reference) )
 
 for amplitude
 
   db = 20*log( a(measured)/a(reference) )
 
 'b' is for bel, which is a standard term for a log ratio to the base
 10, named after alexander graham bell. a 'deci' bel is 1/10 of a bel.
 it has nothing to do with the bell telephone company except for
 the common founder's name. the small 'd'/large 'b' is per si notation
 convention. i don't know anyone that's been crucified for messing it up.
 
 common references for audio are:
 
 	0 dbm = 1 milliwatt across 600 ohms
 	0 dbv = 1 volt
 
 	0 vu (a zero on the vu meter) = +4 dbm  (pro gear line level)
 	0 vu = -10dbv	(consumer gear line level)
 
 
 often times, a power amp vu meter will be aligned using
 the rated power of the amp as the 0 db point. it is all
 done to whatever reference is reasonable for the application
 or moment.
 
 note that in a circuit with a given (and maybe unknown) linear
 impedance, if the amplitude goes up so many decibels, the
 power will also increase the same amount. this proof can be done
 with the above two identities and ohm's law.
