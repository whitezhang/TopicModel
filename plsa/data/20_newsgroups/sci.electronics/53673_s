 my monitor display has a bad case of the wigglies. i have a good ground. i
 live in an old house and i have replaced much of the wiring. i have two
 emi filters on the computer, the monitor plugs into the computer. when
 fluorescent lights are on upstairs, the display jiggles, when motors run
 in the house, the display jiggles, when incandescent lights are on in the
 kitchen the display jiggles.  i could bring a separate line from the
 breaker box, and use it only for the computer, would this do it? emi
 doesn't only travel the 110 volt line though. should i shield the back of
 the monitor? ground a grid or plate? 
 your expertise is appreciated. thanks very much!  ed byrnes
