 probably won't help.  i'd be willing to bet that _every_ manufacturer
 used those little self-contained modules.  i think sharp made them.
 radio shack used to sell them for a few bucks (maybe they still do.)
 
 the module had 3 leads:  power, ground and demodulated output.  it
 contained the photo-detector, amplifier, integrator and demodulator
 all in a tiny metal can.
 
 if you want to buy one, try radio shack, or else a tv repair shop can
 probably order one.  btw - the carrier frequency is 40 khz, and each
 different tv/vcr/cable box/stereo manufacturer uses a unique pulse
 scheme to perform each different function on their equipment.

 there is an art, the guide says, or rather a knack to flying.  the
 knack lies in learning how to throw yourself at the ground and miss.
