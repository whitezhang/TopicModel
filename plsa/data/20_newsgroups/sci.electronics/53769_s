 there is a number you can call which will return a synthesized
 voice telling you the number of the line.  unfortunately, for the
 life of me i can't remember what it is. the telephone technicians
 use it all the time.  we used to play around with this in our
 dorm rooms since there were multiple phone lines running between
 rooms.
 
 sorry!
