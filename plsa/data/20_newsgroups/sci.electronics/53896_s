 fyi:  the actual horizontal dot placement resoution of an hp
 deskjet is 1/600th inch.  the electronics and dynamics of the ink
 cartridge, however, limit you to generating dots at 300 per inch.
 on almost any paper, the ink wicks more than 1/300th inch anyway.
 
 the method of depositing and fusing toner of a laster printer
 results in much less spread than ink drop technology.
 
 it doesn't take much investigation to see that the mechanical and
 electronic complement of a laser printer is more complex than
 inexpensive ink jet printers.  recall also that laser printers
 offer a much higher throughput:  10 ppm for a laser versus about 1
 ppm for an ink jet printer.
 
 something else to think about is the cost of consumables over the
 life of the printer.  a 3000 page yield toner cartridge is about
 $us 75-80 at discount while hp high capacity (~500-1000 page yield)
 cartridges are about $us 22 at discount.  it could be that over the
 life cycle of the printer that consumables for laser printers are
 less than ink jet printers.  it is getting progressively closer
 between the two technologies.  laser printers are usually desinged
 for higher duty cycles in pages per month and longer product
 replacement cycles.
