 inkjet and bubblejet printers are the same tech.  "bubblejet" was trademarked
 by cannon and inkjet was by hp i belive.  i have seen both, and own a 
 "bubblejet" (a apple stylewriter which has a cannon engine) with a 360 dpi
 rated output.  the output is very good with quality paper, which is
 very importaint.  cheap paper gives bad results.  i use sealed paper and
 the only differenc is that the ink is less dark than toner (i compaire
 to the apple personal laserwriter ntx), but then again the difference
 is $300 to $1500 so....
