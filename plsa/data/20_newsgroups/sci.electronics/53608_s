 my next project is to come up with an if/detector module for fast -- 112
 to 250 kb/sec -- packet radio use.  no fancy modulation scheme, just
 wide fsk for use at 902 or 1296 mhz.
 
 i'm a bit familiar with the motorola 3362 chip, but i wonder if there
 are newer designs that might work at higher input frequencies.
 
 my goal is to come up with an inexpensive design for a receiver "back
 end" with if input on one end and an fsk demondulator on the other.  i'm
 particularly interested in ways to use a higher if than 10.7 -- do any
 current chips work up to, say 150mhz with internal downconversion so a
 normal if filter can be used?
 
 any suggestions?
