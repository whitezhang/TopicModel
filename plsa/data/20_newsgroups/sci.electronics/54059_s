 i have numerous 7000 series scopes which are surplus to requirements.
 these devices range from fully functional to having a fault which
 remained unrepaired since they weren't needed any longer.
 
 my query is: is there anybody in australia interested in buying them?
 
 i think the shipping costs would make it impractical to send them o/s.
 (certainly the mainframes, but if you're willing to pay shipping, i'll
 consider offers for individual plug-ins).
 
 for those who are in the know (anywhere in the world), what are these 
 bits worth second hand in your area?
 
 i have:
 	11	7603 mainframes
 	4	7a15 vertical amp
 	18	7a15a vertical amp
 	1	7a16 vertical amp
 	10	7a22 differential amp (10uv / div, 1 mhz, 100,000:1 cmrr)
 	6	7b50 timebase
 	8	7b50a timebase
 	1	7b51 timebase
 
 in addition, i have the following, which have been smoke damaged in a fire
 and, although washed, are probably a little more prone to failure than
 the others:
 
 	2	7603 mainframes
 	5	7403n mainframes
 	5	7a15 vertical amp
 	2	7a15a vertical amp
 	5	7b50 timebase
 
 overall, i suspect that the 7a22's are worth as much as all the rest
 put together. all bar one of these are operational - that one failed
 and has never been repaired because it was no longer needed.
 
 the 7a22 has an on-board voltage offset as well as switchable high-
 and low- pass filters. there is _nothing_ on the market, to my
 knowledge, that comes close to the specs of this plug-in.
 
 all of the above have service manuals.
