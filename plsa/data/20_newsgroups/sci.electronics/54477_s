 does anyone have recommendations on whether a smart data i/o (print spooler,
 digital sampling, etc.) would be better implemented with a dma chip or a
 dedicated microcontroller?  essentially what i am trying to decide is the best
 way to handle moving data from a port with automatic handshaking from or to a
 memory area that will be accessible by a main system processor when not in use
 by the smart data i/o.
  
 which dma or microcontroller chip would be best to use?  fast, cheap, and easy
 to obtain would be nice, but i won't limit my choices to only those that fit
 those characteristics.  even an 8086/8088 (under $5) would do what i want,
 but i am sure there is a better alternative -- like a microcontroller with
 onchip (e)eprom.
  
 so i essentially want to hear about all dma and microcontrollers that are simple
 to interface and will move data from one place to another while monitoring a
 few i/o lines.
