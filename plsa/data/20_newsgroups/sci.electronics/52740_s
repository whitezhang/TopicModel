 i have a stereo compressor-limiter by 
 audio logic (model mt-66).  the gates work,
 but the compressor seems to be gone on one
 channel, and very weak on the other.  
 
 i'll probably need an ocsilloscope to trace it
 down (no pun intended), but if any one with
 experience with this type of equipment could
 point me in a certain direction as to where the 
 circuit is most likely to fail, i'd sure appreciate it.
