 	greetings. there are 3 types of warnings on (us) tapes:
 
 	1) a hologram is glued across the seam of the 2 halves of the
 	   tape. the message usually reads, "if seal is broken, you must
 	   buy this tape"
 
 	2) the standard "macrovision" warning, "copies of this tape will
 	   be unviewable"
 
 	3) [your case] extended message for the average consumer (tm) which
 	   states that even attempting to copy the tape will destroy the
 	   original. i don't believe you can sue them for misinformation
 	   in cases like this :-)
 
 	take care.
 
 	p.s. of course, #3 is utter bs - but the average consumer (tm)
 	     believes it. heck, my mom once returned such a tape without
 	     watching it... she was afraid that something might just 
 	     happen :-)
