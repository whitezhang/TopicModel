 nasa and related agencies apparently used this same principles to create
 the loudest reported reproduced sound. they used an "analog" electrically
 controlled valve to control the flow of air across a horn throat. if i 
 remember correctly it was called a "modulated air blast transducer". there
 were reports of the thing being able to produce 106 db @ 80 hz @ 10 mile
 distance, communicate directly with fighter pilots @ 5000 ft, etc.
