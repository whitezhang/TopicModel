 are you switching high level signals or low level signals like pre-amp
 out level signals?  also, are the clicks you mentioning the big
 clack that happens when it switches or are you refering to contact
 bounce?  how are you driving the relays?  ttl gate output?  switching
 transistor?  how are the relays connected to what you are driving?
 
 need more specifics to answer your question!! :-)
