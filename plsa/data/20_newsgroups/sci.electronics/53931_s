 
    i was just wondering one thing, actually two. ( i hope that this is the
 proper place to post this subject)
 
   why does a lead acid battery discharge and become dead (totally unuseable)
 when stored on a concrete floor?  
   i decided to bring the battery in from the lawn mower and the motorcycle
 from the unheated garage this year, *to preserve them* and i just
 went to use them and noticed that not only do they not work, but 
 they act like the two terminals are shorted.  i asked a friend
 and he said that you should never do that, 'cause it ruins them,
 but he couldn't tell me why.
 
 thanks
