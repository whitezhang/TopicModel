 hams can legally run up to 1500 watts.  it is very unlikely, however,
 that a ham would be running that kind of power from a car.  ham rigs
 for cars put out around 100 watts.  it is possible that a 100 watt
 radio would cause interference to consumer electronic 100 feet 
 away.  most tvs, stereos, and vcrs have very poor rf shielding.
 if you experience the problem frequently, it may be 
 caused by a ham, cber, or other radio operator in a base station
 nearby.    the interference may have been caused by a radio 
 transmitter used for other purposes, such as police, fire,
 etc.  if you heard voices over your stereo, i think you are
 correct in assuming that the source is an rf transmitter.
 
 if you have frequent trouble, you may want to try the rf ferrite
 chokes available at radio shack.  the interference is probably
 being picked up by your speaker wires, and those chokes can
 be installed on the wires very easily (without cutting them).
 good instructions are included with the chokes.
 if that does not solve the problem, you may want to search your
 neighborhood for a radio operator.  look for antennas on the roof
 or car.  talk to him/her about your problem.  there are things
 a radio operator can do to reduce interference.
