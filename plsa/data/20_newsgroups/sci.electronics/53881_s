 hey everyone, i'm new to this  newsgroup so please excuse me if this is a 
 dumb question....i want to build a crossover for my stereo and i need
 a coil with an inductance of 6.8mh (actually i need 4).  i was wondering
 if anyone knew where i could buy these or how to make these.  i've called
 many places and no one i can find sells them.  if you have the answers just
 e - mail me....
 thanks in advance....
 chris
