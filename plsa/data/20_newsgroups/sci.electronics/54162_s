   * does anyone sell blinking leds with variable flash rate? (by voltage
     i guess) if so, what hertz (pulse) rate are they adjustable or set to?
 
      i'd like blinking leds that can be set for approx 5 hz, 10 hz, 
      15 hz, or 20 hz. something like that... i'm interested in what's
      out there for flash rates. i like the idea of leds with flasher 
      circuits already in them. i hate soldering ics in general. guess i
      don't have a hell of a lot of patience. 
 
 
       thanks,
