 if you want slow led flash rates, adjustable by switches (or by a
 4066/4016 digitally controlled switch), i suggest looking at a 555
 oscillator chip. they cost ~$1 at radio shack (much cheaper in
 quantity at quality places), and you will be able to find good info
 about simple circuits in a 555 oscialltor notebook (i think forest
 mims has one at radio shack). you'll have to toy with
 resistor/capacitor values or you can use your head with a little math
 to get the right frequencies. any engineer worth his salt, can make a
 555 osciallator... it's in the book, and left up to you to see (i hate
 doing ascii circuit graphics). the 555 can accurately go from a few hz
 to about 500 khz (i think).
 
 about the tape recorder gizmo, you could alter a stereo tape deck to
 use one channel as a data line (for flashing led), and one as audio
 line (for voice or music). this would eliminate a lot of noise.
 
 the data line is probably most easily done
 by some kind of pll or bandpass filter (using just an op-amp). the 565
 chip is a good pll, and not hard to work with. however if you nothing
 about how a pll works, i suggest you don't try this. op-amp
 information can also be found in the forest mims radio shack
 info-booklets, and the popular 741 op-amp is a snap to work with.
 setting frequency and bandpass filter values are not so easy, so i
 would suggest the 555 method firstmost... i have no idea what this is
 going into, so i am really generalizing...
 
 as for manufacturing techniques, if you're only goofing with it, i
 suggest you breadboard the thing... no need to solder. wire-wrap would
 be the next, more permanent step. and lastly, soldering/pcb making.
 hope that clears things......
