 gec/plessey specify a series of fm demodulators (sl1454 etc) for use in
 satellite tv receivers : 150 or 600mhz in, 10mhz of baseband video out.
 i think there's also a related data slicer / clock recovery circuit intended
 for use in dmac decoders, though that isn't used in the most common 
 implementation - it may not be in volume production.
 
 the most easily available components probably vary with local satellite
 standards, and i think the european systems vary rather widely from those
 in the us - so it may be worth investigating locally-available receiver
 designs to find out what's in common use.
