 the rule for the designations is that if it says mc, that means it works
 *exactly* the way the datasheet/book specifies.  if it says xc, that means
 there is at least one known bug.  often these bugs are small and obscure;
 you might never run into them in practice.
 
 at least motorola admits it, unlike certain other companies...
