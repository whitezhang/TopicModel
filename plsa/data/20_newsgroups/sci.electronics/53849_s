 i want to start a dsp project that can maniplate music in a stereo cassette. 
 is that any chip set, development kit and/or compiler that 
 can equilize/mix music?  ideally, the system should have d/a a/d converters &
 a dsp compiler.  a rough estimate of the cost is greately appreciated.
 
 thanks in advance.
 
 regards,
