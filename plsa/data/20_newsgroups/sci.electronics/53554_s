 like most high-volume manufacturers, adcom has most of its pc boards
 assembled off-shore (in their case, mostly in the far east).  final
 assembly _and testing_ are done in east brunswick.
 
 the products are, and have always been, designed entirely in the us;
 by their own staff and by audiophile gurus like walter jung.  adcom
 also tends to prefer american and european components over their
 japanese/far east equivalents.
 
 off-shore assembly is one reason that adcom is able to make products
 that perform as well as those from people like audio research and van
 alstine (and better than hafler and forte'), but at a much lower cost.
 
 of course, if your musical diet consists mostly of rock, you might
 prefer components from kenwood or pioneer...
