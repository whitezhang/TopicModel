 i think you posted your article 15 days too late :-)) april 1st is over.
 i don't like nuclear powerplants but i think it's not fair to tell such
 "storys" about them. ok ?
 let me try to explain what that tower is used to:
    -1st. even the modernst nuclear powerplant is only a simple steam-engine.
          it has an hightech "boiler" but the rest is still verry verry 
          conventional. and if you've already visited any condensation-
          powerstation you'l have seen the cooling towers too.
          if you look at any good book about thermophysics you'll find
          a chapter about the "carnot-process" which describes how to
          get energy from a temperature difference ! and that is the reason
          for cooling towers too !!! you only can get energy if you've an
          temperature gradient. that means that you have steam on the one 
          side and need to cool down the steam 'till you get water
          again on the other side if you want to get aprox. 30% of the 
          energy you (or better the uranium) brought into the water to
          let it boil. if you only have hot steam on the one and "cold"
          steam on the other side you'll loose much more of the energy.
          and so they cool down the steam to get at least the 30% of
          energy that carnot will give them.
          the cooling towers are for cooling the steam !
          the vapor you'll see is not the steam of the main core circulation,
          because that steam is radioactive ! the circulation is divided in
          at least 2 circuits connected about heat exchangers to prevent
          radioactive pollution of the environment !
          
    -2nd. ok, the main core is hot, but even in the modernst hightemperature-
          reactors (htr) they only run at ~800 deg celsius. this is still
          verry far away from uraniums melting point which is somewhere
          around 2000 deg. celsius ! but you'll have lot's of problems with
          the boiler's steel. that's because at this temperature the
          metal is attacked by steam and will corrode verry fast.
          this is only for bwr's. the new he cooled reactors have temperatures
          up to 1200 deg. celsius. but this is only experimental. 
 
    -3rd. i personaly think that nuclear waste should be as low as ever
          possible because the dose you get will accumulate about the
          years. today 1 mrem and next year 0.5 mrem won't be 0.75 mrem
          at all. it accumulates and even in 80 years you'll still have
          1.5 mrem. and i'm not interested in glowing in the night and
          getting children with 2 heads. this is my point of view.
          
 
 only my 0.02$ !
