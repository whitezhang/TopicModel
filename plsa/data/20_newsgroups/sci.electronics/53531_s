 what is happening is this:
 1) you turn the tv on.
 2) the horizontal output begins normal operation.  this powers up the
    high voltage and most of the rest of the circuitry.
 3) a problem is sensed and the horizontal oscillator shuts down.
 4) after it powers down the cycle repeats.
 
 things to check:
 first check for a shorted high power component.  your best bet is the vertical
 output transistor(s) or, if there is one, the voltage regulator.  the most
 common cause of this type of failure is too much current being drawn
 somewhere.
 also look for shutdown circuits (which your tv may or may not have),
 if you can find one that is shutting down the horizontal oscillator
 then it shouldn't be too hard to find the problem from there.
