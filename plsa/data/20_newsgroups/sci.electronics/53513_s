 just a shot here, but ya never know:
 
 i once bought a (real) cheap equalizer / power amp for my car tape player 
 at one of those motel-room truckload sales, and it sounded great.  for a 
 while, that is.  then one channel quit entirely.  i opened it up, and the 
 amplifier chip for the bad channel had simply melted some of its solder 
 joints attaching it to the pcb.  i soldered them back and it worked fine.  
 i just had to keep the volume a bit lower than i did before.  probably 
 lousy heat sinking.
 
 you said "a nice alpine" which i'm sure is a few orders of mag higher
 in quality than the p.o.s. i had.  but the point is - look inside before
 you scrap it, since you occasionally find something you can repair.
 maybe even the same thing i found.
 
 good luck!
