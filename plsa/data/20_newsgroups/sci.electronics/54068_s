 i once wrote such a program (in bbc basic...) it was very crude, and took
 around 5 seconds to do an exhaustive search (with a small amount of 
 intelligence), and told you the best combination >rq and the best below rq.
 
 if you want to write one, just store the prefered values in an array, and
 then search the solution space using three nested loops. i'm sure you
 could knock this up in an hour.
