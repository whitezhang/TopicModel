 pin      function
  1      led supply voltage
  2      latch data input b
  3      latch data input a
  4      left decimal point cathode
  5      latch strobe input
  6      omitted
  7      common gnd
  8      blanking input
  9      omitted
 10      right decimal point cathode
 11      omitted
 12      latch data input d
 13      latch data input c
 14      logic supply voltage (5v)
 
 latch strobe input, pin 5, when low, the data in the latches follow the data on the latch data
                              inputs.  when high, the data in the latches will not change.  if the
                                display is blanked and then restored while the enable input is high,
                                the previous character will again be displayed.
 
 blanking input, pin 8,    when high, the display is blanked regardless of the levels of the other
                               inputs.  when low, a character is displayed as determined by the data
                               in the latches.  the blanking input may be pulsed for intensity modulation.
 
 latch data inputs, pins 2,3,12,13,   data on these inputs are entered into the latches when the enable
                                           input is low.  the binary weights of these inputs are a = 1,
                                           b = 2, c = 4, d = 8
 
 decimal point cathodes, pins 4, 10,   these leds are not connected to the logic chip.  if a decimal point
                                           is used, an external resistor or other current limiting
                                           mechanism must be connected in series with it.
 
 led supply, pin 1            this connection permits the user to save on regulated vcc current by using
                                  a separate led supply, or it may be externally connected to the logic
                                  supply (vcc).
 
 logic supply (vcc), pin 14      separate vcc connection for the logic chip
 
 common ground, pin 7,      this is the vegative termnal for all logic and led currents except for the
                               decimal points.
