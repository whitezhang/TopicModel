 names.  if it is used to make circuit boards it is called fr-4.  the same
 material is used in the cryogenics industrya and marine industries as a
 structural material and is called g-10.  fr-4 and g-10 are both green.  they
 are not green because of a solder masking agent.  the basic ingredients are
 a clear epoxy resin and glass fibers.  i am not sure what the specs are on
 the resin, but if you are really curious you can call nema (national
 electronics manufacturing association) or ciba geigy (a major manufacturer
 of epoxy resins) to find out.  as an aside, i occasionally mix clear epoxy
 and glass microsphres to cast small structures for cryogenics experiments.
 the proportions of glass to epoxy are about the same as in g-10.  they are
 the same green color.
