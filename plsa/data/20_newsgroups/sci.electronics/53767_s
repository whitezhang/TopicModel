 on your electronic odometer with an oscillator....
 
     i wouldn't expect to be able to do this.  not because the engineers at bmw are
 putting in anti-fraud logic, but just because an automobile is a noisy, hostile
 environment for electronics, and i would expect the software to be conservative.
 
    if i were to design a microprocessor-based odometer/speedometer program,
 it would have the following features ( just off the top of my head ):
 
          * debouncing/deglitching  ( is this a real pulse, or just a glitch? )
          * smoothing:  the rate-of-change of speed cannot be too high:
                                 this is a car, not an electron.
          *  top speed limit:  anything above 200mph is ridiculous: must be
                                         electrical noise or contact bounce
 
     as for getting in and presetting the pins:  if this is the circuit board out of
 a bmw dashboard, i seem to remember a single big chip with lotsa pins in the
 middle of the card.  good luck getting at the counter :-).
 
     i wouldn't expect a high input frequency to damage the meter:  remember, it's
 probably damped so it can't move too fast, and is probably protected.  after all,
 a car is an extremely hostile place for delicate electronics;  there used to be an
 app note in the national semiconductor linear databook that went into this
 in good detail.
