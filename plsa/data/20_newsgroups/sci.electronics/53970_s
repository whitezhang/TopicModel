 i missed the first part of this thread; are you switching line level or
 speaker level audio?
 if line level, there's a single chip 4x1 *stereo* audio switch available
 that switches 4 two-channel inputs into 1 two-channel output, and also
 has a mute function, all controllable with ttl inputs.  lm1037, i think?
 
 if speaker level, never mind.  :(
