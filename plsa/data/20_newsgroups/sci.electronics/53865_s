 look at the 4053.  this is a triple 2-to-1 transmission-gate analog
 multiplexer, with positive and negative power supplies (can be run
 from a single-ended supply as well).  with dual supplies, the logic
 inputs still range from ground (0 volts) to vdd.
 
 this is a neat (well, i think so) design for a switchable-polarity
 amplifier:
 
                  +-----/\/\/\-------+
                  |                  |
                  |    /--------\    |
 input -+-/\/\/\--+----| -      |    |
        |              |  opamp |----+------- output
        +-/\/\/\--+----| +      |
                  |    \--------/
                  |
 control	---------x (analog switch)
                  |
                  |
                 ---
                 gnd
 
 all resistors are equal-value.  when the analog switch is closed,
 the amp is inverting-gain-of-one.  with the switch open, it is
 non-inverting-gain-of-one.  you can clean up the circuit to trim
 out input offset current if this hurts the balance (this would show
 up as carrier feed-through).
 
 for high frequencies, the slew-rate of the opamp might cause problems,
 especially if it isn't symmetrical (and it usually isn't).
