 i've seen them in surplus stores.  all they are are fluorescent bulbs 
 without the phosphor, and a uv transparent bulb (special glass).  i've
 also seen incandescent versions that you screw into an ordinary 120vac
 socket, probably not what you want.

 as far as i know, near uv (as opposed to far-uv) is longwave uv (near
 the visible spectrum).  longwave uv is safer as far as accidental (i hope)
 exposure to the eyes.  as far as fluorescent minerals go (the reason a
 friend has a uv lamp), some only respond to only one of short or long uv.
 
 hope this helps.
