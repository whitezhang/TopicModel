 we'll let you live, but just this once....
 
 there's more to a real "storage" scope than just a long-persistence
 phosphor.  actually, the phosphor isn't usually anything special at all;
 what makes a storage tube work is a screen placed just *behind* the phosphor,
 which becomes charged as the electron beam intially "writes" the trace.
 with the trace now written to the screen, a separate low-level "flood"
 electron gun keeps the image lit by exciting those areas of phosphor
 which are next to the "written" areas on the storage screen.  there are
 some problems with this - the resolution is limited compared to a non-storage
 tube, and the stored trace tends to "bloom" with time. 
 
 of course, this is pretty much obsolete technology, done in by the current
 digital scopes which use raster-scan displays and keep everything in a
 frame-buffer memory anyways.

 ah, yes - from the same people who brought you that amazing new reading
 program that's sweeping eastern europe: "hooked on consonants!" :-)
