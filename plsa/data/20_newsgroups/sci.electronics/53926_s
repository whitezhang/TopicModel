 i need to find a uart that will interface to an 8051 and do the following:
 	-250k baud, 8 data bits, 2 stop bits, no parity
 	-ability to do break detect (irq or output pin)
 	-irq on character received
 
 i'm using a dallas ds2250 at 16 mhz (8051 clone), but it won't do 
 break detect.  i've looked at the 6850, 8251, 7201, 2661, etc...
 
 	any help would be appriciated!!!
