 hi there,
 
 does anyone know whether the puff rf design package is available
 via ftp from any site? as i understand it, it is in the public
 domain - please correct me if i'm wrong on this one.
 
 any other pd rf design tools out there that can be recommended?
 especially microstrip filter tools...
