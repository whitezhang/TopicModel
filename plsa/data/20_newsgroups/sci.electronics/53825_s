 
 i had a similar idea, for a fax/answering machine switch,
 to put both machines on one line.  you order distinctive
 ringing from your phone company.  this is $3/month here.
 you get a second (unpublished) phone number.  when
 someone calls this number, your phone rings with short
 rings instead of long rings.
 
 you set up your answering machine on 4 rings and your fax
 on six rings.  you'd give out the new # as your fax #.
 a device would measure the length of rings.  when it
 detects a short ring, it turns off your answering machine.
 five rings later your fax picks up the call.
 
 this should be cheaper and more elegant than the $80
 switches now available.
 
 but that's not what i did.  i'm giving out the new
 # to my friends and customers.  this should leave the
 old # for telemarketers, etc.  i won't pick up the
 phone when i hear the long rings.
