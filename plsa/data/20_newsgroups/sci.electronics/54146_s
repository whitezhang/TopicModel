 anyone claiming that 1500 "real watts" isn't possible in a mobile should
 dig through their back issues of 73 (and, i think, qst) for a description
 of the mobile installation of that most revered of oms, w6am.  as i recall,
 this included a heath 1kw (dc in) amp (what was that model number...sb-
 something....  my mind is turning to the usual friday mush...) and was run 
 full-out cw fairly regulary.  the car's electrical system had been modified, 
 including a rather seriously-heavy-duty alternator, but such an installation 
 has been done, and so is possible.  this installation was the source of
 the legendary story of w6am sitting in the car, and paging his wife over the
 department store pa systems!
