 i would suggest draw for windows (by micrografx).  i have this on my
 home box.  its quite impressive and only cost ukl100.  it has a rather
 nice clip-art library facility which you can expand with your own
 drawings.  there is no circuit component clip-art included, but you
 could add your own quite easily.
 
 it works with any windows printer driver of course, and can also
 export embedded postscript and pcx files.
 
 note: i am not connected with micrografx in any way.
