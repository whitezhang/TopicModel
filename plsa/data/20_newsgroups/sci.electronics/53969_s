 hi people..
 
 ok heres my problem.... 
 i keep hearing about these little credit card type of things which
 detect ir light....
 
 i believe that you have to 'charge them up' under normal (visible) light
 and then if they are exposed to ir light they glow or something like
 that...
 
 i think that they are avaliable in the states and even in england, but
 alas i live in australia.  could someone please inform me if i can get
 these things over here, and if so where??? and how much???
 
 also are they really commonly avaliable in the states, and if so, then
 how much are they and who sells them (maybe if i cant get one here, i'll
 write to one of the companies over seas..)
 
 anyway.... thanks in advance...
