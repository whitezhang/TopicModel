 careful now folks... also consider the 90vac+ @20hz that is forced on ring
 and tip when the phone's supposed to ring!  even with a simple zener
 and led setup, you might end up with some carbon real quick.  whatever
 scheme you use, make sure you've got at least 200v-rated components on 
 the frontend.
 
 also remember that, if i'm not mistaken, the phone line is a 600ohm
 equivalent circuit.  any current you draw from the 48v or so gets
 dropped across that 600ohms.  that's fine until you're down to roughly
 12v, when ma bell considers it to be off-hook.  but dropping it that
 far down is probably a big no-no.
 
 the easiest implementation to accomplish the above??

 this is only a suggestion...go ahead and blow holes in it, but you
 get the idea.  choose a high-efficiency led so you don't need much
 current to get it to light up.  choose values for the other components
 as required.
