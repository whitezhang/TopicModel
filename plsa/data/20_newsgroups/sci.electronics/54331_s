 yes and no. i would use the fm transmitter chip from motorola (linear and  
 interface databook), a stable cristal oscillator and a mixer (e.g. sbl-1 from  
 mini circuits lab). everything is done in the fm chip and then mixed up with  
 the oscillator frequency. just have a look at the arrl handbook. there are lots  
 of ideas in there about oscillators and mixing. i don't think, there are single  
 chip designs for such high frequencies yet.
