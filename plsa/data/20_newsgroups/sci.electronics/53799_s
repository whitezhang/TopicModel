 could someone please tell me if a 1/4 decoder is the same as a 1 to 4
 demultiplexer. i know how to link 2 of these to get an 8 output circuit,
 but how do i link 5 of these to make a 1/16 multiplexer. sorry if this
 seems like a lame question, but i'm only a newbie to electronics, and i
 have to do this circuit. please make any mail as droolproof as possible.
 
 				 thanx,
