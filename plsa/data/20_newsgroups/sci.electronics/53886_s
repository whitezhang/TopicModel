 the atari 2600 used a 6502 cpu, just like their entire 8-bit line
 (400, 800,1200,1400, 1440, 130xe, 65xe computers, as well as the 5200
 game machine). the 2600 had some extra asic chips that were basically
 modified graphics chips and pia's for the joysticks. later model 2600
 might have incorporated many of the chips into one asci, as the weight
 of the machines and part count decreased a lot over the years.
 
 additionally, i think the 2600 used 2k, 4k, and up to 8k of rom for
 their games. i have no idea how much ram it had to work with, but i
 would hazard a guess of 2 or 4k ram. think comes from a lot of hacking
 with the 800 and 130xe computers. and occasionally hacking with the
 2600 (fixing it for monitor composite video use, and audio hookups).
 also i tryed to make a cartridge-less system that stored the rom into
 a ram cartridge that could be loaded up at some prior time (a way to
 backup cartridges). i've heard of a setup like this where games could
 be bought (cheaply) on fsk-recorded tapes, then you would load them
 into a special ram cartidge, and play them.
 
 anyways, if you're interested in looking for 2600 equipment, we've got
 two 2600 machines around (one composite a/v modified), and lotsa
 cartridges. willing to sell for reasonable offer + shipping and
 handling. don't play it anymore, since going to computers + nintendo
 (interested in that too?).
 
 hope that helps your question... i might grab some 6502's out too,
 since they must be fun to play with (as microcontrollers).
