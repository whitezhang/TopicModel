 there was a news article a little while ago reporting a type of car (was
 it a volvo?) was found to stall if you used a certain brand/model of cellular
 phone in it.  i seem to remember the car was recalled to fix the problem.

 if the police are in pursuit of a vehicle, maybe they can bombard it with
 high energy rfi.  :-)
