 two or three years ago i saw a report on tv about a company that had 
 developed a method of making solar cells on a flexible substrate. my
 failing memory has convinced me it was some flexible metal. i now have
 an application that requires a flexible solar cell and was hoping someone
 out in netland knows something about this company or a similar product.
 any help would be greatly appreciated.
