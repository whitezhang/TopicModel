 how hard would it be to somehow interface them to some of the popular 
 motorola microcontrollers.  i am a novice at microcontrollers, but i am
 starting to get into them for some of my projects.  i have several 256k
 simms laying around from upgraded macs and if i could use them as "free"
 memory in one or two of my projects that would be great.  one project that
 comes to mind is a caller id device that would require quite a bit of ram
 to store several hundered cid records etc...
