 attention hardware hackers and bargain seekers!
 
 i just bought a 640x200 pixel lcd panel for 25 uk pounds.  i have
 a datasheet for a similar panel, but i'm looking for proper data.
 
 if anyone can help with locating data for this device (before i start
 with the routine on the phone to hitachi and rummaging through the
 library), then i'll pass on the source.
 
 	type: lm225 (hitachi)
 	resolution: 640w x 200h (so can do 80x25 chars on 8x8 matrix)
 
 bought from:
 
 	greenweld electronics ltd
 	27 park rd
 	southampton so1 3tb, uk
 
 	tel. +44 703 23 63 63
 	fax. +44 703 23 63 07
 	email: compuserve [100014,1463]
 
 nb: i only just bought this!  i don't even know if it works!
 
 	price was 25 uk pounds including vat (17.5%), which isn't
 	payable if you're outside the ec.
 
 thanks for any info!
