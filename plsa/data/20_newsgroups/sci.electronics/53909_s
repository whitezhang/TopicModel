 	with relays alone, you will always get a transient when
 you abruptly turn on or off any channel.  if you don't want to hear
 the transient, use some other device (a photoresistor-output optoisolator
 is the usual sort of thing) to gently mute the signal, then switch,
 then remove the power from the lamp in the optoisolator.
 
 	it used to be standard practice to employ photoresistors
 in switching audio, because the photoresistor time delay (a few
 thousandths of a second) kept any noise in the digital side (which
 drives the lamp) from contaminating the audio.  and, the devices
 are cheaper than relays.
