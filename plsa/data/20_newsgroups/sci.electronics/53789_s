 just a thought........maybe it possibly has to do with the fact that it
 is an emerson.  i've got an emerson vcr which is #6 in the series.  returned
 it six times for various and never the same problems.  got tired of taking it 
 back and fixed it myself.  the hi-fi "window" was a bit off.  something like
 the hi-fi audio fine-tuning.  when i was a wal-mart "associate" in '88-'89,
 we had at least one returned as defective every single day.  how's that for
 reliability?  face it--emerson can make audio stuff (albeit not of premium
 quality), but they can't make anything as complex as video equipment with 
 reliability imho.  please, no flames.  just *had* to share my emerson disaster
 in the light of this exploding tv.
