 recently, my video monitor went dead, no picture, some low distorted sound.
 i didn't hear the tell-tale cracking that indicated hv at work, nor are the
 filaments at the far end of the tube glowing orange, just nothing.
 
 on examining the power board, i noticed the largest capacitor with a very
 bad bulge at the top.  naturally, i want to replace it, but i can't find
 any sources.
 
 the electrolytic capacitor is 330 mf at 250wv.  it has radial leads, and is
 roughly 1 1/2 inches long, 1 1/8" wide.  the dimensions are important since
 the whole board fits in a metal cage, leaving little room.
 
 living in the los angeles area, i've been to numerous stores (dow radio,
 all electronics, itc elect, sandy's, yale elect) with empty hands.
 
 can anyone suggest sources for high-voltage capacitors?  mail order is 
 fine, although i'd rather check out a store to compare the can.  i'm going
 to try a video electronics store, hopefully they'll have hv caps.
 
 (by the way, the monitor is a atari sc1224, goldstar circuitry, masushita
 tube.  anyone else had problems?)
 
 thanks in advance,
 rich k.
