 i would like to be able to detect the angular position (low accuracy) of an
 ir emitting source at a distance of about 100 meters (more is better) in
 daylight.  the ir source could be emitting a signature; i'm leaning toward
 30 khz square wave with 50% duty cycle.
 
 i am considering the use of a quadrant detector from centronic inc. to give
 information to a pan/tilt head to point the sensor and thus determine the
 angles.  for the source i am considering wazing the heck out of an ir led(s),
 possibly an optek op290 or motorola mled81.  wazing would mean at least 1 amp
 current pulses.  at this current the duty cycle of the led drops to 10% and i
 would need to cycle five of them in turn to get the 50% required.
 
 has anyone done something like this?
