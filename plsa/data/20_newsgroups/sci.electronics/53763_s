 since your mosfet is a 1972 vintage, it's probably not a very good one by 
 today's standards.  if you have an idea about its voltage and current 
 ratings, e.g. 60vdc @ 6a, you can probably get away with replacing it with 
 anything with better specs.  early mosfets had a gate-source voltage rating 
 of approximately +/- 20 vdcmax, and they would usually turn completely "on" 
 at +10vdc.  otherwise, mosfets are not really mysterious -- they're more or 
 less voltage controlled current sources.  if the mosfet in your circuit is 
 used as an open-loop, voltage controlled current source, you may have to 
 experiment with various gain-altering techniques.
