 i didn't catch your posting one year ago, but i presume you like to leave out
 an extra a-latch ? (i presume you allready know there is a '573 but that couldnt
 be the question, could it ? ;-)
 
 during my student-trainee project, i discouvered a nice device, it's a psd301  
 from waferscale integration. in one single (44 plcc i think it was) package
 it contained: rom, ram, i/o lines and a programmable addressdecoder...
 
 as far as i can recall, it can be hooked directly with a mcs-51 series up ... 
 neat huh ? but it needs programming before assembly, so it wasn't suitable
 for my project. perhaps usefull for you (future) plans ?
 
 
 greetings!
