 
 	greetings. i've recently decided to chuck the linear regulators
 	and learn the "black magic" art of switching power supplies...
 	(before anyone flames me, i know, both have their place :-)
 
 	anyways, i've built the basic up & down converters with pretty
 	good results (>80% efficiency) but i'm running into problems
 	when i try to design & build anything that puts out serious
 	amps... i know it can be done (i have some 5v@200a guts on my
 	bench) but something puzzles me: i'm using a simple choke as 
 	the storage element (basicly a toroid with a single winding)
 	but all commercial models use transformers with many windings.
 	i traced a few and they seem to use some of the winding for
 	the usual error/feedback but some of the others seem to loose
 	me... what are they for? better than that, anyone have a full
 	schematic for one of these that i could get a copy of? i'd
 	love to see how they manage to squeeze out so much from such
 	low volume :-)
 
 	my other problems (in getting high amps & good efficiency) are
 	1) lack of sources of ideal components (calculated) and 2)
 	limited knowledge of the whole topic... i'm doing this on my
 	own (not school) mind you (in fact, i have yet to take any
 	course that covers transistors ;-)
 
 	so, is the answer to #1 the accumulation of dead commercial
 	models and truning into a scavanger (not that it's not what
 	i'm doing now...) and #2 getting & understanding schematics
 	and a bit more of the [mind-boggling] theory? 
 
 	take care.
 
 	p.s. my goal is 12v @ ~25a in (car battery) -> 250vac out and
 	(on the other end) 250v -> +5vdc @ 5a, -5v @ 1a, +12vdc @8a
 	and -12vdc @1a... the distance between the two will be
 	more than 100 feet (of 14-16 gauge) but less than 300 feet.
 	would like to have a working model in a year or so... :-) 
 	(do i have a chance to make it?)
