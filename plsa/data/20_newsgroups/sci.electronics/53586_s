 i have an adcom gfa-555 that i got in 1985.  there certainly isn't
 anything magic about it.  the components used are decent, but
 nothing uncommon with respect to consumer grade components.
 
 the gfa-555 is a nice piece of equipment.  i'm glad that adcom had
 the guts to not over-do the packaging.  it irks me when i see
 audiophile oriented equipment whose case and heat sinks probably
 cost much more and receive more attention than the electronics they
 are supposed to serve.
 
 i don't see any big deal about the geographic region in which
 something is assembled.  this is especially true for something as
 low-technology as a gfa-555.
 
 i'd hope that a gfa-545 would still work well after several years.
 except under conditions of extreme abuse, there isn't much there to
 go wrong.
