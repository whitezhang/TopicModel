 1)  output offset:  obtain the service manual for the oscilloscope
 and adjust the internal output offset contorl.  there is virtual
 certainty that there is an internal ajustment for the offset
 control's zero detent position.
 
 2)  verify that the function generator is properly loaded.  many
 generators expect you to supply a 50 ohm load.  go to a hamfest
 flea market and scrounge around for a pass-through 50 ohm
 terminator that has a male and female bnc (or whatever) connector
 on it.  the calibrator on my tektronix scope is designed to put out
 .4v into a 1 meg load, but .1 volt into a 50 ohm load.  you may
 also find that loading the output of the function generator also
 reduces the harmonic distortion.
 
 build an attenuator.  you don't have to use (and i wouldn't want to
 use) the input impedance of the device under test as part of the
 voltage divider to drop the input test voltage.  consider this:
 
 ------10k--------+---------? ohm ----
                  |
 gen            50 ohm            d.u.t.
 (loaded)         |
 -----------------+-------------------
 
 think about the ratio of 50/10k and then think about the accuracy
 to which you can read voltages on your oscilloscope.  you can
 virtually discount the loading of the d.u.t.  also you have the
 millivolt test generator you want.
 
 good luck,
