 funny . . . i and most of the detector-owning friends i have, are  
 generally able to *remember* such things as nearby microwave towers and  
 radar detectors going off in exactly the same spon every day . . ..
 
 i know on i-64 at the grayson, ky exit, there's a store just off the side  
 of the road (think it's a liquor store . . .) with what must be a security  
 system that would make most federal prisons proud.  it's the only thing  
 i've ever driven by (besides a cop) that puts my whistler in "oh my god  
 he's right behind you!!!!" mode . . ..  i simply ignore the detector and  
 use my eyes when i drive by that store . . . 40 seconds later, all's quiet  
 on the front and no problem.
