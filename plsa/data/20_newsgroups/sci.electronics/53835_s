 well, i'm not too sure if this would be the right place to post this, but
 anyway, here goes:  i was just noticing that some of the current bubblejet
 printers offers up to 360x360 resolution while a lot of lower end laser
 printers only offer 300x300.  however, the laser printers still seems to be
 significantly pricier than the bubblejets... how is this?  or am i missing
 something about the resolution thing?
