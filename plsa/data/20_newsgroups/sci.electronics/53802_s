 
 currently i am using the 8051 microcontroller with external eprom..
 
 in order to drive the dc motor (with direction) i use the pulse width modultion 
 
 thru software control(assembly language programming). however i am afraid that
 
 they will be overheads and thus alter the pulse timing. my question is 
 
 is the software pwm control reliable?. i understand that port 0 is a latch
 
 and so i vary the duty cycle by setting it high first and at the desire 
 
 duty cycle then i set low..? any improments ?
