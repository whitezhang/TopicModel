 i am not quite so sure about the illegality of using a regular american phone
 on your home system. i vaguely remember a few years ago, when "deutsche
 bundespost" split into postdienst, postbank, and telekom there was some
 discussion about a new regulation. i know that cordless or cellular phones
 still have to be approved by the telekom, but does that hold true for regular
 phones? in my areacode in germany (2234 - frechen, near koeln) you can use
 touch-tone dialing. i assume, however, that most areas are still exclusively
 set to pulse dialing. last time i checked (jan '93) the cologne areacode 221
 was still solely pulse dialing.
 
 btw, touch tone does become more common in germany, bringin with it the
 flourishing of 1-900 services (in germany 0190). i just hope we'll all have
 isdn some time at an affordable price - idle wishes...
