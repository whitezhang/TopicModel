 what kind of csa/ul/fcc approval do $60+ mail-order pc computer
 cases and power supplies have?  
 
 can i assume that the certification process for small-scale custom hardware
 (ie digital/analog circuitry) is reduced, or even eliminated, if i use
 such a case and (certified) power supply?
 
 also, assuming that i use a "certified" power supply, have i satisfied the
 requirements of csa/ul approval, and possibly fcc approval as well?
 do mail-order pc cases satisfy fcc certification?  is fcc certification
 even necessary for scientific (non-commercial/non-residential) use?
