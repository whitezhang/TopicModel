 illegal to receive land-mobile telephone service?  don't you have to have a
 mobile reciever to even have land-mobile telephone service?  what about
 ship-to-shore telephone service?

 isin't there some kind of rule (regulation, law, whatever) in some
 juristictions that prohibit the use of *police band* recievers
 in vehicles?  and that radar transmissions are included in the police band 
 so they get covered by the same regulation?
