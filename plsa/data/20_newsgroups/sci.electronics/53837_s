 i want to be able to take a bunch of home-made songs (from dat or other 
 suitable master) and output them to a short run (10-20 off) of standard 
 music cds. would one of the cd recorders designed for writeable cd roms work 
 for this purpose? alternatively, is there a service that does this sort of 
 thing for a fee? 
 
 i'm after as much information as possible on the alternatives (cost, lead 
 time, equipment required, procedure to follow, etc.)  email replies would be 
 appreciated.
