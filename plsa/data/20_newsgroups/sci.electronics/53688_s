 it sounds like your tv is one of the ones that also reacts to the video 
 protection.  (poor you!)
 
 the macroscrubber from radio electronics removes the protection so you 
 souldn't have any more problems.  however, if you use the method of 
 copying it from one vcr to another where the second vcr doesn't react to 
 the protection, you will end up with a duplicate tape, including the 
 protection.
 
 one thought comes to mind about your problem...  when playing the tape 
 for viewing, are you feeding the signal from the source vcr through an 
 extra device before going to the tv?  if you feed it through a second vcr 
 first, that is your problem.  as to other devices such as converters, i 
 don't know if they would react or not.  just to be safe, you might want 
 to make sure that you have nothing between the vcr and tv.
