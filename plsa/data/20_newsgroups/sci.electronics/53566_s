 first, it will not pass a national electrical code inspection.
 secondly, the neutral wire is current carrying and the ground wire
 shouldn't be, or only during a fault condition.
 
 the reason the neutral and ground are tied together in the panel is the
 tranformer on the power pole has a grounded center-tap secondary, with the
 grounded center-tap the neutral.  this gives 120v to neutral(ground) from
 each side of the transformer and 240v across the transformer.  so in effect
 the neutral and ground should be at the same potential.
