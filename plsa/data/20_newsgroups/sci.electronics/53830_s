 it is illegal to use anything you eavedropped on for a business 
 or for an illegal use.  jurisdictions that ban radar detectors or
 police monitors, are essentially making the claim that there is no
 other reason for a radar detector or police radio monitor. 
 
 the results of fighting these claims in courts have been mixed.
 the federal courts are not anxious to intervene and state courts
 have sometimes held that the feds have exclusive jurisdiction
 and sometimes they have not.  a lot of state courts do not have
 enough imagination to see any use for a radar detector besides
 avoiding law enforcement action for speeding.
 
 when you buy a radar detector, amongst the guarrantees, instructions, 
 explanations, and other detritus, is an invitation to join an
 association dedicated to preserving your right to use a radar detector.
 (i promise i am not making this up!)
 
 i do not think radar detector manufacturers would be making any 
 headway at all in courtrooms if police departments enforced speed 
 laws with a strict eye to public safety and a blind eye to the fund
 raiser aspect of tickets.
