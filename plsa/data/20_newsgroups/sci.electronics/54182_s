 uh, bob, why is the battery warmer than ground temperature?  on the time
 scales in question, and with the considerably reduced temperature swings
 several feet underground, there isn't going to be any major temperature
 difference between the battery and what it's sitting on.

 because the temperature of your hand, *unlike that of the battery*, is
 determined by the balance between internal heat production and external
 heat loss.  you're feeling the greater rate of heat loss from an object
 (your hand) which is kept much warmer than its surroundings.  in the case
 of an object with no significant internal heat production, this will
 affect how quickly it comes into equilibrium with its surroundings (if
 it started out not in equilibrium with them) but won't affect the final
 temperature.
 
 for the same reason, windchill affects whether you will freeze but not
 whether water will freeze.
