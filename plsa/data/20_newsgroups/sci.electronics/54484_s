 phototransistor-> x100 -> x100 -> ne567
 with 330kohm              limiter 
 feedback to base                  
 to control operating point (i expect this really hurts noise figure! any
 comments from phototransistor experts?)
 
 we intended to use this atop a stepper motor, to provide headings to the
 beacons. the plan was to have 3 or 4 beacons, of different frequencies, in 
 each room, and tell the 567 what frequency to phase-lock to. we did not do so.
 one challenge was that the available stepper had 8 degree steps!
 knowing the headings to each beacon, we would have used the surveyor 
 technique of resection to determine robot location. (no, i ain't going to
 explain resection over the net.)
 
 given hindsight, i would digitize the amplified output of the self-nulling
 phototransistor circuit, and correlate in-phase & quadrature square-waves at
 the several expected frequencies, to extract amplitude of each beacon.
 by doing this at the numerous steps, even with  8 degree steps, with knowledge
 of the angular response of the phototransistor, you should be able to
 rather more accurately determine the heading to each beacon.
