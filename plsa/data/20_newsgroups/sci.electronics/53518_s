 hmm... now where was that ad for the combination radio/hand cranked
 generator/flashlight/siren i saw? :-)
 
 [function generator has a 50mv offset, and the amplitude's too high]

 sure, you've already got the right idea.
 
 ignoring the 50 ohm internal resistance of the generator for a second, just
 run it into, say, a voltage divider made of 990 ohms in series with 10
 ohms.  this new circuit is the thevenin equivalent of one that puts out
 1/100 of the original voltage, and has an output impedence of negligibly
 less than 10 ohms.  you may want to monkey with the values a little
 depending on whether you care more about the _exact_ dividing ratio or
 the availability of parts.
 
 hows that sound?

 p.s. -- this is why those 1000:1 high voltage probes for multimeters can be
 accurate but still cheap.  they have something like 100 megs in series with
 100k, which doesn't load the (often high impedence) source much, as well as
 keeping the (probably 10 meg impedance) multimeter happy.
