 yes, but still not a 6502 for those differences.  same instruction set,
 of course.

 yes, the same number, but an entirely different device.  i should have
 qualified this further by stating that this was the pal version of the tia -
 i am not 100% sure that the ntsc tia would have a different number.

 does anyone on the net actually have details of the tia, as this is the only
 device i have not yet discovered details about?  atari australia, when asked,
 claimed that their attempts to get the programmers documentation for the 2600
 had failed, as the us head office had refused to provide it.

 i saw a couple of cheaper devices with pn2222's and a couple of resistors
 hooked up as a cheap inverter.  nasty, but workable, and cheaper than a
 7404 inverter if labor costs almost nothing.
