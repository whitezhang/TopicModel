 
 	i have a new scope and i thought i'd save a few bucks by
 buying one with a function generator built in. after having it awhile
 i noticed two things about the function generator. for one, there
 seems to be a bias even when the 'pull-offset' is pushed in. that is,
 i have to pull that know and adjust it to get a signal sans some
 random 50mv bias.
 	the other _really_ annoying thing is that the damn output
 won't go below about 1v p-p. i am a student ( you may have guessed
 from my previous posts ), and i often have to measure the input
 impedances of various circuits i build.many of the circuits have
 maximum input signals of way less than 500mv amplitude and most have
 input impedances in the 10's of kohm range. the thing is, in order to
 use my function generator i have to divide the voltage to some thing
 reasonable. then, of course, to measurethe input impedance of my
 circuit i am going to have to throw in another resistor in series.
 with the 50ohm output of the generator i could just ignore it, but now
 with this little divider there i have to figure that in. it's kind of
 a pain in  the ass.
 	is there any way i could make myself a little box that could
 solve this little problem. the box would tkae the function generator
 input, lower the voltage and give an output impedance that is some
 low, unchanging number. i would want to lower the voltage by a factor
 of one hundred or so. i could just build a little buffer amp, but i'd
 like to have this box not be active.
 	any quick ideas. the scope's not broken. for other reasons i
 had sent it to the shop to get repaired and they replaced it. the
 function generator was the same way on that one, too.
 
 			please help as i am feeling very stupid 
 			today,
