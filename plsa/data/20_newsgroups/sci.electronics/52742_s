 i'm trying to figure out how to operate a pioneer laserdisc ld-1000 that i bought at a surplus store. it is reputedly from some kind of computerised viewing
 and/or ordering system. there is what may be an hpib connector on the back. when
 i power it up, the front panel power light comes on, but no activity, and the
 door doesn't open. anyone have any experience with this unit or any ideas on how
 to obtain documentation?
