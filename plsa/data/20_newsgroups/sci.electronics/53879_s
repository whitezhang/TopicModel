 i booked a hotel (red roof inn) last week in cincinnati (blue ash, which
 is at the northern tip of the metro. cincy area).  i chose it for a few
 reasons.
   1.  all hotels in and near dayton were booked solid.
   2.  this hotel is only costing $28/night.
   3.  it was one of about 4 rooms left on the night i reserved.
   4.  cincinnati probably has more to to at night than dayton.  i intend
       to hit the riverboat entertainment at dusk!
 
 if anyone has other suggestions for nightlife, please let me know of
 other hot spots.  thanks!
