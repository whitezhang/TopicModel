 
 hello there.  the other day i was feeling a tad nostalgic and thought
 about constructing an old-time crytal radio set.  i figured on
 substituting a modern germanium diode for the crystal, and winding the
 antenna coil, etc., myself.
 
 the only problem i seem to have is in locating a source for a tuning
 capacitor -- you know, the old meshed-plate variable condensers which
 used to be the mainstay for tuning circuits.  well these things seem to
 be all but extinct in their original catalog habitats.  trimmer
 capacitors are relatively abundant, but are not really suitable for this
 application.
 
 so, can anyone point me to a supplier of tuning capacitors in the 
 0--360 pf range?
 
 manythanks.
