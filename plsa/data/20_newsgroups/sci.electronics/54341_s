 >rubbish. the reason for the colour of the boards depends on the solder
 
 the may 1993 cover of qst has a picture of three different boards without
 any solder mask (you can tell from the copper colored traces). the box
 labeled 2304 transverter has the brown teflon/glass board, while the one
 in the center has the grayish board exposed.  on the left is some 
 fiberglass board that looks green to me.  i see no reason
 for putting solder mask on circuit board used for box covers :-).
 
 i wonder if any manufacturer actually puts a solder mask on their
 low noise microwave preamps?  often, microwave circuits have odd
 bits of wire/foil/metal attached to wherever/whatever is necessary
 to make the unit work properly (this is a commercial product?).  a
 solder mask would certainly make doing this tougher, never mind 
 the finding something that minimally degrades the circuits.  (q dope
 for coils *does* not improve the q--it just holds things together with
 minimal loss).
