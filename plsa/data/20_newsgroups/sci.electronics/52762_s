 i want to convert a 500 volt sinewave with frequency between 1 khz
 and 10 khz, to a 10 volt sinewave with the same frequency, by
 means of a transformer. the secondary current will be .6 a (600 ma).
 
 what kind of transformer should i use (ferrite?)
 can i buy one? if so, i need a partnumber and supplier
 if i cannot buy one, how do i go about winding one myself?
 what core do i use, how big must it be in order not to saturate,
 what thickness copper wire, how many turns, etc.?
 
 i know little about analog electronics, so i hope some kind
 soul here will help me out.
 pointers to relevant databooks will also be highly appreciated.
 
 thanks,
