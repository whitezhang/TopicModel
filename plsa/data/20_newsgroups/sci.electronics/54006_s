 there are several types of copy protection, and the point is to make sure the
 user is using a legitimate copy.  the simplest and virtually fool-proof way is
 for the program to somehow fixate itself to the machine it was installed on
 (some sort of checksum, serial number, whatever) so a copy put on a different
 machine (not installed from original disks) will not work.  
 
 the program is definitely backupable, if restored to the same machine (depends
 on the programmer...  don't use a disk drive characteristic!)  if the user 
 did an upgrade to the machine, he/she should reinstall all programs any way.
 no document look-up, no disk wear-and-tear!
 
 i did not say that the originals would allow only one install.  the user's 
 conscience should do that.
 
 i know, i'll get flamed for this...  but with the increasing number of "casual"
 users who either unknowingly or don't care about the software copyrights
 (it's the truth.  i have "friends" who ask me for copies of my latest games
 all the time, and when i refused, they went after somebody else.), casual
 pirating is becoming more of a problem.  some sort of copy protection will
 discourage the casual copying.  i've seen what some of my "friends" dug up
 somewhere...  latest and the greatest games, all cracked, within days of actual
 release!  you know how many bytes you need to change in x-wing to disable
 the quiz?  two!  yes, two!  (and don't ask me which ones they are.)  determined
 pirates are unstoppable, given enough time, but their results do not spread 
 that far, since pirate boards are not that well-known, and easily tracked once
 found by authorities.  it is the "casual" pirates that the copy protection is
 determined to discourage.
 
 what i believe the companies should do is implement the above plus
 a special patch once the user registers that loudly exclaims upon bootup
 "registered to xxxxx -- address, city, state zip" and disables the above.
 two benefits: 1) encourages registration, 2) cuts down on pirating and
 makes it more traceable, because if the patch's registration message is
 encrypted, it will be quite hard to change, and therefore provides a
 stable trail of who allowed their copy out of their hands, and thus
 violated their license agreement.
 
 this way, the legitimate users who does not register will experience minimal 
 discomfort (who does major upgrades to their computer frequently?) as only
 problem they have is they won't be able to restore to another computer.
 
 the registered users would have proven they are legitmate users and therefore
 gains full rights, and can restore to different machines.  on the other hand,
 the software company now have a record of where this particular copy is 
 supposed to be.  if this user's copy was found to be somewhere it was not 
 supposed to be, we know who has broken their license agreement.  of course,
 a hacker can break that eventually, but that's not the point, is it?
