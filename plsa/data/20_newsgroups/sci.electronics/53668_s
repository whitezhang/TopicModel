 hewlett packard has a series of barcode decoder ics hbcr-1800, hbcr-2000,
 and hbcr-2010 and they support 3of9  extended 3of9  interleaved 2of5  
 and upc codes. the 2000 and 2010 pieces add codabar and code 128.
 
 these chips support hp's barcode wands and slot readers.
 
 an 1800 + a heds-3050 wand run about $150 cdn .
