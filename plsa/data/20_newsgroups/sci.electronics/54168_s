 once upon a time, long long ago in this news group, someone
 posted a schematic for a 1-bit a/d converter.  well i just found a use
 for the little monster.  anyone out there still got this text file?
 it had a flip-flop, a resistor and a cap, and a comparator/op-amp i 
 think.  i would be extremely thankful to anyone who could mail me the 
 schematic or post it to the news-group.
