 yes,
 
 take interstate i-70 to the route 48 exit.  go south on 48 about
 2-1/2 miles.  trun right on shiloh springs road.  the hamvention is
 at the harrah arena, which is about 1 mile west and on the north
 side of the road.  parking at the arena is limited.  lodging is
 probably entirely booked-up within a 40 mile radius.  good luck.

 it is possible to park at the mall to the west.  there are shuttle
 busses running between the arena and the mall.
 
 if possible, get a montgomery county, oh map from your local aaa
 office.  it should be free if you are an aaa member.
 
 if you don't already have definite plans, now is not a particularly
 good time to start to think about going to the hamvention.
