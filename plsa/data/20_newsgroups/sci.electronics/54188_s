 hi, folks out there !
 
 i don't know whether i am in the right newsgroup, but i have a question.
 
 if i am completely wrong here in this group, could you mail me the right name  
 of the correct newsgroup ?
 
 a friend of mine is studying electronics at the technical university in  
 karlsruhe/germany since one year.
 
 he wants to know whether there are possibilities to study audio control  
 engineering in the u.s.a. .
 
 does anybody know how to get information about these studies in the u.s.a. ?
 could you send me information like (e-mail)adresses of the universities,  
 "quality" of these studies, and so on ?
 
 is it possible to e-mail the universities directly to get information ?
 
 do the universities send information via e-mail ?
 
 please could you answer via e-mail, because i don't read this newsgroup  
 regularly.
 
 
 thanks in advance.
