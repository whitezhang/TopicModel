 sorry about following up my own article, but i wanted to continue
 that what might be being missed here is that the important thing
 might not be temperature differences per se, but the action of
 heat sinking the battery.
 
 perhap someone could conduct an experiment, taking two identical
 lead acid batteries, placing both on wooden shelves, but putting
 one of them in a water bath designed to act as a heat sink.  this
 would eliminate the 'concrete floor effect', and keep both batteries
 at the same ambient temperature.
 
 i think the argument over temperatures is not pertinent, but the
 one over heat conductance and removing the exothermic heat may have
 some validity.
