 i don't want to get into a semantic argument, but contrary to some other
 postings "near uv light" /is/ "actual uv light."  the "near" means that
 it is close to the visible spectrum (i.e. of relatively long wavelength),
 not that it is "nearly uv."  (i'm sure you can figure out now just what
 "far uv" is.)
 
 regular incandenscent flashlight bulbs emit tiny amounts of uv in the
 near end of the spectrum, such that a filter can be used to remove the
 visible light and thus create a weak uv source.  stronger sources are
 going to require gas (probably mercury vapor) discharge tubes (such as
 fluorescent tubes with uv phosphor).  be careful, though; strong uv
 sources can cause physiological damage, especially to the eyes.  the
 shorter wavelengths are the most dangerous.
 
 it wouldn't project a beam like a flashlight, but replacing the tubes
 in a portable fluorescent lantern with uv tubes would be a relatively
 cheap way to create a portable source.  it would be bright enough to
 be useful, but not dangerously so.
