 
 	greetings. i received a reply stating that unless someone else
 	confirms that the following company is operating, i should
 	remove it from my lst:
 
 >pcb prototypes of sandy, ut
 >ronald baker
 >8195 south 2660 east
 >sandy, ut  84093
 >tel: [read below]
 	
 	this is from the comm_pcb.faq (commercial pcb makers).
 
 	also, i don't have time to get the faq onto the sci.answers
 	because of what i like to refer to is "red tape" - after the
 	finals, i'll see what i can do... in the mean-time, anyone know
 	of an ftp site that wouldn't mind a 250k file? :-)
 
 	and last, i have some new entries for the simusoft list (mostly
 	commercial/institutional stuff) but was wondering: should i keep
 	the restrictions on the price of the software to be considered ->
 	under $600 or should i include all those in 4 digit prices also?
 
 	take care.
