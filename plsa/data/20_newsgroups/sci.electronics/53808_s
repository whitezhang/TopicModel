 do you get a dial tone when you plug a phone into the jack??  if not,
 then the line is possibly disconnected from the nearest telco junction
 box. if you do get a dial tone, then surely the telco is sending a bill
 for the line to *someplace* or *somebody*. are you sure that what you
 are doing is on the level. sounds to me like you are just trying to get 
 at somebody's unlisted number.  fess up.
