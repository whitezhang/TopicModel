 write a good manual to go with the software.  the hassle of
 photocopying the manual is offset by simplicity of purchasing
 the package for only $15.  also, consider offering an inexpensive
 but attractive perc for registered users.  for instance, a coffee
 mug.  you could produce and mail the incentive for a couple of
 dollars, so consider pricing the product at $17.95.
 
 you're lucky if only 20% of the instances of your program in use
 are non-licensed users.
 
 the best approach is to estimate your loss and accomodate that into
 your price structure.  sure it hurts legitimate users, but too bad.
 retailers have to charge off loss to shoplifters onto paying
 customers; the software industry is the same.
 
 unless your product is exceptionally unique, using an ostensibly
 copy-proof disk will just send your customers to the competetion.
