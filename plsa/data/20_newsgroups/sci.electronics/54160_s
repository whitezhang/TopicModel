 does anyone know how the vga video feature connector operates? i
 would like to know which of the pins are inputs, which are outputs,
 and which are bidirectional (if any - and how the direction is
 selected).
 
 i have found a pinout for the connector:
 
 video feature connector pinouts.
 
 pin     name   function
 1       pd0    dac pixel data bit 0
 2       pd1                   bit 1
 3       pd2                   bit 2
 4       pd3                       3
 5       pd4                       4
 6       pd5                       5
 7       pd6                       6
 8       pd7                       7
 9       -      dac clock
 10      -      dac blanking
 11      -      horizontal sync
 12      -      vertical sync
 13      -      ground
 
 14      -      ground
 15      -      ground
 16      -      ground
 17      -      select internal video
 18      -      select internal sync
 19      -      select internal dot clock
 20      -      not used
 21      -      ground
 22      -      ground
 23      -      ground
 24      -      ground
 25      -      not used
 26      -      not used
 
 and i assume that pins 1 - 12 are outputs, and 17 - 19
 are inputs. is this correct?
 
 the reason is this - i have a rombo media pro+ video
 digitising card. it chroma keys its output into the vga
 monitor signal. however, although it is supposed to work
 with an et-4000 with hi-colour ramdac, the colours on screen
 behave as if the top 2 bits of colour information are missing,
 and red, green, blue signals are swapped around.
 rombo has suggested that this may be due to insufficient
 buffering on the feature connector outputs, and is happy to
 sell me a buffer device for 50 pounds.
 i would rather save about 45 pounds, and build my own. i assume
 it would require (for example) a 74f244 buffer ic (or two).
 
 can anyone help? any information on the feature connector would
 be highly appreciated!
 
 please could you reply by email :

 because i am at home (easter holidays) and a 300 baud modem
 is slow for reading news!
