 i have notice a lot of electronics questions by people who are obviously not 
 "tuned-in" to electronics.  many of them have rather simple answers, and 
 many of them require a circuit diagram.
 
 rather than muck up the network, why don't you write to me, send a self-
 addressed, stamped envelop, and i'll answer your questions, if i can.
