 i hope david isn't going to be too upset with me for sticking my nose
 in here again, but here goes......:-)
 
 it isn't the average temperature that is the key factor here, but rather
 which is better at transferring the heat out of the (presumably warmer
 than ground temperature) battery.  call it a question of thermal
 conductivity, or of insulating ability, or "thermal mass" - whatever you
 like.  question - why does a concrete floor feel cooler than the 
 surrounding dirt when you place your hand on it?
