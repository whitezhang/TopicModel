       this is a 1950s idea.  supposedly, splicing in a frame of "buy
 popcorn" upped popcorn sales in a movie theatre.  big flap at the time.
 congress involved.  talk of making it illegal.  general agreement by
 networks not to do it.
 
       a few years ago, some junior person at an advertising agency
 re-invented subliminal projection and one commercial went out on tape
 with single-frame messages.  it aired on a few stations, but a tech
 at one station, previewing the tape, noticed a flicker and looked at
 the tape frame-by-frame to find the "defect".  big flap.  fcc notified.
 commercial pulled.  press reports. embarassed ad agency.  you could
 probably find the press reports via dialog or nexis if you wanted.
 
       now that everybody has vcrs, it's not likely that anybody could
 get away with this on tv.
