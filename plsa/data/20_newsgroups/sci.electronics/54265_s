 what??!!!!
 
 you can't remove it, unless you register?  
 you gotta be joking, right?
 what happens if i get a demo-version of that program, install it, and then
 decide that i don't like it.  do i have to register to be able to get rid
 of it?  (hell, no, that is the last thing i would think of!)
 if that is what you mean, then you would better make pretty sure, that a
 statement to that effect is printed loud and clear on the package!
 
 
 a better way to implement the above mentioned scheme is (imho) to allow
 anyone to install the program, but if they register, they get some
 additional features enabled.  it could mean only one new .exe file needed
 to be copied, to have got the full-version of the program.
 of course anyone is _free_ to _delete_ or _remove_ that program at whatever
 time they like.
 
 still, we face the trouble of 'moving' the new .exe file around.  that
 could be solved by having the user registering him self, and get back a
 specially marked for him (or her) a new .exe file.
 
 
 as for some sort of limitations, here are some suggestions:
 limit the size of data that the program can work with,
 disable saving the data,
 print it out with some defects in the output (but be sure to mark them as
 such)
 let some pop-up screen appear for ca. 10 secs. when the program is started
 and/or exited
 
 etc....
 but don't have it that you _must_ register to be able to remove it.
