 why can't he record it legally?  it may not be admissable in court, but
 recording for personal use is legal.  if he wants to play it for his ham
 friend, that's legal too, as long as he doesn't charge admission.

 it doesn't actually have to be 1500 watts at 100 feet.  i've heard radio
 transmissions from concert security over guitar amps with no guitar plugged
 in, and security uses radios transmitting 2-5 watts into a rubber duck antenna,
 which acts more like a dummy load than an antenna.
