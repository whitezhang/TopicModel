 
     i was wondering if anyone out there in net-land knew of a simple
 way to make a 4-band equalizer (single channel).  i need it to accept
 line inputs (tape deck, cd player, etc.) and output to the same! so
 input impedance should equal output impedance.  also, since i am driving
 a line, i would need 1 volt p-p output.  final requirement is that i
 can either:
 	      1. control it digitally
 			or
 	      2. control it easily, or with few resistors
 
 finally - if anyone knows of any filter or equalizer chips, that might
 be useful, please let me know. (i have seen a couple of them from national,
 and maxim).  thanks in advance,
