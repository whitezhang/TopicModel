 	uh oh...
 	umm, there are a number of copy protection schemes.  some involve
 modifying the physical media, and some involve encryption schemes, &c.
 	all of the ones that have existed over the course of computing have
 been successful for a time.  i recall, however, near monthly releases of new
 ways to "crack" the copy protection scheme of the latest releases.  the fact
 is, none of them are completely secure, or anywhere near it.  some are more or
 less difficult to crack, and some have already been cracked.
 	i guess what i am saying is that your question is difficult, if not
 impossible, to answer.  what exactly do you want to know?  do you need a good
 one for a project you are working on?  how secure must it be?  are you trying
 to crack one that someone else has used?  i can probably make suggestions,
 assuming the activity is strictly legal.  (in general, it is a bad idea,
 legally, to tamper with copy protection.  it can also lead to corruption of
 files which you necessarily do not have back ups of (being as they are copy
 protected,) which can be devestating.)  do you have absolutely no ideas for
 practical applications, and are merely curious?
 	please clear up those questions, and i'll try to help as much as i
 can.
 
 	incidentally, the "uh oh..." at the top is indicative of the dread
 anyone who has watched their friends hacking equipment be carted off feels
 when they are asked how to hack.  the area you are broaching is wrought with
 dangers, many of which include breaking the law, or at least addressing it
 (from one side or the other.)
