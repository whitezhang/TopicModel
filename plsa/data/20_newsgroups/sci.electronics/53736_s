 i've been thinking of sending into mad magazine an idea for a 
 parody, of those books entitled "how things work" that
 engineers buy their sons, which explain how engines, elevators,
 flourescent lights, etc. work.
 
 the parody would be "how things really work."  under "canned
 food", on the left page you'd see the description from 
 "how things work": gleaming stainless steel equipment
 pasteurizing the food to precisely the right temperature,
 then sealing the can in an oxygen-free environment, etc.
 
 on the right page you'd see "how things really work":
 brain-dead workers sending disgusting food to the
 gleaming equipment -- rotting vegetables, parts of
 animals people don't eat, barrels of sugar and chemicals.
 
 under "elevators" you'd see (on the left) computer geniuses
 working out algorithms so that x number of people
 waiting for y elevators will get to z floors in the shortest
 time.  on the right, you'd see giggling elevator controllers
 behind a one-way mirror in the lobby choosing which people
 appear to be in the biggest hurry and making them wait longest.
