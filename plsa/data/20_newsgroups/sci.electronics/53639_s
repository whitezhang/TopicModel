 an now-deceased prof told us willing students about a project he had
 worked on during wwii.
 
 they needed a mega-power pa with very clear audio quality. the purpose
 was to bellow at refugees from aircraft.
 
 their solution was a giant compressed-air source, and a horn with
 parallel shutters worked by a small audio system. i think he said it
 worked very well, thus the war dept. cancelled the project ;_}.
