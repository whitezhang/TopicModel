 i have the arrl handbook for the radio amateur, and i'm getting the
 solid state design for the radio amateur.
 
 the handbook is $25 and solid state is $12 from arrl, 225 main, newington,
 ct 06111 but you should be able to find them at electronics or amateur radio
 stores.
 arrl will want $5 or so for shipping.
 good luck,
 galen watts, kf0yj
