 mixers have a wide variety of implementations; the mini-circuits
 part you mention is a doubly-balanced diode mixer, but active ones
 (bjt, fet) seem more popular in consumer receivers.  you might
 call mcl; they have a nice catalog.
 
 the universal answer for wide-coverage, theory+practice, rf design
 is the _arrl handbook_, published by the american radio relay
 league, the radio amateur organization.  any technical bookstore
 can order you one.  the book is superb, with lots of accessible
 theory, construction projects, and generally interesting stuff.
 
 you might also check out _solid state design for the radio amateur_
 (i think), by hayward and <someone>.  this has sharper design
 and test information about subsystems like mixers.
