 i had the good luck to obtain an eico dynamic conductance 
 tube tester for a song. unfortunately, i was a little out of
 key; the only thing wrong with it was an open meter movement.
 does anyone know where i can find either another meter movement
 like it, a dead-but-not-the-meter-dead unit, or schematics 
 to specify the current scale of the meter movement? i can cut
 and paste a more sensitive movement in if i can find what the
 full scale current was. or... is eico still contactable?
 
 the thing is a model 666 -nope, not a joke or any sort of snide
 reference.
 
 r.g.
