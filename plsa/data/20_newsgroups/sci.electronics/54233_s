 maxim makes a chip that does exactly what you want. the max7219 drives 8
 7 segment led displays with full decode or drives 64 discrete led's with
 a 3 wire serial interface.  the chips can also be cascaded to allow very
 large arrays.  i am working on a sign display using this part.
 
 i'll have to post the contact info for maxim later, it's at home.  there was
 a series of articles on this chip in the last couple of circuit cellar ink's.
