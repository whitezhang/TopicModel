 
 intel also makes some neat memory and peripheral chips:
 
 old technology (early 1980's)  
 8155  ram plus io (slow ram as i recall)
 8755  eprom plus io (expensive and slow)
 
 
 intel does make eproms with built in address latches.
 i fear that you would need a very flexible and up-to-date eprom
 programmer to write to them.
 
 give them a call.  i am not able to locate their memory products book
 yet.
 
 
 
 sigh...  now, who borrowed it...
