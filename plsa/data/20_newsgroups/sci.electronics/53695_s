 i hate to disagree w/ a fellow as smart as henry, but...
 
 a few years back, i worked on a project using lots of high-speed
 stuff.  (my part was slow & parallel, whew.) the mild-mannered designer
 working on the fast (serial) stuff cussed & swore at 74f all the time.
 it was the harry reams of ttl. one ultra-tiny power line glitch, one
 hickup, one eyeblink across the board, and bang - the f had
 toggled/counted/whatevered.  at times he swore it would count even
 without any 5 volt supply ;-} you can guess what the "f" stood for....
 
 they would do anything to push s or work around it to avoid using f. i
 don't think i'd consider using f to replace s unless the consequences
 were *fully* understood.......
