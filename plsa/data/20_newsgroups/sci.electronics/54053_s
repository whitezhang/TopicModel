 it has been a while since i knew the electronics of ham radio, but i seem
 to remember that pep is actually 4x the "real" power.  which makes 1kw pep
 actually around 250w.  or was it 2x?  i disremember.
 
 "effective transmitted power" is also "odd", in that it takes into account
 antenna height and geometry.  which is why a tv station with a 50kw klystron
 might advertise a megawatt (if their antenna is on the top of the
 cn tower ;-).
 
 this is like sears hp ;-)
 
 though, 1500 real watts still isn't impossible.  about 125-150a with
 a 12v alternator, less if the alternator produces higher voltages.
 
 it's only three horsepower (taking into account inefficiencies).  you'll
 feel it when you hit the key.  but not too much.
