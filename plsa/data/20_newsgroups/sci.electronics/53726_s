 digi-key also sells quad line receivers, parts ds1489an (68cents) and ds1489n
 (48cents).  a quad line driver, part ds1488 (48cents), is also sold.  i guess
 if you don't won't to supply +12v, the chips with the pump-up circuitry might
 be worth the extra cost.  but 1488's and 1489's are available at your friendly
 neighborhood rs, parts mc1488 (276-2520) for $1.29 and mc1489 (276-2521) for
 $1.29.
