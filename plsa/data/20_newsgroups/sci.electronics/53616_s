 not even in sub panels!  the only place the neutral should be connected to the
 ground is in a service disconnect!  in your house the "main" panel serves as
 the service disconnect.  sub panles in your garage or workshop for example must
 maintain seperate neutral and ground busses because they are not  service
 disconnect equipment.
