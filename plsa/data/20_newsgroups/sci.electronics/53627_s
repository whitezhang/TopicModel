 hello,
 
 i just canceled my support of the cable regime and i would like to at
 least pick up the 3 networks and nbc.  :)   i do not have tons of
 money nor even a few pounds so what i am looking for is the best solution
 for reception for under 100 dollars.  i have seen modules that you plug
 into your wall outlet that "supposedly" make your entire house an
 antenna.  i have to admit, even with my limited knowledge of wavelength
 and aerial reception, this seems dubious in its claims for "excellent
 reception" at best.  i'll try anything, though, if it works.  i am in
 a non-mountainous area, approximately 50 miles from the transmitting stations
 which are pretty large (montgomery alabama pop. 200,000) and colombus goergia,
 pop. 100,000+.  any recommendations of products, brand-names, prices and 
 company info (catalog ordering numbers, addresses etc.)?  thank you in
 advance.
