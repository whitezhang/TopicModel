 i need a small battery powered hi voltage capacitive discharge supply to
 deliver ~6 joules at 250 volts. this implies a 200uf cap. i have built
 a very satisfactorily operating version from a max641, but do not like
 the idea of using a $6 single source part. it seems that the ubiquitous
 camera flash circuit is what i want, but i cant get mine apart without
 breaking it. i would appreciate receiving the circuit description or
 a source of one. i have already looked in several electronics circuits
 handbooks to no avail. thanx
