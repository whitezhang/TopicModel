 hello,
 
 can somebody tell me what kind of mov's are most useful for a computer
 surge protector?  radio shack have 2 types, both rated 130v, one for
 a 10a current and the other for 20a.  on the other hand, commercial surge
 protectors i have seen claim a clamping voltage of 330v-400v, which seems to
 me in imply a rated voltage of about 250v (250v * sqrt(2.)=353).
 
 what is the right kind?
 
 while at it, ow important is really the emi/rfi module?  is there really any
 noticable level of such noise in the power line?
 
 please-  e-mail to me, as this group has too much volume for me to be able
 to follow.
 
 thanks!
