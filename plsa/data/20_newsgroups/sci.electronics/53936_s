 i had a catalog with membrane keypads, but i dunno what
 happened to it, and it was so long ago that i forget the
 name of the company.  anyway, you could make your own
 legend and slip it behind the bezel.  really nice and 
 reasonably priced.  can anyone tell me where to get some
 more of these critters?  i've tried several places, but
 none of them seem to have keypads which allow you to use
 your own legend.
 
 any suggestion would be appreciated.
