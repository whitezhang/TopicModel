 charlie brett's suggestion -- buy one of the disposable flash cameras, use
 the film, then take the thing apart -- is a good one.  note, though, that
 you won't get a particularly precise voltage out of such a thing, and it
 may be a single-point design that won't adapt well to off-nominal operation.
 
 the things are easy to dismantle.  the key piece of information is that
 when you advance the film on one of them, you are winding it *into* the
 film cassette -- it is unwound from the cassette in the factory, when
 the camera is made.  so no darkroom is needed for dismantling.  it's
 standard film, so just take the cassette in for processing.
 
 all the camera-store people do when you bring in one of the disposables
 is rip it apart, toss the film cassette into the to-be-processed bin,
 and throw the battery in one trashcan and the rest of the camera in
 another.  if you take it apart yourself, you get an aa alkaline battery
 (still with a fair bit of life in it) and all kinds of little bits and
 pieces from the camera.
 
 i expect you could even re-load and re-use the camera if you were really
 determined.
