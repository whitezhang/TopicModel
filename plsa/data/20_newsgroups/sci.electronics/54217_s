 there is nothing in the amateur radio tests that requires an technical
 competence at all. it is a simple matter to memorize all the questions
 and answers.  however, that said, most hams that i know do spend quite

 you cannot do that legally. however, you can ask a ham over to listen.
 if the interference occurs at a specific time each day, then it would
 be possible to do such scheduling.  if nothing else, you could invite
 the ham over to transmit from your driveway, to see if he interferes.
 if he does, then you probably need to have your equipment worked on to
 make it immune to rf interference.

 the fcc may, or may not, have such information. they have enough to do
 without getting calls for such information. if nothing else, call your
 city offices or police department (general business number). they should
 have the name of a local ham contact.

 see above - your concept of wasted signal is erroneous. if his rig is
 transmitting properly, then the chance of interference (with the exception
 of harmonic television interference) is the greatest - since he is putting
 out the strongest signal.

 unfortunately, most consumer equipment is succeptable - it is all poorly
 designed.

 it does, but not for a mobile radio. there are very few mobile rigs that
 could power a 1500 watt amplifier.
