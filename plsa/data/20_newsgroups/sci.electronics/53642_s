 $50 each!!  don't bother trying to make one yourself, just shop around a
 little.  i've found dod brand di boxes for as cheap as $20 each.  you can 
 get higher end ones for more, but for pa use for bands, i wouldn't bother.
 making one yourself might work, but getting a sturdy enough enclosure might
 be hard (they're made of heavy guage metal, since they're always on the floor,
 being kicked around a lot). for any additional questions on this topic, you 
 might want to post to rec.audio.pro
