 mjm>hi, i was wondering if anyone would be able to help me on twwo related
 mjm>subjects. i am currently learning about am/fm receivers and recieving
 mjm>circuits. i understand a lot of things ,but a few things i am confused
 mjm>abuot. the first is the mixer, to mix the rf and local oscillator
 mjm>frequencies to make the if. does anyone have any cicruit diagrams (as
 mjm>simple as possible) for this kind of mixer? i have come across a
 mjm>mc-sbl mixer chip but i have not been able to find it in any catalogs
 mjm>(active,etc...)
 
 mjm>along the same note, are there any simple fm receiver circuits anyone
 mjm>may have stashed away somewhere and they couold let me see?.
 
 mjm>p.s. any really good books on am/fm theory along with detailed
 mjm>electrical diagrams would help a lot.
 mjm>i have seen a lot of theory books with no circuits and a lot of
 mjm>circuit books with no theory, but one without the other does not help.
 
 digi-key has the ne-622 chip which has a local oscillator and mixer on
 one chip.
 
 for a great combination of theory with actual circuits, the best
 reference for non-engineers is probably the radio amateur's handbook
 from the arrl.  most library's have it in the reference section.
