 hi,
 
 	being a electronic engineering student with only electronic ii under
 my belt, i find myself *needing* to build a moderate wattage audio amp. so, 
 i'll throw out a couple of question for the vast knowledge of the 'net'!
 
 	please explain how watts are calculated in audio amp circuits. no,
 not p=i*e, just how it relates to one of the following:
 
 	ai [current gain]
 	av [voltage gain]
 	ap [power gain]
 	or whatever.
 
 i already have a ?wonderful? cheap i.e <$20 schematic for a 20w amp, but
 i would like to cross/improve the circuit. the problem is that the parts
 list has ic1 and ic2 as nec70001ab amplifiers. they look like ?11 pin? 
 sip packages with a heatsink. this schematic was published in a 1991 mag
 so it may be non-existant now. anyway, i tried looking up a replacement in
 the latest digi-key cat and found it  not listed 8(. the closes i could
 figure was a 9 pin sip as tda1520bu. anyone got any ideas? 
 
 	i thought, hey i can rin a pspice simulation using 741 opamp 
 models. yea, great! it worked. but, i guess the 741 wasn't made for high
 power amps. as a result, i got a voltage gain of ~15mv/v. worse than
 i started with 8(... does anyone have a pspice ckt file with cheap yet
 good gain? how about some models for some of the chips listed in this 
 e-mail? any ascii chip info you guys can send me? 
 
 i'm open to suggestions/ideas/comments/help!
 please e-mail since i have little time to search the news... 
 and i'll post if there's and interest!
 john
