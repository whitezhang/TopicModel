 fiberglass boards are available in several colors.  sitting right
 here, i have unetched board stock that is white, blue, green and
 yellow respectively.  i've also seen black boards.
 
 solder mask is available in a variety of colors too.  depending on
 the supplier, the color helps indentify the material.
 
 don't forget conformal coating.
 
 i don't think i've seen phenolic impregnated paper boards in
 anything other than the familar brown, but it would not be
 difficult to add a dye to change the color.
