 try the folks at dimolex corp., la crescenta, ca 91214.
 their number is (818) 957-7001.  they make membrane keypads
 that are very flat, in layouts from 2 to 128 keys.  they
 have standard models, tactile models (with stainless domes
 under each key to make a 'click' you can feel), as well as
 backlit models.  some of them can even be cut with scissors
 to form a funky shape other than a rectangle.  many of the
 models are available in a 'kit' which includes a bezel,
 colored and plain key covers, and rub on lettering to make
 your own layout.  one piece prices aren't cheap, though,
 as they want $10 for one four position pad *kit*, and $45
 for a 40 position *kit*.
 
 i have no affiliation with dimolex or any company connected
 with them.  i *have* purchased a couple of keypads from them,
 and am pleased with what i got.
 
 cheers,
 alan
