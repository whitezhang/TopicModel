 there usually is a way, however, often, telephone companies like to
 keep all of their internal numbers private. depends on your exchange.
 any modern electronic switching equipment usually have voice synth
 lines that echo the number you called from. the line service guys use this
 to make sure they connect up the right pairs of lines.
