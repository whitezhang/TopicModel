 
 does anyone has a table about the size of the wire to the amount of current it can carry.  probably in the 1-15amp range.  my friend is interested in converting a mazda into an electric car.  needed information for estimation.  thanks in advance.  
 
 p.s. any info on electric will be greatly appreaciated.
