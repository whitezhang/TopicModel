 
 i don't know much about hydrophones, so i'm looking for any information
 that will help avoid problems i haven't thought of! i would like an 
 inexpensive hydrophone and amplifier with tape (line level) outputs...
 something like edmund sells for $250. they also sell just the microphone
 (hydrophone) head for $24, but how does one construct the enclosure?
 any information would be greatly appreciated, thanks!
