 while driving through the middle of nowhere, i picked up knbr, am 1070,
 a clear-channel station based in los angeles. they had an ad 
 claiming that they were able to get traffic flow information from 
 all of the thousands of traffic sensors that caltrans has placed
 under the pavement. does caltrans sell this info? does knbr have
 an exclusive? what's the deal?
