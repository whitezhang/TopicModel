 i would expect that cd-rom software would not even need copy protection.
 as the program on a cd-rom would not fit onto a hard-drive, and it is
 impossible for the average (and even not-so-average) user to write to a
 cd-rom, copies of the software (that still work) could never be made.
 
 hmmm.. now that i think about it.. with a creative tsr, maybe
 disk-swapping could be used to simulate files on a single disk. you
 would need a tonne of disks though.
