 hey, can someone clue me in on these and other weird types of amplifiers?  just
 a brief intro to the concepts behind these would be cool.  i have the clues 
 on type a, b, and ab already and stuff, but these other ones are mentioned 
 occasionally and i dont know what they do.  i think type d is like a pwm scheme
 or something.  thanx in advanced.
