 we used to buy beckman 110 and hd110 ("ruggedized") versions for use
 by electricians in the steel mill where i work.   after a while we
 got round to filling all the current-input jacks with silicone -
 electricians have a regrettable habit of not checking where the last
 guy left the leads before using a 3 1/2 digit 0.5 % autoranging $400
 meter to check if a fuse is good or not. its very hard on meters
 (and electricians) when you put the milliamp shunt across a 600 volt
 bus. 
   but that's not why we stopped buying beckmans - after a while a 
 lot of them got "funny" in the lcd display.  a black stain would
 spread from one edge, or else they'd come adrift from those
 zebra connectors and fail to operate.    now we buy flukes, the
 low-end 20 series mostly ( and we still fill the amp jack with 
 silicone). 
   what the world needs is a meter that won't let you change ranges or
 turn it on/off with a lead stuck in the amps jack - a little bit of
 clever plastic detailing would take care of this and make the world
 safer for electricans, anyway.
    not that i've ever put a meter on the wrong range into a live 
 circuit, no, not me...not more than a dozen times, anyway....
