 you can get a *little* uv by putting a heavy uv filter (deep purple) in
 front of an ordinary flashlight bulb (the brightest you can get).
 my father used a setup like this in law enforcement work circa 1964.
 
 good uv ("blacklight") bulbs work like fluorescent bulbs.  i'd proceed by
 getting a cheap battery-powered _fluorescent_ light, then going to an
 electrical supply house and finding a uv bulb that would fit it.
