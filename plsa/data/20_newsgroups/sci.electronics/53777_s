 i repair a lot of monitors here, and i'd like to know where i can get a
 pattern generator (or a circuit for one) that will provide mda, ega and vga
 signals. using a whole pc to do this takes up too much space on my bench, and
 is somewhat less than portable. i guess i could sit down and design something,
 but i don't have the time right now - any (reasonable) suggestions would be
 appreciated.
 
 tnx
 
 tg
