 this probably only tells you that the dc blocking capacitor that's in series
 between the one-chip, single-ended audio amp and the speaker terminal is there.

 open it up and look for the power amp "ics".  they'll be fairly obvious. 
 replace the one connected to the dead output.

 well, one thing you should do is poke around the terminals of the power amp
 chips.  use a probe with a 10m resistor (like a scope probe) connected to the
 input of a small audio amp w/speaker.  if you find line-level input to both
 chips, one of the chips is bad and can probably replaced pretty easily.  
 
 if you want to pick off a near-line-level signal, suitable for feeding to an
 outboard amp, the outer legs of the volume control pot will often be good
 enough.  this is *before* the volume control (and usually before the tone and
 balance controls too).  if you take off from the center and ground legs of
 the volume pot, this will be after the volume control (but again, probably 
 before the other controls).  
 
 if the unit is a modern type with an electronic volume control chip, you should
 probably forget the whole thing.
