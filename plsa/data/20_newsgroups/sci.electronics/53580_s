 i want to send emg-signals from a running person to a computer. 
 each signal is 4khz wide and there is up to 30 of them on each
 running person. the signal is only to be sent over a few hundred 
 meters. it seems to me that the frequency intended for this use is
 about 150mhz and about 440mhz.
 to make the transmitters as light as possible i suppose it will be best 
 the to send the signals in an analog form. as this application is rather 
 specialized i do not expect to be able to buy the exact transmitter-
 units i need.
 on the other hand i imagine that i can buy the receiver somewhere. i 
 need a multichannel (up to 30 channels) receiver or 30 complete  
 receivers in some rack system where one can add as many receivers 
 as needed in the particular case.
 do anybody know if there is existing such receiver 
 system on the market?
