 not all parallel ports are bi-directional without modification.
 
 my experience with the standard old zenith parallel port in their 
 original 286s proves that.  they had the input direction disactiviated by 
 tieing them r/w select line of the circuit to vcc.  to make it bi ( which 
 i did ) i had to modify it by scraping off the trace and solder a jump to 
 the proper location.  i thought that this was just lazy on the part of 
 zenith ( they were not zenith-bull group at that time).
