 i have a fujitsu m2322k which has been removed (i believe) from a digital
 x-ray machine (takes x-ray pictures without film).  the fujitsu part number
 is b03b-4745-b002a.
 
 i have obtained some data on the device, it is 8-inch winchester-type
 of 168 megabyte capacity (though i was told it was over 800 megabytes).
 however, there is very little information on the interface standard used.
 it appears to use two balanced-line connections, but what each connection
 corresponds to i know not. one connection is a 30-way idc, the other a
 60-way idc.
 
 if anyone has any information on this device, i would be most grateful
 if you could provide it.
 
 thanks.
 
 
 chris powell.
