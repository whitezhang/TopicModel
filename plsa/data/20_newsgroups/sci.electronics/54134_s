 
 	i wrote a commercial program called game-maker (can you guess what
 it does).  what we do is have a document protect (answer question on page x, 
 line y), which is a real pain.  we also allow the user to register by sending
 in a card, and computing a # based on their name.  the system works in that
 we've gotten lots of registration cards.
 	i hear that the program has been cracked though.  someone two people 
 actually called up my support--one with a question, the other wanting to
 buy our graphics libraries (right!).  anyway if anyone wants to help me
 catch a cracker and has the cracked version, mail me.  i won't accuse
 you (unless you're the cracker of course).
