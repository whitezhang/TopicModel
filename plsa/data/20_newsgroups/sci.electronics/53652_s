 if you are going to use one where it counts (eg:aviation, space scuttle, 
 etc) then i suggest you go and buy a fluke (never seen a beckman), however 
 for every other use you can buy a cheapie. i have a metex which is some 
 made up name, as i have seen the same dmm with other brand names on it, i 
 bought it about 4 yrs ago for aus$125.00 (convert that to us and you see 
 that it's definetly a cheapie.) so far it has proved to be accurate, taken 
 moderate abuse, and has many features on it (cap, freq,transistor check, 
 etc). i am very happy with it and would definetly not buy a fluke just for 
 the name. hope this helps.
 
 cheers
