 	low power quartz oscillators are usually 32 khz (and these
 have significant temperature drifts, which one doesn't often notice
 while wearing the watch on one's wrist).  low temperature sensitivity
 is available in other crystal types, which unfortunately
 are larger and higher frequency (1 mhz or so) and take more
 battery power.  
 
 	programmable timers might be less accurate, but they
 are more power-stingy than suitable crystal oscillators.
