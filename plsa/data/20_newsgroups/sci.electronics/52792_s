 actually, i think j. chiu knows the score and is just being
 silly. however, "decibel" is in fact 1/10th of a bel. he is
 right on that one, but i don't know if it was accidental or not.
 
 strictly defined, a bel is the ratio of the log of two power levels,
 and a decibel is 1/10th of a bel so you have 10x decibels for every bel,
 hence bel=log(p2/p1) and decibel=10xlog(p2/p1).
 
 the bel, ohm, volt, farad, ampere, watt, hertz, henry, etc. are
 all named for pioneers in the field. it's a traditional and fine
 way to honor researchers who discover new knowledge in a new field.
 hertz was one of the most important of the early electronics explorers,
 but had been left out in having a term or unit named after him
 until recently, (1960's, prior to that what is now a hertz was a cps.)
 all the other units were defined many decades earlier.
