 hi,
 	i am looking for some help in choosing a package
 for a high-speed silicon adc (100mhz) currently being 
 fabricated. this is a phd research project and i have to test
 the chip at speed on a pcb. i expect to have roughly 100
 packaged circuits and will do dc, low-speed and high-speed
 testing using 3 different set-ups for the test chip.
  	
 	i know for sure that a dip will not work
 (the long lead lines have too high an inductance).
 getting a custom-made package is too expensive, so
 i am trying to choose between a flatpak and a
 leadless chip carrier. the flatpack would be hard
 to test since it has to be soldered on to the test
 setup and i would spend loads of time soldering 
 as i kept changing the test chip. the leadless chip
 carrier sockets also have long lead lines and may
 not work at high speeds.
  
 	does anyone out there have experience/knowledge
 of this field ? i would greatly appreciate help! any ideas/
 names of companies manufacturing holders/sockets/packages
 would help. 
  
 p.s. the multi-layer fancy gaas packages seem like a bit
 of overkill(?)
