   this may sound like a simple-minded question, but this is the first time
 i've ever had a need for this:
 
 i've been designing some relatively simple chip circuits based on things
 like photoresistors (you know, no light to photoresistor, emit a logic
 high, etc.).
 
 anyway, i've got some servos lying around, and i wanted to do some things
 with them using digital logic.  i know all about having to pulse the signal
 and everything, i just have one problem:  i'm assuming i need a negative
 (yes, negative) logic high to get the thing to turn in the direction 
 opposite the direction it would turn under normal logic high.
 
 is a negative logic high (i've seen this in schematics) the same thing as
 an active low, or what?  i'm not using a bi-polar power source, so how
 would i get a negative logic high out of this thing?  i need to have all
 three signals available:  logic high, logic low, and negative logic high.
 
 any help would be greatly appreciated.  also, please reply via email, as i
 never seem to have time to read this (or any other) group lately.
 
 thanks much,
