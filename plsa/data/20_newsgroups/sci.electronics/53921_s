 or, _documentation_ for the program ;-).  a lot of shareware out there is 
 very similar in the approach - send in your money, and you get 
 documentation, and a free upgrade to the latest version.  perhaps even 
 support of some small degree.  whatever you want to offer that is "better" 
 than the circulating version.

 it doesn't really hurt legit users.  shareware is still much cheaper than 
 the alternatives.
