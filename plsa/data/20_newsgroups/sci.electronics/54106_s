 
 i have 2 omti 3527 scsi adapters for sale.  these make an st-506 rll drive
 look like a scsi disk drive.  each adapter will support two rll drives.  i
 have used this model omti adapter with my amiga a500 and a c-ltd scsi host
 adapter without problems. i'm selling these because i got them about the
 same time i decided to sell instead of expand my amiga so i have never even
 used them.  i can't guarantee they will work with every scsi host adapter.
 
 they are essentially new in box. i paid $150/ea, make me an offer.
 
 regards,
 todd
