 they require two separate grounds.  one ground goes to the ground pin
 of the outlet, and the other ground wire is connected to the outlet's
 mounting tabs (and thus grounds the box and faceplate screw and metal
 faceplate, if any).
 
 the box/faceplate ground goes to the normal distribution panel ground.
 the outlet ground-pin wire is generally connected to an insulated
 busbar in the distribution panel which is, in turn, connected to
 the building-entrance main ground by its own wire.
 
 so the two separate ground systems are connected together at the
 building's service entrance.  but one is also connected to every
 grounded piece of electrical equipment in the whole building,
 while the isolated ground is shared only by the equipment plugged
 into isolated-ground outlets of that panel.  if someone happens
 to accidentally short one phase of a 600v feeder to ground,
 the main building ground is likely to have a lot of noise on it
 until the breaker trips or the fuse blows, while the isolated
 ground will remain relatively noise-free.
