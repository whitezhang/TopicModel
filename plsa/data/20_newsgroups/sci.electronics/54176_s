 can someone tell me where to find 120volt 3 watt 40 ma fans that
 fit the standard computer mounting size )ie. 3 and 1/8 inch wide
 and 4 inches diagonal from hole to hole (hole=where bolt or screw
 goes through.  i have found higher (noisy) fans that are 120 v
 6 watt, but i need a quite fan.  i can use 12 volt as well, but
 found just about all 12 volt fans to be noisy.  i also find that
 the 120 v fans are not only quieter, but the blade shape has a lot
 to do with it.  i have a dead fan that was quiet in it's day.  it
 has long blades (like fan blades in a tturbo engine on a jet is
 the only way i can describe it.  the dead fan is etri model 126lh.
 actually it's not dead, it just makes a hideous rattle noise so
 it's stealthy qualities are void.  thanks.
