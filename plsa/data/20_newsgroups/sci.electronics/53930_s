     be careful.  the 41256 is organized as 4 64k sections and
     needs only 8 bits to refresh.  whereas the 44256 has 4 256k
     (ie is a 1m dram) and requires 9 bits to refresh.

     how to you plan to use it?  did apple devlope a mmu system
     for the //e?  i know the radio shack color computer can work
     with 2megs (built in mmu with extras) now.
