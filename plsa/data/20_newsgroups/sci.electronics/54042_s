 i strongly disagree. i think most pirating is done by amateurs, who won't
 copy the program if "diskcopy" can't do it.
 if you're talking a 20% max goal of pirated copies, i bet that anything that
 will beat diskcopy, and can't be easily copied from a hard drive, will
 suffice.
 i hate hard copy manuals, and would rather have all docs online - *not*
 because i want to copy the program, but because its usually faster and
 and convenient than sifting through an old book i can't find.
 
 off deeper end-> why does everyone think they need to be able to make a 
 backup copy? almost all new software must be installed to the hard disk,
 so you are left with the originals as your backups. i think its a waste
 of time, space, and money, as well as it makes it to tempting to "lend"
 out the backups. 
 
 
 no flames intended - just my thoughts.
