 mc>aye, there's the rub -- if you draw enough current to light an led, th

 mc>in the on-hook state you're not supposed to draw current.  
 
 ok lets have some calculation here: going by australian standards, which i 
 presume might be similar to other countries ( if not, lets have some 
 input) a phone uses 600ohm to loop a 48v line = 80ma. a standard led 
 drains 20ma. so what is the actual loop current required for an "off hook" 
 indication, do you know?
