 perhaps you're using the wrong brand! (sorry all hp fans, but i have
 a hard time being convinced that their scopes match the rest of their
 (excellent) gear).
 
 one of the principal functions i look for when considering a dso is
 whether you can turn interpolation off. the other important feature
 is to disable repetitive waveform acquisition i.e. being able to lock
 the instrument into real time capture mode.

 i agree with you here. the only consolation is that manufacturers are
 _beginning_ to pay attention to ergonomics when designing the menus.
 however, to be fair, it seems that first time scope users (our students)
 seem to adjust to menus easier than navigating around the twenty or
 more knobs required of a "real" scope :-)

 this is one area that newer dsos are addressing. i recently evaluated
 the latest box from tek - their tds320 - which seems to be a worthy
 alternative to a standard 100mhz analogue cro. this instrument has
 a 100mhz, 500ms/s spec, meaning that it is _always_ in real time
 capture mode. the pricing also matches equivalent analogue scopes in
 the range. the downer is that the instrument uses menus again, but at
 least they appear to be logically laid out.

 one more thing about the new, "simpler", front panels. these instruments
 tend to use digital rotary encoders as knobs now. this is a vast improvement
 over the old oak switch. the single most common cause of failure in our
 scopes (other than students blowing up inputs!) is mechanical wear on these
 switches. i look at the new panels as a great step toward increasing the
 longevity of the instruments.
