 oh, yeah.  this is a fine place.  we haven't had the "why does concrete
 kill lead-acid batteries" thread in at least six months.

 the concrete simply sucks all the electrons out of the battery and drains
 them into the ground.
 
 another explanation, implausible as it is,  is that the lead-acid battery
 needs to be periodically charged (topped-off), otherwise the battery
 self-discharges and then undergoes irreversible chemical reaction.
 
 naawwwww.... the concrete sucks the life out.
