  jh> i was wondering if people had any good uses for old
  jh> 256k simms.  i have a bunch of them for the apple mac
  jh> and i know lots of other people do to.  i have tried to
  jh> sell them but have gotten no interest.
 
     how about collecting them all together (ie everyones) and
     selling them as a lot?  the other thing is to give to a
     recycler.
 
  jh> so, if you have an inovative use (or want to buy
  jh> some simms  8-) ), i would be very interested in hearing
  jh> about it.
 
     if they are free and you can send them real cheap!  i would
     be intrested in them.  hehehe  are these 2 chip or 8 chip
     devices what speed?
 
  jh> i have seen ram disc storage devices but they have been
  jh> very pricey (plus i am still a little worried about having data
  jh> stored on ram).
 
     why?  do you use a ram disk? :)
