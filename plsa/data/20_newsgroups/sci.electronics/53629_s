 you didn't mention whether or not cost is an issue.  where
 exactly are you running 100mhz??  the digital side?  ttl?
 ecl?  we run 200mhz and 100mhz all over our ic test equipment 
 all day long in the ecl domain, and we use dip's along
 with plcc's, 25mil and 20mil pitch 256pin qfp's to name
 a few.  i don't see a problem in packaging as long
 as you adhere to sound engineering practices.  
 
 a good source of information is motorola's mecl system design
 handbook. the latest ed. is dated 2/88.  that is considered
 to be one of the *bibles* in high-speed design.
 
 the very fact that you need to build a test fixture means
 you're most likely going to need a socket.  it in itself
 has far more inductance per pin than the package you are
 testing, not to mention any impedance discontinuities.  i
 don't see the big concern over the packaging because it
 probably isn't going to make that much difference
 
 if you're trying to get ttl to run at 100mhz, have fun...
 ttl was never designed to run in a 100mhz environment.
