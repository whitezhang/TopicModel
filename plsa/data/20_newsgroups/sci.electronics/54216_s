 
 i'm wondering if i can tote my american touch tone phone around with me
 to sweden and germany.  it's dc powered, and i can buy a special adapter
 for that in europe.  the question is if the general electronics work
 the same.  i can buy a different wall plug and refit it (i'm sure i'd
 have to), but would that do the trick?
 
 thanks,
 hugo
