 i guess 100k, connecting pins 1-3 (1x), 1-6 (1y), 9-11 (2x), and 9-13 (2y).
 
 or: get an 8-bit da-converter (merely a couple of transistors and
 resistors) and an opamp to compare its output to the voltage you want to
 measure, connect them to a spared printer port (if you have one), and do
 the rest by software (stepwise refinement). the port addresses for your
 printer ports are probably: &h378 (lpt1), &h278 (lpt2). this should work
 well enough for your purposes.
 
 hope this helps
