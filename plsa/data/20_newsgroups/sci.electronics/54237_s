 
 	being in the "visualization" stage of a circuit design right now,
 i was wondering what the best way to "scale" an ac voltage using an 8-bit
 digital word is. i am thinking of using the common method of sending the
 word through an adc and then comparing it with the ac voltage (converted
 to a sawtooth wave) to get a duty cycle. however, i am leary of this
 method because it a) requires a lot of parts, and, more importantly, b)
 creates a lot of interference from the switching on the entire ac line. i
 realize that correct filtering could cancel out most of this interference,
 but that would require more parts and boost the price further.
 	someone mentioned to me that they had seen an ic which input 8
 bits of data and directly scaled the ac voltage coming in all on-chip.
 unfortunately, he couldn't remember the chip number or the manufacturer;
 if anyone else has heard of this chip, please e-mail me.
 	i am building this project as a "dimmer box" for a light
 controller circuit and it is important that the cost of each box remains
 very low because one dimmer is required for each light that the user
 wishes to control (well, each channel, at least). therefor, if each box
 costs $150, i doubt that an end user will want to dish out ($150 x 16 =
 $2400) for sixteen channels... this is something i have noticed about
 today's dimmer boxes; they are so expensive!
 	anyway, any help which someone could offer on either a method of
 easily doing this or info about the chip which will do it for me (always
 the preferred method... :) will be greatly appreciated!
