 : look guys, what's the problem here?  if you want a light that goes on when 
 : the 'phone is *off* hook, all you need it to run it in *series* with the 
 : line, as i mentioned in my previous post.  if you want a light that goes on 
 : when the 'phone is *on* hook, all you need is a voltage threshold detector.
 
 if you're going to do the series diode thing (which is the easiest), just
 make sure that the led can take the current (i can't recall it off-hand, but
 it's something like 100ma or more?)
