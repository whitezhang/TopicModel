 well, i'm not sure i'd use this to process a guitar but there was a audio
 filter dsp construction article in the sept 92 issue of qst magazine (ham radio
 oriented).  the dsp is available in kit form for about $120.
 
 this particular dsp filter was targetted toward processing audio to remove
 noise (static).  i built it and it really works well.  the source code is
 available too.  it makes a noisy audio signal much easier to hear.  note that
 this is for communication applications and is not "high fidelity".
