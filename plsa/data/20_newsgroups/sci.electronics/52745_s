 rs components (they exist in australia and the uk. don't know about the us) have
 little chips called isolated max 250 and 251. they give you isolated rs-232 from
 a single 5v supply. external components are 4 caps, 4 optoisolators, a diode,
 and an isloting transformer. they go up to 19.2k baud..
