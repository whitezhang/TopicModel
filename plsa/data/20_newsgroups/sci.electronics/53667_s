 	this is a followup post to something i've written previously.  several
 people responded with good information, but i don't think i communicated 
 exactly what i am looking for.
 	i'm working on a custom i/o device that will communicate with a host
 via rs-232.  my custom circuitry will use an 80c186eb or ec cpu and require
 about 64k of ram (preferably flash ram).  in looking around, i see that lots
 of people have engineered uart-cpu-rom-ram subsystems that are ready to be
 interfaced to your custom i/o devices.  it's been done so much, that it 
 would be best if i can avoid reinventing a system.  it just needs to use
 an 80c186 (or 188) cpu, and be able to load a program from the host then 
 transfer control to that program.  well, there's one other thing the rom
 needs to know how to do.  it should have routines to send and receive bytes
 to/from the host, that utilize the hardware control lines (dtr,rts,dts,cts).
 everything i've seen is in the $200.00 and up range.  that's too much for
 this application.  i need something around $100.00.  the cpu has the uart
 built-in, so you're only looking at a few chips.  does anyone know a 
 company that markets a good board in this range, or some public domain 
 circuitry i can use?  thanks in advance for the info.
