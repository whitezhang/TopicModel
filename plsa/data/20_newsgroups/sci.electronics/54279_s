 the major problem with this is that the reaction takes place in an acid solution.
 pbso4 is soluble in an acid solution and will not precipitate out.  also, h2so4
 is in a water solution as 2h30+ and so4--.  thus the heats of formation of
 pbso4 and h2so4 are for the most part irrelevant.

 as it turns out the reaction is indeed exothermic (heat producing).
 (more about this later.)
 
 what actually happens to make the battery completely useless is this:
 (we're talking lead-acid batteries of course)
 the battery slowly self discharges.  as this discharge takes place two things
 happen. -the level of pb++ ions in the acid solution increases (i.e. the lead
            and lead oxide plates are dissolved).
         -the level of h30+ ions in the acid solution decreases (i.e. the solution
            becomes less acidic, or more like water if you like).
 now, as the post to which i am responding correctly stated, pbso4 will precipitate
 in a water (non-acid) solution.  when the battery dies (i.e. is fully discharged)
 we end up with a high concentration of pb++ and so4-- in water.  so pbso4
 forms in the solution and falls to the bottom of the battery (of course this
 happens in varying degrees, the more discharged, the more precipitate forms).
 
 the precipitate forms a conductive layer on the bottom of the battery.  if
 there is enough of the lead and lead oxide plates left to touch the precipitate
 (more common in a newer battery) a dead short results.
 
 i have seen products in automotive shops to correct this condition, but they
 are for the most part useless.  they can dissolve the pbso4 but cannot restore
 the lead and lead oxide plates properly.  you may have some success with
 these products for a newer battery.

 this stuff is just made up by the author and is completely invalid.
 in fact the discharge reaction takes place at a higher rate at higher
 temperatures.  a logical consequence of the above argument is this:
 "if you really want your car to start, lower the battery temperature to
  -50 to 'pull' the reaction along."  we all know from experience (at
  least those of us in canada do (it gets cold up here)) that this is
 not true.  if we want to start our car on a really cold day we warm
 the battery.
 
 (besides which, there is not enough energy released through self discharge
  to appreciably raise the temperature.  the air would amply dissipate any
  such heat, whether the bottom of the battery was insulated or not.  this
  is of course irrelevant, since you would want the battery to be cool
  during storage.)
 
 just keep the battery in a cool dry place and keep it charged!
