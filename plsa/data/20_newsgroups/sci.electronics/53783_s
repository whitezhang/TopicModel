 yes, i know it sounds crazy. call it an urge. call it what you want.
 just don't ask why :-)
 
 anyway, i'd like to build a uv flashlight, cheaply. "flashlight" means
 it should be reasonably portable, but could have a power pack if
 necessary.
 
 my main question is the bulb: where can i get uv bulbs? do they
 need a lot of power? etc., etc.
 
 i'm not too concerned with whether it's long-wave or short-wave
 (but hey, if anyone has a cheap source of bulbs, i'll take both).
 
 one other thing: a friend of mine mentioned something about near-uv
 light being cheaper to get at than actual uv light. does anyone
 know what he was referring to?
 
 thanks much.
