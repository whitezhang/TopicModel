        it's possible to make boards in other colors, and i have an ad
 for laser light-show equipment which offers the circuit boards in your
 choice of day-glo (tm) colors.
 
        the usual light green color is just the natural color of fiberglas.
 the dark green or blue is the solder mask layer, and i suspect that color
 is a dye.
