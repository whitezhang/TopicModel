 
 i'm doing sound for a couple of bands around here and we need direct
 input boxes for the keyboards.  these are the little boxes that take a
 line level out of the keyboard and transform it into low-z for the run
 to the mixer.  sadly they cost like $50 (or more) each and i'm going
 to need like 5 or 10 of them!  i looked inside one (belonging to
 another band) and it looks like just a transformer.  does anyone have
 any plans for building them?  perhaps in anderton's "electronic
 projects for musicians" book (which i am having a hell of a time
 tracking down...)?
 
 thanks a lot!

 ps: post or email.  i read this group...
