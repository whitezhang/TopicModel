 with regards to what you wrote, how does one "adjust for room dynamics 
 and stuff like that"?  i asked a professor that question just
 last week and he didn't really know himself.  since pink noise is believed
 to be due to surface states (say, the surface of the silicon where there's
 a lack of a covalent bond) that act as "traps" to nearby elecrons, and since
 this happens at low frequencies (because at high frequencies they aren't
 able to "trap" electrons), how do you compensate for that?  it seems to me
 that you wouldn't be able to compensate for pink noise.  i have seen the
 "pink noise" feature, however, on many eqs, and i was wondering
 how they are suppose to compensate for noise when pink noise is not due to
 "man made noise" like power lines, crosstalks, coupling, etc.  if you have
 any information about this, it would be appreciated.  hope this didn't sound
 too drawn out.  thanx.
