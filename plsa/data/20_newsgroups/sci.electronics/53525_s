 the pricing of parts reminds me of something a chemist once said to me:
 
 "a gram of this dye costs a dollar.
 it comes out of a liter jar which also costs a dollar.
 and if you want a whole barrel of it, that also costs a dollar."
 
 i.e., they charge you almost exclusively for packaging it and delivering
 it to you -- the chemical itself (in that particular case) was a byproduct
 that cost almost nothing intrinsically.
