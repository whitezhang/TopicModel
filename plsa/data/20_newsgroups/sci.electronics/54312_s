 rubbish. the reason for the colour of the boards depends on the solder
 mask that is used. older boards (bakelite and phenolic) rarely used
 a solder mask (these boards are not suited well to automatic stuffing
 and soldering techniques) and hence are the colour of the compound
 used to make them. these days boards are made of fibreglass for most
 general purpose uses and have a solder mask applied to them to prevent
 close traces shorting to one another during soldering (and also to prevent
 the decomposition of traces under harsh environments). the light and dark
 green boards ofter seen have a "dry film" mask applied to them (usually
 applied as a complete film photographically produced). the blue (and red
 or orange) boards are a two-part epoxy or a liquid-imageable resist
 formulation and are applied in a different manner. there's a lot of info
 about the pro's and con's of each, but that's another story...
