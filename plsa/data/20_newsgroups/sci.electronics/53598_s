 one thing to consider is time division multiplexing the emg
 channels to reduce the number of rf carriers you have to generate.
 if you multiplexed the emg inputs at 10khz, that would probably be
 sufficient for most physiology studies (you'd have ~ 330 hz per
 channel sampling rate.)  that level of analog multiplexing should
 be rather easy to accomplish.
 
 combining a lot of rf carriers is pretty tricky to do without
 generating intermodulation.  a system to be carried by a runner is
 in a fairly harsh environment and would probably be difficult to
 keep balanced.
 
 a commercial hand-held transciever could probably be employed with
 a little modification to accomodate widening the bandwidth.
 obviously, this has to be done in accordance with whatever laws
 govern the use of transeivers in your location.
