 i missed the first article[s] on this line due to not having a
 chance to read the news for a couple of days...
 
 the idea is commercialized in at least one product, the private
 eye.  that's a small cube-shaped device that the user straps around
 the head similar to a sweat band.  there is a boom that comes from
 the side on which the device is mounted so that it is positioned
 in front of the user's eye.
 
 the private eye we had here for evaluation was hercules-mda
 compatible.  the innards are a row (~400 leds) that are swept up
 and down by a galvonometer-like movement.  the result is that the
 sweeping led bar forms a fused raster.  there is a virtual image
 projected in front of the user that the visual system tends to fuse
 with the background.
 
 i didn't like the device very much.  i found it easiest to use if i
 looked at a blank white wall.  i had problems with focus tracking
 if i glanced down to look at my keyboard for an out-of-the-way key.
 the unit also emitted a soft buzz and vibration which i found
 annoying.  some people didn't seem to mind the buzz.  properly
 used, however, the image clarity was quite crisp.
 
 i don't know if the company has taken the technology any further in
 the last year or two, but it did seem to have promise.
