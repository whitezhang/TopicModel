 you still need to supply a proper ground for a ground fault circuit interrupter!
 so rewiring is still a part of this job, however, the ground may be connected to
 a local earth ground, rather than back at the breaker box.
 
 as jamie said, gfci devices are required by code in a number of places, most
 notably: bathrooms, and outside the house.  i do suggest the use of gfci outlets,
 rather than the breakers.  you will end up with much less headaches.  noise pickup
 in long cable runs is sometimes enough to cause frequent tripping of the breakers.
 
 gfci devices do save lives, if you decide to install them, be sure to check them
 regularly (using the test button).
 
 running the family business (electrical supplies and lighting) for many years, i
 have seen too many seasoned electricians fried, because they forgot to double check
 their common sense list.  please exercise caution.
