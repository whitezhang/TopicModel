 very interesting application, controlled lighting and environment, moderate
 distances ... might be more interesting than my application.  just a thought,
 you could use a roof mounted ir sender, similar in operation to a tv remote
 control that tells each persons coded ir pulser to send a pulse.  a hamamatsu
 detector, as was mentioned in a previous message in this thread, would give
 the current position.  store and collate this on a computer and you could
 replay the movements on the screen.  interesting!
