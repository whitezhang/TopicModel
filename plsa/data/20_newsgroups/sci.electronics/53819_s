 what do you mean by "police band" - there is no such thing.
 
 anyway, radar detectors work in shared bands.
 if you applied your test, all of those radar operated door
 openers in malls would be illegal.
 
 one of the great problems here is that there are too many
 ill-educated (read illiterate) people making too many laws
 about subjects on which they are incompetent - there may well
 be laws refereing to "police bands", they are almost certainly
 local in scope (state or county) - created by well-meaning,
 but incompetent idiots.
 
 unfortunaltely, laws do not have to be sensible (or even enforceable).
 lawmakers exist to pass laws - and will continue to do so, until
 the day where you are faced with death for not doing x, and
 amputation of all your limbs for doing x ... the choice will be yours.
