 hi,
 	just a quick question.  what standard lab solvents can be used to
 clean electronic equipment and components safely (ie not corrode, dissolve,
 short-out, etc the equipment)?
 	water?	:-)
 	methanol?
 	ccl4?
 	etc?
 i am not an electronics type (surprise, surprise), and i want to avoid using
 freons.
 
 thanks,		adrian
