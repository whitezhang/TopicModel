 are you saying that you have some extras that you would like to do some cost
 recovery on?  i may be interested.  i think for practical and cost reasons i
 am limited to envelope detection so that leaves me with only increasing the
 output power and increasing the optical gain at the receiver as methods to
 extend range.

 yes i'm interested in the company name.  i have access to an extensive data
 book collection.  with that kind of power, are we getting into an area where
 eye safety is getting to be a problem.

 they are a long way from me but they might be a better source than i can find
 around here.

 i'm keeping my application confidential for now.  raising the frequency should
 be no problem, in fact one respondent to my question said that i may not have
 to mimic the 50% duty cycle normally used by ir detector chips.
