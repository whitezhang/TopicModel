 do you know what a bi-metallic strip is?
 just in case: it is two strips of different metals bonded together, which 
 when heated bend to one side (check out the blinker globe in your 
 christmas tree lights).
 
 so when you turn on the power, this causes the bulb to work like a neon, 
 heating up and shorting out, thus providing a loop to power the heaters in 
 the main tube. when the tube fires, insufficient current runs through the 
 starter to keep the heat up and the bi-metalic strip straightens out 
 (o/c).
 
 btw, i too thought that they were nothing more than a small neon, so one 
 day when the neon in my sisters digital (flip the metal squares type) 
 clock broke (flimsy leads), i replaced it with one from a starter. well 
 powering up made a bit of a mess of the clock!
