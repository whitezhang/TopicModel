 heh, heh, heh, heh....i laugh because i have the same damn tv, and it
 did the same thing!  actually it is a goldstar, but it's essentially the
 same tv and electronics--just a different face plate and name.
 
 #1.  fortunately, tv tubes don't explode.  i'd think the tv mfrs want
 to make this possibility remote as possible.  if at all, they'll 
 *implode* and the glass that blows out would be the result of the
 glass boucing off the back of the tube due to the implosion. in any
 case, don't kick it around! :-) 
 
 #2  i fixed the tv after getting a hold of some schematics.  it turned
 out to be a blown 2w resistor feeding the flyback transformer.  i guess
 the original resistor was a bit too small to dissipate the heat it
 created, burning itself out.  i checked to make sure the flyback wasn't
 shorted or anything first!  oh, luckily, i had a resistor handy lying
 around that had just the right value for what i needed.  i can't see it
 being more than 50 cents!.
 
 well, needless to say, the tv still works today.  so go get a set of
 schematics and have some fun...just don't get shocked poking around
 the flyback.
