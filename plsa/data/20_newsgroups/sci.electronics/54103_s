 i'm glad to see this idea come up because i've had something similar in mind.
 what if you had an authorization key that computed from the name and address 
 data.  when the user registers, you don't even need to send executable code, 
 just compute his/her key and send him/her instructions to enter in the 
 appropriate place the following:
 
 name=joe doe
 address=123 main street
 city=anytown, ca
 key=ldslfoialsdkcdsngsikhsfd
 
 every user needs a unique key.  the executable can propagate as much as you 
 like, the author can respond to the registration by e-mail, post card, 
 whatever.  unauthorized users would have to put up with someone else's name 
 showing up (maybe on a main menu screen as well as a startup message).  
 authorized users can make as many copies as they like, upgrade their 
 machines, whatever.  the main motivation here is guilt and irritation at 
 seeing someone other than yourself as the "registered owner".
