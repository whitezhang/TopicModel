 the standard at bus (isa) runs at 8mhz, not 12.5 mhz, but some 
 non-stnadard isa buses do have higher clock rates, but be careful, since 
 some boards don't work with faster than standard rates.  for instance, my 
 486 has adjustable at bus speeds, and my pas16 audio card chokes when i do 
 ad data acquisition with a bus speed faster than 10mhz.
 
 the fact that non-turbo-mode speed a/d doesn't work is weird.  you may 
 have a motherboard with a hardware 'bug'.  
 
 33 mhz bus on the 486dx2 66 does refer to the local bus.  fyi: the at bus 
 operates asynchronously, and is linked to the local bus via a 'bus 
 interface', which is one function that your 'chipset'.
