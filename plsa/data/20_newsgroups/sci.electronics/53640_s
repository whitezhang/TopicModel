 check with kyocera america, inc.
            24 prime park way, suite 150
            natick, ma 01760
 
 they are one of the largest manufacturers of ic packaging in the
 world.
 
 it sounds like you would be a good candidate for wafer probing or at
 least ic probing to test performance.  hp, cascade microtech and
 tektronix should be able to help you here.  one note, testing at high
 frequency accurately can be an *expensive* business.
