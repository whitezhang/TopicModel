 yes. it's called radar.

 depends on the environment: in a static environent such as a waveguide yes, in
 a dynamic environment (with objects moving about) the multipath kills this
 concept.

 what is the difference between vertical and horizontal?

 this depends on the required range, the required accuracy, the allowable
 ambiguity in range, the frequencies the fcc (etc) allow you to use.
