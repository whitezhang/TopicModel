 the actual hourglass is hollow and is designed to generate a draft,
 exploiting the venturi effect.  around the base of the hourglass is a
 ring of water towers.  warm river water, coming from the steam condenser
 in the plant, is sprayed over louvres.  the draft being pulled through
 the tower cools the water by both evaporation and convection.  the
 sensible heat extracted from the cooling water is the driving force for
 draft generation.
 
 it should be noted that the hourglass-shaped cooling towers are used on
 both fossile and nuclear plants.  it should also be noted that at 
 locations where water is plentiful, the cooling towers are only used part
 time, when the discharge temperature would exceed some release limit.
 it was once thought that the warm discharge water was damaging to fish.
 fishermen know that is thoroughly incorrect.  nontheless, stringent,
 usually state, regulations remain in some instances.  since it typically
 takes 60,000 hp worth of pumping to move the volume of water needed 
 to cool a 1000 mwe plant, the cost of using the towers is not insignificant.
