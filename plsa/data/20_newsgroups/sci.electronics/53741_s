 here's a rough sketch of how the system works.  a reference station
 with a very exactly known position computes the errors in the
 incoming gps signals.  these errors are due to several factors
 including atmospheric distortion, sa (selective availability) time
 dithering, etc.  the reference unit contains complex computational 
 equipment to "back out" the errors in its position (since it knows
 where it is already).  it then transmits these corrections on a 
 broadcast which is available to any number of relatively local
 receivers.  if the receivers are nearby (<300km) and are using
 the same satellites as the reference unit, the errors should be very
 similar for the reference unit and the receiver unit.  thus, the
 receiver unit may apply the corrections calculated by the reference
 unit.
 
 the us coast guard is currently (as far as i know) installing a series
 of coastline transmitters for differential gps.  these stations will
 use existing radio towers.  i believe the frequency is to be approximately
 305 khz.  there are many other private corporations offering dgps signals
 on different frequencies.  for example, pinpoint ((310)-618-7076) offers
 correction signals and receiver units using an fm broadcast system
 which has stations all across the us.
 
 the correction codes are usually transmitted using the rtcm 104 format.
 advertised accuracies espouse 1 to 5 meter errors.
