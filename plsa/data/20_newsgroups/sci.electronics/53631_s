 	nonsense.  first, the uranium fuel is sealed in zirconium
 alloy cylinders (which don't melt in any circumstances short of 
 major failure of the power plant).  second, the primary water
 (that circulates inside the reactor core) is never pumped into the
 cooling tower (it's the secondary water cycle that goes 
 through the cooling tower).  third, liquid uranium would burst
 into flame on contact with air.

 	cleaning crew working in a mist of uranium?  this is a
 toxic heavy metal, even if it weren't radioactive.  shouldn't there
 be some smileys here?  or frowneys?
