 from what i understand about radar dectectors all they are is a passive
 device much like the radio in your car.  they work as an antenna picking
 up that radar signals that the radar gun sends out.  therefore there would
 be no way of detecting a radar detector any more than there would be of
 detecting whether some one had a radio in their car.
