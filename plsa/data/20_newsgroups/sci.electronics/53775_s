 i haven't been following this, so i'm sorry if somebody already mentioned  
 this, but you could grab a lemon (i think potatoes work too, but i'm not  
 sure), a strip of copper, and a strip of zinc (i think you can get the  
 metal in a hardware store or hobby shop, maybe??).  stick the strips in  
 the lemon (so they don't touch!) and you'll get a measurable voltage (not  
 a lot, but, hey, it's a lemon :-)  ).  as i recall we had to hook  
 something like ten of these things to get an appreciable amount of  
 current, because of the mondo internal resistance, but if you just need a  
 demo you might get it to run a tiny fan or something! :-)
