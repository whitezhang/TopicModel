 there is a correclation between warm-running amps and good sound,
 or in your words, "it does have a bearing on....".
 
 now, i don't suggest that everyone run out and create combination
 stove/amplifiers that will degrade lifespan,
 but a cold-running circuit is much more suceptible to temperature
 variation with varrying current than is a warm-running one.  and since
 junction resistance is a function of temperature, this has a detrimental
 effect on linearity.  
 
 a few facts:
 -bias points vary with temperature
 -junction resist varrie with temp
 -adcom products do not run class-a
 
 if you still don't beleive this assertion, consider the warm-up requirements
 for most good test equipment, or better yet, just listen to an amplifier
 warm-up.  on many designs its quite audible, on mine, about 20 minutes for
 the output stage, many hours for the drivers.  fortunately the drivers
 are not switched.
 
 in any experiment, or when drawing conclusions from listening,
 betcareful to seperate the effect of device temperature from bias
 (idle current) level.  both have a positive correlation with low
 distortion and "good" sound quality, and high bias results in
 warmer operation, all other factors being equal.
