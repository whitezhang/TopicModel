 yes.
 
 i use 74hc4066 and others commerically for this purpose so rest assured it 
 works fine. in one case i route bit serial digital audio using these and it 
 is difficult to see any signal degradation at all which surprised me given 
 some pretty fast edges. hc4066 is spec'd at something like -3db @ 200mhz into 
 50 ohms. the more complex types are generally a little slower and more 
 resistive.
 
 plain 4000 series are not so good at handling 5v logic.
 
 remember that the output load is seen by the input device.
