 hi all,
 
 i am looking for a new oscilloscope (bk 1541-b, it looks like, goldstar os904s
 if i can find one cheap enough) and would like suggestions on a low-priced
 source for them.
 
 (currently, btw, fry's electronics in los angeles has the 1541-b for $598,
  the best price i've seen overall for now - they carry the gs os902s for 
  $490, but i need the 904s because of the 40 mhz b/w)
 
 thanks all.
