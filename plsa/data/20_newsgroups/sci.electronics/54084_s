 i just got caller-id (except bell calls it "call display" and didn't know
 what i was talking about when i asked for "caller-id").  i got the
 cheapest display box i could find, and hope to convert it to serial out.
 
 the chip used is an 18-pin dip marked "cdt 14-285" and "1473 9220".
 i presume the 9220 is the date.
 
 i'm hoping somebody out there knows something about this chip, to save
 me a very strange few hours hooked up to a scope, asking my friends to
 call me again and again.
 
 i'll post any interesting replies, and my experiences.
