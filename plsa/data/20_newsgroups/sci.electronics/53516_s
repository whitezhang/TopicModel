 of course you could develope this system, but there is already a system called global
 positioning satellites.  it gives three dimensional coordinates anywhere on earth. 
 many surveyors use this system with a differential receiver/transmitter to get
 coordinates within centimeters.  basic receivers with resolution of a few meters (on
 a good day) are available from many sources.
