 sci.e(e) netters:
 
 i am setting out to build and market a small electronic device that 
 requires an lcd display.  all of the analog electronics are working 
 fine, i have ordered a pic ice (not vice versa) since the pics are so 
 cheap and low-power, but i am having a devil of a time finding any 
 lcd displays in the 6-8 digit range that are priced as low as i need.  i 
 am looking for somthing in the range of $1 in quantities of about 
 1000-10,000.
 
 mainstream distributors like almac cannot help me without a part 
 number, or when they do look around for something in their line 
 they find a $15 8-digit lcd.  even digikey's cheapest offering is $5 in 
 quantity.
 
 i know lcd displays like this must exist because i see whole 
 calculators for sale for $4.99, meaning the retailer probably buys it 
 for $3.50 and the wholesaler probably gets it for $2.50 or so.  this 
 $2.50 includes assembly labor, packaging, sales, transportation, 
 import duties, the case and keyboard, the pc board, the processor 
 chip, the solar cell --- and the lcd.  the lcd can't cost much.
 
 if anyone could put me in touch with some manufacturers and/or 
 distributors that handle such things i would be much obliged.

 p.s.  i have tried tearing apart several cheap consumer devices that 
 have lcds only to find that the lcds are unlabelled.  has anyone else 
 had better luck with this strategy?
