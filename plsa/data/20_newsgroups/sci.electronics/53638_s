 i keep finding these programmers in local junk shops. this may
 mean that they are indeed junk - but i'd like to hear from anyone 
 else that may have met up with them. the basic device is a
 "data i/o 29a universal programmer", and the usual pod is a 
 "logicpak 303a-vo4" with a "303a-001" programming tester/
 adapter. i'd really like to hear from anyone who knows whether
 these monsters are worth bothering with. all i want to do is blast
 palce22v10s. - ideas, folks
 mike.
