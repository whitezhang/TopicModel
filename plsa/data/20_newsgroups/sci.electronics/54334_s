 yet another suggestion, but this one is non-toxic (although i would handle
 it like any other cleaner) and it smells nice.  the chemical is called
 d-limonene, and it smells like lemon peels (i think it is a lemon extract
 of some kind).  you might find it in a hardware store, sold as a
 general-purpose solvent, but your best bet would be any bike store --
 it is used as a chain-cleaning fluid.  it works on sticker glue, crayons,
 grease, oil, etc.
 
 it's clear yellow in the bottle, and you can use it straight; if you add
 water, it changes to a creamy consistency, which is good for some jobs.
