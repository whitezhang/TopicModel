 	there should be a connection of the ground wire to a ground
 in the breaker box.  there also should be a connection of the neutral
 wire to a ground in the breaker box.  there should be no other 
 place in the building where such a connection occurs (i.e. not in
 any of the outlet boxes).
 
 	the neutral (white) wire is a 'grounding conductor' for
 the plug, and is not safe to touch, while the ground (green)
 wire is a 'protective ground' and carries no current unless
 some kind of electrical fault has occurred.  it's safe
 to touch the protective ground, but not to touch the 
 grounding conductor (because there is current in the grounding
 conductor, its outlet-box end will not be at the same ground
 potential as its breaker-box end).
