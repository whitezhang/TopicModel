 if your looking for leds in the $.10-$.20 range, forget it. blue leds just
 recently became available and the materials they are made of are expensive.
 maybe in the future they will become less expensive (and brighter), but
 for now it's going to cost you and the output will be limited. if they ever
 do get as efficient and cost effective as red and green leds, you're probably
 going to see a whole new family of color displays.
