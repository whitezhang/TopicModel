 might be a good idea...  the resolution you requested is about 0.3mv
 in order to get what you've paid for, noise level better be lower than
 that.  it is kind of hard to do it in a noisy box like you can expect
 inside a pc.
 
 before you pay $$$ for a pc card, test it out by sampling a low
 distortion sine wave (i think there is a sine wave on a cd.  digital
 domain ?  there are possibly other low thd sources)  run the digitized
 waveform through a fft transform and take alook at the noise floor on
 the spectrum.  that's should give you a good indication of the design.
 (that's what i am doing to test a data acquistion system i have designed
 - i got the idea from maxim data sheet.)
 
 if you can live with 14 bit resolution, i would recommend looking at
 the max121 from maxim.  it is a high speed (308khz) complete
 sampling a/d with dsp interface.  the input range is +/- 5v and it
 uses a serial interface (which can easily be optically isolated
 from the computer to elinimate a major noise source)  the analog design
 guide i got from them shows a -100db noise level.  they claim a -77db
 max (-85 typ.) thd.  looks pretty good for the $12 @ 1000 pieces
 
 a evaluation kit is available.  might want to give these nice folks a
 call.  1-800-998-8800 or fax: (408)737-7194 and (408) 737-7600 ext4000
 for application assistance.
 
 this assumes that you can build your own das and write your own software.
 (hey you can get the max121 as a free sample just by calling the 1-800 #)

 i would recommend you to find out the resolution that can be gotten out
 of your system by looking at the noise level, otherwise you might be
 throwing out your money.

 i have no connection with maxim except i do in general recommend
 companies that give samples to students to others.  i feel they
 deserve that for being nice to me.
