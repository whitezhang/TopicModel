 not that the question is anything important, but i am still curious:
 why is that almost all printed circuit boards are green? i have seen
 a few blue ones, but no red, yellow, company logo etc. is there a
 technical reason or could it be that the marketing "geniuses" have
 not tought about it (yet)?
