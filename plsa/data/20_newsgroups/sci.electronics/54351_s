 accelerometers are not cheap, mainly because the outputs are fairly linear 
 with respect to acceleration.  you don't say what the range of acceleration 
 you want to measure is, and there are other ways in which to measure it 
 other than using an accelerometer.  additional information would be helpful 
 to anyone who may respond.
 
 call, if you wish.
