 definately, i agree wholeheartedly.  if they can build the amp where
   the labour is not so expensive, they can afford to put decent
   components in and go to more effort to improve the design of the
   amplifier - as adcom has done.

 sure, i didn't mean to imply that because of the heat generated, the
   amp sounds good.  my adcom gfp 535ii runs fairly warm - not hot to
   the touch - but enough to satisfy me that the amp is running nicely.
 i don't like it when an amp runs dead-cold.  it makes one think that
   the amp is doing nothing :)
 the heatsinks that adcom uses in their amps are certainly far for
   skimpy - they're massive things with heating vents both below
   and above.  more than enough to carry away excessive heat.
 
 my opinions once again.
