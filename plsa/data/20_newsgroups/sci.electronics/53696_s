 
 i recently bought an apparantly complete expansion chassis by mountain
 computer inc.  it consists of a box with 8 apple ][+ compatible slots,
 powersupply brick, interface card and ribbon cable to attach it to the computer
 to be expanded.  there was also included a small card with empty sockets on top
 and pins on the bottom that looks like it would plug into the ][+ motherboard
 somewhere after pulling a chip.  there's an empty socket also on the interface
 card and a short 16-pin dip jumper like the ones used with ][+ language cards.
  
 this technological marvel came with no docs and i haven't a clue as how to hook
 this thing up.  if anyone has docs and/or users disk of any sort for this i
 could really use copies of them or at least some help.
  
 i need to know:
  
 o how to orient the ribbon cable between the card and the chassis.
 o how to attach the short cable from the motherboard to the card
   and if the small card is used.
 o the purposes of the various jumper-pins on the card (it has more
   of those than my cms scsi card!)
