 in making batteries you could use copper and zinc in an acid electrolyte.     
 copper=copper wire (pennies are now mostly zinc if i recall correctly)
 zinc= zinc strip (hardware stores arround here (seattle) sell this to prevent
       moss buildup on the roof. an alternative would be to use a galvanized
       (zinc coated) nail
 electrolyte= lemon juice -> citric acid is the active ingrediant(sp).
  
 volta (late 18th century scientist) used a stack for his batteries-
 copper disk, paper disk soaked in acid, zinc disk, copper disk, paper ....
 they were advanced technology for the time.
