 last week i asked for help in getting an old homemade amp working with
 my sun cd-rom drive. it turns out that the channel i was testing with
 was burned out in the amp. the other channel works fine.
 
 so now i need a new amplifier chip. my local radio shack no longer
 carries components! the chip is a 12 pin sip (?) labelled with ba5406
 and then "502 515" below that.
 
 does anyone have a source? thanks,
