 i have a mosfet pulled out of a trygon power supply, for which i have no 
 manual.  it's a motorola part with a 1972 date code and the number
 
 		285-4
 
 which the motorola folks assure me is a house number, which they can't
 help me with.  any suggestions from folks out there?  i can't put it on
 a curve tracer to try to get an equivalent, since it's completely shot.
