 hi,
 	i am looking for a very high speed 
 d/a converter (at least 8bits and 150mhz) for
 a research application. a paper in  the january
 issue of ieee solid-state circuits mentions a 
 gaas, 1ghz, 8bit dac - anyone know where i can find
 such a thing? even a somewhat slower si dac would
 do.
 	needless to say, i have looked in all the
 conventional places (vitesse, motorola, national,
 etc. etc.). any pointers would be appreciated.
