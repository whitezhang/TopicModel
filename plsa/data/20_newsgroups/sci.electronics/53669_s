 recently i posted two oscilliscopes for sale. one has sold, the other is
 still available:
  used, good condition:
  hitachi v-422 40mhz dual-channel portable analog oscilliscope
    o 1mv/div
    o dc offset
    o alternate magnification (10x magnified & non-magnified
      waveform)
    o vert mode trigger
    o tv sync separation circuit
  list price      $910.00 (...and the price fry's electronics just
                          quoted!) :-(
  sells for       $699.99 (jdr microdevices current price)
                  $745.95 (products international)
  your price used $425.00 obo
 ...i haven't gotten an offer at the asking price, so 'obo' applies...
 
 i also have a 'broken' version of the scope which sold:
  jdr 2000 20mhz dual-channel portable analog oscilliscope
    o 5mv/div
    o component tester (resistors/caps/diodes/coils)
    o tv video sync filter
    o z-axis input (intensity modulation)
 
 'broken' means: the crt produces a nice, bright trace, but the trace does
 not correspond to the input signal. my guess is it's repairable but more
 than a simple calibration problem...but i honestly have not tried to
 calibrate the scope or otherwise fix it. it's 'as-is'.
 i paid $60 for it in its current state (i bought it thinking i'd repair it,
 using the 'good' scope for side-by-side comparison...since i've sold the
 'good' scope, the 'bad' one doesn't do me much good) and i'd like to recoup
 that amount. as above, i'll accept offers and take the best one.
 
 i'd prefer a local (bay area, california) buyer, so (a) i don't have to
 ship it and (b) she or he can examine the scope prior to purchase.
