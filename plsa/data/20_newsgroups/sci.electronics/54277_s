 just saw an article in new scientist; at&t videophones won't talk to (?)bti 
 videophones. the at&t ones use a 19.2kb modem, bti uses 14.4kb. at&t models 
 have to communicate using all at&t exchanges, whereas the bti can route 
 via most current exchanges. suggestions include building standards converters 
 into telephone exchanges - the mind boggles :)= . the bti design is a bit 
 more conservative and is better able to cope with current data compression 
 hardware on long-distance lines.
 
 (not having the magazine to hand, i may have mis-remembered bti. i think it
 is a british one made by gec-marconi, and currently selling to other
 countries). 
 
 yet another standards screw-up.
