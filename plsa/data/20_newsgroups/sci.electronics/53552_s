 
 	greetings. i've been seeing the word "storage" mentioned
 	around oscilliscopes but i'm curious, what does it mean?
 
 	if my life depended on it, i'd say that it's a scope that
 	uses long-persistance phosphor to keep the successive
 	taces on the screen for some unit of time - "store" them.
 	do i get to live?
 
 	also, i've been shopping for a decent, used, [old] scope
 	since my tek 514a (portable...not!) and my heathkit o-1000
 	are all single trace and i need more... like 2 or 3 and at
 	least 50mhz (maybe 100...)
 
 	during my shopping at hamfests etc. i've run into the 
 	problem of "old scope" terminology. i can imagine what
 	a "mainframe" and "plug-in" are but some things like
 	the above "storage", "coax input" (hey, where do i get a 
 	probe that fits this? i had to fiddle with mine for a week 
 	before i got anything resembling "a good trace" - they all
 	come with bnc connectors!), "unblanking" (huh?), and, oh,
 	just like my 514 manuals, many changes were made along the
 	way to the schematic - scopes, even with identical model 
 	numbers, have different (better?) response/performance than
 	others - how can i pick the better one? does the rule of the
 	higher sn the better apply?
 
 	take care.
