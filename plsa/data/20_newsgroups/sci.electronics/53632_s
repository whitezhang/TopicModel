 has anybody out there used/tested these new fluke scopemeters?
 how do they compare to a low-end tectronix oscilloscope? are
 there any big drawbacks about these handheld scopes when
 compared to the benchtop scopes of the same price range
 ($1000-$2000)?
 
 any info on the fluke scopemeters would be greatly appreciated.
 
 thanks,
