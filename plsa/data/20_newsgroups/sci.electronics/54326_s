   well, bertil, you might laugh, but in many places here in austria, there are
 no wall jacks yet, either - just wires sticking out of the wall (and put into
 a closed, often sealed, box) :-)
   as far as i remember from germany, it is a nicely mixed situation - somebody
 had wires sticking, somebody had jacks...
   on the other hand, everywhere in bohemia i have seen wall jacks, and never
 seen just wires sticking out of the wall... and i thought slovakia was the
 same case. well...
 
   "how much do scandinavians know about the rest of europe?? :-))"
