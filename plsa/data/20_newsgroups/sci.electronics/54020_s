 	some tv's, including my rca set at home, uses simple carriers
 which i think run between 32 and 36 or 38 khz.  there is no tone decoding
 in it.  all one has to do to piss the thing off :-) is just hook an
 irled up to a variable oscillator and tune through.  wreaks all kinds
 of havoc.  :-)
 
 	similarly, my vcr remote changes channels on my cable box.  always
 seems to change the cable box to channel 5 when you do the pause/play.
 
 	soooo, some things do have some overlap to them.
