 you might want to get a disposible flash camera, shoot the roll of film,
 then take it apart (they're snapped together). we used a bunch of them
 at my wedding, but instead of sending the whole camera in, i just took
 the film out (it's a standard 35mm canister), and kept the batteries
 (they use one aa battery). sorry, i didn't keep any of the flash electronics.
