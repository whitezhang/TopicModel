 we have a sun cd-rom drive which i would like to play audio cd's in.
 i have an old 10 watt amplifier which works fine when connected to a
 junk "walkman" style am/fm radio. this amp ties the common path of the
 earphone connection to ground.
 
 however, it doesn't work with my sony walkman cassette player, or the cd drive,
 it produces of loud low-frequency tone. obviously sony doesn't ground
 the earphone output common. does anyone have specs on the cd drive's 
 output? will an audio transformer help? what are others using to
 play there cd's in the sun drive so that more than one can listen?
 
 thanks for the help.
