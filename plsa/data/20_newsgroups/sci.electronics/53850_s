  according to my ti databook, the pinouts for the til311 display are as
 follows:
  
  pin 1 - led supply voltage
  pin 2 - latch data input b
  pin 3 - latch data input a
  pin 4 - left decimal point cathode
  pin 5 - latch strobe input
  pin 6 - omitted
  pin 7 - common ground
  pin 8 - blanking input
  pin 9 - omitted 
  pin 10 - right decimal point cathode
  pin 11 - omitted
  pin 12 - latch data input d
  pin 13 - latch data input c
  pin 14 - logic supply voltage, vcc
  
 the logic supply voltage is 5v @ 60-90ma. the led supply is also 5v, but
 it need not be particularly well regulated. the led drivers on the chip
 use a constant current source, so led intensity is not affected by the
 supply voltage.
