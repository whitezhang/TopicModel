 having vainly looked for devices capable of dealing to the nec 77p20
 dsp chip which dont require taking out a mortgage, i decided to roll
 my own. not a difficult task for an 8751, given that all the timing
 relationships are set out in the databook. one thing bothers me, that
 is the accursed 50ms 21 volt vpp pulse. sure, a little buck step-up
 converter can achieve this (in what is otherwise an all 5 volt widget)
 but i know latterday eproms dont need nearly this pulse length.
 q : has anyone come up with a more efficient programming algorithm
 which is failsafe ?
 cheers
 mike.
