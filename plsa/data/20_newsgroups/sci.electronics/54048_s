 true enough, but...

 zilog scc:
 ---------
 	rr0[7]:  break detect
 
 this is a very popular part, but it has a number of quirks, especially
 in hdlc mode.
 
 signetics 68562 duscc:
 ---------------------
 	rsr[2]:  break start detect
 	rsr[3]:  break end detect
 
 two of the bits in the receiver status register.  you can enable an interrupt
 on either of these bits going high, too.  also, only one null will be put
 in the fifo per break detected.
 
 this is simply the best serial chip i've ever worked with.  _many_ less
 quirks than the scc, which is imho second-best.  (death to 8250 devices!)
