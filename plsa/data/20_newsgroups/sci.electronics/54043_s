 
 ** for my computer law module i have been asked to write a computer 
    contract for the supply of computer software to a business. the
    software is being especially written for the company.
 
    would anyone, per chance happen to have a copy of a computer
    contract on their system which they could mail me.
 
    if anyone has a computer contract but it contains sensitive 
    material then i can assure them that it will remain confidential
    and i will not pass it on, or allow anyone else to view it.
 
    thanks.
