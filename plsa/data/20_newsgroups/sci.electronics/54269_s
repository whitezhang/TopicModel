 ah-ha!  i'm not alone at last!  which sony do you have??  i have a
 27"sxr (pre-xbr series, circa 1987).  that damn thing used to
 make noise like a mad-man.  i had/have 2 separate problems...one being the
 flyback, the other was the assembly where the windings of the yoke
 came together. 
 
 first:  i found by poking around the windings on that assembly,
 the thing would make noise.  i guess that there was enough of a potential
 in that assembly to leak, so i sprayed it with a dielectric insulation
 spray--i think it was urethane or acyrilic.  that fixed it.
 
 second:  flyback...for the life of me, i can't isolate this one.  if i
 leave the cover off, the tv will be quiet.  if i put the cover back on,
 and let it heat up, it'll start to whine--kinda hard to solve with the
 cover on!! :-(
 
 a friend of mine who used to fix tv's says there might be a pin-hole
 leak somewhere on the flyback.  usually it's surrounded by a bunch of
 black dust/dirt.
 
 i hope this is a start...if you find something out, let me know!
