 
 i just bought a little gizmo that is supposed to be installed "in
 series with the tip or ring lines" of the phone wire. which ones are
 those? suppose i am holding a regular phone wire, such that the little
 plastic tooth (on the little plastic square thing with the naked lead
 ends that you plug into the phone) is facing down, and away from me.
 which of the 4 wires that i see is the "tip" and which is the "ring"?
 please reply to mlevin@husc8.harvard.edu.
