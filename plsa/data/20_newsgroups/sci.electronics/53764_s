 i have never worked with really small signals before and have a few 
 questions about low level noise.  i have noticed that the waveform 
 synthesizer that i am using (analogic 2020) has some relatively large
 common mode noise on it.  i am using this synthesizer to 'null' out another
 transient waveform and am amplifying the difference (~200uv) several hundred 
 times.  the 2020 has about 1-3 mvp-p of common mode noise and this tends to
 make my measurements hard to repeat.  (the noise is not quite in sync with 
 line frequency, and on a spectrum analyzer, the main component is about 64hz).
 
 how can i get rid of the noise?  when i look at the spectrum using an
 hp 3582a (audio range analyzer), the noise goes away the minute i switch to 
 'isolation' on the input.  i am guessing the anlayzer has a diff amp on the 
 input since it will read accurately down to dc.
 
 also, if i use a differential amplifier (ia) to solve the problem, 
 how important is it to use one of these 'shield drivers' (an amp connected 
 to the shield in sort of a feedback loop to remove trouble caused 
 by different cable capacitances)?  if anyone can suggest a good ic ia for 
 use with transient signals with content from 1khz to about 300khz, i would
 appreciate it.
