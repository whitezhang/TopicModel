 unfortunately, you're wrong on both counts.  the most common method of
 implementing a tunable receiver is to have a local oscillator.  the
 local oscillator's frequency can be radiated out of the receiver via
 the antenna unless the circuit is designed and constructed with great
 care.
 
 for a reference on detecting radios, get the paperback book _spy catcher_.
 the author discovered how to detect radio receivers from their local
 oscillator emissions back in the *1950s* while he worked for british
 intelligence.
