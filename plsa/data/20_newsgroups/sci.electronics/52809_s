 i think there is a huge difference in the materials and 
 process for printer/toner pcb's. i get first time, everytime
 results from a local hp postscript, and hardly ever works from
 copies of the same artwork. the printer results are so good
 that i have quit even looking for pc board processes. if i had
 to use the copier version, i would think i would look elsewhere.
 the moral? experiment and find what works. toner transfer can
 give excellent results. it, like any process, gives erratic 
 results with variable inputs.
