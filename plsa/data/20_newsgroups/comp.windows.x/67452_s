 i've found that i have to add the "-8" option for displaying jpegs
 with the new version.  for some reason, if i don't, it goes into
 24-bit mode and the resulting image is displayed with 216 colors 
 (from a 6x6x6 array) instead of 256 and looks grainier.  since i'm
 on the ubiquitous 8-bit pseudo color display i would have thought it
 could tell that.
