 i'm trying to turn on xauthorization using mit-magic-cookie on my servers
 (cpu heads, hp700rx xterminals), but i'm running into a couple of problems.
 
 first, at least one of our applications (maple) doesn't seem to understand 
 how to deliver the magic cookie, and won't run on a display with authorization
 turned on. 
 
 second, we have people with client software on remote machines, and i
 really don't want to hassle them with having to copy their .xauthority
 file to the remote machine... assuming that the clients there support
 xauthorization.
 
 so, what i would like to do is turn on mit-magic-cookie by default, with
 non-privileged users able to turn it off - dropping back to host-based
 authorization.
 
 (yes, i know how to turn it off by changing the xconfig file for the
 heads and the client authorize setting for the xterminals, but
 non-privileged users can't do this.)
 
 i've checked with the hp support line, and there doesn't appear to be a way.
 can anyone confirm this, or do you know of a way to accomplish what i
 want?
 
 btw, i'm running hpux 9.0, and vue 3.0.
 
 thanks in advance,
 rick
