 
 i am looking for a package that implements standard
 image processing functions (reading/writing from
 standard formats), clipping, zoom, etc. implemented
 under x. both public domain and private packages
 are of interest. the particular application area i
 have in mind is medical imaging, but a package meant
 for a more general context would be acceptable.
 
 please reply to me; i will summarize on the net if
 there is general interest.
