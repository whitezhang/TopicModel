 i  am  having  a  big problem trying to build mit x11r5 with xlc 1.2.1
 (the  one  bundled  with  aix  3.2.3e).   its almost the linker is not
 working properly with shared libraries.
 
 i've built x11r5 with no problem before .. but now its all  headaches.
 for example, the xset client complains that libxmu doesnt have a bunch
 of xt routines and shr.o is missing (or  something  like  that).   the
 build of libxmu does link in libxt  so i am really perplexed  what  is
 going on.
 
 
 ....following up on this, the specific error i get is:
 could not load program ./xset 
 symbol xtvasetvalues in ../.././lib/xmu/libxmu.a is undefined
 symbol xtname in ../.././lib/xmu/libxmu.a is undefined
 symbol xtwindowofobject in ../.././lib/xmu/libxmu.a is undefined
 symbol xtgetconstraintresourcelist in ../.././lib/xmu/libxmu.a is undefined

 could not load library libxmu.a[shr.o]
 error was: exec format error
