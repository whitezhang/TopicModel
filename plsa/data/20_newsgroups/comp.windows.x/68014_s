 
   i'm running hp-ux 8.07 with hp vue 2.01 and i need a hardcopy of
   the login window (the one asking  for login and password) to 
   include in a manual. 
   i have tried:
    xwd -display hostname:0 -root -out login.xwd 
 
   from a login on a remote terminal, but it doesn't work. 
   xwd seems to wait for the window server, but the window
   server doesn't answer. 
 
   any suggestions? i must use xwd because i don't have access to
   ftp and i can't obtain another program to grab the screen.
 
   thanks in advance
                                            nadia pitacco
