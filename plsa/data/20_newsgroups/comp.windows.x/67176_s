 
 hello,
 
 i am testing a port of x11r5 to coherent, a unix clone os for intel architecture
 machines.  i am seeing a strange problem with text in clients like xvt (a simple
 terminal emulator program).
 
 the problem manifests it self when the shell echoes typed characters back to the
 server for display, one at a time.  the characters appear to be too closely
 spaced, with the result being that the 2nd character echoed destroys the 
 rightmost edge of the first character, then the 3rd character destroys the 
 rightmost edge of the second character, and so on.  it looks like there is an
 invisible boundary around a character which obscures a portion of the previous
 character.  there is no problem between the characters when the shell returns
 a complete line of text... only when the output is a series of individual
 characters.
 
 if anyone has any ideas what the problem might be, or where i should look to
 find it, it would be much appreciated.
 
 regards and thanks, jon dhuse.
