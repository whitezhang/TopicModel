 
 	i want to be able to send a pixmap from one client to the next.
 along with this i want to send the colormap and foreground and
 background pixel values.  so far not a problem, i can do
 this with no problem.
 
   however, once i have the pixmap id and the colormap id, how
 do i go about telling the server that the second (receiving)
 client now wants to have associations with the two id's?
 
 	tia,
 
 	john
