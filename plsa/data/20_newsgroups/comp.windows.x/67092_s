 some time back i asked for software recommendations to  allow me to
 run x from my pc at home to my sparc at the office.
 
 many thanks for all replies, the majority of people  recommended
 pcxremote from ncd. i received it yesterday  and installed it on
 my sparc and pc with only one hitch. 
 the unix install consists of copying 2 files into some local bin directory. 
 on the pc side, i ordered the windows version  which  came with a slick windows
 installation.
 
 
 the only problem i had was that  my .xinitrc  in my home directory
 had the line
 display=`hostname`:0.0; export display
 
 s.t the clients i kicked off connected to my xserver on the sparc console.
 by removing this line from the .xinitrc everything worked as planned
 and the clients connected to the server at
 
 `hostname`:1.0
 
 some comments on performance, i was connected to a sparc 2 thru
 a netblazer terminal server over a 9600 baud line.
 my pc is a 486-dx2 ati ultra, 16 mb
 
 bitmap stuff sucked.
 basic editing and compilation stuff definitely usable.
 xmail was very usable.
 
 at times the first time u typed in an xclient window there was
 a very noticable delay, i put this down to brain damaged "windows
 should not be called a scheduler", besides that this will become
 my remote work environment for a while.
 
 has anybody tried the non windows version of the product, the sales
 person said they performed about the same, given the over head of
 windows i question this?
 
 many thanks for help to all who responded
