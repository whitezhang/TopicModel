 why do many (?) people believe that xhibition '93 is one of the "paid
 market hype nt conferences" (as you put it)? i for one am going, because
 i, too, am curious about the technology. i think this is a great chance
 to learn about nt, mainly because:
 
   - it will be presented in x's "home turf". i believe that the attendees
     will mostly have x backgrounds (biases? :-); thus, i expect that the
     nt presentations will face a tough audience.
 
   - i can be there in person to judge for myself whether or not nt is what
     it is hyped to be. this is as closely as i can get to in evaluating the
     nt technology without actually using it myself, which i don't have the
     time to do.
 
   - if nt turns out to be a vapor technology and i get bored, there will be
     many other interesting tutorials/presentations that i won't have to
     waste my time ... in california?!?  :-)
 
 just my thoughts...
