 
 version 1.3 of xew widgets is available at
 
 	export.lcs.mit.edu: contrib/xew-1.3.tar.z
 	export.lcs.mit.edu: contrib/xew-1.3.readme
 
 for better details, check the readme. (for extensive details, you have
 to with xew-1.1.ps.z, still haven't had time to update this one).
 
 no new functionality has been added since 1.2 version. raster widget
 handles now expose events slightly more intelligently than before
 (really had to do this when i added a simple program that uses x11r5
 athena porthole and panner widgets). the program demo/viewer.c is
 very simple demonstration of panner/porthole usage (copied
 from'editres' actually :-)
