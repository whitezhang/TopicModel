   i'm looking for x servers for dos or windows.
 
   i've already seen desqview/x and xvision but i'd like to be
  aware of other choices.
 
   is there anything on the public domain or shareware ?
 
   and in the commercial area is there anything with aggressive
  pricing ?
 
   what about incompatibilities ? window managers ?
 
   any info is welcome.
 
 
 
   thanx in advance.
 
 
   c u!
