 when attempting to connect to an sgi indigo from a pc clone using
 a commercial x windows emulation package, the x package hangs in
 a pre-login x screen mode.  the login box won't display.  using
 the package in 'telnet' mode, i can logon to the sgi, and run any
 none graphic type things.  on the pc i get an error:
 "read error 0 on socket 1"  (raw socket error)
 
 on the sgi, in xdm-errors:
 i get a termination error when i kill the stalled screen on the pc
 
 on the sgi, in syslog:
 <date><time><sgi> xdm[#]:hung in xopendisplay(<remote>:0, aborting
   "                  "  :server open failed for <remote>:0, giving up
 
 i have all access control disabled (i believe, syslog message confirms
 this when i login on the sgi).  i believe i have the sgi set up properly
 as described in the x adm. book by o'rielly....
 
 the x emul package tech support hasn't been able to solve the problem.
 
 so what i'm looking for is some suggestions on where to look for problems,
 and possible tests to run to narrow down the questions.
 thanks
