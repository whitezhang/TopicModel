 the colormap element of setwinattrib must be a legitimate truecolor
 colormap. so, use xcreatecolormap() with the proper visual and use it
 in setwinattrib (and don't forget the mask!).
 
 and the inevitable caveat: i usually use widgets, setting the visual
 and colormap resources rather than direct x routines, so i could be
 wrong. but, i think this is the general difficulty.
