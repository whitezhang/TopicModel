 sorry, but olwm and tvtwm don't do it. they place the title at that position
 and the window at a position below it.
 
 this becomes a problem when you want a program to be able to save its current
 configuration and restore is later.
 
 currently, my solution is:
 
 	xcreatewindow(...);
 	xsetwmproperties(..);
 	xmapwindow(...);
 	xflush(...);
 	xmovewindow(...);
 
 
 it works with olwm, but is less than elegant. all this leaves me wondering
 if i'm overlooking something obvious.
