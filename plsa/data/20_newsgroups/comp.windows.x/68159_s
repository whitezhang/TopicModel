 subject: vxt2000 windowing terminal help
 
 greetings!
 
 
 we have several vxt 2000 windowing terminals and associated software on our
 network.  we are able to open a lat terminal window to any of our workstation
 nodes but we are unable to get a lat x session to work.
 
 we have customized the terminal security to allow all lat connections.
 
 trying to invoke a lat x session from the vxt 2000 results in the following
 message being displayed in the terminal manager window message area:
 
 host does not support x sessions
 
 (the host is a vax4000 model 60 and does support x sessions)
 
 
 opening a lat terminal window and logging into the server node, setting the
 display variable as follows:
 
 $ set display/create/node=lat_###########/transport=lat
 
 and then trying to create a decterm on the vxt as follows:
 
 $ create/term=decterm/detach
 
 fails and gives the following error message:
 
 dectermport failed to find language, xopendisplay("")  returned null
 %decw-f-cant-open-displ can't open display
 
 the vxt 2000 is using its system defaults (ie. default font(s), language, ...)
 except for the security options to allow all connections and options enabling 
 lat protocol.
 
 we have vt1200 windowing terminals and the above things were enough to allow
 lat x sessions.
 
 vms version is 5.5-1
 running decwindows/motif of vax4000 model 60s
 
 
 please help.
