 we're looking at various x11 clients for pc's and we're looking for some
 information about the relative efficiency of different products.  are any
 notably efficient (fast)?  are any notably inefficient?  i assume that a
 graphics accelerator makes them significantly faster (right now i'm looking
 at ico running on xoftware/32 for windows sitting on the distinct tcp/ip
 platform, and it's (not surprisingly) much slower than ico running on the
 sparc10's console.  what are the key ways of improving performance for
 pc (presumably windows) clients?
 
 also, what about async solutions?  (yes, i appreciate that it will be 
 *much* slower even with v.42bis.)  i'm in the process of installing ppp
 (with header compression).  how does that compare to cslip?  i've seen
 a product called xremote by ncd that promises to be pretty efficient, but
 are there comparable products out there?  if we're looking for efficiency
 for async, pc clients, what should we be looking at in addition to standard
 ppp w/ compression and xremote?
 
 any information would be greatly appreciated.  i'm still taking in all
 the information in the faq, but any tips about the relative efficiency
 of various product offerings would be great.  (i get the impression
 that discussions about speed are largely application specific, but
 that not withstanding, any comments would be appreciated.)  thanks.
