    sorry, but olwm and tvtwm don't do it. they place the title at that position
    and the window at a position below it.
 
    this becomes a problem when you want a program to be able to save its current
    configuration and restore is later.
 
    currently, my solution is:
 
 	   xcreatewindow(...);
 	   xsetwmproperties(..);
 	   xmapwindow(...);
 	   xflush(...);
 	   xmovewindow(...);
 
 
    it works with olwm, but is less than elegant. all this leaves me wondering
    if i'm overlooking something obvious.

 i know that the mwm has an resource to specify if positions are to be used for
 the border of a window or for the "user" window. maybe other window managers
 have similar options.
 another way to figure out the difference between the "user" window position
 and the window manager decoration window position is to subtract their
 positions. you just have to use xquerytree and remember that the window manager
 decorations window is the parent of your window. unfortunately, you can only
 figure out the decoration width and height after the window has been mapped
 this way.
