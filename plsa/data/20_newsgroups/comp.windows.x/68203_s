 hmm, depends on how you define 'clean'. jordan implemented the system
 dependent stuff in a way that you have basic implementations for,
 call it, operating system types, then you go ahead and write a include
 file for your specific machine or operating system using the basic
 implementations. since both jordan and i haven't encountered a 
 os flavor yet, that is fully posix, we haven't gotten around to
 really implement (and test) a top-level include file specifically
 for just posix. the posix routines are used in the sun specific file
 tty_sun.i for example, but here we also use some bsd stuff. all in all
 it still is probably better to implement a include file for each and
 every operating system than '#ifdef'ing in existing ones. the type
 of mess that can result from that can clearly be seen in the xterm
 sources. even if quite a bit of code gets copied almost unchanged a 
 couple of times, this only uses up some disk space, since only the 
 "drivers" actually included from the toplevel include file will be 
 compiled into emu.
 
 it shouldn't be hard to come up with a tty_linux.i file that fully
 relies on the posix stuff, but unfortunately i don't have a linux
 system available to me, so i can't do the port myself. i would suggest
 you read the readme in term/sysdep and if you have any problems or
 questions, contact me and we could try to sort this out. unfortunately
 we have to rely on help from the net on this part of emu, since we 
 just don't have access to that many different systems.
