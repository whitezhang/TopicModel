 ld: unidentified external symbol
    _get_wmshellwidgetclass
    _get_applicationshellwidgetclass
 
   i use -lxaw -lxmu -lxext -lx11 -lxt not in this order but in a proper order
 
 i am wondering if there has to be some changes in my link libraries or should
 i include some more libraries.
 
 any help in this matter will be very useful and highly appreciated
 
 thanks
