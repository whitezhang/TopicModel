 i need help binding some value to the home and end keys on my keyboard.  i have an
 rs/6000 w/ aix3.2.3ext running x11r5pl19 mit dist.  i'm using a pc running exceed
 for windows as my xterminal.  the home and end keys do not send a value, and my
 application needs them to be defined.  i used this in my xdefaults to define the
 keys:
 
 varnet*vt100.translations: #override \
     <key>home: string("\033[8~") \n\
     <key>end: string("\033[7~")
 
 then i xterm -name varnet.  this works perfect, however the 7 and the 1 key on my
 keypad are also defined as \033[8~ and \033[7~.
 
 any ideas?  help please.
 
 thanks.
