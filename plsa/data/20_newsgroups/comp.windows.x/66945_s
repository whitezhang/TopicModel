 windows nt is a step forward, but not by much. i guess for dos users who
 think multi-tasking is really _neat_ (add puke here) and are overjoyed to 
 be able to use more than 64k of memory, its a major improvement. for windows
 users its more like an upgrade with facilities most unix users take for 
 granted. most of  windows users only use pcs for text processing or running 
 3rd-party applications anyway so the operating system features are not even 
 a real issue. my ideal operating system:
 
 	binary compatible across all plaforms. it should recognize
 	binaries and configure on the fly, so i don't have to have
 	bin/mac bin/dos bin/dec bin/sun bin/hp etc...
 
 	multi-cpu. so i can use the cpus on my pc and w/s and mac 
 	and transputers and dsps. i don't know a single site which 
 	has gone for a single vendor. i am not going to trade-in 
 	80mflops per h1 transputer or ultra-fast fft on dsp chips.
 	note nt runs on symmetric multi-cpu systems.
 
 	built-in portable gui/graphics tools. you can call drawbutton 
 	or drawline and it does the same thing no matter what platform 
 	or display. it should also translate graphics commands on-the-fly.
 	so i can use pc graphics s/w on my workstation and x software on 
  	my pc. i think guis are not just nice to have but essential.
 
 	configurable front-end. so you can make it look like unix or dos
 	or nt or os/2, and run shell scripts or command/bat files.
 
 	object oriented. so i can program easily under it and not have
 	to re-invent the wheel if the networking is not up to scratch
 	or my application needs to access source/object code on the fly.
 
 in other words it should have some ai capability. that and a tight, clean
 kernel so you can actually understand it. anyone know of something like this ?
 
 	adios
