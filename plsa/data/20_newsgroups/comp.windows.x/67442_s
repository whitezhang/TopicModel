 one way to "mask" the left button check the contents of the xevent that the
 xaddeventhandler send to your event_handling function (in your case, it is the
 show_mouse_position function. 
 
 if the xevent arrive in this function as 
 
 xevent p_event;
 
 then, the value of p_event->xbutton.button is the button that was pressed. so, 
 you just do a switch on that value in order to distinguish between them. in case
 it was not clear p_event->xevent.button is an int. 
 
 by the way, you mentioned the button1motionmask and if anyone can help me with 
 these motionmasks i would be grateful. i can not figure out how do distinguish
 between motions by which button is pressed as the motion is occurring. in 
 essence i would like an seperate event-handler for motion with each button. 
 unfortunately, the xevent sent by a motionmask does not seem to contain the 
 value of the pressed button.
 
 any ideas,
