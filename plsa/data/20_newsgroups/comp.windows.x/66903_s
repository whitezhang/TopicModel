   i think you will find that the active linux and 386bsd communities are
   populated by enthusiasts who would object to paying *any* money for software.
   otherwise, they would probably have gone for a commercial unix.
   an important factor in the linux community is that source code is always
   available (this is probably similar in the 386bsd community, however, i'm not
   really involved there). many people using linux like to stay at the cutting
   (bleeding) edge: ie. when kernel patches, c library or compiler patches come
   out, people like to rebuild their entire systems. the prime requirement for
   all linux software is that it is available under a gnu style public license.
   hence, linux software uses either the athena widgets or xview.
   individuals may write software requiring motif, but i doubt it is widely
   adopted.
