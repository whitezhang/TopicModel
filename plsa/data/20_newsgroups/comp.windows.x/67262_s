 not being an xt programmer by any stretch of the imagination, this is
 driving me crazy and it's probably really simple to do.
 
 i need to make a composite widget that does nothing at all but is
 merely a placeholder in a widget instance heirarchy -- allowing me an
 additional resource name level.
 
 to illustrate i have an application with the following widget
 heirarchy:
 
 	    shell widget
 	         |
 	application widghet
 
 i want the following:
 
 	    shell widget
 	         |
 	intermediate widget
 	         |
 	 application widget
 
 where the intermediate widget has a name but gets all its other
 properties (and propagates down new values) from the shell widget.
 
 i assume there's a simple way to do this but i can't find an example
 and the documentation i have is rather vague about implementing
 composite widgets.
 
 please respond via email.  any help will be very much appreciated.
