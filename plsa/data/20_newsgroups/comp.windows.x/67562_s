 hi,
 
 i'm working on a project that involves storing an application's rendering
 to an x display and then playing it back again.  rather than 
 "reinvent the wheel", it like to find:
 	* a file format for saving x protocol.
 	* software that saves and replays such a session.
 
 any ideas out there?  i've heard that there is a version of xscope
 that will save and replay sessions.
 
 i'd be willing to share much of the code i develop back to the x community.
