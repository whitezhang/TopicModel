 i don't know if there's a corresponding patch for solaris 2.1, but this
 sounds like the following bug which is supposedly fixed in 100492-06, the
 solaris 1.x olwm jumbo patch:
 
 	1108642 - window system can hang in an errant pointer grab
 
 actually, i suspect that the ow 3.1 problem may be different, since the
 readme file says that this patch is just a sunos 4.x version of the ow 3.1
 olwm (but maybe that line came from an earlier version of the patch, and
 they forgot to take it out in the -06 version).
