    under openwindow and motif. i wrote my program in motif with pixmap and
    icons. it runs fine under motif/motif window manager and x11r5/mwm. but 
    the icon pixmap does not show up under openwin/olwm and x11r5/olwm.
 
              has anybody got into this kind of problem? need a clue. an 
    example which works in both x11r5/motif and openwindow will be great.
