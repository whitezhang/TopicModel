 i`ve been happy with axe under linux. now i wanted to use it under hp-ux,
 too. however, my attempts have ended in core dumps this far (bus error).
 
 has anybody else been more successful? jim wight`s install file does
 say there have been problems with hp`s...
 
 data: axe 5.0; hp-ux 9.01; x11r4 or x11r5 doesn`t seem to matter (shared
 libs); hp 9000/720.
 
 thanks in advance,
