 
    environment:
       mach/arch : sparc/sun4  (ipx)
       os	: sunos 4.1.3
       x11	: x11r5 (patchlevel 22)
       motif	: 1.2.2
 
 i bring up x server using 'startx' and /usr/bin/x11/xsun. the following sequence
 of actions crashes the x server (sigpipe, errno=32, 'xinit' reports that connexion 
 to x server lost):
 
    1. xinit -- xsun
    2. start mwm
    3. start a client with a 100dpi/75dpi font.
    4. move the window by dragging the title bar.
 
 the server dumps core due to sigpipe. one of the two messages is printed:
 
   "connection to x server lost"
 
 or
   
   "connection broken (errno=32)"
 
 (i believe the first is reported by a client and the second by the server itself).
 
 next, i ran xdm in debug level = 5. after the same set of actions, xdm reports:
 
   select returns -1
   server for :0 terminated unexpectedly: status 2560
 
 
 note:
  * the problem doesn't occur with other window managers (twm or olwm). 
  * i have not set ld_library_path. 
  * i am not running font server. 
  * if i start the client with fixed width font, i do not see this problem.
  * my font path:
      /usr/lib/x11/fonts/misc/,/usr/lib/x11/fonts/speedo/,/usr/lib/x11/fonts/75dpi/,/usr/lib/x11/fonts/100dpi
 
    (i did mkfontdir in /usr/lib/x11/fonts/100dpi, /usr/lib/x11/fonts/75dpi,
    /usr/lib/x11/fonts/pex, /usr/lib/x11/fonts/speedo,
    and in /usr/lib/x11/fonts/misc).
 
  * this problem seems to occur only on ipx machines. i do not see this 
    problem on ipc workstations.
 
 questions:
  * what the hell is goin on ? :-)
  * what does "status 2560" mean (of the server).
 
 i'd greatly appreciate any hints as to the cause of the problem.
