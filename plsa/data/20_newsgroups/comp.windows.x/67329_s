 the only time i've seen similar behaviour is when an x application forked a child
 without setting close on exec on the x display connection file descriptor.
 the shell waited for a configurenotify event that never arrived because it got
 picked up by the child.  sometimes the shell correctly got the configurenotify if
 the timing was 'right'.
