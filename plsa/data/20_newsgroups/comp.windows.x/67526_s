 will someone who can 'see' the x-face included in this header please reply
 and tell me if it turned out okay?
 
 i'm not all too sure about my viewing software.  i *hand*-converted this
 thing in "vi" from a sun rasterfile... what a pain!
 
 for folks who haven't the slightest, it went like this:
 
 -------------------------------------------------------------
 
 		how to make your own x-face:
 		   in 0x000f easy steps!
 
 	1. scan my drivers' license into a *.pcx file.
 	2. use wingif to 'trim' my face out of the license,
 		'reduce' it by half, and
 		convert it to *.bmp.
 	3. use paintbrush to touch up manually.
 	4. use wingif to 'reduce' it by half again.
 	5. use paintbrush to touch up again.
 	6. use wingif to 'reduce' it by half *again*
 		and convert it to *.gif.
 
 		[now over to the unix side...]
 
 	7. use snapshot to convert the *.gif to a sun rasterfile.
 	8. use iconedit to touch it up and
 		convert it to an x bitmap.
 	9. use "vi" (yes, a *text* editor) to manually convert
 		the rasterfile into the "uncompressed x-face" format.
 		(lots of global "ed" commands, and by the time you're
 		 done you'll mirror hex bytewise in your sleep!!)
 
 		[now over to the *linux* side...]
 
 	a. use "compface" to convert it to what you see here:
 
  %:a<m@dob}bo"'e",eeqgbn7qy(en7as5u([k//"g{6^hiby9x8~+pd($}6szf"&vvxcxsn
  8mw^0g#nvhe%w,`x"[j0s{r.~%zs:o|hfu=lwzygh
 
 	b. try viewing it by whatever means you have available.
 	c. go back to step 9, but do it *right* this time.
