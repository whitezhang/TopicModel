 it is true that the man page for pageview does not say that the files need
 to be dsc compliant.  that is the fault of the left hand not knowing what the
 right hand is doing at sun.  i was informed by a sun employee that the pageview
 program does require dsc compliant postscript.  there was the possibility that
 it was going to be changed so that if the file wasn't dsc compliant that it
 would stop at each showpage.  i believe that this method would preclude being
 able to go backwards and forwards through the file, i.e., you could only go
 forward to the next showpage.  this isn't in ow3.0 pageview, but maybe it is
 in the solaris 2.x version of ow (ow 3.1?).
 
 in any event, i find pageview extremely useful.  since all of the postscript
 that i produce is dsc compliant, i don't have any problems.
