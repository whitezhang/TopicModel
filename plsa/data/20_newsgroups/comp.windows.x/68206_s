 hi all,
 i have this program in which user can display many images one-by-one on the
 display. now i am trying to get the best poosible color allocation. so
 each time i open a image, i try to allocate the colors reqd for that image
 (approach similar to that used in xv by john bradley). the problem 
 comes when i try to display the next image. now i have effectively tied
 myself to the colors of the previous image. so the second image doesnot come
 up in original colors.(i.e. the colors it would have shown, had it been
 displayed first). 
 i know that i can display only 256 colors (or whatever depth of the display)
 at a time. but i also dont want the color reproduction dependent on the
 sequence in whihc you display the image. 
 so what is the best way out?
 
 please rewpond to vijay@iitb.ernet.in.
 
 thanks,
 
 vijay
