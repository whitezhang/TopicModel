 i am using xnlock as the screensaver for a pc-based x server. however,
 after an interval of no activity, my x session ends. this does not
 happen when i use xscreensaver. 
 
 my screensave command is fired up from my .xsession like this:
 
 xautolock -time 1 -locker xnlock -corners ++++ -cornerdelay 1 &
 
 my hypothesis is that xdm (i use xdmcp to start my x session) detects
 a period of inactivity from the server, then terminates the session.
 however, for some reason, this does not happen with xscreensaver. is
 there a workaround?
 
 i'd prefer responses via e-mail.
 
 thanks.
