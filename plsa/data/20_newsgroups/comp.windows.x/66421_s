 at robert gordon university, programming was the main (most time-consuming) 
 start of the course. the first two years consisted of five subjects:
 software engineering (pascal/c/unix), computer engineering (6502/6809/68000 
 assembler), computer theory (lisp/prolog), mathematics/statistics and 
 communication skills (how to pass interviews/intelligence tests and group
 discussions e.g. how to survive a helicopter crash in the north sea).
 the third year (industrial placement) was spent working for a computer company 
 for a year. the company could be anywhere in europe (there was a special 
 travel allowance scheme to cover the visiting costs of professors).  
 the fourth year included operating systems(c/modula-2), software engineering 
 (c/8086 assembler), real time laboratory (c/68000 assembler) and computing 
 theory (lisp).  there were also group projects in 2nd and 4th years, where 
 students worked in teams to select their own project or decide to work for an 
 outside company (the only disadvantage being that specifications would change 
 suddenly).
  
 in the first four years, there was a 50%:50% weighting between courseworks and 
 exams for most subjects. however in the honours year, this was reduced to a 
 30%:70% split between an individual project and final exams (no coursework 
 assessment) - are all computer science courses like this?
 
 btw - we started off with 22 students in our first year and were left with 8 by
 honours year. also, every course is tutored separately. not easy trying
 to sleep when you are in 8 student class :-). 
 
 cheers,
