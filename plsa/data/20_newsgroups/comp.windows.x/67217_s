 
 i am trying to build and use imake (x11r4) on an ibm rs/6000 running aix v3.2.
 i am having the following 2 problems.
 
 (1) many of my imakefile's have contructs like
 		/**/#this is a makefile
 	at the start of lines to pass makefile comments thru the c
 	preprocessor and into the makefile.  most of the c preprocessors that
 	i have used will not treat such a # as appearing at the start of the
 	line.  thus the c preprocessor does not treat the hash symbol as the
 	start of a directive. 
 
 	however the ibm cpp strips the comment and treats the hash symbol
 	as the start of a directive.  the cpp fails when it determines
 	that "this" is not a known directive.  i have temporarily hacked my
 	imake to handle this situation but would like to come up with a better
 	fix.
 
 (2) several imakefiles use /**/ as a parameter to a macro when a particular
 	use of the macro does not need a value for the parameter.  the aix cpp
 	gives warnings about these situations but continues to work ok.
 
 if you are familiar with these problems and have solutions, i would appreciate
 information about on your solutions.  (perhaps, this is solved in a later
 version of imake that i have not reviewed.)  also, do you know of other cpp's
 that behave similarly?
 
 since i do not have easy access to news, a response to
 'white_billy@po.gis.prc.com' would be appreciated.
