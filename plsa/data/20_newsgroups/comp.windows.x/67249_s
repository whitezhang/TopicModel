 hello--  i'm currently designing the architecture of a chip which is
 intended to help speed up common operations on a windowing system such as
 x.  a friend and i are designing the chip as the final course project for
 an advanced computer architecture course taught by dr. fred brooks at
 unc-chapel hill.  while we feel that we've got a pretty solid design
 currently, we'd really like to get ahold of some frequency data from an
 x-windows server so that we can make the most effective use of our bit
 budget.  
 
 unfortunately, i've been unable to find anything of this sort in the
 various x faqs, or x manuals that i've seen.  does anyone have some type of
 frequency data, like how many copy-rectangle operations vs draw-lines, and
 things of that sort?  or, barring that, a program that records requests to
 the server into a logfile that i can munge on myself?
 
 any and all help would be very appreciated.
 
 many thanks,
     ---mark
