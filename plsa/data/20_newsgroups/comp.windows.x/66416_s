 it's my understanding that the next release of uim/x, due out
 last february :-) has full support for c++.
 
 i use xdesigner which does not have the interpreter or ui meta languages
 of these other tools but does fully support c++ code generation,
 reusable templates via c++ classes which are generated, a variety of
 other handy features for using c++ and layout functions in different
 ways, and generates motif 1.2 code (including drag 'n drop, 
 internationalization, etc.).  fits in quite nicely with doug young's
 paradigm for c++/motif.
 
 available in the us from vi corp, in europe from imperial software,
 london (see faq for details).
