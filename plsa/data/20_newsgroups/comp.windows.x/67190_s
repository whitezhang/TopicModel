 	because xterminals do not have a news server.  xterminals have
 speed by nature of their limited functionality: once you add news and
 everything else, you have a workstation.  there are workarounds, i've
 heard, one involving a perl script.  what we are trying to do is
 replace programs that need news (like pageview) with programs that
 don't (like ghostview).
 	maybe someone else can elaborate on the perl workaround; i
 have no personal experience with it.
