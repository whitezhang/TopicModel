 it might be that the x terminal doesn't support the "postscript
 extensions to x" product.  i use the 'dxpsview' program on a 
 decstation 5000 to view postscript files but when i moved to an
 ncd x terminal, i couldn't use it any more.  so i ftp'd and
 compiled ghostscript (gnu software).  now we can view postscript
 files on our x terminals.
 
 hope this helps.
