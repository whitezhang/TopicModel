 hi,
 i have a lots of problems using xview (libraries release 3.2) in order to
 do the following:
 + i want to create a modal dialog which block the program flow
   (a syncronous dialog, ala macintosh) , as the notice panel
   does, but with text item, list item, and other xview objects.
 + the modal dialog also must allows the timer to be called (why
   notice doesn't do that?).
  
 the problems are:
 - using the "xv_window_loop" functions most xview objects dont work
   (as the list item), and the timers aren't called.
  
 - with the "notify_dispatch" explicit i have problem because:
   "...never attempt to do direct dispaching from within a callback
   routine..." as say the "xview programming manual (third edition)"
   on page 486 (uhm... i know this number!!! :->).
   but i need to do dispatching just inside a callback routine!
  
 help me, please!!!
  
 thanks in advance,
 --- giovanni
