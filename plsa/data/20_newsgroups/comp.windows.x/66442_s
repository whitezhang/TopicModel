 i don't know how many hours you've spent on this, but the sun user
 group makes x11r5 available on cd-rom to its members. the 1992.1 disk
 has both sources and binaries and it sells for $50.  i've tagged a
 table of contents and an orderform on below if anyone's interested.

 sug cd 1992.1 is x11r5 and gnu on a cdrom, priced at $50 to sug
 members, including a caddy!
 
 sug's emphasis has always been on supplying the greatest possible
 service and value-added to our members.  last year, the sug 1991 disk
 contained plug-and-play x11r4, 20mb of additional essential binaries,
 almost 200mb of sun patches, fully-indexed archives of sun-related net
 postings, priced at only $250.
 
 our aim this year has been to reduce the price for disks which can be
 produced inexpensively, but to continue to supply as much value-added
 as possible.  to accomplish this, we will be putting out a two disk
 set, the first containing what's ready and needed now, the second
 available later in '92, containing more sparc binaries and other
 useful material not found on previous disks.
 
 the sug 1992.1 disk, which was assembled by robert a. bruce, contains
 a lot of essential source code, and we decided it would be a great
 service to make it available right away to our members (and this
 pricing makes this a good opportunity to become a member!) for $50 per
 disk (including one of those hard-to-find caddies!).  if you are not a
 sug member, you can become one for an additional $40 if you live
 within the us or $55 outside.
 
 the sug 1992.1 cdrom is an iso 9660 disk (which means it can be used
 by pc, macintosh, and other workstations as well), and contains a
 total of 543mb of material, including:
 
 x11r5 sources and core binaries (for sparc) as of several weeks after
 the initial distribution, thus, four fixes and the the mit contrib-0
 distribution are included (109mb of material).  binaries for: x xsun
 xsunmono appres atobm auto_box bdftopcf beach_ball bitmap bmtoa
 constype editres fs fsinfo fslsfonts fstobdf ico imake kbd_mode

 xmkmf xmodmap xon xpr xprop xrdb xrefresh xset xsetroot xstdcmap xterm
 xwd xwininfo xwud
 
 copies of contributed x sources (from export.lcs.mit.edu/contrib),
 which were then uncompressed/untarred into source directories (212mb).
 these are sources only, and some of them were (after the date of
 production of this disk) included in the mit contrib-2 and contrib-3
 distributions.
 
 gnu sources which were uncompressed/untarred into source directories
 (88mb).
 
 sparc binaries (and needed libraries) for these gnu programs: a2p ar

 the pieces, compile, install, etc.
