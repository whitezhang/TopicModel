    a colleague has a bizarre font problem on his new mips workstation.
 when he first logs on (via xdm), he has a single xterm window appear
 with the mwm window manager running.  in this configuration, x windows
 applications (particularly xdvi) work fine.  however, if he opens up a
 second xterm application, suddenly xdvi cannot start in either window,
 giving the error: unable to load iso 8859-1 font.
 
    the only difference between the two xterm windows is that the initial
 one references a different name in the xsession file, with prettier
 colours and other slight changes.  further investigation shows that only
 opening a default xterm causes this behaviour, and more significant, all
 x applications can no longer load any fonts if they are invoked from the
 command line in either window.  if i start the xterm with a different
 font (using the -fn option), no problems.  it would seem that the
 default xterm is loading a font which somehow causes the server to lose
 all of its fonts.  note: xlsfonts in either window shows all of the
 fonts available, so there doesn't appear to be a problem in the font
 directories/hash-tables.
 
    other than rewriting the xterm app-defaults file to use a different
 font and hope for the best, does anyone have any ideas?
 
 more info:  this is the most recent mips workstation (r4000 i believe),
        with the most current operating system and running x11r5.
        it is not mwm's fault, as the same problems occur under twm, etc.
