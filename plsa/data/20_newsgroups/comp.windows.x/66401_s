 
 i have heard of two packages for the pc that support x-win.
 the first is linux which is a free unix package.  the second
 is x-appeal, which sounds pretty good.  it can be found at
  garbo.uwusa.fi in the ~ftp/pc/demo/ dir.  the files are
 
 	xap13exe.zip
 	xap10fon.zip
 	drivers.zip
 
 this should get you started.
