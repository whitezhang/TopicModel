 hi,
 i have a problem when compiled wcl 2.02 in sco odt 2.0:
 
 
         cc -c -ox  -i.. -i/usr/include xt4getresl.c
 xt4getresl.c
 xt4getresl.c(47) : error c2065: '_xtconstraintbit' : undefined
 *** error code 1
 
 although i follow the instructions in file readme_build to build wcl in sco 
 platform, this problem didn't resolve.
 
 so i have some questions related to this matter:
 
   1. does _xtconstraintbit exist in sco odt 2.0? ( does _xtconstraintbit use
       in x11r3 & x11r4? and what release does sco odt 2.0 use, x11r3 or x11r4?)
   2. if not, does someone know how to work around?
