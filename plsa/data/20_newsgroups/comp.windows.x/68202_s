 
 i understood that there are two methods to connect application code to widgets:
 
                        callbacks and actions
 
 the problem i face now is that i have a quite long piece of application code
 that performs a lot of drawing into a window. i want to connect this to a
 widget. no problem so far. i could use a callback function or an action to do this, processing any events afterwards.
 
 but because the drawing takes some while, i want the application code sequence
 to be able to be interrupted by events. then i want to handle the events
 and resume with processing the application code at the point it was
 interrupted.
 it seems to me that this isn't possible, but how can i give the user the
 impression that his inputs are immediately processed ?
 
 has anybody an idea?
 
 please answer via e-mail.
 
 thanks in advance.
