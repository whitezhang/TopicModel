 i would further add that a 486/50,s3/928,8mb,15",200mbdisk is going to cost
 /way/ more than $900, probably $3,000.  color makes it not apples/apples too.
 xterminals provide better price/performance than pcs.  you can make a pc
 much cheaper, and perform much worse, and you can make pc's perform great, and
 cost more.  you pay extra for the additional functinality and expandability
 of a pc.  for home user, that extra functionality is worth the added cost.
