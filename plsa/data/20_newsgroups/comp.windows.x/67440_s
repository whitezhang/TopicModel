 the patches for xv.h need to use ``#ifdef svr4'' rather than the
 overly complex ``#if defined(sun) && defined(sysv)'' in order to
 generically compile xv on i386svr4architecture.  also, rand and srand
 don't work very well--use lrand48 and seed48 to get better results.
 otherwise, xv-3.00 compiles just fine on my esix system v 4.0.4 box
 with xfree86 and gcc-2.3.3.  i just uncommented the gcc definition in
 the makefile, added -l/usr/x386/lib -i/usr/x386/include to the copts
 line and modified libs to include -lsocket -lnsl.  really john, if you
 just use the imakefile things like this don't even have to get
 mentioned...
