 #does xdm work with decnet? i have an ultrix machine running both tcp/ip
 #and decnet. i have a number of x-terminals hanging off the ultrix host also
 #running tcp/ip and decnet. presently i am using xdm for the login procedure
 #on the x-terminals using tcp/ip. since xdm is basically just an x-windows
 #client, shouldn't i be able to run xdm on the decnet protocol tower as well?
 #
 
 xdm is not just an x window client.  xdm has its own protocol (xdmcp) that
 operates of ucp on port 177.  it does provide a login window which is an
 x window client.  as to using decnet protocol.  looking through the source
 for xdm from x11r5 that i have here, it seems that the bare bones code is
 there but not completely there.
 
 #
 #my first inclination is that xdm is not your typical x client. it is making
 #tcp/ip specific socket calls. in this case the answer would be no; you can
 #not run xdm over decnet. is this right or not? any feedback is appreciated.
 #thanks.

 from my look at the source, it seems you cannot run it over decnet as shipped
 with x11r5.
