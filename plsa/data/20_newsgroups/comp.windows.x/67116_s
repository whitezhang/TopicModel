 
 try this after xcreatewindow:
 -----------------------------
 
 #include <x11/xutil.h>
 
 display display;
 window window;
 
 {
   xsizehints *xsizehints = xallocsizehints ();
   xsizehints->flags = usposition | ussize;	/* or = pposition | psize */
   xsizehints->x = 42;
   xsizehints->y = 42;
   xsizehints->width = 100;
   xsizehints->height = 100;
   xsetwmnormalhints (display, window, xsizehints);
   xfree (xsizehints);
 }
 
 these hints tell the window manager that the position and size of the window
 are specified by the users and that the window manager should accept these
 values. if you use xsizehints->flags = pposition | psize, this tells the window
 manager that the values are prefered values of the program, not the user.
 i don't know a window manager that doesn't place the window like you prefer if
 you specify the position and size like above.
