 even 24bit truecolor machines are in most cases running an emulated
 8 bit pseudocolor visual, only to get standard x clients, motif apps and
 thelike to run. i strongly suppose you to emulate at least:

   should not make big misfits

   pixel indices, conversion stuff. furthermore, you should run your default
   screen on this visual.
