 i need to write an application which does annotation notes
 on existing documents.  the annotation could be done several
 times by different people.  the idea is something like having
 several acetate transparencies stacked on top of each other
 so that the user can see through all of them.  i've seen
 something like this being done by the oclock client.
 could someone please tell me how to do it in xt?
 thank you very much.
