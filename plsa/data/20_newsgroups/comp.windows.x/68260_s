    we have a problem with 'makedepend': it doesn't know how to correctly process
    #if clause in c preprocessor statements. it evaluates everything to

    has anybody come up with some solution/fix to 'makdepend' other than
    writeyourownparser... and willing to share it with us?
 
 rewrite 'makedepend' to use 'cc -m' or 'gcc -m' or 'gcc -mm' (which is
 the one i prefer, since system headers don't change that often) for
 generating the actual dependencies.  you'll still need to write the
 parts that edit the actual makefile.  i think there's a program in the
 berkeley distributions called mkdep that will do essentially this.
