 
 store and reply of mouse and keyboard events
 --------------------------------------------
 
 to produce regression tests or automatic demo's
 we would like to store all mouse and keyboard events
 produced by a user. it should be possible to filter
 the mouse and keyboard events from the server's queue
 an to store them in a file.
 this sequence of events, stored in a file, should be given 
 to the server's queue as if a user is working.
 
 
 1. exists a tool that is capable to save and reply all
    mouse and keyboard events (where)?
 
 2. where one can catch these events to store them ?
    in our case the server's queue is on a x terminal (hp).
    where can we catch all events coming from a given
    server.
    if this is not possible, can we catch all events given
    to a certain client and how ?
    
 3. where one can send a stored sequence of events to simulate a user ?
    is there a central dispatcher on the clients machine who manages
    all incoming events from a given server and how can we reach it ?
 
 
 thanks in advance
 
 ron.
