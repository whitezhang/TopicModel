 can anybody tell me how to use the xmu function "xmucvtstringtowidget". i
 want to specify a widget name in a resource file so that i can connect
 two widgets together on an xmform. ie.
 
 myproggy*mylistsw.topwidget:               maintextsw
 
 however, when i run the program, i get the message:
 
 warning: no type converter registered for 'string' to 'window' conversion.
 
 (just like the manual sez).
 
 i have managed to find this bit of code which seems to be the correct way
 to go about this:
 
     static xtconvertargrec parentcvtargs[] = {
         {
             xtwidgetbaseoffset,
             (xtpointer)xtoffsetof( corerec, core.parent ),
             sizeof(corewidget)
         }
     };
 
     xtsettypeconverter( xtrstring, xtrwidget, xmucvtstringtowidget,
                             parentcvtargs, xtnumber(parentcvtargs), xtcacheall,                                null );
 
 
 however, i haven't got a clue where to put it! the example code i have seems
 to suggest i can only do this if i am creating my own widget; but elsewhere it
 says that i can add it to a widget's "class_intialize" function. how? what's
 one of those? :-(
 
 if anybody has any code to do this, please let me know the trick - i'm sure
 this is a faq.
 
 thanks in advance,
 
 rik.
 
 ps: what are the header files "corep.h" and "intrinsicsp.h" - should i use
     these or "core.h" and "intrinsics.h" (ok i know rtfm:-)
