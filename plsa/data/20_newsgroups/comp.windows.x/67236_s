 hi,
 
 i just got xfree86 running on my pc with consensys and encountered a few
 minor (i hope) probems.
 
 the pc is hooked up to a lan where i want remote x applications to 
 connect to my x-server.  i believe the command to permit this is
 xhost.  when i'm logged on my pc and type 'xhost + '  ,  i get the error message saying
 "you must be on local machine to enable access". 
 what does this mean ?  ain't i already on the local machine?
 
 another problem i have is with the mouse movement.  i find that the 
 mouse cursor moves extremely slow and choppy.
 how can i make the mouse cursor move more accurately?
 
 
 thank in advance.
 any help is much appreciated.
 
 please send replies to christy@alex.qc.ca.
