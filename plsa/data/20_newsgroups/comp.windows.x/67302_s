 hello,
 
 i am looking for someone to help me with the proceedure for remote login, via
 modem not ethernet, to our new silicon graphics iris machines.  i can log in to
 them only as a vt100 terminal regardless of what i am emulating on my end.  i
 have communication software, kermit, which supports tek 401x and vt102
 emulation.  the x windows manual lists xterm as the appropriate command to
 change the terminal type.  when i try it the reponse is 'unable to open window'
 
 thanx in advance
 
 keith grider
