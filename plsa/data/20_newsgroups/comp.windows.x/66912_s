 i want to create a single-line text widget for entering a small amount of text.
 
 i want it to be of fixed width, but have a horizontal scrollbar that scrolls
 automatically when the user types in order to keep the insertion point
 visible.
 
 in trying to do this i have two problems:
 
  - the addition of the horizontal scrollbar does not make the text widget
    taller, but instead it seems to cover part of the text.
 
  - the scrollbar does not scroll automatically as the user types in text
    in order to keep the insertion point visible.
 
 any help is appreciated.
 
 mike
