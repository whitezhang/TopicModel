 ncsa mosaic provides a consistent and easy-to-use hypermedia-based
 interface into a wide variety of networked information sources,
 including gopher, wais, world wide web, nntp/usenet news, techinfo,
 ftp, local filesystems, archie, finger, hyper-g, hytelnet, texinfo,
 telnet, tn3270, and more.
 
 this release of ncsa mosaic is known to compile on the following
 platforms:
 
   sgi (irix 4.0.2) 
   ibm (aix 3.2)
   sun 4 (sunos 4.1.3 with stock x11r4 and motif 1.1, and gcc).
   dec ultrix.
   dec alpha axp (osf/1).
 
 documentation is available online.
 
 changes since 0.13 include:
 
  o added new resource, gethostbynameisevil, for sun's that
    coredump when gethostbyname() is called to try to find out what
    their own names are. (command-line flag is -ghbnie.) 
  o explicitly pop down all dialog boxes when document view
    window is closed, for window managers too dull to do so
    themselves. 
  o better visited anchor color for non-sgi's. 
  o added .hqx and .uu to list of file extensions handled like .tar files. 
  o added 'clear' button to open box, to allow more convenient
    cut-n-paste entries of url's. 
  o new resource 'autoplacewindows'; if set to false, new document
    view windows will not be automatically positioned by the
    program itself (but it's still up to your window manager just how
    they're placed). 
  o command-line flags -i and -iconic now have desired effect (new
    resource initialwindowiconic can also be used). 
  o gif-reading code is a little more bulletproof. 
  o obscure infinite loop triggered by extra space in img tag fixed. 
  o eliminated nonintuitive error message when image can't be read
    (inlined ncsa bitmap is indication enough that something's not
    right for authors, and readers can't do anything about bad images
    in any case). 
  o obscure parsing bug (for constructs like <address><a
    href=...>text<a></address>) fixed. 
  o fixed mysterious stupid coredump that only hits suns. 
  o fixed stupid coredump on url's like '://cbl.leeds.ac.uk/'. 
  o fixed buglet in handling rlogin url's. 
  o new support for solaris/sysvr4 (courtesy
    dana@thumper.bellcore.com). 
  o better support for hp-ux 8.x and 9.x (courtesy
    johns@hpwarf.wal.hp.com). 
  o better support for next (courtesy scott@shrug.dur.ac.uk). 
  o some miscellaneous portability fixes (courtesy
    bingle@cs.purdue.edu). 
  o miscellaneous bug fixes and cleanups. 
 
 comments, questions, and bug reports should be sent to
 mosaic-x@ncsa.uiuc.edu.  thanks in advance for any feedback you can
 provide.
 
 cheers,
 marc
