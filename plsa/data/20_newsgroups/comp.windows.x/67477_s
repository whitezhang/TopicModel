 position field in the wm_normal_hints property, then map it.
 
 then, assuming they have a non brain dead window manager, the user can
 say whether they want to us program specified positions or not. for
 tvtwm the usepposition command in the .tvtwmrc will do this.

 timewarp someone will have advised you to set the user position bit in
 the wm_normal_hints. _do_not_ do this. it's evil. it's a disservice to
 your users. offler the tusked crocodile god will come in the night and
 remove your vital organs with a blunt spoon if you even contemplate
 it.
