 
 	help,
 
 	i've got an applications with a series of pushbuttons across
 	the top (a toolbar).  i wanted to add eventhandlers to these
 	pushbuttons on enterwindowmask and leavewindowmask so that
 	i can put up some descriptive text about the function of each
 	pushbutton as the pointer crosses over it.
 
 	i've done this fine, but i've turned up the following problem:
 
 	when the pushbuttons are sensitive i get callbacks on both of
 	the above events, but when they are not sensitive i only get
 	callbacks on leavewindow events.  this seems odd.  i would
 	expect this to be an all-or-nothing type of thing.
 
 	is this a bug?  if not, can someone explain this behavior?
 
 	thanks,
 
 	mark
