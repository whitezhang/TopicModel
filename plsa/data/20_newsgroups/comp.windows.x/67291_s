 
 hi guys,
 
 	it has been a long time since i wrote a program using x. i am trying to 
 	get myself re-familiarize with x. i would appreciate your help regarding
 	the following problem.
 
 	i am trying to compile a simple x program on sun running sunos 4.1.2. 
 	using
 	cc -o ex ex.c -lxaw -lxmu -lxt -lxext -lx11 -lm
 	i am getting an error
 
 	ld: undefined symbol
 		_get_wmshellwidgetclass
 		_get_applicationshellwidgetclass
 
 
  the simple program i tried to compile is given below.
 
 #include <stdio.h>
 #include <x11/intrinsic.h>
 #include <x11/stringdefs.h>
 #include <x11/xaw/form.h>
 
 main(argc,argv)
 int 	argc;
 char	**argv;
 {
 	widget	toplevel;
 	widget	frame;
 
 	toplevel = xtinitialize("ex","ex",null,0, &argc,**argv);
 	frame = xtcreatemanagedwidget("form",formwidgetclass,toplevel,null,0);
 	xtrealizewidget(toplevel);
 	xtmainloop();
 }
 
 
 
 
 	i got the same error when i tried to build "xpostit" using the imakefile
 	provided with the software.
 
 	i have compiled x programs before (not on this machine, but on other 
 	machines running sunos 4.0 and x11 r4). i did not get this error message
 	can anybody tell me why i am getting these messages.
 
 	i would appreciate if you can email your responses to me at
 	azn30@ruts.ccc.amdahl.com.
 
 	thanks
 	anand
