 hi, netters:
 
 we have a problem with 'makedepend': it doesn't know how to correctly process
 #if clause in c preprocessor statements. it evaluates everything to
 true no matter what the conditionals are.
 for example, makedepend chokes on one of x11 include files (as distributed
 by sun) - namely xos.h:
 
 #if     !defined(sunos41) || defined(__stdc__)
 #       include <string.h>
 #       define  index   strchr
 #       define  rindex  strrchr
 #else   /* bsd && !__stdc__ */
 #       include <strings.h>
 #endif  /* !sunos41 || __stdc__ */
 
 here 'makedepend' evaluates both #if and corresponding #else statements
 to 'true' and tries to open the file <strings.h> which doesn't exist
 under solaris2.
 we also have a lot of #if statements in some of our legacy code.
 we got and built 'makedepend' off the net - it didn't fix the problem.
 
 in all fairness it should be noted that 'makdepend' man-page (sun's
 distribution) mentions this problem:
 
 bugs
      if you do not have  the  source  for  cpp,  the  berkeley  c
      preprocessor, then makedepend will be compiled in such a way
      that all #if directives will evaluate to  "true"  regardless
      of  their  actual  value.  this may cause the wrong #include
      directives to be evaluated.  makedepend should  simply  have
      its own parser written for #if expressions.
 
 has anybody come up with some solution/fix to 'makdepend' other than
 writeyourownparser... and willing to share it with us?
 
 since we often experience delays in our newsfeed - please reply 
 directly to my e-mail address -> i'll post a summary.
 
 thanks in advance.
