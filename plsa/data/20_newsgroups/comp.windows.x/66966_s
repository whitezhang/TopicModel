 hi,
     i have a piece of x code that compiles fine on pmax-ul4, pmax_mach, as
 well as sun4_mach, but whenever it compiles on sun4_411, it gives me 
 undefined ld errors:
 _sin
 _cos
 _pow
 _floor
 _get_wmshellwidgetclass
 _get_applicationshellwidgetclass
 
 the following libraries that i linked it to are:
 -lxaw -lxmu -lxt -lxext -lx11
 
 the makefile is generated off an imake template.
 can anyone give me pointers as to what i'm missing out to compile on
 a sun4_411?
 
 thanx
 wilson
