 i need to port several os/2 pm applications to x (openwindows or motif),
 and desperately need any information on how to go about doing this (short
 of a complete rewrite.
  
 are there any tool to make porting easer?
 any references?
 any talent out there to hire to do this?
 i will even take an os/2 presentation mgr emulator for sun!
  
 any, and all replies (except flames) welcome!
