 i need help positioning the slider of a list widget's horizontal scrollbar.  i am displaying the full
 path of a selected file in a list widget.  the horizontal's slider defaults to the left side of the
 list widget; however, i need the slider on the right side.  this is so the user can see the file name
 they selected.  i know it's possible, because when files are displayed in a file selection dialog box,
 the slider is on the right side.
 
 thanking any and all who can help in advance,
