 
 	three q's:
 
 1) is it reliable?
 
 2) how does it send the information from a ms windows app over
 the x11 protocol? does it just draw everything as graphics into
 one window, or does it use multiple windows and essentially work
 more cleverly?
 
 3) if i want to run ms word, for example, remotely, do i have to
 run a separate copy of ms windows remotely, and then start ms
 word from that, or can ms word be started remotely on its own?
 
 	thanks a lot!
