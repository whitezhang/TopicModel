 hi.  i've looked in the faq and the o-reilly books and was unable to
 find (an easy) means of finding out the state of state keys such as
 capslock and numlock.  i can certainly track the events inside of my
 window and set a boolean there, but what if capslock is pressed in
 another window?  i looked at xgrabkey() and decided it was definitely
 not what i wanted to do.  i could find no convenience function to tell
 me that information.
 
 my question is this:  is there a means of determining what the state
 of capslock and/or numlock is?
 
 an even more pointed question: is there an easy means of making an x
 keyboard act like a pc keyboard?  ie, capslock is active, and the user
 presses shift-a, i'd like to get a lowercase 'a' instead of 'a'.
 
 any input is greatly appreciated. please respond via email.  i will
 repost a summary of my findings.
 
 			thanks, ralph
