 i'd appreciate any feedback on capture/playback tools for use with x clients.
 
 i have pulled xtm from public domain but it appears to be set up to test
 x servers not x clients. 
 
 any comparisons/comments on regression testing tools would be great -
 particularly xtm, xrunner, autotester, and sri's capbak, smarts and exdiff.
