 what i want to be able to do is to set the cursor
 color to the same as the forground color that is set
 for that xterm.
 
 from the man page.....
 
 -cr color
  this option specifies the color to use for text cur-
  sor.   the  default  is  to  use the same foreground  <---
  color that is used for text.  <---
 
 however this doesnt seem to be the case, it appears to default to black
 or to whatever xterm*cursorcolor is set to.
 
 feel free to point me at the relevant fm or whatever,
 cheers,
 c
