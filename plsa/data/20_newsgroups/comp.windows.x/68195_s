 thanks to everyone who mailed help, unfortunately the end problem was a really
 stupid `oversight' on my behalf. the code was 100% perfect, but it might
 help to add control.c to my makefile.......
 
 	anyway the mangled name was telling me it could'nt locate the control
 constructor...
 
 	i just want to reaffirm what a valuable book this one is, i'm enjoying
 evry page :)
