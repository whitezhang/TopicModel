 i have two questions (well probably more...) about how expose & configure
 events are handled.
 
 i have an appl. which uses 1 window to draw in.  since i give the user the
 capability of scaling and zooming as well as allowing the window to be
 resized, i made a translation table for the expose & configure events.
 the expose event calls my redraw method while the configure event
 calls my rescale method.  the rescale method invokes a "fake" expose
 event (actually just calls the redraw w/ an appropriate expose struct)
 to draw the data.
 
 quest 1.
 when the appl. is compiled/linked w/ r4 (running in either r4 or r5 env.)
 i get multiple (>4) redraws when the window gets uncovered or the size
 is changed.  i assume i'm getting cascading events.  is that right?
 any suggestions as to how to handle/trap events in a better way?
 
 quest 2.
 when the appl. is compiled/linked w/ r5 i get no expose events
 whatsoever.  do events and/or translation tables act differently in r5?
 
 thanks in advance
 
 steve
