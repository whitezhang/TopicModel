 i am using the glx widget + athena widgets on a mixed-model
 application, under 4dwm, but when the dialog gets popped up, its
 text entry field does not have focus. aimilar code works perfectly if
 i use "pure x" (no mixed-model). here is the relevant portion of
 the code.
 
 {
    int n;
    arg wargs[16];
    widget button, popupshell, dialog;
 
    /* initialize toplevel here */
    .
    .
    .
 
    n = 0;
    xtsetarg(wargs[n], xtnlabel, "foo"); n++;
    button = xtcreatemanagedwidget("foobtn", commandwidgetclass,
                                   toplevel, wargs, n);
 
    popupshell = xtcreatepopupshell("pupshell", overrideshellwidgetclass,
                                    button, null, 0);
    xtaddcallback(popupshell, xtncallback, mypopup, (xtpointer)popupshell);
 
    n = 0;
    xtsetarg(wargs[n], xtnvalue, ""); n++;
    dialog = xtcreatemanagedwidget("thedialog", dialogwidgetclass,
                                   popupshell, wargs, n);
 
    .
    .
    .
 }
 
 void mypopup(w, popup_shell, call_data)
 widget w;
 widget popup_shell;
 xtpointer call_data;
 {
    xtpopup(popup_shell, xtgrabexclusive);
 }

 a way i found to give focus to the text field is to move the
 application window around a little bit and place it right behind the popup.
 
 any pointers would be greatly appreciated.
