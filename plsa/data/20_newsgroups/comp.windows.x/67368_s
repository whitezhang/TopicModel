 
 	imake support for xmosaic
 	=========================
 
 although xmosaic is a great program in general, it unfortunately comes
 without imake support. so i created one. until marc andreessen finds the
 time to incorporate it in an official xmosaic release, you can easily do it
 yourself. use anonymous ftp to get
 
 	ftp.germany.eu.net:/pub/x11/misc/xmosaic.imake.tar.z
 
 the file's size is 3200 byte. you will need gzip to unpack it. have fun!
