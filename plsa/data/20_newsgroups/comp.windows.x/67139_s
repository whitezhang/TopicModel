       try change the gxxor to gxequiv.  i have to do this for programs that
       are to run on ncd terminals (on sun terminals i have to change it
       back to gxxor)...
 
 there is a small section in the o'reilly xlib books that describes
 the right thing to do.  the key is to set the plane_mask in the
 gc to the or of the foreground and background pixel values.
