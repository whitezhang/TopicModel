 you've got to set border_pixel in your window attributes. the default
 is copyfromparent which gives the badmatch. do this:
 
    ...
    unsigned long valuemask;
    ...
    /*
     * if border_width is non-zero you'd better alloc a colour from cmap
     * rather than use any old pixel value. also, use valuemask, it makes
     * the code more obvious.
     */
    attr.colormap = cmap;
    attr.border_pixel = 0;
    valuemask = cwcolormap | cwborderpixel;
    win = xcreatewindow(
            dpy,
            defaultrootwindow(dpy),
            10,10,
            width,height,
            0,		         /* border width. see comment below */
            8,                    /* depth */
            inputoutput,          /* class */
            vinfo.visual,         /* visual */
            valuemask,
            &attr
          );
 
 a note on border_width: your code looked like this:
 
 >>   win = xcreatewindow(
 >>           dpy,
 >>           defaultrootwindow(dpy),
 >>           10,10,
 >>           width,height,
 >>           copyfromparent,       /* border width */
 >>           8,                    /* depth */
 >>           inputoutput,          /* class */
 >>           vinfo.visual,         /* visual */
 >>           cwcolormap,
 >>           &attr
 >>         );
 
 border_width set to copyfromparent works but doesn't make sense.
 border_width should be an unsigned int. you get away with it because
 copyfromparent is #define'ed to be zero in x.h. if it happened to be
 defined as -1 you'd get a very interesting looking window!
