 what "it may think is right" may be exactly what the user wants.
 assuming that your application "has reason to know better" is, imho,
 anti-social.  if i start your application with a -geometry option are
 you going to ignore that as well?
 
 there's really no way to force a window manager to do much of anything
 if it's managing your window.  you can ask, you can hint, but there's
 no guarantee that you're going to get what you want.
