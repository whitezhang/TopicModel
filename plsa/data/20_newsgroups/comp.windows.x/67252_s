 we have recently obtained a copy of color_xterm (from export.lcs.mit.edu) after
 seeing it mentioned in a previous article. on compilation, it reports the
 following undefined symbols:
 	_get_wmshellwidgetclass
 	_get_applicationshellwidgetclass
 
 	but still runs. when sending escape sequences to set the colour,
 any colour comes out as black text on a black background. any ideas?
 
 has anyone used this program in colour successfully?
 
 can anyone point me to any other colour terminal emulators?
 
 we are running openwindows 3 on sun sparcs running sunos 4.1.3.
