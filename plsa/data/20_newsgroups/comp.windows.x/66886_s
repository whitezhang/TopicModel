 seeing as motif has been adopted by sun, ibm, hp +++ (can't remeber the
 other members in the recent announcement), i'm sure you'll see it on
 virtually every workstation (ie. sun, ibm, hp and dec must make up the
 **vast** majority of all hardware).

 ports of motif to both 386bsd and linux are available for a fee of about
 $100.  this is cost recovery for the person who bought the rights to
 redistribute.  the activity in both the bsd and linux news groups
 pertaining to motif has been high.

 i can't see why.  if just about every workstation will come with motif
 by default and you can buy it for under $100 for the "free" unix
 platforms, i can't see this causing major problems.
 
 
 side note :
 ---------
 all the x based code i am writing (and will distribute freely when
 completed) is based on motif because from a programmatic and also "look
 and feel" point of view i like it the best (no flames on this one
 please).
