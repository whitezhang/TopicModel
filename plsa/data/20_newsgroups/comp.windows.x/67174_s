 
  i have a problem when i'm using postscript. when i am working local
 on a sun sparcstaton ipc the postscript works good, but when i connect
 to the sun from a x-terminal i just get error messages that the
 postscript cannot connect to the news-display.
 
  why doesn't postscript work on an x-terminal?
 
  is there any way to make it work?
