 does the workstation you're using have hardware cursor support?  or does
 the server generate a software cursor.  you can generally tell the difference
 just by using it.  if the cursor blinks a lot when there's screen activity,
 it's probably a software cursor.  if it has a hardware cursor, i think you're
 probably battling a bug in hp's x server.  i'm not familiar with any hardware
 cursor chips that display cursors greater than 64x64.  it's quite possible
 that the server is just echoing your preferred cursor size without actually
 checking it.  i vaguely recall that very old mit server revisions did just 
 that.
 
 in reality you're probably stuck with a 64x64 maximum size cursor regardless
 of what the server returns.
