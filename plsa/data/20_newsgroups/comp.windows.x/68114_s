 
 hello,
 
 i have a problem with x11r5 on a sun386i an i hope that someone can help
 me with it.
 i've built x from the mit sources after applying all patches i have got (i
 think 23). building was easy. after installing everything i started x but
 nothing happened but the screen and the keyboard freezed, the machine seemed
 to hang. i loged in from another machine an found the sun386i running well.
 'ps' told me that there's a x-server and a xterm running. and with some 
 experimenting with the mouse and repeatedly pressing ^d i blindly hit the
 xterm, endet the session and got my prompt back.
 i guess it's a device problem but i did not find the correct device yet.
 i've got a sun386i with a b/w framebuffer (ace-6 0688 94v-0, rev 53)
 sunos 4.0.2 and rom 4.4.
 please help me. i'm able to run clients on the sun and send the output to
 other machines but that's not what i did it for.
 
 thanks in advance,
 stefan
