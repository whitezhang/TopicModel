 the following packages meet your criteria in that they are pd and
 present an aesthetically pleasant graphical interface to the users.
 
 if you can use 386bsd:
 	there is xview3 (openlook)
 
 	there is interviews which looks a little like motif
 
 	there is gopath a very nice c++ toolkit for athena widgets and motif
 	         which is simpler
                  and better than interviews and you will enjoy
                  technical support from bull via e-mail
 		 it has a nice draw program (it uses motif) which can be used
 		 to create graphical front-end to programs.
 		 the data format is called streams which you can feed
 		 to your programs. i ported gopath on an internet machine
 		 which is gone but if you use gcc-2.3.3 with minimal effort
 		 gopath can be ported to 386bsd.
 		 last but not least, gopath interfaces to toolkits via a driver
 		 module. they have an ms-windows driver module for instance.
 
 	also, many have written extensions to tk/tcl thus allowing powerful
 	applications. for instance, tcl_nm  has snmp extensions for tk/tcl.
 	with ease, i  can now combine snmp network operations with graphs,
 	photo-widget, graphical interface, file operations, database 
 	operations,etc.. the author of tcl_nm mail me a simple network 
 	management application which was about 80 lines long - it displayed
 	various environmental parameters from a router. i wrote  a simple
 	strip chart script for displaying real-time ip received
 	packets/seconds.
 
 
 	hope this helps,
 	amancio hasty
