     antialiasing support - with colour openwindows 3 try pageview -aa -dpi 150
     note that pageview uses the x11/news server to interpret the postscript,
     and thus won't run on an x terminal or other non-openwindows server.
     it's *not* enough to be runing an open look ui [tm] window manager such

     an olit-based terminal emulator.  i couldn't get the demo version to
     give me a shell prompt, although it did look like it was a pretty fll
     vt340 emulation, with double-height characters, colour, fonts, grahics
     and so forth.
     with the union flag (the british flag) as their logo i somehow expected
     an english address, perhaps in bristol...

 another $25,000; tooltalk is $40,000 or so.

 subject: xview 2 ports
 
 in general, there is no point in using xview 2 if you have xview 3 available;
 it's a good idea to look for an xview 3 port first.  moving from xview 2 to
 xview 3 is usually simply a matter of recompiling, unless you've done
 "dirty tricks" or used undocumented calls.
