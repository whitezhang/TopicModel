 i know that this is not the correct place to post this, but i have 
 exhausted all other logical options.  i used to be on the info-unix 
 newsgroup mailer.  the mailers mysteriously quite coming around the end of
 last year.  all e-mails requesting that i be placed back on the list have
 been ignored.  i have been unable to locate the administrator of this list.
 
 if anyone knows of the internet address that i can send a the request to
 get back on this list, can you please send it to me.  if you don't know
 of this specific newsgroup mailer, i would appreciate the address of *any*
 unix-related newsgroup.  thanks.

 ps - sorry for the non-x-related question.
