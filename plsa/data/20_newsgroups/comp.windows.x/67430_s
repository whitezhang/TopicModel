 i am having the problem of ensuring point-to-focus when the mouse
 cursor enters a window in my application.  i'm using interviews,
 but that may not matter, this seems to be a generic problem in x.
 for example, i use openwindows on a sparc2, with point-to-focus
 set, and that generally works, but not always, depending on what
 was going on in some window when i move the cursor from one shell
 tool window to another.  or so it seems...
 
 my question, then, is what can i do within x to guarantee point-to-
 focus within my application?  thanks for any response.
