 
 if you're willing to do a little work, you can make drawnbuttons do what you
 want, more-or-less. one of my colleagues here at ge crd has done just that
 in our internal lymb system.
 
 we have a matrix transform class that makes it easy to compute a series of
 dial positions from a single set of vectors. each set of vectors is then
 drawn into a pixmap. clicking the button advances the knob's state and
 changes to the next pixmap in the sequence.
 
 using drawnbuttons obviously still constrains you to taking up a rectangular
 portion of the parent widget, but that's normally not a big shortcoming. you
 can make things look circular enough.
