 
 issue 5 of the x resource (the published proceedings of the 7th annual x
 technical conference) has an paper by mark linton and chuck price
 titled "building distributed interfaces with fresco".
 
 the summary describes fresco (formerly known as xc++) as an x consortium effort.
 without doing a complete review of the paper, i'll just mention the goals
 as stated in one section of the article.  the effort has the goal of providing
 the next generation toolkit with functionality beyond the xt toolkit or xlib.
 features they want in fresco include:
 
 lightweight objects, such as interviews glyphs
 structured graphics
 resolution independence
 natural c++ programming interface
 edit-in-place embedding
 distributed user interface components
 multithreading
 
 this by no means captures the complete content of the paper. the conclusions
 sections mentions that a rough draft specification should be available in
 early 93, with no schedule (paper presented in jan 93) for a complete sample
 implementation.
 
 i am not affiliated with any of the people or places mentioned above.
