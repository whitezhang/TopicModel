 these are two common subjects so i hope someone has had to deal with these
 specific questions.
 
 1.  if my application depends on modifiers, what is the best lookup method?
 my choices are to call xgetmodifiermapping() for each key press with a 
 modifier, or make the call once at the init of the app and store the modifiers
 in a lookup table.  i would like to do it the second way, but i can't seem to
 get the notify when the user uses xmodmap to remap the modifiers.  i know that
 when an app calls xsetmodifiermapping() a mappingnotify event is generated
 (non-maskable) which i can pick up and modify my internal table.  but, i don't
 seem to get any notify events when the user uses xmodmap.  if i use xt, all 
 o'reilly has to say is '...is automatically handled by xt...'.  if i use xlib, ala xnextevent(), i get nothing.  this all stems from problems with users of 
 the sun 4/5 keyboard and the numlock; plus various alt/meta/etc. modifier 
 requirements.
 
 2.  i would like to place a popup so that it will be to the immediate right
 of my main window.  i want it at the same y coord, and their right/left
 sides touching.  what i need to ask for is the x,y coord of the window 
 manager's border for the main window.  this should ring a bell with anyone
 who has called xtmovewidget(), immediately checking the x,y after the move
 and seeing that it is right, and in their next callback asking for the x,y
 and seeing that it is now offset by the wm border.
 
 any help would be most appreciated.
