 this is incorrect.  sun has made no such claim regarding devguide, and as 
 manager of the devguide engineering group i can state with authority that
 work on devguide is continuing apace.  we had quite a strong show of interest
 from the devguide user community at last week's solaris developer's conference.
 devguide is being advocated not only as a valuable future builder tool, but
 as an important bit of transition technology that will help sustain current
 customers and facilitate their migration to the cose desktop environment.
 
 if you have specific questions about devguide availability, etc., you can 
 contact tali aben, our devguide product marketing person, at (415) 336-3536.
