 
 we've just recently upgraded our x11 to r5 and are now running into problems
 with some of our applications that use motif 1.1.  it appears that pointer to
 the widget being passed to the callback function (i.e., the "w" of
 (w, client, call) ) is nil.  the client and call pointers are okay in some
 instances, but bogus in other instances.
 
 we are running sunos 4.1.2 on a sun 4.  after compiling x11r5 and all 23
 patches (with the motifbc flag set), we recompiled motif and then we 
 recompiled the application.
 
 did we skip a step or leave something out?  is there a flag that we should
 have used?  should we have left motif alone?
 
 any answers or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
 
 thanks
 kathy
