 what does this have to do with my original question???  i previously
 stated that i did an xcopyarea of the depth-8 pixmap to the screen
 just to make sure that my image had data, and it did.  this is not
 a problem with expose events, it has to do with xcopyplane not
 working!!!
 
 does anyone have a code fragment they could send demonstrating that
 xcopyplane works???  this would be very helpful!
 
 thanks!
