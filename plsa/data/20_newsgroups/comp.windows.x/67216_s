 i am in the process of installing x11r5 on my sun sparcstation 2 and
 have run into a problem.  i imagine it has something to do with a missing
 screen driver, or something along those lines, but figured someone out there
 in internet land might be able to help.
 
 i am installing it on a machine that already has openlook installed, and would
 like to have both installed concurrently.  thus, i set it up to compile to my
 /usr/x11r5 directory.  i worked out all the kinks in getting it compiled (with
 gcc), so that it compiles without any warnings.  i need it installed for pex-si,
 so i set all those appropriate flags.  when i run it, however, i get a message
 along the lines of:
 
 getting interface configuration : operation not supported on socket
 
 sunopenframebuffer : inappropriate ioctl for device
 
 fatal server error : no screens found 
 
 
 any ideas on how i can fix it?  please respond by e-mail at the below
 address.
 
 thanks in advance.
