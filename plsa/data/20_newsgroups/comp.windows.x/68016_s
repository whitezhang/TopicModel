 this would be tedious, but if you have the time you could get the .bdf
 file (i can email it to you if you don't have it or don't have easy access 
 to the x source), and could make your own bold font from this.  since each
 glyph is just a bitmap, you could write a program to convert each
 glyph to a bitmap-readable file, use bitmap to make each glyph "bold", and
 convert the results back to .bdf format.  then, use "bdftopcf" to create
 the .pcf file.  then, stick the .pcf in /usr/lib/x11/fonts/misc (or wherever)
 and include it in fonts.dir and, voila, you'll have what you need!
