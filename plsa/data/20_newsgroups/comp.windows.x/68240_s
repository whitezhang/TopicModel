 this discussion on viewing .ps files undex x11 seems rather interesting
 but i fail to understand the reason it is not contained in 2 at most
 newsgroups.
 
 i am subscribed to comp.text.interleaf and i could care less about
 .ps viewing under x11. i am sure that members of this group interested in
 the topic can followup by looking at other newsgroups.
 
 could you please remove the comp.text.interleaf from your distribution?
 just as a nettish sort of courtesy.
 
 best regards.
