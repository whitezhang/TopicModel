 how can i capture buttonpress/buttonrelease events in multiple clients?
 i want to know if the user is still at the display before locking the screen.
 i can get  keypress/keyrelease and pointer motion events, but if the user
 is pressing the mouse button in the same location (the mouse doesn't move)
 i can't capture the events.  
 
 the o'reilly xlib programming manual (vol. 1) says on page 252;
    "only one client can select button events on any one window at one time, 
     due to the grab that automatically takes place."  
 
 any help would be appreciated.
