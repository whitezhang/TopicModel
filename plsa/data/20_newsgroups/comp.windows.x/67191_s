 
 i have an applicationshell which uses a colormap created with
 xcreatecolormap() and uses all of the colors available for my 8-bit
 display.  when i move the cursor over the window i get the "technicolor
 effect" - which is fine.  basically, my program works.
 
 my problem/question is: when i popup a dialogshell to prompt the user for
 some input i want the xmndialogstyle to be set to
 xmdialog_primary_application_modal.  the result is that if my cursor is
 over the dialogshell i get my colormap, but if the cursor is over the
 applicationshell (or any window other than the dialogshell) i get the
 default colormap.  but i'd like it so that if my cursor is over _any_
 window of my application, i get my colormap.
 
 any suggestions?  thanks,
 
 david,
