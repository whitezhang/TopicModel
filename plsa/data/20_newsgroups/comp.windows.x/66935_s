 it is actually worse than you think.  i have the same problem, and have
 given up.  emacs has an internal table (somewhere!) which defines what
 keys it will accept, and this table is system-dependent.  i use a sun
 from my hp, and cannot get 'shift pageup' to work - xmodmap is not
 sufficient, or at least i haven't worked out how to make it work.
 however, i can get ordinary 'pageup' and 'shift cursorright' to work,
 and i do some customised things with them.
 
 note that the emacs on my hp has no problem, and i am using exactly
 the same xmodmap and emacs configuration.
