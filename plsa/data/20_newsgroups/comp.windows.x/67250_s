 i *think* this is correct behavior.  remember the default
 colormapfocuspolicy is keyboard (meaning the cmap focus follows the
 keyboard focus).  since the dialog is modal, mwm won't allow keyboard
 focus onto your main shell, and so it won't allow cmap focus either.
 
 since it sounds as though you have keyboardfocuspolicy:pointer, i
 suggest you set colormapfocuspolicy:pointer also.  that way, the cmap
 focus won't slavishly follow keyboard focus, but will beat its own path.
 
 (if you have keyboardfocuspolicy: explicit, you can set cmap focus
 explicit also, but you then need a binding to f.focus_color, probably on
 mb1).
