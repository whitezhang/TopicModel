 
 hi all,
 
 i've read the faq, i've fiddled around, but i am still having problems getting
 my poor old hp9000/300 to let me input/display characters above 127.  i have 
 the following in my .xdefaults:
 
 xterm*font     :   -adobe-courier-bold-r-normal--14-140-75-75-m-90-iso8859-1
 
 so i believe that i have the correct font selected to use in xterm.  i have not
 set my lc_ctype environment variable because whatever i put it, it tells me that
 that locale is not supported (apparently we have no additional locales defined,
 or at least, /lib/locale doesn't exist).  i can get some of the characters
 above 127 to print out, but they are not where i'd expect them -- for example,
 alt-v does not produce a u umlaut.  this leads me to believe that the fault
 lies with the stty settings, which are as follows:
 
 speed 9600 baud; line = 0; susp <undef>; dsusp <undef>
 intr = ^c; quit = ^\; erase = ^h; kill = ^k; swtch = ^@
 eof = ^d; eol = ^@; min = 4; time = 0; stop = ^s; start = ^q
 -parenb -parodd cs8 -cstopb hupcl cread -clocal -loblk -crts 
 -ignbrk -brkint -ignpar -parmrk -inpck -istrip -inlcr -igncr icrnl -iuclc 
 ixon -ixany ixoff -ienqak 
 isig icanon iexten -xcase echo echoe echok -echonl -noflsh 
 opost -olcuc onlcr -ocrnl -onocr -onlret -ofill -ofdel -tostop 
 
 anyway, i've struggled with this off and on for a couple of weeks, and any help
 anyone could offer would be greatly appreciated.
 
 
 					thanks!
