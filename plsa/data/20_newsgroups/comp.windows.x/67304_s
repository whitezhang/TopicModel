 
 hello folks,
 
 i'm seeing these errors when i try to modify my key map:
 
 mwm: invalid accelerator specfication, line x
 
 i've added a line in the start up file before the line
 that starts mwm. it looks like the following:
 
 xmodmap keymapfile
 mwm
 
 i think that the problem has to do with a conflict between
 function keys f1 through f7 which already have assigned
 functions (e.g. move, minimize, etc).
 
 the odd thing is that i don't see these errors if i run
 
 xmodmap keymapfile
 
 from an xterm.
 
 can anyone suggest a way to modify the key map, specifically
 f1 through f7 and not have mwm (motif window manager) complain.
 
 i realize this is a bit stupid, but we only have time to
 implement, not time to learn how to implement.
 
 terry
