 the multi-lingual archives at the computing research labs, new mexico
 state university will be moving to a new ftp address soon.  the
 archives are being put under control of the consortium for lexical
 research.
 
 the new ftp address will be: clr.nmsu.edu (the current ip address
 is 128.123.1.12 but may change, so use clr.nmsu.edu whenever
 possible).
 
 please note that there is a difference between ftp sites crl.nmsu.edu and
 clr.nmsu.edu.  the crl.nmsu.edu site will be our ftp site for items
 not related to the consortium for lexical research.
 
 the arabic, chinese, french, italian, indian, japanese, korean,
 tibetan, and vietnamese archives will all be moved.
 
 we will announce the new locations of the relevant directories once
 the archives have been moved.
 
 please be patient if you discover directories missing when you ftp to
 either crl.nmsu.edu or clr.nmsu.edu.  it will take a few days to move
 everything.
 
 if you are not familiar with our multi-lingual archives, we have been
 slowly collecting various software, fonts, and text for different
 languages over the past 2 years.  most of the software is currently
 unix oriented.  we would also like to encourage people to continue to
 contribute items to the archives to help improve the quality and
 quantity of multi-lingual tools.
 
 if you have an item to contribute, please put it in:
 
 clr.nmsu.edu:incoming/
 
 and send a note to lexical@nmsu.edu telling them about your
 contribution.
 
 if you have any questions or comments, please send them to:
 lexical@nmsu.edu
