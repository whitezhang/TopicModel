 check into the vopl and vogle libraries.  i beleive that i still have
 them available on ftp.c-mols.siu.edu but i'm not sure.  i haven't seen
 any new announcements for the software but i'm sure it's still around.
 
 i have used it to do real-time data display and analysis as well as
 just for producing graphs after the fact.  it works well and supports
 numerous graphics output formats (including x.)  i tried it and liked
 it.  you may as well.
