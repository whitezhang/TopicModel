 hi, looking for any advice or suggestions about a problem i'm
 having with mit x11r5's editres, in particular under twm variants.
 
 for a start, 9 times out of 10 (but not always) editres won't
 grab a widget tree when running on our ncd (decwindows) xterms,
 which i'm told will be fixed when the r5 (not r4) xdm is installed.
 ok, so i tried running it on a sun, running real r5, on the same
 network - i get a widget tree, but it's always for 'twm icon manager'
 
 anybody know of any patches for (a) twm or (b) editres that i should
 look at?
 
 thanks,
 k
