 hello...
 
 i wonder if some one can suggest an answer to the following question:
 i am a total x novice and would appreciate any suggestions you may have.
 
 i am trying to create a simple drawing tool....
 
        __________

 let's say i have two rectangles on the canvas(see above) 
 one intersecting the other...
 now, i would like to delete one of the rectangles.
 the way i do it is to create another gc wherein i use the
 gxxor logical function and simply redraw the rectangle using the newly
 created graphics context thus deleting it for all apparent purposes.
 a problem with this approach is that at the points of intersection the pixel 
 locations belonging to the other rectangle also become white, which is 
 something that should be avoided.
 
 is there any way i can avoid this problem without having to redraw the other
 rectangle too?
 i also would not like to generate an expose event for the affected area
 as this degrades performance very badly...
 
 
 thank you...
