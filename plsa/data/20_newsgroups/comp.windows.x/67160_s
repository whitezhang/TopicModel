 i don't know anything about a "sunkbd" patch, but i use the following
 .xmodmap file (run from .xinitrc via "xmodmap $home/.xmodmap", of course) for
 my type-5 unix keyboard:  (it's a bit "brute force", however.)

 !
 ! sun type-5 unix keyboard remappings 
 !
 ! this remaps the arrow keys properly
 !
 ! by default, the arrow keys on the keypad (shift-8 = up, shift-4 = left,
 ! shift-6 = right, and shift-2 = down) work, but the arrow keys are not
 ! assigned to any keysym
 !
 keycode 27 = up
 keycode 31 = left
 keycode 34 = down
 keycode 35 = right
 
 !
 ! now we want the back space key to emit the "delete" keysym
 !
 keycode 50 = delete
 
 !
 ! other random mappings that aren't on by default
 !
 ! sysrq/print screen key
 keycode 29 = sunsys_req print
 ! break/pause key
 keycode 28 = break pause
 ! alt graph key
 keycode 20 = mode_switch
 ! pageup key
 keycode 103 = prior
 ! pagedown key
 keycode 130 = next
 ! insert key
 keycode 51 = insert
 !
 ! home, end keys = ???
 !
 ! open look functions
 !
 ! stop key (sunstop keysym == cancel)
 keycode 8 = sunstop
 ! again key (sunagain == redo)
 keycode 10 = sunagain
 ! props key 
 keycode 32 = sunprops
 ! undo key (sunundo == undo)
 keycode 33 = sunundo
 ! front key
 keycode 56 = sunfront
 ! copy key
 keycode 58 = suncopy
 ! open key
 keycode 79 = sunopen
 ! paste key
 keycode 80 = sunpaste
 ! find key (sunfind == find)
 keycode 102 = sunfind
 ! cut key
 keycode 104 = suncut
