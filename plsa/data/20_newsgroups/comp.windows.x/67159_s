 would if only it were true ...
 
 if only mit would fix the !@&$^*@ twm "installwindowcolormaps()" crash bug
 once and for all, then i could say that i've (almost) unable to crash either
 "twm" or "tvtwm", which would be a remarkable feat - and most desirable to
 boot.  i mean, this bug has only been reported, oh, a zillion times by now ...
 
 now *servers*, on the other hand ... (want to crash an openwindows 3.0 "xnews"
 server at will?  just do an 'xbiff -xrm "xbiff*shapewindow: on"'.  blammo.)
