 how do you solve the problem when the message "cannot perform malloc"
 shows for xtcreatemanagedwidget call?
 
 i have the application written in x11r5 running on decstation using
 athena widgets.  as soon as i added codes to do remote procedure call,
 the program refused to work.  i also have my program working using
 just xlib calls with rpc.  my executable code is about 1.4m and i don't
 have any idea how much memory is the decstation 3100/5100.
 
 any help will be appreciated.  thanks.
