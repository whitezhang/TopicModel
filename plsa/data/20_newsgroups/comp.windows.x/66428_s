 no. as soon as you blit two of this icons once on top of the other with a
 little dislocation, you see the rectangular blit crashes too much of the
 icon first blitted, because it draws a full rectangle. the way to do it
 is masking: create a bitmap with all pixels to be merged are 1 and all
 not to be merged are 0. then, set the clip_mask of the gc to this
 bitmap, set the clip_x_origin and clip_y_origin of the gc to the x/y
 coordinates where you blit the icon to the destination drawable, use gxcopy,
 and xcopyarea() the icon pixmap to the destination drawable using this gc.
