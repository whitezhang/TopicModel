 many spreadsheets do regression analysis.  the topic is also well covered
 in most undergraduate statistic books.  cubic splines are usually well
 covered in any undergraduate computer science numerical analysis text.
 i am sure ge/mm has a well stocked library.
 
 i have never used mathematica, but i would be surprised if it could not do a 
 spline.
