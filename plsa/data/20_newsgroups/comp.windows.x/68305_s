 hi,
 
 i am running x11r4 on an ibm rs/6000 (aix 3.2) and x11r5 on a sun4 (sunos 4.1).
 
 since i run x on both colour and black&white displays, i need different
 values for the same resource, so i want to use #ifdef color in my
 application defaults files. however, cpp is only invoked by xrdb, and
 not when the resources are loaded on demand.
 
 is there a proper solution to this?
 
 so far, the only proper solution i've come to think of, is to create 2
 different files in my ~/app-defaults/, say xterm and xterm-color, and
 set my xfilesearchpath to either $home/%t/%n or $home/%t/%n-color.
 but that does not always seem to work (e.g. executing a remote shell
 command without reading the .cshrc does not set xfilesearchpath).
 
 furthermore, i thought of using #include "xterm" in xterm-color.
 however, for resources in xterm that i want to override in xterm-color,
 things are different on both machines. on a sun, the first found resource
 is used (i.e. the one from xterm, the b&w one), while on an rs/6000, the
 last found value is used (i.e. the one from xterm-color). what can i do
 about it?
 
 i have one last question: for the specification of xfilesearchpath, i
 can use %t, %n, %c and %s. %t stands for app-defaults, %n for the
 resource class, but what do %c and %s stand for?
 
 thanks in advance for replying,
 marcel.
