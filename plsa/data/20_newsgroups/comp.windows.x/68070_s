 hi netters,
 	having inherited a solbourne (s-4000 : sun 4 compatible), i was wondering
 if somebody has ported x11r5 to this beast. since solbournce computer inc. folded
 up i don't know where i can get the kernel to move from r4. since they never
 joined the mit consortium, the regular distribution doesn't work. any pointers
 will be highly appreciated.
