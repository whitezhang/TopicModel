 
 hi! i've just installed the new xarchie 2.0.1 and it all works
 fine, except:
 
 on our grayscale xterm the custom icons compiled into the
 program don't work at all, but on the bw terminal it works fine.
 i can set the icon to an xbm file with .twmrc, but that doesn't
 give the neat-o change when busy action. (other programs with
 similar actions, e.g. xmail, xbiff, work fine.)
 
 the x-interface author, george ferguson, suggests it might be a
 problem with the x intrinsics, but isn't willing to hack around
 to fix it himself. but i know zero about x programming, so i
 don't think i can find it. 
 
 does anyone out there know an obvious fix for the problem?
