 dear netters,
 
 i have noticed something rather weared (i think) about creating a dialog shell
 widget while running hp vue's vuewm.
 
 for some reason, every time i create a dialog shell the foreground and backgroun
 d colors are different compared to my toplevel shell.
 i am not doing anything special/different.
 
 does any body know anything about this problem?? how to fix it without hardcodin
 g the colors ?
 
 please respond to kamlesh@salzo.cary.nc.usa ....
 
 thanks !
