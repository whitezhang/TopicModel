 i am trying to run xwd on a sun sparcstation ipx
 with sunos 4.1.2 and openwindows 3.0. i am using
 the motif window manager. i have been unsuccessful
 in using xwd under motif. i get the following when
 doing xwd -out xwd.dmp
 
 x error of failed request:  baddrawable (invalid pixmap or window parameter)
   major opcode of failed request:  73 (x_getimage)
   resource id in failed request:  0x500043
   serial number of failed request:  213
   current serial number in output stream:  213
 
 does anyone have any insight to this ?
