 i have been using a hds x-terminal, and really like it. what
 is really powerful is that it can run the x server without
 running a window manager. one can then run a special client
 x program called a window manager, either (1) run 
 motif or openlook from it's own firmware (limiting the network
 traffic - but having no home). or (2) run motif or openlook
 from some home place (like a sparc, or vms).
 
 this is powerful, especially since i can exit one window manager
 (without killing windows) and then start up another manager.
 (some of my vms tools need special meta-mouse combos that work in
 one manager and not the other).
 
 well the question is:
 
   on a sparcstation running openlook, does anyone know how to
   break apart olwm from the olwm_slave program? basically i
   want to run only the server, and go somewhere else to run
   the window manager.

 please respond my e-mail (as well as posting) because of the
 large volumes in window.x)
 
 thanks.
