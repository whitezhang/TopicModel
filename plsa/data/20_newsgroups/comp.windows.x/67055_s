 i have been trying to compile some source code for a mpeg animation viewer for
 x windows. i got the code from a ftp site. i have modified the makefile as
 they instructed, no errors there. what happens is that i get the following
 message when everything is going to be linked:

 make: fatal error.
 
 does anyone know where these missing functions are located? if you do can you
 help me with it?
 
 i posted before to one of the other unix groups, i tried their suggestions but
 always get this error.
 
 if you have to know: i am using unix system v. the machines here are 486's. the
 terminals i want to use are separate and just called x-terminals and they seem
 dedicated to that. i'm not sure as to what they really are, since it is one of
 my first times out with this x-windows gidget! that is, first time programming
 for it, so to speak. i use them alot just for the graphics things.
 
 if you can help, mail me soon.
 
 gerard.
