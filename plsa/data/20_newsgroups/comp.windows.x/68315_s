 granted it's nothing to loose sleep over, but this is ethernet's tragic flaw:
 the more activity (especially lots of tiny activity), the more collisions
 happen and the performance gets exponentially worse...  i am just now
 opposing any kind of waste of bandwidth under ethernet.  although in a polling
 system it would not be so bad.
