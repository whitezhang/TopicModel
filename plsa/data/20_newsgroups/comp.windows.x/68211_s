 i need some help in tracking down a dvi viewer for x. i have xdvi but we
 have not got the x libraries and includes installed- so 
 		i) is there a way around this, as we are trying to avoid
 		   installing the stuff (space is at a premium).
 		ii)would someone be prepared to make the binaries
 		   available. we have a hp700 and a hp382.
 
 	thanks for any help
