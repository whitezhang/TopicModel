 hello,
 
 	i am admin for an rs/6000 running aix 3.2, x11r5, motif, and xdt3.
 	i want to prevent the user from hitting cntl-alt-bkspc to exit x.
 	
 	i've tried invoking x with 'xinit -t', but that doesn't work.
 	xinit appends the -t to the call to .xinitrc, and not to the
 	call to x.  
 
 	the man page to xinit is no help.  in fact, it tells
 	me that xinit is a script when it is really a binary file.  
 
 	so far, the only way i've been able to accomplish this feat is
 	to add the -t to the call to x in /usr/lpp/x11/defaults/xserverrc.
 	i would rather not do it this way.  does anyone have any other ideas?
