 i have been building x11 with gcc since 2.1 and the only time i had
 trouble was when the position independant code option broke (so i
 couldn't use gcc to build sun shared libraries). the important thing to
 do is to follow the tips given in the gcc release. gcc generates code
 that requires libgcc2 and you should take that into account when
 deciding which compiler to use for the libraries.
