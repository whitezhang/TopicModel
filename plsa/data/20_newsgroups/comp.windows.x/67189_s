 the reason they place their outside corner at the location you requested
 is because that's what the icccm says they should do.

 this code will almost certainly break.  calling xmapwindow and then
 xflush does not guarantee that the window is visible and managed by the
 window manager.  even if this did work, there isn't a reliable way to
 find out how much decoration the window manager placed around your
 window, so you don't know how far to move it.  and what if the window
 manager refuses to move your window?
