 a few days ago there was a posting in this group by andrea winkler
 titled "x and security / x technical conference".  i was one of the
 instructors of that tutorial.  unfortunately, my system purged
 the message before i had a chance to see it, and i don't have
 andrea's email address.  if someone has andrea's address and/or
 the posting, i would really appreciate it if you'd forward it to
 me!
 
 thanks
