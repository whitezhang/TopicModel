 code deleted...
 
 from the xmtextfield man page (during discussion of resources):
 
    xmnverifybell
 
       specifies whether a bell will sound when an action is reversed
       during a verification callback.
 
 you are setting doit to false in the callback, and text[field] is beeping
 as it should.  to turn off this behavior, set this boolean resource to false.
