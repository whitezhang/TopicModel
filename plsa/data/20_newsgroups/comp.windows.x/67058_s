 does xdm work with decnet? i have an ultrix machine running both tcp/ip
 and decnet. i have a number of x-terminals hanging off the ultrix host also
 running tcp/ip and decnet. presently i am using xdm for the login procedure
 on the x-terminals using tcp/ip. since xdm is basically just an x-windows
 client, shouldn't i be able to run xdm on the decnet protocol tower as well?
 
 my first inclination is that xdm is not your typical x client. it is making
 tcp/ip specific socket calls. in this case the answer would be no; you can
 not run xdm over decnet. is this right or not? any feedback is appreciated.
 thanks.
