 i'm not familiar at all with the format of these "x-face:" thingies, but
 after seeing them in some folks' headers, i've *got* to *see* them (and
 maybe make one of my own)!
 
 i've got "dpg-view" on my linux box (which displays "uncompressed x-faces")
 and i've managed to compile [un]compface too... but now that i'm *looking*
 for them, i can't seem to find any x-face:'s in anyones news headers!  :-(
 
 could you, would you, please send me your "x-face:" header?
 
 i *know* i'll probably get a little swamped, but i can handle it.
 
 	...i hope.
