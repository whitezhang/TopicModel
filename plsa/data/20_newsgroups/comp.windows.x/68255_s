 hi
 
 i`m looking for some assistance in locating information on how to run
 win 3.1 on a cga monitor. the setup suggests you look at the manual, but
 the guy i`m helping is part of a large office and computer assistance
 must be booked in advance, therefore he cant get windows onto his cga
 system. 
 
 thanx in anticipation
