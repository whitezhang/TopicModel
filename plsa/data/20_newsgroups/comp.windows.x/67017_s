 dear xperts,
 
 i've trawled through the cc and ld man pages for an explanation on apparentlly
 frequently used compiler options with x programs (ultrix v4.3/dec 5000). however
    ,
 the criptic information i found largely overestimates my brain potential and up
 till now i haven't got the slightest idea what the following options are standin
    g
 for and when to use them (i gathered them from different x programs):
 
         1) -wc,-nd4000 -wc,-ns4000 -wc,-nt50000  -wf,-xng1000
 
         2) -nf,-xnh2000 -olimit 2000
 
         3) also, has anybody the foggiest idea what the following link error mea
    ns
            and what corrective action should be taken? i know of bss as the area
     in
            unix for uninitialized data, but i'm completely unaware of the gp are
    a.
 
 "colormapinds: a large common placed in gp area because of a small undefined
  reference (possible gp relocation errors may result)
  pixelmap: a large common placed in gp area because of a small undefined
  reference (possible gp relocation errors may result)
  ld:
  gp relocation out-of-range errors have occured and bad object file produced
  (corrective action must be taken)
  gp relocation out-of-range for small data or bss by,
         221181 in the positive direction,
         0 in the negative direction.
  best -g num value to compile all -count'ed objects creating nmr with is 13
  best -g num value calculation reliable only if all -count'ed objects were
  compiled with -g num greater or equal to maximum size of a literal pool
  item (8).
  *** error code 1"
 
         4) finally, is the options syntax consistent across different vendor's
 compilers. if not, does imake offers a standard machine independent approach to
 it?
 
 i do realize that an explanation will involve some compiler and os knowledge but
 i pretty know some basics and help of any nature will be greatly appreciated.
