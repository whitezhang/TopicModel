 from the faq:
 
 subject:  96)! what is this link problem with libxmu on sunos 4.1.[23]?
 
         in sunos 4.1.2 sun fixed a shared-library bug in ld which conflicts
 with the way x builds the shared xmu library, causing these symbols, notably,
 to be undefined when building some x11 clients:
         _get_wmshellwidgetclass
         _get_applicationshellwidgetclass
 compiling "-bstatic -lxmu -bdynamic" appears to work.
 
 to solve the problem if you are using openwindows 3.0 (x11r4-based xt), please
 contact your local sun office and request the following patches:
 
 patch i.d.      description
 100512-02       4.1.x openwindows 3.0 libxt jumbo patch
 100573-03       4.1.x openwindows 3.0 undefined symbols when using
                         shared libxmu

 a source patch for use with the mit x11r4 libraries was developed by conrad
 kimball (cek@sdc.boeing.com); it retrofits into r4 some fixes made in r5 to
 get around this problem. the patch is on export in [1/93]
         contrib/x11r4_sunos4.1.2_patch_version3.z
