 
 i want to do something like this:
 
   date | xcb -s 0 | xcutsel
 
 to get the output of the date command put into the xprimary selection.
 unfortunately, xcutsel is an interactive little bugger and there isn't a
 command argument to tell it to just do it and not put up its little
 window.  so, is there some other command that i can use like this?  or,
 is there an analog to xcb that will put stuff in xprimary instead of cut
 buffer 0?
