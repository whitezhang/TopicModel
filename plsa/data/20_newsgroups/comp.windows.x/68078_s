 an application we *must* use requires upper-case input.  i'd like to be
 able to simply move my cursor into the window where that application is running
 (just a text window, xterm or some such) and have everything i type be entered
 as all caps.  when the cursor is in any of my many other windows, i want to
 automatically return to normal functionality.  i have point-to-type set.
 
 is there a way to do this in x (specifically ow 3.0 on sparcs)?  is there a
 way to mess with .xdefaults to make a category of window do this?  any
 hints would be most appreciated.  i program in c but not x, although i can
 pick up somthing that's not too involved.
 
 thanks kindly.
