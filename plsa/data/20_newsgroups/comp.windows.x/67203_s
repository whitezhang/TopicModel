 you could set up a bitmap with a mask in it.  clear the
 bitmap, draw the rectangle to be deleted with gxor.  draw the one
 that is to stay with gxclear.  then gxxor the entire pixmap with
 the screen.  
 
 note that this is a pretty effective way of animation, if you ever
 need to do that (replace the gxclear with a gxxor).
