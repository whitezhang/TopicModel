 i recently corrected the resolution on my sparcstation by changing
 /usr/lib/x11/xdm/xservers from:
 :0 local /usr/bin/x11/x :0 -ar1 500 -dpi 100
 to:
 :0 local /usr/bin/x11/x :0 -ar1 500 -dpi 85
 
 i determined that my 19" 1152x900 monitor was 85 dpi by measuring the
 active screen area and dividing by resolution.
 
 however, this has caused my application fonts to behave strangely.
 after some research, i believe this is caused by my applications
 requesting fonts by family, weight, slant, and pointsize.  i believe
 that x is grabbing the first font on the path with these characteristics
 and displaying it.  since i have only 75dpi and 100dpi fonts on my
 path, the results are inaccurate.  i do have some speedo fonts, but
 not for the family i am using (helvetica).
 
 i think this is incorrect.  the fonts should always be provided in the
 resolution of the display.  this never seems to happen unless you
 explicitly request fonts by xres and yres!  this is true of both the
 scaleable and bitmapped fonts!  for instance, the command
 
 xfd -fn '-bitstream-charter-*-*-*-*-*-240-*-*-*-*-*-*'
 
 will invoke a 75dpi font (despite the fact that this is a speedo font).
 
 the command  
 
 xfd -fn '-adobe-courier-*-*-*-*-*-240-*-*-*-*-*-*'
 
 will invoke a 75dpi font or a 100dpi font (depending on my font path).
 despite the fact that x knows my display is 85 dpi, and that it can
 generate an 85dpi font for me!  unless i my applications specifies a
 resolution, x appears to pick a stupid default.
 
 is this a bug?  is it a feature?  if so, why?  is there anything i can
 do to get around this problem?  people have suggested that i lie about
 my resolution, and specify a single font path (75 or 100, not both).
 this would at least make my app consistent, but i like being able to
 look at rulers that appear in my paint application and say: "yup, thats
 an inch".  anyone have a set of 85dpi bitmapped fonts i can use?
