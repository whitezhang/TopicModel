 a new version of tkman, a hypertext manual page browser,
 is now available for anonymous ftp at harbor.ecn.purdue.edu.
 if you can't wait until it's moved into a permanent place,
 you may obtain it now by
 
 cd /incoming
 binary
 get tkman-1.3.1.tar.z
 
 in a few days it will be moved to /pub/tcl/code.
 
 it requires tcl 6.7 and tk 3.2, which are also available on harbor.
 
 
 among the new features are:
 
 * tables and equations (tbl and eqn) supported
 * selectively search directories
 * searches may be case insensitive
 * ultrix man pages supported (if yours--for whatever machine--
   doesn't format properly now, please send me uuencoded version
   of both the man/man/ and man/cat/ versions)
 
 for those over 21 and with a strong stomach, the following is a line taken
 from an ultrix man page ("<tab>" means the tab character):
 
      -t<tab>  sorts<tab>by time<tab>modified (most recently<tab>modified first)<tab>instead<tab>of by
 
 
 sgi users should still use paul raines patched v1.3.
 you can get the modified distribution by anonymous ftp from
 bohr.physics.upenn.edu (130.91.48.159) in ftp:/pub/tkman_sgi.tar.z
 
 everyone else should be able to use tkman 1.3.1 successfully on their
 machines without modifying anything outside of the makefile.
 warning:  if you are upgrading from a pre-1.3 to 1.3 or later and you
 have a ~/.tkman file, you should delete the "set man(print)..."
 line before running tkman 1.3.
