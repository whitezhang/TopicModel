 we have a sun 3/80 and we have just acquired a cg8 frame buffer card.
 
 the cg8 is supposed to support both a 24-bit color visual and a monochrome visual.
 the default visual for the xnews server is the monochrome, and we are unable to change it to
 the 24-bit visual. we have tried using xgetvisualinfo to get a visual of depth 24, but had no
 success.  xdpyinfo gives no information about a 24-bit deep visual, only monochrome. 
 
 there are two possible solutions:
 	if someone has patches for x11r5 xsun server, could they forward them to us?
 
 	otherwise, could someone instruct us how to access the 24-bit color in openwindows?
