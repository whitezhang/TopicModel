 hi, i'm new to this group so please bear with me!
 
 two years ago i wrote a sunview application for fast animation
 of raster files. with sunview becoming rapidly obselete, i've
 finally decided to rewrite everything from scratch in xview.
 i put together a quick test, and i've found that xputimage()
 is considerably slower (factor of 2 on average?) than the
 sunview command pw_rop() which moves image data from memory
 pixrects to a canvas. this was on a sparc ipx. it seems that:
 (1) the x protocol communication is slowing things down; or
 (2) xputimage is inefficient...or both! my question is, what
 is the fastest way in x11r5 to dump 8 plane image data to
 a window? can i take advantage of the fact that the client is
 running on the same machine as the server? or am i stuck with
 xputimage() (in which case i might as well give up now...)?
 
 all help appreciated...thanks!
