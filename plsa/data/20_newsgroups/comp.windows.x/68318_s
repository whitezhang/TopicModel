 bandwidth is unlikely to be the problem, except over a wet string network.
 one of major flaws of x is the horrendous number of transactions (and
 hence process switches) that it forces upon a host.  actual measurements
 (hourly average) are 5 per second per logged in user, which can lead to
 20-50 or more process switches (depending on whether each event is
 filtered by the window manager as well as the applications and how
 many processes are needed for each character.)
 
 while a blinking cursor needs only the application and the networking
 process, and does not add any transactions, it will add something like
 10 process switches per second per user.  this is a significant increase
 in overhead, especially as the application may have quite a large working
 set.  if you want a rapidly blinking cursor, there could be as many
 as 50.
 
 if you want to go there, i wouldn't start from here!
