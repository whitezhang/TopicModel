 thanks for this clue, and thanks to derek ho also for a pointer in the
 same direction.
 
 one solution, due to derek ho: when the popup is popped up, we setvalue
 its location -- which on repeat popups will be unchanged from the
 previous popup. the slow response can be avoided by calling getvalue
 first, and only using setvalue if the required location is different.
 the problem can also be avoided by making a tiny alteration in the
 location of the popup, so that the setvalue really does change the
 location of the popup. (we tried this just for a double check on the
 source of the problem.)
 
 the solutions we have tried successfully are now as follows:
 
 1) use "twm" or "mwm" rather than "olwm"
 2) use "olwm", with resource "*wmtimeout: 10"
 3) only reset the location of the popup window if it is truely changed.
 
 this is obviously working around some bug somewhere.
 
 thanks -- chris ho-stuart
