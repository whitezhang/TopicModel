 i've been hearing rumblings about fresco, and it sounds like it may be
 what i'm looking for, but how far is it from release, or at least some kind
 of availability?  how similar is it to interviews?  if i code to interviews,
 will my code work with fresco?  how about motif?  i've heard some mention
 of versions of interviews which support motif.  will it be feasible to use
 motif with fresco?
 
 any information would be much appreciated.
