 how are you, everybody?
 
 i installed x11r5 on our ibm rs6000 workstation. os version is aix 3.2.3.
 there was no problem in installation.
 but there was a problem in invoking 'xinit'.
 when i invoke 'xinit', there is a error message as follows:
 
 giving up.
 xinit: unable to connect to x server
 xinit: no such process (errno 3): server error.
 
 i'm a navice. so i don't know the reason why i get this message.
 please help me. i am waiting for your help.
 
 thanks for reading this mail.
