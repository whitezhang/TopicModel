 i am trying to write an image display program that uses
 the mit shared memory extension.  the shared memory segment
 gets allocated and attached to the process with no problem.
 but the program crashes at the first call to xshmputimage,
 with the following message:
 
 x error of failed request:  badshmseg (invalid shared segment parameter)
   major opcode of failed request:  133 (mit-shm)
   minor opcode of failed request:  3 (x_shmputimage)
   segment id in failed request 0x0
   serial number of failed request:  741
   current serial number in output stream:  742
 
 like i said, i did error checking on all the calls to shmget
 and shmat that are necessary to create the shared memory
 segment, as well as checking xshmattach.  there are no
 problems.
 
 if anybody has had the same problem or has used mit-shm without
 having the same problem, please let me know.
 
 by the way, i am running openwindows 3.0 on a sun sparc2.
 
 thanks in advance--
 john c.
