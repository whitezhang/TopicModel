 it seems silly, but while i've located things like tgif that can  edit
 gif  files, and various tools to convert to/from gif format, i haven't
 been able to locate a program that just opens a window and displays  a
 gif file in it.  i've looked thru various faq files, also to no avail.
 is there one lurking about in some  archive?   nothing  sophisticated;
 just "show the pretty picture"?
 
 alternatively, if i could locate the specs for gif, i don't suppose it
 would be too hard to write it myself, but i have no idea where to even
 start looking for the spec.  (well, actually, i do have an idea - this
 newsgroup.  ;-)
