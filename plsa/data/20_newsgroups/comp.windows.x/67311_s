 see subject. an opportunity for sales-people (-persons? -entities?).
 
 i am looking for a commercial/pd graphics editor with fairly limited
 abilities that runs under x and preferably uses motif widgets. it must
 run on hp-ux version 9, either with or without the pex extension. the
 sort of things i want are simple drawing, resizing and moving of objects
 such as lines, rectangles and text. bounding rectangle operations are
 sufficient for object selection. ideally it should also allow the
 creation and placement of more complex objects such as widgets (e.g.
 text entry fields or labels), but this is not mandatory.
 
 does anyone have such an animal? if you do, please mail me with details
 including price (especially run-time licensing since it must be
 included in a product). alternatively, send glossies to me at logica,
 68 newman street, london w1, including technical info please. for pd
 stuff, i have some effort that could be put into porting.
 
 thanks for any help,
 nicholas young.
