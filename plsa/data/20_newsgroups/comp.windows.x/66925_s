 
 the following problem is really bugging me,
 and i would appreciate any help.
 
 i create two windows:
 
 w1 (child to root) with event_mask = buttonpressmask|keypressmask;
 w2 (child to w1) with do_not_propagate_mask = buttonpressmask|keypressmask;
 
 
 keypress events in w2 are discarded, but buttonpress events fall through
 to w1, with subwindow set to w2.
 
 fyi, i'm using xnews/olvwm.
 
 am i doing something fundamentally wrong here?
