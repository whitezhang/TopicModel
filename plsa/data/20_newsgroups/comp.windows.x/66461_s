 well i am not sure if this is the right newsgroup to ask, but let me try anyway.
 i am running xterm and like all unix users, i run man <something>. recently,
 i switched to solaris 2.1, and their man pages are littered with ".i" directives
 that are somehow translated into reverse video when displayed by man under xterm.
 the resulting output (admittedly a personal taste) is very annoying to look at.
 back when i was using sunos 4.1.2, i remember their man pages have some keywords
 displayed with underlining....
 
 so my question is how do i change the xterm's behaviour under ".i" directives 
 for nroff man pages, to perhaps underlining, or at least disabling it. (".b" 
 directives are fine, i like them. and of course, i don't want to go in and edit
 the man pages inputs...) somehow, xterm allows one to specify both a normal font
 and a bold font, but not an italic font??
 
 any pointers, suggestions are greatly appreciated.
 thanks -- john
 
 p.s. running xterm -rv won't work, i tried...
