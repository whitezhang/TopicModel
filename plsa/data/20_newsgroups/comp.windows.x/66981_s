 hello world,
 
 i want to write my xt-application code like this:
 
 {
     do_some_work();
     /* now i need some user input */
     xmcreatedialog();
     wait_for_user_input(input);
     if (input == "ok") {
        more_work();
     } else {
        other_work();
     }
 }
 
 so "more_work() and other_work()" are not in callback functions but the
 application simply waits for the user to answer the question.
 
 how can i code this in my xt/motif-application?
 
 thanks very much in advance.
 
 greetings, huub.
