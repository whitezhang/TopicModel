 	yes, it is.  it is available at ftp.ctr.columbia.edu, probably
 in pub/xkernel.  
 
 	in response to the earlier gentlemans question, you could
 theoretically recompile xkernel on a sun4.  the binaries available are
 for the sun3/50, but the author says it could be used on most
 architectures, and he does have a 'do-it-yourself' type distribution.
 
 	we use xkernel for about 7 machines here.  email me if you
 have any questions i can help you with...
