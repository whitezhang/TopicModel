 while i have respect for john's ability and integrity, i really regret his
 leaving just after a major release (or, more accurately, making the release
 just before leaving).  several of us are having problems with xv-3.00, and
 in particular i have issues with all the fixes that have so far been made
 to the imakefiles and xv.h.  without john to adjudicate, and everybody
 posting fixes that work for *them*, chaos is inevitable; let's hope it is
 temporary.
