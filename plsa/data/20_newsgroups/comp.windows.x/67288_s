 fix the table in .../x11r5/mit/server/ddx/sun/ or
 use xmodmap(1).
 
 put
   stty pass8; setenv lc_ctype iso_8859_1; setenv lesscharset latin1
 in your .login. the first prevents the stripping of bit 7.
 the second sets the locale. the third makes less(1) show the character
 instead of the octal representation.
