 : eg, sgi's vendor server has mod2mask being numlock, whereas solaris

 : given server?  sorry for the wasted bandwidth and my appalling ignorance.
 
 you'll have to check the keysym(s) on each of the keys for each
 modifier. the one with numlock in its mapping is the modifier
 you want. a bit ugly perhaps but i think its currently the only
 way to do this (and it does have some precedent as keysyms are 
 used to differentiate capslock from shiftlock for the lock
 modifier).
 
 i don't know of an accepted strategy for handling ambiguous
 assignments either. (ie. what if numlock is mapped for more then
 one modifier). i suppose first found is as good as any.
 
 x doesn't handle locking modifiers that well. 
 
 hope that helps,
