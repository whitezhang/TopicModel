 hello motif world,
 
 a few days ago i posted my announcement for an update of motif++. i got
 several requests to send the bindings per e-mail, and i know of several people
 who have been using motif++, and there are probably a number of people i am
 not aware of who are also using motif++.
 
 my question is:
 
 how many people 'out there' would be interested to join a mailing-list, where
 people can ask questions about motif++, swap stories, and give new ideas about
 new directions and improvements for the bindings. this would benefit the
 user-community, as well as give me more insight in what people would like to
 see added to motif++. motif++ is still very much a voluntary project, and this
 way i can make a list of priorities, in what order things should be added, or
 changed.
 
 if you're interested in joining such a mailing-list, please take the time to
 reply to this message, and tell me so. when there is sufficient interest, say
 about 20 people or more, a mailing-list will be set up at my site, and i will
 post the announcement of the newly-created list to this and other newsgroups.
