 	several ways are available -- pageview (which i think came
 with our system, so i can't point), ghostview (with ghostscript), and
 the new xv 3.00 package all do so.  i recommend the latter two,
 especially xv if you want to do any conversion.

 	i'm not sure offhand, but i will attempt to mail you the
 comp.lang.postscript faq, which has a list of utilities.
