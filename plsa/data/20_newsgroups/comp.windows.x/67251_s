 i am considering making a reasonably large application for free
 distribution (probably copylefted).  i am going to use x.  now i'm
 bewildered by the huge number of "standards" that "open systems" has
 created.  
 
 i've lived in a fairly tookit-sheltered environment.  most of the tools
 here were produced with the athena widget set, or x intrinsics or xw
 (??).  
 
 in my humble opinion, they look like crap.  i don't know, however, if
 this is a characteristic of the tookits, or just poor aestetic taste
 in the programmers.
 
 i would like my app to look a little more "sculptured" like mwm.  i
 understand, however, that mwm isn't free like the other tookits.
 
 i am getting linux, so i will have interviews, but i don't know how it
 will look.  i get the impression andrew is from the fsf, but i don't
 know what it looks like either.
 
 if you can help explain this toolkit mess to me, i would be much
 obliged.  which are free?  which are the best?  which are portable?  which
 looks nice?  which is not a resource hog?
 
 also, if you happen to know which are available on linux and/or sun,
 that would be a big help too.
 
 thanks in advance.
