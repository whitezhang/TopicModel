 i am working for a company which has only one connection to the internet.
 this is through a firewall gateway (unix workstation). i would like to be
 able to telnet to a host outside the company and set the display to my pc
 which is running an x-terminal emulator (exceed/w). the display can be set
 to the gateway workstation with no problem but when i set the variable to 
 my ip address i get a "error: can't open display" message. 
 
 this can't be that hard to work around can it?
 
 btw i have no trouble running x-clients on local workstations (in the company)
 and having them display on my pc.
