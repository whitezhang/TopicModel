 i need some advice regarding monitor to use with xfree86. i have an et4000
 based graphic card with 1 meg of memory. i know this card is supported in
 xfree86 because a friend of mine has one of these in his pc. his monitor is
 17" colour capable of displaying 1280x1024 resolution. i cant afford this kind
 of expensive monitor. i heard from somewhere that xfree86 requires multisync
 monitor with minimum horizontal scan frequency of 60khz. is this true?
 i would only like to use xfree86 at resolution of 800x600 in 256 colours and
 so was thinking of buying a cheap 14" svga monitor. interlaced (cheap)14" svga 
 monitors only have have maximum horizontal scan frequency of about 38khz.
 will this kind of monitor work with xfree86? 
 
 please reply by email.
 
 thaks in advance.
