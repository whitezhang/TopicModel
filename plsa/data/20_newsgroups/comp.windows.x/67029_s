 
 	hi. i'm trying to figure out how to make a window manager
 place the window where the create window command tells it,
 regardless of what it may think is right. (my application has
 reason to know better)
 
 	i don't want to set the override-redirect because i do
 want all the embellishments that the window manager gives, i just
 want the wm to accept my choice of location.
 
 	i've tried twm, tvtwm and mwm and they are all
 uncooperative.
 
 	thanks,
 	-- ethan
