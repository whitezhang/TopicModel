 we are currently evaluating gui builders, initially for motif but with
 a wish to be flexible & portable.  we have been through the popular
 names (uimx, teleuse, xvt etc) and have been very impressed with what
 we have seen of galaxy from visix.  i have spoken to current users
 from a list supplied by visix (happy users as you would expect), and
 seen favourable comments on the net.  however, since it is fairly
 expensive to get an evaluation license from visix, i would like to
 query the net for any negative experiences with galaxy.  did anybody
 evaluate them and prefer another tool or use galaxy and regret it or
 find any mis-features ?
 
 advthanksance,
 
 phil
