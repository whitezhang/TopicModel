 
 after looking at the scaling code i realized the follwing:
 
   1) my problem with the resolution 100x100 foints is due to an installation 
      problem.
 
   2) that the x server or font server will rescale the best font it can find
      to meet your requirements.  
 
      this means that if you server return a response like the following
 
      -adobe-helvetica-medium-o-normal--0-0-75-75-p-0-iso8859-1
 
      you can ask for the follwogin:
 
         -adobe-helvetica-medium-o-normal--14-100-90-90-p-0-iso8859-1
  
      and it will generate it for you.  you should try to always use 
      known pixel sizes.
