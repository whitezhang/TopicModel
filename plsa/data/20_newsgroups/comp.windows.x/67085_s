 hi,
 
   please reply to me direct as i am not a member of this list.
 
   i am new to x, so please excuse my lax (read: "probably incorrect")
 terminology!
 
   environment: sun sparc 10, sunos 4.1.3.  x11r5 path level 23.  my x process
 is started by xdm.
 
   i) i want to setup the backgroud (root window?) of the tvtwm display to
      display the escherknot etc (grey is a very boring colour to work on)!
 
      the setup is as follows:
 
         lib/x11/xdm/xsetup_0    -   xsetroot -bitmap ... etc
         ~user/.xsession         -   xsetroot .... etc
                                     tvtwm
 
      there are also .tvtwmrc and .xdefaults files in the (~user) home
      directory.
 
      the xsetroot in xsetup_0 displays the appropriate bitmap in the xdm
      login window as expected - very nice!
 
      unfortunately, when the users session is started, the background of the
      tvtwm window reverts to grey.  if i manually type xsetroot... in an
      xterm window when the session has started, the background is changed as
      expected.
 
      the question is: how do i retain the background from the login window
      and/or specify a new background on a per-user basis as part of the
      the users session startup?
 
  ii) when i open an xterm on the sparc 10, not all of the keys are recognised
      and some keys on the keyboard are not sending the correct characters.
 
      ie: real key       key shown on screen
          ------------   -------------------
          hash           back slash
          tilde          pipe
          double quote   at symbol
          pound          hash
          cursor key     not recognised
 
      this is very annoying!  is x at fault here or the machine setup?  i have
      installed the xterm drivers that came with x11r5 in both terminfo and
      termcap as they seemed more uptodate.
 
      typing set in an xterm window shows a terminal type of xterm - as
      expected!
 
   any help on how to correct either of these problems much appreciated!
 
   thanks,
 
 dave.
