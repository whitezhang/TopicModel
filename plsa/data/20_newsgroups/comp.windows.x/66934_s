 i have two motif widgets. i would like to control one of them via the
 keyboard and the other with the mouse. i set the keyboard focus on the first
 widget, but as soon as i click the mouse on the second one, i lose the
 keyboard focus on the first one. 
 
 could some kind soul show me how to do this?
 
 thanks
