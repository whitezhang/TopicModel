 standard colormaps were spec'd with the intention that window managers
 would make them available. this doesn't mean that every window manager
 author in the world immediately dropped everything they were doing and
 implemented this at top priority.
 
 the esge server we ship makes the xa_rgb_best_map available at
 startup. it doesn't wait for window managers to do it.

 does your hardware have only one clut? since standard colormaps
 typically devour all 256 entries, there is no way it can avoid
 displacing the entire default colormap if your hardware has only one
 clut.
 
 i don't believe standard colormaps are intended to aboid possible
 colormap flashing between clients using the default coilormap. rather,
 colormap flashing will be avoided between two clients that use the
 same standard colormap. an example would be two clients that need a
 full color range would both use xa_rgb_best_map (or whatever it's
 called under x11r5).
 
 if you are trying to avoid colormap flashing with the default
 colormap, your best bet is to try to load all the colors you use into
 that colormap. if you can't do that, then you'll get flashing on a one
 hw clut framebuffer.
 
 now if your window manager used the same standard colormap as your
 client, this flashing could also be avoided. perhaps some window
 managers have command line options for selecting standard colormaps?
