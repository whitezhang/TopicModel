 we where following version of xv and i have been very surprise to discover that
 the new version is a shareware: what a pitty !!! :-( .
 what i found on the inthernet was the freeware. i make myself a freeware and
 i spent long time on it but i don't plain to make paid to use it. i think
 if evrybody spent some time to make freeware, evrybody will be paid by the use
 of other freeware.
 
 here we will stay with xv 2 and drop xv 3.
