 i tried to send this as private mail, but mail to benj@ossa.hq.nasa.gov was
 rejected, so here it is:
 
 here is an extract from the readme file that comes with macx:
 
 users of remote commands with sun machines may find that their remote commands 
 appear to do nothing and there is no output from the sun machine.  this is due 
 to a feature of the sun rexecd network daemon which quietly disconnects from 
 requesting machines that are not known to the sun|s network address (/etc/hosts
 or nis hosts) database.  to successfully use remote commands with a sunos-based
 machine, there must be an entry in the network address database for the 
 macintosh which is running macx.
