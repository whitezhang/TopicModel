 i've installed many x apps, and have that many of them imakefiles that have
 lines startingwith xcomm in them. when i do a xmkmf to create the makefile,
 the makefile also has the xcomm (comment?) lines in them. i always have
 to edit out these lines because the make command barfs on them. i was
 wondering what these lines were for, and what i might be doing wrong that
 causes the make command to dislike them. thanks!
