 now available: xvertext 4.0 
 --------------
 
 summary                                  
 -------
 xvertext provides you with four functions to draw strings at any angle in   
 an x window (previous versions were limited to vertical text). rotation  
 is still achieved using ximages, but the notion of rotating a whole font
 first has been dropped.
 
 what's new?
 -----------
 i've added a cache which keeps a copy of previously rotated strings - thus
 speeding up redraws.
 
 where can i get it?
