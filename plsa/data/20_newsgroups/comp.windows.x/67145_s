 i've installed x11r5 with patches for solaris 2.1 on our sparcstation lx /
 sparcclassic pool. on the lx, x11r5 runs fine, but on the classics,
 after giving the command startx, xsun prints the following messages:
 	warning: cg3_mmap: can't map dummy space!
 	mapping cg3c: no such device or address
 and exits.
 
 does anybody know how to fix this problem?
 
 thanks in advance.
