 # does anyone know if the following is possible, and if so how do i go about
 # doing it.
 # 
 # i want to be able to display remote x11 applications on a vaxstation 2000 off
 # of an internet node. here is where the problem comes up, the vaxstation isn't
 # connected directly to the internet but is connected via decnet to a node that
 # does have a connection to the internet. does anyone know if it is possible to
 # get the display to use tcpip from the remote internet node down to my local
 # internet node and then send it via decnet down to the vaxstation 2000?
 #
 
 for the machine that is connected to the internet, what is it running?  if it
 is running vms, then if you obtain multinet for it, multinet comes with a
 tcp/ip to decnet gateway for x11.
