 hi folks,
 
 i'm trying to compile xfig 2.1.7 on a ss1+ running sunos 4.1.1 and ow 2.0,
 and i'm having a little trouble with make/imake.  specifically, make bombs
 when it needs to use any xaw file.  this isn't surprising since x11 files
 on suns with the standard ow 2.0 distribution are in various places under
 /usr/openwin (xaw files are in /usr/openwin/share/include/x11/xaw !!)
 actually, the real problem is that i know squat about imake, and i don't
 know how to tell imake where the x11 files are.  i can see from the 
 makefile that it's looking in the wrong places, but the first line of the 
 makefile reads 
 
    # makefile generated by imake - do not edit!
 
 help!  is there some way i can edit the imakefile to tell it where to
 look?  (i have set defines = -dopenwin_bug, as it said to in the readme
 file.)
 
 email and post are both fine.
 
 thanks in advance,
 
 dave
