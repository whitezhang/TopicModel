 yesterday i changed the us-keyboard of my sparc10 with a german keyboard.
 and now i cannot get any "alt graph" characters ('tilde' usw.).
 when i exit from x i can get the characters, but not under x.
 
 can anybody give me some hints, where to check for the correct installation
 of the keyboard.
