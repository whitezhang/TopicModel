 
 hi
 
 i am trying to implement a pointer feature in xlib
 
 i have multiple windows and all can take input and 
 show output simultaneously on all other displays
 
 i want to implement a pointer feature 
 
 i would like to get the pointer to come up on all windows once 
 i choose pointer in the menu and every one should be able
 to see it
 
 can you give me some hints as to how i should proceed 
 
 
 replies will be greatly appreciated
 
 thank you
