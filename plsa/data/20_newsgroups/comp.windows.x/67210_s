 
 hi folks
 
 say, i'm new to r5 and have one quick question.
 
 in using xon ( xon  <machine_name> )  , i notice that it
 always comes up with a very small window .  i'm pretty
 sure its the default font.  my xterms all work normally.
 is xon supposed to read your .xresources for a font size ?
 
 xrdb -q appears to show the right stuff.
 
 i can use xon with arguments such as  xterm -fn 10x20    etc
 and everything is correct.  of course you could always do a 
 simple script to do this , but i have a feeling i'm missing
 something simple here.
 
 comments / suggestions appreciated.
 
 thanks in advance
