 
 i am developing an x (xt,xm) application that will include a graphics window
 of some sort with moving symbols among other things.  a pure x application
 could be implemented with motif widgets, one of which would be an 
 xmdrawingarea for drawing with xlib.  but i would like to take advantage of
 the graphics library (gl) available on our ibm rs/6000 (sgi's gl i believe).
 
 is it possible to mix x and gl in one application program?
 can i use gl subroutines in an xmdrawingarea or in an x window opened by me
 with xopenwindow?
 
 i have never used gl before, but the doc on gl winopen() says that the first
 time winopen() is called it opens a connection to the server.   also, most of
 the gl calls do not require a display or gc, unlike most x calls.  from this
 initial information it appears that x and gl cannot be mixed easily.   is this
 true?
 
 does pex (graphigs?) have the same functionality of gl?
 
 
 environment:
      aixwindows x11r4
      motif 1.1
      gl is available
      aix sys v 3.2
      ibm rs/6000 360
 
 
 thanks in advance.
