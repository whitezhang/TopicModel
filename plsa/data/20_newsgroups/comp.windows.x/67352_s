 the xview version 3 source distribution included in the contrib section 
 of x11r5 included the source to the textedit program.  i'd like to take 
 the sources and modify them to add support for a tooltalk-like message 
 server, and maybe for tooltalk while i'm at it, since the sun-supplied
 textedit binary doesn't seem to speak tooltalk.
 
 however, the sources in the r5 contrib area seem to be for an older
 version of textedit than the version shipped with openwindows 3.  for
 example, the own 3.0 textedit includes drag and drop support and a 
 dropsite in the main control area, while the source in contrib/xview
 knows nothing about drag and drop.
 
 the textedit.c included in the xview sources says it's version 15.50,
 dated 5/22/90, while doing a 'what textedit' on the own 3.0 binary says:
 
         textedit.c 2.62 91/09/14 copyr 1990 sun micro
         dragdrop.c 1.26 91/09/14 copyr 1990 sun micro
         tooltalk.c 2.16 91/09/14 copyr 1990 sun micro
         ds_relname.c    1.7 91/09/14 copyr 1990 sun micro
 
 so, does anyone know if the 9/14/91 sources to textedit are available?
 i'd really like to work from the latest source if possible.
 
 please reply by email, and i'll post a summary if there's enough 
 interest.
