 hello xperts out there.
 i've just built x11r5 for sunos 4.1.1/sparc.
 i have gcc-2.2 and i'd like to use its 64-bit capability
 to generate an x11 release which will render to the frame
 buffer using store-double (64-bit) machine code.
 can anyone tell me which directories/source files/
 compiler switches to begin with?
 
 thanks in advance
