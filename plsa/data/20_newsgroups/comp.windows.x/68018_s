   how can i draw an object of a specified color over objects of varying colors
   and then erase it without having to redraw everything else?
 
   what's happening is this,
 
       if i draw it using gxcopy, it is drawn in the specified color.  if i erase
       it using gxcopy with foreground and background reversed, it erases 
       whatever it overlayed.  i then need to redraw
       all of the items it crossed.  yuch.
 
       if i draw it using gxinvert it is drawn in a random color - nothing 
       resembling what i requested.  it properly restores the color of 
       underlying objects in erase mode.
 
   what's the solution?
