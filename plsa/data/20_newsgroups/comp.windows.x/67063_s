 
 i am currently attempting to get a copy of the hp widget set compiled
 under linux (sls release with kernel 99.6) and am running into some
 problems.  actually, it seems that this is more of a gcc question,
 because i got it to compile without trouble using cc on an rs/6000.
 	basically, there are a number of functions with prototypes
 set up in, let's say, compositep.h, for instance, the composite
 widget's insert_child procedure is set up with the type :
 
 	typedef void (*xtwidgetproc) (widget)
 
 but in several places in the hp source code, they reference the
 insert_child procedure and pass it multiple arguments instead of just
 one, as the prototype suggests.  for example:
 
 	(*superclass->composite_class.insert_child)(w, args, p_num_args)
 
 now, gcc chokes on this, giving an error message that too many arguments
 are passed to the function.  so, does anyone have any suggestions as to
 how to turn off this checking in gcc, or how i can go about changing the
 code to accomodate this call without changing /usr/include/x11/compositep.h,
 or has anyone successfully built the hp widget set and have any suggestions.
 	many thanks in advance for any help.
