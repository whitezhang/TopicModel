 if i understand your problem correctly, you want to have a way to send
 exposures to your manager widget when your app-specific code draws xlib
 graphics on the window.
 
 it sounds like you might want to send an exposure using
 xsendevent and specifying a region. if you know the region you need to
 send the exposure, generally you have the bounding rectangle of the objects,
 you can use xcreateregion to create a region, xunionrectwithregion to add the
 new object polygons to the region, and then either use the region
 to clip your gc for the redraw or use xrectinregion to test which of your
 other objects need to be redrawn. keeping in mind that the stacking order
 of overlapping objects affects how they look.
 
 hope it helps
