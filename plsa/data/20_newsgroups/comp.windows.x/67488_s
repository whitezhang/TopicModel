 most graphics systems i have seen have drawing routines that also specify
 a color for drawing, like
 
 drawpoint(x,y,color) or drawline(x1,y1,x2,y2,color) or
 fillrectangle(x1,y1,x2,y2,color) 
 
 with x, i have to do something like 
 xsetforeground(current_color)
 xdrawpoint(d,w,x,y)
 
 why split this into two functions? why did x designers decide to not associate
 the color with the object being drawn, and instead associate it with the
 display it is being drawn on?
