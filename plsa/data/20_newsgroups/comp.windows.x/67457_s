 at the moment, i am using a sun 3/80 (cgfour/bwtwo) with sunos 4.0.3
 and openwindows 2.0.
 
 this configuration is slow and i can't run all the programs on ow2. for
 example, when i start a mailtool from ow3 and display it on my ow2
 display, i can't open the compose window.
 
 i want to install an x11r5 or x11r4 server on my sun and use xdm (yes,
 we have xdm already running for other x-terminals) to log in and start
 the x programs.
 
 is there a "ready to go" binairy of the x11 server for my configuration
 (i have read something about xsun), or must i compile the x11 stuff by
 myself?
 
 any help is welcome
