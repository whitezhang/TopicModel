 hear! hear! i agree completely. one thing i can't stand about
 the mac interface is its shear determination to force you to use
 the mouse(what if your mouse breaks--your whole system is
 down!).  i like the mouse--it is handy on some occassions such
 as cut and past and moving icons around, etc.  but for most
 work, the keyboard and hot keys are 10-20 times faster than
 using the mouse. sure it is a plus to be able to do something
 simple if you are an inexperienced user, but how long is it
 before your are experienced? a month? two? (speaking of pcs at
 the moment.)
 	i don't think it is too much to ask that window
 programmers provide not only a menu/mouse interface but also
 look forward to those who would like to move on to hot keys and
 command line interfaces, which usually allows you to do more in
 less time if you are experienced.
 	all of the above equally applies to windowing systems on
 unix (especially since unix is at least 500% more powerful than
 dos).
