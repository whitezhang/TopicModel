 hello everybody,
 
 i hope that i insert the right options, so that my question is only
 distributed through out germany, because my question is more or less
 country dependend.
 
 now the question:
   is there anybody who can tell my if (and of course where) there is
   a ftp-site/archie (or whatever) where din fonts for x are available.
   i am looking for fonts holding the specification:
     din 16
     din 6776
     din v 40950
 
 
 thanks in advance
