 using xputimage, your source is maintained by the client and the
 destination is maintained by the server, thus you incur the overhead
 of transporting through whatever client-server communications
 mechanism you are using.
 
 is it possible for you to maintain your source images in pixmaps?
 these are maintained by the server, so copying them into a window is
 much cheaper.
 
 also make sure you are not sending any unnecessary xsyncs, or running
 in xsynchonize mode.
