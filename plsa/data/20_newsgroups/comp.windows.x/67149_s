 #do anyone know about any shading program based on xlib in the public domain?
 #i need an example about how to allocate correct colormaps for the program.
 #
 #appreciate the help.
 #
 
 i don't know if this might help, but i've just started playing with a program
 called povray (persistance of vision raytracer) that also displays its output
 via x windows.  it does a fairly good job of allocating the colormap on my
 psuedo-color 8-plane display.  i got the source from from a site in canda.
 the person i retrieved them from was david buck (dbuck@ccs.carleton.ca).
