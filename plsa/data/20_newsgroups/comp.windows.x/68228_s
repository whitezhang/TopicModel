 hi there,
 
 
   do someone of you have a program for sending a key event
 to another window but it must appear in that window....
 
 i have used xsendevent.tar package but it does not do that !!!
 
 for example, if i get a program executing:
 
 --------------
 #!/bin/sh
 read something
 ....
 ....
 echo $something
 ....
 ....
 --------------
 
 and if i send the key event "<keypress>a,<keyrelease>a"
 to that window then i will get:
 
 something=a
 
 
 thanks in advance.
