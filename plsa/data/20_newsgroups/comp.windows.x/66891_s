 hi xperts, some simple questions for you:
 
 i've seen a lot of different terms, which seem to mean the same thing.
 who can give an exact definition what these terms mean:
 
 	-) multi-screen
 	-) multi-headed
 	-) multi-display
 	-) x-server zaphod mode
 
 is there a limit how many screens/displays a single server can handle
 (in an articel a read something about an upper limit of 12) ?
 
 how is the capability called, if i want to move the cursor from one
 screen/display to another.
 
 any hints welcome.
 
 thanks, rainer.
