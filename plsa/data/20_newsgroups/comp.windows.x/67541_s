 i have done this before, but i'm not sure i used the best approach (although
 i tried several methods...).
 
 you have to run up the window heirarchy (using xquerytree()) until you get
 to the root window.  now, this is not so simple because some window managers
 slap a window over the root window that is the same size as the root window,
 so be sure to take that into account for further calculations.
 
 calculate the position and width/height offsets for each window using
 xgetgeometry().  be sure to take the border_width into consideration.
 remember a windows border_width is on the outside of a window, so the
 windows x,y,width,height must be adjusted accordingly.
 
 all of this should give you pretty good numbers for how much space the
 window-manager is using.
 
 now, to place the new window, you have to use the same numbers to calculate 
 where you want to place it, because the window-manager will re-parent it on
 the outside of where you place your window (if i remember correctly).
 
 disclaimer: all of this is from memory, and i no longer have the code.  but
 i did get it working under several window managers correctly.  feel free to
 call or e-mail for further info.
