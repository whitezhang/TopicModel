 i'm writing 'xwall', a simple x version of 'wall', and i want it to
 put a message up on each of a default list of displays.  the problem
 is that xopendisplay hangs if one of the displays is currently
 controlled by xdm (login screen).   i've been through the manuals
 and faq and don't see a simple way to see if a display is 'openable'
 ahead of time, or to get xopendisplay to fail after a short period
 of time.  any hints, suggestions, clues, or pointers to info?  thanks...
