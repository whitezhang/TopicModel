 in x10, the drawing attributes were bundled into drawing
 requests;  that is, the server's drawing model was stateless.
 
 this caused problems with performance and network traffic,
 so the x11 redesign included the graphic context to codify
 the drawing state.  most application designers who want to
 draw things in several different colors create a gc for
 each color during initialization, then pass the gc id in
 each drawing request.
 
 for more information see scheifler and gettys's article
 in the 1986 acm transactions on graphics.
