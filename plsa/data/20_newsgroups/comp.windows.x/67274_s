 i was planning to use the following pipe to move some display data to a system
 that has a color hardcopy unit:
 
 	xwd | xwud -display hostname:0.0
 
 i had tested it with some simple windows like the openwindows file manager,
 and it worked fine, but when i tried it with a more complex (larger) image,
 the xwd part blew up with a segmentation fault.  i tried it without the pipe,
 by redirecting xwd's output to a file and then used the file as input to xwud
 and got the same error from xwud.  if i had to guess, it seems like it's
 running out of memory, but this happened on a sparc 10 with 64 megs, 128 meg
 swap space, and only one user with minimal activity.  the file was about 3 mb.
 
 this verion of xwd/xwud was supplied with the sun openwindows 3.0 distribution
 which i believe corresponds to x11 r4.
 
 any ideas?  thanks in advance.
