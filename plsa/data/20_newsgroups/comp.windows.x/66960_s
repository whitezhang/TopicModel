 i have the exact same problem when running hewlett packard's microwave design
 system (mds) from an hp 380 unix box and running macx 1.2, sys 7.0.1*.
 normally, mds draws a window with a deep blue backround, but occasionally
 it becomes a light blue and all the text, etc, inside the window become
 "washed out" (nearly invisible). i thought that it was just something
 brain dead that i was doing or a subtle conflict with another app or init.
 
 by slightly moving the window, and forcing a re-draw, the colors get corrected.
