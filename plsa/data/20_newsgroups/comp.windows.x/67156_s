 i just had an idea. i'm not sure if its been done and i'm just
 remembering it unconsiously, but i thought that in dialog
 boxes and whatever in windowing systems, there should be a
 way to intuitivly set some things checked or unchecked or
 filled in a certain way. my idea: tape. you know, like putting
 a piece of tape over a light switch?
 just an idea, if you like it, use it.
