 
 i have the task to program a x application for the first time and have some severe difficulties creating a window in which i can draw something.
 unfortunately some basic books on the topic of x application programming are not available to me for the moment.
 
 i am running a hp720 with hpux 8.07, vue and x11r4 using xt anbd xaw.
 
 what i did until now:
 i initialized the x intrinsics cxreating a top level widget with xtappinitialize. i passed as a application_class name 'commandwidgetclass'.
 then i set the argument values for window height and width using xtsetarg and
 passed it to the toplevel widget with xtsetvalues.
 when i call xtrealizewidget, i get a window of the specified size, but i have no idea how i can draw something in it.
 
 can anybody send me some help and perhaps some basic information how to use the widgets ?
 in which situation it is useful to use them and in which not ?
 
 thanks very much in advance
