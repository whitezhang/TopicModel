 is there a pd version of cfb, or other pd server stuff, which has a colour frame
 buffer implementation which works in bitplaned mode, i.e. where the screen
 memory is grouped so that "bit 0 of every pixel is here, bit 1 is there, etc."
 
 the only such beast i know if at the moment is the gfxbase server for the
 commodore amiga, and it is commercial. i don't know if they wrote their own cfb,
 but i suspect they did.
 
 please respond by email, as i don't read this group.
 
 many thanks
 dave
