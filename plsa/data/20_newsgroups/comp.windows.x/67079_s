 there is a widget already defined for gl.  it is the glxmdraw (motif) or
 glxdraw (athena) widget.  it is similar to a xmdrawingarea, except that it
 allows you to use gl calls to render into the window.  look at glxlink,
 glxunlink, glxgetconfig, and glxwinset in the man pages.

 the glxmdraw widget works pretty well.  opengl will be an improvement.

 i think gl is a little easier to use and a little more powerful, but
 that's just an opinion.  mileage may vary.
