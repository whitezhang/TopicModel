 hi all!
 
 i tried to run softpc, a pc emulation software program, installed on a silicon 
 graphics workstation from a human design system (hds) x terminal, and 
 everything went fine, except the fonts could not be converted from one type 
 of format to the other - hds uses different font format from sgi worksation.
 so, i have the following questions:
 
 1. how do you resolve different font formats from different machines?
 
 2. is there a program to convert one type of font format to another?
 
 if you have similar problems/experiences and have found a solution, please 
 let me know.  your help will be greatly appreciated!
 
 thank you in advance for your help and information.
