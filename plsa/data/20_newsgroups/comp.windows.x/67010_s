 actually, info@qdeck.com is our customer service department. if you have
 technical questions, you can write to support@qdeck.com.

 i expect the limiting factor will be your server machine, not the network
 itself. to give you a real-world example, here at quarterdeck we have
 roughly 100 people using dvx to talk to a bunch of unix boxes, novell
 file servers, and each other. it's not _too_ much of a load on our
 ethernet (with maybe 4 concentrators, so you have 20-30 people on each
 segment). if you had a badly loaded net, or the apps you wanted to run
 were very network intensive, you could run into some slowdowns.
 
 but the biggest problem would be the machine itself. say you have a 486
 33 with plenty of ram and a fast hard disk and network card. if you have
 10 people running programs off it, you're going to see some slowdowns
 because you're now on (effectively) a 3.3 mhz 486. of course, dvx will
 attempt to see if tasks are idle and make sure they give up their time
 slice, but if you have 10 working programs running, you'll know it.
 
 having said that, if you can tweak the programs being run (by adding
 in calls to give up time slices when idle and that sort of
 thing), you could probably run 15-20 people on a given machine before
 you started seeing slowdowns again (this time from network bandwidth).
 it all really depends on what the programs are doing (ie. you're going
 to see a slowdown from x-bandwidth a lot sooner if your apps are all
 doing network things also...)
