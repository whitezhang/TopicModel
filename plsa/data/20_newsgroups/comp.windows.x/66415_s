 i need to have pcs and sparcstations run the same application ( namely
 microsoft project ). the original system ran on the pc. now it needs to
 be expanded to allow unix users to work with the application. the
 current proposal is to use desqview/x as a display server for the
 application.
 
 i would like to know your experiences with using desqview/x to run an
 application on a pc and displaying on a sparcstation. i've heard that
 the network traffic is slow.
 
 replies only by e-mail please.
 
 thanks, in advance.
