 when i changed from svr4 to svr4.2 on my intel box i discovered that
 some of my svr4 xclients such as xload, etc would no longer work.
 
 
 they bomb out with the message:
 
 error: can't open display unix:0.0
 
 is this because they can't find the correct shared libraries, they need
 to be recompiled, or have i not used the correct options?
 
 both systems use x11r5.
 
 thanks.
 
 jack.
