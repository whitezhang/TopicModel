 i'm having problems creating a cursor bigger than 64x64, i'm using motif 1.1
 x11r4 running hp-ux 8.07 - all the functions return valid results but no
 cursor appears when the bitmap is bigger than the aforementioned size. i tried
 
 using the following code:
 
 unsigned int w,h;
 xquerybestcursor(xtdisplay(programarea), xtwindow(programarea), 72, 71, &w,
 &h);
 
 to return the nearest size to what i require however it returns 72 and 71 as
 the width and height respectively. what am i doing wrong? and if not how can i
 get round the problem!!
 
 thanks in advance
 mike
