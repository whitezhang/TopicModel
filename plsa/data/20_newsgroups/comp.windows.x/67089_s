 hello netlanders:
 
        i am a novice x user with a question for any xgod.
 
        my computer configuration with the x problem is as follows:
 
        486dx50/256/16ram  running esix 4.0.4 
        wangtek at-style interface 250 m tape drive.
        i have loaded the basic os (which includes nsu) and
        inet utilities (tcp/ip).
        i ftp-ed the xfree86 (x11r5) binaries and installed properly.
  
  i can execute startx and run x-windows with no problems.
  however, if i try to access the tape drive while in x, the
  machine locks up instantly.  if i am out of x and access the
  tape, the tape drive works fine.  soon as i try to
  startx again; the screen changes modes, but, the grey background
  pattern does not come up and no xterm is forked.  i have to login
  from another terminal and execute a shutdown to reset the system.
 
  i've contacted esix about this problem.  they claim their x-window x11r4
  server (which i have) works with the wangtek tape drive.  they also 
  claim i only need the nsu (network system utilities) to run x; i don't
  need inet (tcp/ip).  my experience has been that i need both to get
  xfree86 to work.  i'm not too concerned about having to load both nsu and inet
  packages to get x to work unless the inet package is causing my problem.
 
  i would like to get both x and my tape drive to co-exist on the same
  system.  if you can shed any light on the problem, it would be appreciated.
  
  one colleague implied this might be a hardware conflict.  if this is true,
  what direction should i look to resolve the conflict ?
 
  thanks,
