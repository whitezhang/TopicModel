 suppose you have an idle app with a realized and mapped window that contains
 xlib graphics.  a button widget, when pressed, will cause a new item
 to be drawn in the window.  this action clearly should not call xcopyarea() 
 (or equiv) directly; instead, it should register the existence of the new
 item in a memory structure and let the expose event handler take care
 of rendering the image because at that time it is guaranteed that the
 window is mapped.
 
 the problem, of course, is that no expose event is generated if the window
 is visible and mapped.  do you know the best way to "tickle" a window so
 that the expose event handler will be invoked to draw this new item?
