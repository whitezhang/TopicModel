 i have tried that with one font, if your xterm terminfos/termcaps are set up
 to not remap bold (which they are be default) to reverse, then nothing happens
 when bold is displayed.  it would appear (at least in x11r4) than you cannot
 display bold in an xterm without specifying two fonts; a normal and a bold.
 i wish someone would prove that incorrect.
