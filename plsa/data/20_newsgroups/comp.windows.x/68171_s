 this is a question aimed at those who have done some server code hacking:
 
 
 
 i am attempting to add a working savescreen function to a new
 server.  i have been able to get the screen to blank out properly, and through
 debugging i can see that my savescreen function is being called with on=0,
 which (for some arcane reason) means to blank the screen.
 
 my problem is that this function is never being called again with on=1, even
 after i have moved the mouse and/or typed some keys.  my question is:  what am
 i likely to be missing that would cause this problem?  i copied the basic
 design of my function from the existing versions:
 
 static bool next_savescreen(scr,on)
 screenptr scr;
 bool on;
 {
 
   /* this was copied from the omron server code -- is it the right way? */
   if (on != screen_saver_on) {
 		nextsetlasteventtime();
   }
 
   if (on == screen_saver_on) { /* save user's current setting */
 		next_save_screen_brightness = nxscreenbrightness(my_eventhandle);
 		nxsetscreenbrightness( my_eventhandle, 0.0); /* blank the screen */
   }
   else {											 /* unblank the screen */
 		nxsetscreenbrightness( my_eventhandle, next_save_screen_brightness);
   }
 
   return true;
 }
 
 i can see in the server/os code where the screensaver is called to turn on the
 saver, but i cannot find where it "wakes up" the server and unblanks the
 screen.
 
 any tips/help would be appreciated.
 
 thanks.
