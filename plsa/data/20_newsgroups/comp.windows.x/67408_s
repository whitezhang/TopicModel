 as i announced at the x technical conference in january, i would like to
 make imake-tex, the imake support for using the tex typesetting system,
 publically available. currently imake-tex is in beta test here at the
 computer science department of dortmund university, and i am looking for
 some more beta testers, preferably with different tex and imake
 installations.
