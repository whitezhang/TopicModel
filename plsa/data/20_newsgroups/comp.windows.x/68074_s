 
 hi!
 
 	i have a question which is not directly related to x screen saver.
 
 what x screen saver does is to blank the screen if it has been idle for
 some time.  i don't want my screen to go blank but to get locked or call
 xlock program.
 
 	is there a parallel call to xsetscreensaver() which locks my screen
 or call my lock program after certain amount of idle time?  or is there a
 way to find out how long the server has been idle?
 
 thanks
