 well, yes and no.  i don't particularly want this discussion to spark
 a lengthy debate, but i do think it's worth pointing out that "popular
 usage" is not always sufficient excuse.  
 
 in this case, for example, i think an appropriate parallel may be found
 in the pronunciation of proper names: if people commonly misspelled or 
 mispronounced your name, would you feel compelled to change it?  probably
 not.  
 
 the same is true of x.  "the x window system", "x", "x11", and related
 monickers are proper names in the same sense that any product name is a
 proper name.  in fact, some of them are *trademarked* names.  the fact 
 that many people get them wrong is largely beside the point.  
 
 as for the trade publications that promulgate things like "x window" or
 "x.windows" or any of the other nonsensical variants one often sees, 
 consider the fact that these publications are supposedly written by 
 *journalists*.  would you trust the facts of a journalist who couldn't
 be bothered to get the name of his/her source right?  would you trust
 a product review by someone who got the name of the product wrong?
 
 popular usage is as it may be, but i for one am all for holding people
 who claim to be journalists to a higher standard of correctness.

 x11 technically superior to news?  well, in *some* alternate universe
 perhaps ...
