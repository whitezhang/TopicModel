 ncd just announced a new generation of pc-xview. they
 changed the name a little though and i can't remember
 exactly... pc-xsomething.
 
 it now supports windows and their press release
 implies that since it's still priced in the $500 range
 and it's so feature-full why buy anything else?
 (disclaimer: this is not a direct quote from the 
 literature, but i think it sums it up. also, i have
 never used the product.)
