 i would suggest skipping olwm and getting olvwm instead. this version of the
 olwm window manager implements a virtual desktop that i find really handy even
 on large monitors. 
 
 this version is also available at export.lcs.mit.edu:/contrib/olvwm3.tar.z.
 the readme file also suggest getting the files in /contrib/xview3.
 
 in my case, i built the x server first, xview second, then olvwm. all of these
 were installed into /usr/x5. once i verified the server worked correctly,
 i happily issued "rm -rf /usr/openwin/*".
 
 using gcc 2.3.3 to build all of the above resulted in a windowing system that 
 is, for all intents and purposes, identical to openwindows 3.0 and that is     
 incredibly faster. there is a bit of tweaking you will have to do if you want
 things to work _exactly_ like openwindows, but not much.
