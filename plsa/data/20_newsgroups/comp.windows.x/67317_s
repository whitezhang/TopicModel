 we recently got an ncd x-terminal to evaluate. this is running xremote over
 a serial line.
 i wanted to get some measurement of response time, so i wrote a small xlib
 program which simply creates a window, maps it and sends the first expose 
 event to itself. the program times the delay from sending the event, to 
 receiving it.  i thought this was the simplest way to test client/x-server 
 round-trip delays. it's a similar concept to the ping(8c) program.
 
 is this a valid test to perform ? i've also tried the xbench program, available
 from ftp.uu.net, which bombards the server with graphics operations, but i 
 just wanted to get a quantative measure of what is "acceptable" interactive 
 response time. has anyone got any ideas on this subject ?
 
 thanks.
