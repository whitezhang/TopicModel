 try to get axe - it's a wonderful x based editor and much simpler to use than
 emacs what is a overkill. of course, emacs is no editor but a religion.

 1) don't call going from an amiga to a ibm 'upgrade'
 2) the amiga workbench did the job of a desktop manager, and there is no
    really amazing good x desktop manager in the public domain.
    (i'm currently writing one... but it's in very early stage)
 3) xdtm may be a medium good replacement.
 4) x associates icons with nothing. a number of x window managers associate
    icons with windows, in a way to ease window management.
    but this has nothing to do with icons of a desktop manager application.
 5) the tool bitmap is there for simple icon drawing.
