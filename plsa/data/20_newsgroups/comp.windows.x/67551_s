 hello,
 
   i am considering buying the hummingbird x-windows software for a ms-windows
 3.1 pc (386-40mhz, ne2000 ethernet board).  would anyone tell me if they
 are using this package in a similar environment and if they are happy with
 it?  i will be connecting to sun sparcstation 10 running sun os 4.1.3.
 
 thanks very much,
