 i have a clone almost with no name generating 91k xstones on a 486/33mhz
 system.

 excuse me, but with a 486/50 256k cache, s3 928 isa card, 8mb xs3 (x11r5) running 386bsd  you can get 100k+ xstones at 1024x768 65mhz which i doubt 
 that your xp10 series gets. commerical verions x servers for s3 928 cards
 can get 136k xstones. so the performance is there and additionally since
 is running unix multiple users can use the system which i have done in
 my home setup.
 
 maintenance is minimal if you can read readme files for the x servers and
 for 386bsd.
