 
 	are there any widgets, function 
 	librarys for drawing networks, 
 	graphs etc ? (not tree views) 
 	freeware, shareware, comercial...
 	like this, for instance:
                                                                
                           o
                           |
                           |
                 o---------o=======>o
                / \        |
               /   \       |
         o----o.....o      o
             / \
            /   \ 
           o     o
 
 	* just by giving the associations 
 	  between the nodes. automatic
 	  layout generation.
 
 	* it would be nice if any node 
 	  symbols could be used. maybe 
 	  even to insert widgets as nodes.
 
 	* using different line styles etc.
 	  for describing associations.
 
 	any information would be appreciated,
 	thanks in advance,
