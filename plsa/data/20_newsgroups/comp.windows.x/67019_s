 i'm trying to write some code that lets me draw lines and do rubber-band
 boxes in motif/x.  i'm running on an 8-bit display for which i've created a
 colormap and am using almost all of the colors.  i want to draw the lines
 in a drawing area widget -- a widget in which i'm displaying a bitmap using
 xputimage().  if doesn't matter if the lines i draw interactively stay
 around when the window is refreshed.
 
 currently, to draw interactively, i begin with:
 
    /* drawindex is an colortable index i reserve for the foreground */
    /* my_default_bg_color is the color index for the background of my image */
    palette_colors[drawindex].red =   palette_colors[my_default_bg_color].red;
    palette_colors[drawindex].green = palette_colors[my_default_bg_color].green;
    palette_colors[drawindex].blue =  palette_colors[my_default_bg_color].blue;
    xstorecolors( mydisplay, my_cmap, &palette_colors[drawindex], 1);
    xflush( mydisplay);
 
    xsetfunction( mydisplay, gc, gxxor);
    xsetforeground( mydisplay, gc, drawindex);
 
 then to draw i do:
 
    xdrawline( mydisplay, xtwindow( drawingarea1), gc, x1, y1, x2, y2);
    xflush( mydisplay);
 
 and when i'm all done, to return things to normal i do:
 
    xsetfunction( mydisplay, gc, gxcopy);
 
 
 what i'd like to happen is for the lines i draw to be the inverse of
 whatever i'm drawing over.  instead what happens is i get white lines.  if
 the lines are over a white background - nothing shows up.  if the lines are
 over a black area - nothing shows up!  it's very strange.  but the gxxor
 function seems right - since if i do a rubber-banding box, it erases and
 redraws itself correctly (ie. not disturbing the underlying image).
 
 any suggestions what i'm doing wrong?
