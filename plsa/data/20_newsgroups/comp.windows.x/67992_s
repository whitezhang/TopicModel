 if you installed x lib xt by redefining projectroot, you will find that
  during the install it recompiles one of the files in x lib that does the
 search for xkeysmdb and embeds the search path for the file based on whatever
 projectroot was defined. to confirm this what happened, because i'm 
 guessing, go to mit/lib/x and do
 strings xstrkeysym.o | egrep xkeysymdb
