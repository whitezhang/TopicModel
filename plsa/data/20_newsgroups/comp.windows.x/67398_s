 i've found a problem in the use of xlib functions regarding re-entrancy. i
 decided to implement an animated cursor (using 6 created cursors) by calling
 xdefinecursor from a sig_alrm signal handler. this is used to indicate we are
 waiting for a operator request to complete. (on a production control system).
 i was redrawing the screen underneath the animated cursor and then restoring
 the standard cursor when complete. i found dumped core , and upon analysis
 it was when the sig_alrm handler was called during a xdrawstring call. xdrawstring
 was doing a bcopy (presumably an internal structure) when the xdefinecursor
 was called. presumably the (internal) structure that xdrawstring was manipulating
 was not in a stable state and sent xdefinecursor to where it shouldn't have been.
 
 has anyone else experienced this? is there any official documentation that
 says you should ensure this doesn't happen? or should bcopy() be atomic.
 we are running on sgi irix 4.0.1 with x11r4.
