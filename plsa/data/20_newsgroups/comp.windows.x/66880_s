 i am creating a graphics program using the athena widgets. i use
 xlib routines to install a custom graphics contex by obtaining the display,
 and window variables with the xtwindowofobject() and xtdisplayofobject().
 the object was one of the sub widgets.  
   the problem occurs that whenever a button is pressed or a menu is selected
 the graphic contex reverts to the orginal one. i tried moving the allocation
 of the graphic context before the allocation of the buttons but nothing
 changed. i am preforming all of this manipulation before calling 
 xtappmainloop().
 
 thank you for any help.
