 they aren't functions, they are character arrays. the standard strings
 are either defined as string constants or character pointers into
 xtshellstrings and xtstrings determined by xtstringdefines. your
 libraries were compiled with this defined and your application with it
 undefined so simply recompile one or the other. it is probably worth
 adding -dxtstringdefines to your cflags.
