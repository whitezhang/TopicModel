 
   when i run our rs6000's "info" utility through a remote login
   shell (rlogin) from my sun sparc 1+, i can no longer type
   lower case in any of info's window prompt's.
 
   i thought the prob. may have been due to my sun window mgr. 
   (openlook) being incompatible with the aix motif application
   but i tried it under tvtwm also.  same result.
   
   so this is presumably an x11 key definition problem between 
   workstations - but my system admins. feign ignorance.
   
   what do i need to do the be able to type lower case into 
   this remote aix motif app. from within my local openlook
   window manager?
