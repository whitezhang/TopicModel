 i'm running x under openwindows 3.  normal x programs not having a
 font specified always show up in the same font - until i change the
 fontpath, and restart windows - then a new default font is used until
 the next change.  i can't seem to figure out how it chooses.  is there
 some way to set this?  possibly something in .xdefaults???
 
 please reply in direct email - i summarize.
