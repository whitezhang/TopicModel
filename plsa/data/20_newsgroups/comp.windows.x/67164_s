 	there is a free program called 'xkernel' which does just that.
 it is by seth robertson (seth@ctr.columbia.edu).  it takes a sun 3 and
 boots a limited kernel which allows you to run x.  we converted 4
 machines over this semester and the speedup is enormously appreciable
 -- i find them faster than an ncd 15inch black&white xterminal that we
 are playing with, and a bigger screen to boot!  as a matter of fact,
 the department just bought some old sun3s at an auction to convert!
 
 } xkernel is available for anonymous ftp from ftp.ctr.columbia.edu
 } [128.59.64.40] in /xkernel/xkernel.shar (/xkernel is a symlink to the
 } latest version of xkernel)
 
 	note that the compiled version which is available is for the
 sun 3/50, but compiling to work for a sun 3/1xx should be quite easy.
 
 	i am not connected with xkernel except as a satisfied
 installer and user 8).  i may be able to answer questions; feel free
 to email me.
