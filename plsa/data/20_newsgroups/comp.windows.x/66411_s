 i've been using the xmgraph widget that's been floating around and i
 noticed the performance is significantly better using gadgets, perhaps
 even 100% faster.  i had heard in an old programming course that gadgets
 were no longer any benefit to performance, and that it's just as well
 to use widgets everywhere.  so why would ~50 pushbutton gadgets be a lot
 quicker than 50 pushbuttons in the graph?  should i start putting gadgets
 back into my long pulldown menus? 
 
 xmgraph manages children connected by xmarc widgets in a directed network
 type graph with automatic layout capability.
