 
 i'm an new to this.  having found some files (public) to look into, i
 ftp'ed them to a system i have access to.  i then used kermit to transmit
 them via modem to my host computer, a pc-based file system.  i access
 internet through modem access to a university mainframe.  from the pc
 file server, i pull the files to a disk, and then pull them from disk
 to a sgi indigo (the sgi is not networked yet).  when i try to uncompress
 and un-tar the files, they either come out as garbage or i get an error
 in the tar process about directories being invalid.
 what i'm wondering about is the transfer of unix files (compressed,
 binary,ascii) about multiple platforms.  my guess is that it is the copy
 to a 'dos' disk that is screwing things up.  any help is appreciated.
