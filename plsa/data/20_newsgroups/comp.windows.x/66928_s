   let me add another of my concerns: yes, i can buy a port of motif for "cheap",
 but i cannot get the source for "cheap", hence i am limited to using whatever x
 libraries the motif port was compiled against (at least with older versions of
 motif. i have been told that motif 1.2 can be used with any x, but i have not
 seen it myself).
 
   currently, i have x11r5 running on eight different unix platforms, of which
 only three came with motif. on those three, i am unable to use the x11r5
 libraries to build motif clients, because i get link errors between the
 vendor-supplied port of motif and my x11r5. i anticipate having this same
 problem when x11r6 becomes available.
 
   the result is that i cannot build motif clients that rely on x11r5, since i do
 not have motif compiled under x11r5. true, i could buy another port of motif,
 but that sort of ruins the whole idea of "free", doesn't it?
