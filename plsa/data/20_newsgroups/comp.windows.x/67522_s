 i checked the faq on this first, and no luck..
 
 
 i need to convert the r5 tree widget for use with xview v3.0. the
 problem is the fact that xview uses their own event loop system, and i
 was wondering if anyone had any tips (or converted source) on converting
 these pups.
 
 
 thanks,
     sean. (wipeout+@cmu.edu)
