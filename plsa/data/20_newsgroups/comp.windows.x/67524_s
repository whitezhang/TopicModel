      you  should  try  having  a  .xsession  script in $home to do these
 things.  xdm will  start  up  your  process  using  the  system  version
 (usually /usr/lib/x11/xdm/xsession), which should check whether you have
 your won and change to that if you do.  (take a copy of the  system  one
 and edit it). 
 
      note, that this file requires "x" access to be set.
