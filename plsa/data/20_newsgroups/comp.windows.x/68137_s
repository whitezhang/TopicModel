 color coordination...
 
     i tried to start a discussion in `comp.windows.x' at the start of the
   year about some sort of `standard color table' that icons should follow
   (say 16 to 32 colors including 5 colors for a small grey scale). but no
   one responded at all.
 
     the problem is that if the colors for icons are just used willy-nilly
   you will soon find that the workstations color table, devotes itself
   solely the window manager, icons and other `adminstrative tasks' instead
   of applications that actually require the colors for proper working.
   ``color needful applications'' such as :  picture and graphic displayers,
   animation, real time video, raytracers, etc... .
 
     the following is a suggested color table for icons, and general use.
   icons, window managers, and general applications, should follow this
   table or something like it, unless the application is ``color needful''.
 
      * for each primary color (red,green,blue) three colors
              eg: values   0, 128 and 255.
        this results in  3 ^ 3  colors (27) representing most of the
        standard colors for use in icons.
 
      * two extra shades of grey
              eg: vales    (black) 0, 64, 128, 196 and 255 (white,red,...)
 
      * 3 other colors -- probably of some primary color to provide shading
        a and 3-d look to buttons and titlebars in the window manager.
 
     this table represents 32 colors and represents a large range of
   posibilities for the above ``administrative services'' of the
   workstation.
