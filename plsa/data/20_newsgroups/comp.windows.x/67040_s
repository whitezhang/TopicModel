 i found an oddity with our sgi indigo (mips r3000 chip).
 when xlock +nolock is running, and i am working remotely
 or in batch (at) mode, the runtime of my programs (as timed
 by using clock() in the code itself) is ~25% slower than if
 xlock is not running.  no other processes seem to affect my
 runtimes, yet this is very consistent!
 
 any explanations, real or imagined :)
 
 thanx
