 dear sun and windows people,
 
 i am running sun workstations with sunos 4.1.1 and 
 vanilla x11 r5. i have a bunch of xterminals as well.
 
 today i had my xdm fail. at about 9:30
 it was impossible to login to a host from an xterminal.
 the message was the "xdm too many retransmissions".
 in my xdm-errors file i had the following entries:
 
 
   >error (pid 7423): server for display :0 terminated unexpectedly:
   >256
   >error (pid 7927): warning: keyboard on display :0 could not be
   >secured
   >error (pid 7423): server for display :0 terminated unexpectedly:
   >
   >i also had:
   >
   >error (pid 7457): warning: keyboard on display :0 could not be
   >secured
   >error (pid 7423): server for display :0 terminated unexpectedly:
   >256
   >error (pid 7462): warning: keyboard on display :0 could not be
   >secured
   >error (pid 7423): server for display :0 terminated unexpectedly:
   >256
 
 also, at the console, the login box would come up for
 about 2 seconds and then
 it would go away. it would do this continuously.
 
 i could login from another workstation to the hosts in question,
 however, i could not login on the console.
 
 i tried killing xdm and restarting it but that didn't help.
 i finally rebooted all the hosts. (which hurts when done in the
 middle of the day).
 
 any help would be appreciated.
 
 thanks,
 phil
