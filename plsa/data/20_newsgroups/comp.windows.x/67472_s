 that's not all it says.  the coverage of modifiers is in chapter 8
 of volume four (or chap 7 in older athena editions), where there is about 
 10 pages on how to specify translations to capture
 various combinations of keys or buttons.
 
 the xlib route uses xlookupstring and there is a lot of coverage
 of how that works in volume one,  chapter 9.  you should read this
 to understand how all the mappings work before trying to do anything
 complicated.
