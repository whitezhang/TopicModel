 
 hi.
 
 i'm wonderring if it is possible to replace a single module, as xkeybind.o
 in a shared library, as libx11.so in suns openwindows. i tried to rtfm, but
 i didn't get any wiser that way. also, can i do the same on an rs6000 machine
 running 3.2.2 (if it is possible at all). i know how to do it with real 
 libraries (ar). i am trying to replace xlookupstring in the delivered
 libraries, with another that does a few special things.
