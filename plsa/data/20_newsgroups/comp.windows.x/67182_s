 thanks for docs info. it turns out that if i leave out colormap updates between
 frames and use tvtwm, my tests with 100 400x400x8 frames on an ipx using the
 server-resident pixmap method give an astonishing *50* frames per second! and
 very smooth. i think i've found the best solution (thanks to the generous help
 on this group!) however, i may have colormap questions later.....
