 you wanna do masking. build a bitmap (pixmap of depth one) where all pixels
 you name "opaque" are 1 (that get copied) and the others are 0. use this
 bitmap as the clip_mask in the gc used for xcopyarea(), and remember to
 adjust the clip_origin coordinates to the xcopyarea() blit origin.
 
 the mouse pointer (besides from that it is driven using ramdac analog
 mapping on most hardwares) uses a mask, too.
 
 but be warned: blitting through a mask and especially moving around this mask
 is annoying slow on most xservers... it flickers even at 40 mips...
