 the copyright notices themselves seem to be making conficting
 restrictions.  i do not know how to reconcile:
 
 /* copyright notice
  * ================
  * copyright 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993 by john bradley
  * 
  * permission to use, copy, and distribute xv in its entirety, for 
  * non-commercial purposes, is hereby granted without fee, provided that
  * this license information and copyright notice appear in all copies.
  *
 
 ... with:
 
  *
  * xv is shareware for personal use only.  you may use xv for your own
  * amusement, and if you find it nifty, useful, generally cool, or of
  * some value to you, your non-deductable donation would be greatly
  * appreciated.  $25 is the suggested donation, though, of course,
  * larger donations are quite welcome.  folks who donate $25 or more
  * can receive a real nice bound copy of the xv manual for no extra
  * charge.
  * 
  * commercial, government, and institutional users must register their
  * copies of xv, for the exceedingly reasonable price of just $25 per
  * workstation/x terminal.  site licenses are available for those who
  * wish to run xv on a large number of machines.  contact the author
  * for more details.
 ...
 
 it strikes me that the first part gives you the right to use, without
 fee, the program for noncommercial purposes if the info appears in all
 copies. this seems to cover educational institutions despite what the
 rest of the notice says.  and the first part doesn't say subject to
 the conditions outlined below...
