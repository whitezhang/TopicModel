 i'm writing an application running under x (using motif), and i need to do
 some stuff when the application quits.  now, when i shut down my x windows
 session, it doesn't seem to send a sigterm (or whatever) signal to my
 application (i'm trapping various signals like that).  therefore, i thought
 i could use an x signal to check for my top level window being destroyed.
 
 however i seem to get destroynotify events whenever i move windows.  is
 there any way for me to check that the window is actually being destroyed
 (some field to check or some combination of events?).
 
 replies by e-mail please and i will summarise.
 
 thanks for any help,
                       ian
