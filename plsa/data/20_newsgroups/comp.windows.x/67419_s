 xv's been shareware for about a year ... hadn't you noticed?
 i don't have a problem with this.  john bradley has put a *hell*
 of a lot of work into xv, and if he feels that it's time to get
 some monetary reward from it, that's surely his right.

 had you bothered to consult the distribution terms of the ijg jpeg
 code (which are right there in the xv distribution), you would have
 observed that we specifically grant permission for use in shareware
 and commercial software.  sam leffler's libtiff copyright also grants
 permission for unrestricted use including resale.

 "commercial"?  there's a big difference between a polite request
 for a voluntary donation and commercial, it's-illegal-to-copy-this-
 and-we'll-sic-our-lawyers-on-you software.
 
 i do agree that john's readme file could be a little clearer about
 what he means by personal use.
