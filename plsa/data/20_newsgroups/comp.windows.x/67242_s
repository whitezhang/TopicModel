 does anyone know the difference between moolit and olit?  does sun
 support moolit?  is moolit available on sparcstations?
 
 i have recntly downloaded a copy of wkshtree written by eric wallengren
 of univel.  there are many widgets that are apparently available only
 to moolit but not olit.
 
 is there a wkshtree program available under olit?
