 
 hi, 
 
 has anybody implements an rpc server in the hp xwindows? in sun xview, there
 is a notify_enable_rpc_svc() call that automatically executes the rpc processes
 when it detects an incoming request. i wonder if there is a similar function in
 hp x/motif that perform the same function.
 
 any help is appreciated.
