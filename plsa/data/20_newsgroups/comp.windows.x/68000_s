 may i humbly suggest desqview/x? (of course, i'm biased...)
 
 desqview/x is a multitasker for dos computers, that uses a standard
 x11r4 server as it's display mechanism. dos applications and microsoft
 windows standard mode are converted on-the-fly to x-protocol, allowing
 you to display them, or any r4 compatable x-program from any machine
 on the net to display to the pc's local display (or to any other display
 on the net).
 
 free tools are available for devloping x-applications for the dvx platform;
 many x-programs have been ported between dvx and unix with little or
 no modifications. (often, you only need to create a new makefile!)
 
 if you're interested in more details, you can check out the usenet group
 comp.os.msdos.desqview, or just email me directly at support@qdeck.com,
 and i'd be happy to fill you in.
