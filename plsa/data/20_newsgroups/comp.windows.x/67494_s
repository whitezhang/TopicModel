 greetings.
 
 i am developing an application that allows a *user* to interactively
 create/edit/view a visual "model" (i.e. topology) of their network, and
 i was wondering if anyone knew of any builder tools that exist to
 simplify this task.
 
 in the past i have used visual edge's uim/x product to develop other
 guis, so i am familiar with uimss in general.
 
 the topology will support objects and connecting links.  once the
 topology is created, i want to provide the user with capabilities to
 support grouping, zooming, etc.
 
 i am looking for some form of a higher abstraction other than x drawing
 routines to accomplish this.  specifically, the zooming and grouping
 aspects may prove difficult, and certainly time consuming,  if i have
 to "roll my own".
 
 suggestions?
