 
 i want to do the equivalent of an "xwininfo -name" via a call or set of calls
 in xlib.  i need to map a windows name to its id.
 it's probably easy, but i've only been programming in x for a little while.
 i've looked in the o'reilly books and didn't find it and i also checked the
 faq and couldn't find it.
 
 email to one of the following addresses and i'll post a response if it
 seems reasonable to do so.
