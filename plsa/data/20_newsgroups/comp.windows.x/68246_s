 so what? i'm running emu on a 25 mhz 68020 box. i cannot make out any
 difference in performance whether the cursor is set to blinking or
 not (if you think about it a bit, a cycle of 400 ms is a hell a lot of
 time for even the slowest pc). since you would of course only enable
 the blinking text cursor when your xterm has the input focus, this 
 application is active anyway. to repeat it, a blinking text cursor
 costs almost nothing in performance, it just needs some thought when
 designing the xterm software.
