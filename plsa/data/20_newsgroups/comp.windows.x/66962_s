 
 hello, 
 
 	way back in the mists of time, i had a set of patches written
 by richard caley (i believe to the standars distribution, patch level
 6) which added regular expressions in the .tvtwmrc file, multiple icon
 regions, squeezable icons, and f.deleteordestroy function. i still
 have the patches, however, i can no longer find the sources to which
 they applied ;-). 
 
 	i'd appreciate if some kind soul could send me a pointer to
 where i could find the sources. has anyone updated the patches for r5?
 (richard? are you out there? pretty please?)
 
 	thanks in advance.
