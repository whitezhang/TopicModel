 i have written a server program which makes socket connections to many nodes
 and collects data from that nodes periodically. i need to display this data on
 my x application. i tried
 to invoke this server using xtaddapptimeout which works ok. but the
 problem here is some time there is delay in collecting data. so i doesn't
 returns to eventloop during that time and my application remains busy and
 it doesn't respond to users input. i button press events are queued and
 exected after server finished its task. now i am going to try appaddinput
 call. so that it reads pipe only when there is something to read in pipe.
 
 i am thinking of creating one pipe in which server will write and client
 which is my x application will read. now i have some doubts which you may
 be able to clarify.
 
 1) when i fork a process. it will create to copy of my process. right !!
    now what does this two copies mean? two shells. where should i fork
    my application. what are the responsibilities of this processes. how
    should i call this processes.?
 
 2) can i fork more than one processes. so that i can read from more
    than one servers input.
 
 thanks
