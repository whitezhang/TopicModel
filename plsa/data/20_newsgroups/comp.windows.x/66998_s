 another company, congruent corporation of new york city, has also ported xlib
 xt and motif 1.1 over to ms windows nt, which provides full client development
 for x applications in an nt environment.
 
 if you are porting interviews over to ms windows, i thought interviews was
 a c++ toolkit with c++ classes. if that is so, how can it be built on xlib,
 unless the classes are calling xlib functions?
