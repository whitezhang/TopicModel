 you are stuck in a distributed system feedback loop!  what if you are on an
 xterminal or running xterm over the net to another machine?  that is when the
 load problems occur.  if you had a machine with 20 xterminals attached and
 they all had blinking cursors in xterm's, this could represent a considerable
 ethernet bandwidth waste.
 
 i'm not picking on you, just people keep forgetting that there is a lot of life
 out there besides distributed or singleuser "workstations"!
