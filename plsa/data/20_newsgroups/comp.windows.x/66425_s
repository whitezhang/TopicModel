 there is no event mask for a particular mouse button press. however in your
 event handler you can use the event structure passed in and query it to find
 which button was pressed i.e.
 
 void
 someeventhandler(widget w, xtpointer data, xevent *event)
 {
     /* catch the button 1 (usually left button) */
     if ( event->xbutton.button == button1 ) {
         /* do some action */
     } else {
         /* do nothing and exit from function */
     } 
 }
