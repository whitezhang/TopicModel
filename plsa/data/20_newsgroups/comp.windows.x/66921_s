 hi.
 
 i use emacs and i want to customize my keyboard better.
 when i set up stuff in my .emacs with a keymap and define-keys,
 i can only access certain of the keys on my x-terminal's
 keyboard. i can't get e.g. f10, home, end, pgup, pgdn; they all
 seem to have either the same or no keycode. i have a feeling
 this can't be fixed in emacs itself, but that i need to do some
 xmodmap stuff. can someone help me?
 
 by the way, i've checked the x-faq and posted a similar message
 to gnu.emacs.help to no response.
 
 currently i have the following in my .emacs file (inside a 'cond'):
 
  ((string-match "^xterm" (getenv "term"))
 ;; done by aj 8/92. i don't know what most of this does...
    (defvar xterm-map (make-sparse-keymap) "keymap for xterm special keys")
    (define-key esc-map "[" 'xterm-prefix)
    (fset 'xterm-prefix xterm-map)
   ;;keys f1 to f12
    (define-key xterm-map "224z" 'goto-line)        ;f1
    (define-key xterm-map "225z" 'what-line)        ;f2
    (define-key xterm-map "226z" 'rmail)            ;f3
    (define-key xterm-map "227z" 'replace-string)   ;f4
    (define-key xterm-map "228z" 'end-of-line)      ;f5
    (define-key xterm-map "229z" 'kill-line)        ;f6
    (define-key xterm-map "230z" 'yank)             ;f7
    (define-key xterm-map "231z" 'beginning-of-line);f8
    (define-key xterm-map "232z" 'end-of-line)      ;f9
    (define-key xterm-map "192z" 'scroll-down)      ;f11
    (define-key xterm-map "193z" 'scroll-up)        ;f12
  ;;keys f10, up, down, etc. ??????? can't get the keys 
    (define-key xterm-map "-1z" 'set-mark-command))
 )
