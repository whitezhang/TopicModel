 hmmm.... clearly?  depends on your programming model.  it is not at all
 forbidden to draw outside the context of an expose event.  certainly any
 internal data structures should be maintained such that the visual
 appearance would be maintained properly whenever an expose event happens
 to be generated.  this doesn't preclude drawing immediately after
 updating the datastructures though...
