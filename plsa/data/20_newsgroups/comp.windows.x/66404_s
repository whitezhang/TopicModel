 i have looked through the faq sections and have not
 seen a answer for this.
 
 i have an x/motif application that i have written.
 i have a couple of gif files (or pict) that i have
 scanned in with a color scanner.  now i would like
 to be able to convert the gif files into a format
 that could be read into my application and displayed
 on the background of its main window. preferably with
 pixmaps, or perhaps as an ximage.
 
 i have found functions in the pbmplus program suite
 to convert gif to xbm, but that is monochrome, and
 i really do need color.
 
 i have looked at xv, which reads in gif, and writes
 out several formats, but have not found a way to write
 out a file which can be read in as a pixmap.
 
 is there an easy way to do this?
 
 email responses preferred.
 
 thanks!
