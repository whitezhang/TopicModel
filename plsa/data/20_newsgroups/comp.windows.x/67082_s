 what it has to do with your original question is this: many times 
 beginning x users (heck, experienced x users too!) write small test
 programs.  many times they forget to draw only in response to expose
 events, and thus see unpreditable results whereby sometimes the application's
 graphics show up, and sometimes they don't.  we're just trying to
 eliminate all the "easy" explanations  for why you're not seeing your
 graphics. 
 
 that being said, why don't you try copying different planes to your
 window other than 16 (== 1 << 4).  try 1, 1<<1, 1<<2, ..., 1<<7
 to see it you get any output.  since you're dipslaying only a single 
 plane of your data, it's possible that all the pixel values in your
 pixmap have the same value for that color plane.
