 help: i am running some sample problems from o'reilly volume 4,
 xt intrisics programming manual, chapter 3. popup
 dialog boxes and so on.
 
 in example 3.5, page 76 : "creating a pop-up dialog box"
 
 the application creates window with a button "quit" and "press me".
 the button "press me" pops up a dialog box. the strange feature of
 this program is that it always pops up the dialog box much faster the
 first time. if i try to pop it up a 2nd time (3rd, 4th .... time), 
 it is *much* slower.
 
 has anyone any experience with these sample programs, or why i get
 this behaviour - fast response time for the first time but slow response
 time from 2nd time onwards ?
 anyone can give me some ideas on how to program popups so that each time
 they popup in reasonable fast response time ?
 
 thankyou - shirley
