 i don't know any way except to see what modifiers are on in th
 keypress event.  of course if there is some reason why you need to
 always know the state of modifiers even if your windows don't have the
 keyborads focus you can always ask for keypress events from the root
 window.  then you get all the keypresses and you always know what have
 been pressed.

 i think this is just a question of how to implement xlookupstring.
 you can always write another function that interprets the keypresses
 as you like.  you can look at the implementation of xlookupstring from
 the xlib sources and then modify it a little bit.
