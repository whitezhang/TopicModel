 
 i'm running xterm under x11r5, motif 1.1, mwm and unix svr4 on a unisys
 386 based machine. my default shell is /bin/csh or the c shell. whenever
 i run xterm, i get the following message before the first c shell prompt:
 
 warning: no access to tty; thus no job control in this shell...
 
 after this, i can't run any job control commands like fg, bg etc. also,
 i can't run another xterm from the command line of this xterm (i can only
 launch additional xterms from a .mwmrc menu).
 
 i'd appreciate some help with this problem, or pointers to where i can get
 some help. by the way, my environment variable term is set to xterm.
