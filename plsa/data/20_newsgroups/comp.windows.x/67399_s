 judging from the responses so far, i have not made clear enough in my
 article quoted above that imake-tex is not for installing tex, but for
 *using* it. with imake-tex, you will never again have to fiddle around with
 calling latex and its various utility programs (makeindex, bibtex). simply
 type "make" and your document's dvi file will be up-to-date. all you have
 to do is to write a simple imakefile and let imake generate a suitable
 makefile for you. here is such an imakefile:
 
 	#include "tex.tmpl"
 	paperformata4()
 	simplelatextarget(document)
 
 the generated makefile provides the following commands:
 
     make depend:    searching the tex source files for dependencies like
                     \input{somefile}
 
     make dvi:       generate an up-to-date dvi file
 
     make viewdvi:   display it on your screen
 
     make ps:        generate a postscript version of your document
 
     make viewps:    display it
 
     make clean:     remove unnecessary things
 
     make veryclean: remove even the dvi file
 
     make makefiles: generate makefiles in subdirectories
 
 
 if ...
 
 a) ...this seems attractive to you,
 b) ...you are willing to test imake-tex and send me a short test report,
 c) ...you are willing to cope with a rudimentary english documentation
    (however, the german version is completed and included),
 
 then you are invited as a beta tester. i am looking forward to your e-mail.
