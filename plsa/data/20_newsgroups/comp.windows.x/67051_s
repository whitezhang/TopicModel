 
 help!
 
 i'm trying to run dxterm's (decs' xterm) on a decstation 5000/240
 (ultrix 4.3, x11r4, motif 1.1.3) with the display variable set to an
 apollo dn2500 (domain/os 10.3, x11r4, motif ?.?).
 
 i get these errors appearing on the decstation:
 
 > dxterm
 x toolkit warning: cannot convert string "<key>apchardel        " to type virtualbinding
 x toolkit warning: cannot convert string "<key>apcopy   " to type virtualbinding
 x toolkit warning: cannot convert string "<key>apcut    " to type virtualbinding
 x toolkit warning: cannot convert string "<key>appaste  " to type virtualbinding
 x toolkit warning: cannot convert string "<key>apupbox  " to type virtualbinding
 x toolkit warning: cannot convert string "<key>apdownbox        " to type virtualbinding
 x toolkit warning: cannot convert string "<key>aprightbar       " to type virtualbinding
 x toolkit warning: cannot convert string "<key>apleftbar        " to type virtualbinding
 segmentation fault

 any ideas? is it a motif problem...are the dec and apollo versions of motif
 incompatible? or something to do with xkeysymdb?
 
 (xterms run fine on dec displaying on apollo..arggh)
 
 i need to run dxterm because the package we are using on the dec's, oracle case,
 uses dxterm by default, and we have a lab of apollo workstations we would like
 to run oracle from.
