 if it's any consolation, i have two 2-headed sun-3/60 systems, though the
 color and mono monitors for each are "rated" 1152x900.   their configuration
 is the same as yours, so it "should" be a plug'n'play situation, except:
 
 i don't know if your hi-res mono monitor will function this way.  however,
 you may simply be able to pull the motherboard and set the hi-res jumper
 (located in the same jumper array as the jumpers for the ram/simm selects
 and ethernet connection) and be happily on your way.  when you pull the
 motherboard, the jumpers are in the left-rear (e.g. "north-west") quadrant
 of the motherboard (to the left of the simm sockets).
