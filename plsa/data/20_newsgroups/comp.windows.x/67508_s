 
 greetings,
   i need some help with the detail of geometry specification.  i have a
 program that uses xlib to create a simple window.  i tried to hard code
 the x,y location in xcreatewindow but it didn't work.  i also tried
 xsetstandardproperties, xsetwmhints with no luck.  could somebody
 enlighten me on this subject.
 
 hans.
