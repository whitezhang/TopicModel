 hi !
 
 i am using xview 3.0 on a sparc ipx under openwindows along with a xvideo board
 from parallax which enables me to use 24 bit color. i am having some problems
 utilizing the 24 bit color and would greatly appreciate any help in this matter.
 
 i use xview to create a frame and then create a canvas pane inside which i use
 to display live video. my video input is 24 bit color.
 
 the problem is that my top level frame created as
 	frame = (frame) xv_create(null,frame,null);
 seems to have a depth of 8 which is propagated to my canvas.
 
 i would like to know how i can set the depth of the frame to be 24 bits.
 i tried using the following xlib code :
 
 xvisualinfo visual_info;
 int depth = 24;
 colormap colormap;
 xsetwindowattributes attribs;
 unsigned long valuemask = 0;
 window *win;
 xv_opaque frame;
 
 win = xv_get(frame,xv_xid);
 xmatchvisualinfo(display,screen,depth,truecolor,&visual_info);
 
 /* so far so good */
 
 colormap = xcreatecolormap(display,win,visual_info,allocnone);
 
 /* it dies here with a badmatch error :( */
 
 attribs.colormap = colormap;
 valuemask |= cwcolormap;
 xchangewindowattributes(display,w,valuemask,&attribs);
 xsetwindowcolormap(display,win,colormap);
 
 
 am i using a completely wrong approach here ? is it possible to set the depth
 and colormap for a window created by xview ? what am i doing wrong ?
 
 thanks in advance for any help that i can get. i would prefer a response via
 email although a post on the newsgroup is also okay.
 
 thanks again,
 
 
 alok.
