 
 we have a program written with x11r5 and motif 1.2.1.  it runs fine on the sun
 x11r5 server and macx.  when that program is run under the sparc 2 and the
 ow server, the program crashed itself along with the server.  it crashed before
 the first window had showed up.
 
 i got the following error from x.
 xio:  fatal io error 32 (broken pipe) on x server "perot:0.0"
       after 62 requests (59 known processed) with 0 events remaining.
       the connection was probably broken by a server shutdown or killclient.
 
 i have run the program with xmon and below is the last twenty lines or so from
 xmon before both the program and server crashed.
