  
   
 this is a repost... i like to find out more about this also...
 
 *** message part 2: text ****************************************
 the cose announcement specifies that motif will become the common
 gui. but what does this mean exactly?
  
 - do they mean that all "cose-complient" apps will have the motif
   look and feel?
  
 - do they mean that all "cose-complient" apps will use the motif
   toolkit api?
  
 - do they mean both of the above?
  
 - is it possible that there will be a motif-api complient toolkit with
   an openlook look & feel?
  
 - how about an olit/xview/oi/interviews api toolkit with a motif l & f?
   (i know oi already does this, but will this be considered cose-complient?)
  
 - will there be more than one "standard" toolkit api or l & f supported?
  
 - how does using tooltalk fit in with motif?
  
 this is my attempt to start a discussion in order to pull as much
 knowledge about these questions off the net... feel free to e-mail
 or followup.
