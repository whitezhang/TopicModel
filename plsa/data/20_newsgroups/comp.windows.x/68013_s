 
 i've written an application for sparcstation 2 gx+, under openwindows 3.0.
 
 the application uses xview stuff to create my window, and the sun xgl
 graphics library for rendering into the canvas.
 
 the application does real-time 2-d animation, but it does not update the
 the display fast enough.
 i'm using notify_set_itimer (xview call) to periodically kick off my
 update routine, and it's not happening fast enough. i want it to
 update 25 times / second. it's only doing about 11. also, it appears to
 be compute bound, because if i run anything else while my appplication is
 up, the update rate slows down even more.
 
 any ideas ?
 thanks.
