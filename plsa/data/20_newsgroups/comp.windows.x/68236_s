 we have suns running sunos 4.1.3 and openwindows 3.0 (x11r4). we have
 used xvision on a pc, setup to broadcast query to the unix xdm servers and
 allow a user to choose a unix client in which to login: xdm will then
 manage that display. i would like to do the same thing with xfree86
 running under linux, but i don't know how. i don't want to hardwire the unix
 xdm to manage the pc displays as the pc's are not always running linux 
 (let alone xfree86). i would like the same setup as provided by xvision.
 
 can anybody help?
 thanks,
