 how can i get the font family, weight and slant from an
 instance of a widget? using initfontcontext(), getnextfont()
 and freefontcontext() i can get the size of the font (and a
 bunch of other stuff concerning the font) but nowhere have
 i found family, weight and slant. assume that i do not have
 access to the source where family, weight and slant were
 orginaly used when creating a fontlist.
 thanks a bunch and have a great day,
 carl
