 i am writing a custom widget to support the display of graphics
 and imagery.  the user of the widget will be able to specify,
 when creating it, whether it is to operate in x or gl mode.
 
 i have set up translations and actions to handle mouse button
 presses.  they work fine when the widget is in x mode.  in gl 
 mode they only work when the widget (my gl/x widget) is a child
 of a manager.  put another way, the translations do not work 
 when the widget is configured in gl mode and is a child of a 
 shell.  does anyone know why this is happening?
 
 thanks in advance.
