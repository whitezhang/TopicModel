 
 x/motif gurus,
 
 	how do you handling scaling of x text while performing zooming 
 operations  on figures? is restricting user to select scalable fonts too 
 restrictive and  a absolute no no?
 any books that have discussion on this topic?  should have really taken more 
 of those computer graphics courses but, now its too late -:( )
 
 	i will summarize response.
 thanks in advance.
