 this all sounds suspiciously like my company might have something to
 do with this.
 
 background first: megatek has a series of framebuffers designed as
 x accelerators. for the most part these are designed for sun sbus
 and sun (and other vendor's) vme systems.
 
 that said, megatek products support multi-screen and/or multi-display
 on a sigle workstation. most of our cards have a keyboard/mouse port
 which can be used to provide additional displays. for example, say
 you hade a sparcstation with an sbus expansion chassis. you could
 put in six frambuffers, allowing a total of six screens in the system.
 you could then attach from 1 to 6 keyboard/mice, allowing you to
 mix and match any combination of screens and displays. you could
 have 1 6-screen display, 3 2-screen displays, 6 1-screen displays,
 or 1 2-screen display and 1 4-screen display. basically any
 combination.
 
 because of this, we at megatek try to be very careful about the use
 of the words multi-screen and multi-display. they are quite different
 in meaning, and (at least in x) have exact definitions.
 
 the reason i ramble like this is the mention of an upper limit if 12
 screens in a display. as it so happens, there's a define in the server
 that determines the most screens supported (server/include/misc.h,
 maxscreens). as released my mit, this is 3. as released by megatek,
 this is 12.
 
 as such, the most screens supported by a single megatek display (i.e.
 x server) is 12. if someone construed this to be a limitation of x
 i'm sorry, but clearly (as pointed out so well by mr. neto) this is
 not the case.
 
 we just did it here because nobody has ever asked us for more. of
 course, i could say "buy all you want, we'll support more."
