 i always use the following in my .[t]cshrc:
 
 ...
 f ( $?login == 0 ) then
    source $home/.login
 endif
 ...
 
 and in .login:
 
 ...
 setenv login 1
 ...
 
 so i don't need to set all environment variables in my .cshrc, but they get
 set if i login via xdm or xon | xrsh | rx and so on.
 
 hope this helps,
