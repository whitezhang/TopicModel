 
 is there an easy (ie via shell commands) way to tell what the display 
 environment variable is for any given client process?  sometimes i can 
 get what i want by typing ps -axe if:
    a. the client was invoked with a -display argument
       or
    b. display is one of the first few variables defined in the environment
       (actually i've never seen b. but it's there to illustrate the type 
       of thing i'm looking for)
 
 ultimately i wish to determine the number of displays that are simultaneously 
 running a given x application.
 
 my system: sunos 4.1.2 sun4c
 
 thanks for any help,
