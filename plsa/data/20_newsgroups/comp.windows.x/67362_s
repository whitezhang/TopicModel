 i am in the process of modifying an x application that uses xlib.  i'd
 like to include a timer-driven facility (for network polling), but cannot
 see how to do it using xlib.  i know it can be done with xaw, using
 xtappaddtimeout and xttimercallbackproc.  how do i do the same using
 xlib?
 
 thanks for any help.  please email.
