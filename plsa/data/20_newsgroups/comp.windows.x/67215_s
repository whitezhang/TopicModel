 hi netland,
 
 i thought that i once read about the existance of a virtual mwm like vtwm.
 on the usual ftp sites (gatakeeper.dec.com, export.lcs.mit.edu) i can't find
 any trace of this program. could anybody give me a hint where to find this
 program or confirm/deny the existance of this program.
 
 regards,
 
   stefan
