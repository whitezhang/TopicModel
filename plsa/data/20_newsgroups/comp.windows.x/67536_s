 we are adding a motif wrapper to a family of data display programs.
 
 these programs are each written as a 'main loop' with these steps:
 - use semop to check a semaphore and if true access new data
   otherwise block (new data comes quite often)
 - use msgop to check for messages and if true read them
   otherwise continue (messages are user commands and not often)
 - update the display according to latest data and messages.
 
 we typically have several of these running in windows,
 plus a data producer serving some device and setting the flag.
 everyone blocking makes sure the device server gets to run.
 
 xt and xm also have a 'main loop' model that we must fit into.
 o'reilly vol iv ch 9 discusses adding a file-watcher and also
 how to add workprocs that are run during idle time.
 
 we can 'open-up' our existing main loop and call it as a workproc.
 the problem is our blocking until new data is no longer appropriate.
 neither is letting the program free-run because others are hurt.
 
 the unix select call lets you block until any of several i/o are ready.
 we want that for the x main loop except not file i/o.
 any suggestions or examples most welcome!
 
 we run sgi personal iris and indigo systems.
