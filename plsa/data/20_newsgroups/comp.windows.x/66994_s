 in plain motify using a dialog 'in-line' like this simply isn't done. you need
 to set callbacks from the buttons/widgets in your dialog and let the callback routines
 do the work. in the callbacks you can then carry on the flow of logic. 
 
 xview from sun actually supports this very neatly with a 'notify' box, which can
 return a status in-line, it does actualy ease coding but goes against the event
 driven style of an application.
 
 summary: redesign required.
