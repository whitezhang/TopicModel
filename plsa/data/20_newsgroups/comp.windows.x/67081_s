 environment:
 	x11r4
 	motif 1.1.4
 	sun ipc 4.1.3
 
 problem:
 	when mouse is moved across screen horizontally, the sprite goes off
 	of the edge of the screen and reappears at the *other* edge.
 	it appears that the server thinks we are running in multi-screen
 	mode; the cursor seems to "wrap" from one side of the screen to
 	the other.
 	as far as we can tell, we are not running the server in multi-screen
 	mode.
 
 please reply via e-mail.
