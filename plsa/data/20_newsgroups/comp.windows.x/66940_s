 begging everyone's pardon, i was not slamming motif, nor was i necessarily 
 plugging/flaming the two.  i was responding to the sweet blithe statement in:
  <rick.734610425@digibd> from rick@digibd.digibd.com (rick richardson)

 this happy statement shows a mindset that inventors and companies have when
 they are pleased with something that works, and they believe that others will
 also be happy to use it.  i remember when _sunview_ was hot stuff (and am not,
 by that statement, endorsing sun and its products, this is just my experience),
 and when openwindows became hot stuff, that was when i started hearing, as
 mentioned before, the "socialistic masses" that were bent on destroying 
 _anything_ that was deemed proprietary, including openwindows.  i mentioned
 motif in the same breath, because that is what sun has decided to turn its
 attention to, not because i hate it.  mr. richardson's position, i believe, is
 a healthy one, and i am sure that the seething hackers will soon try to
 flame and destroy nt, if it ever shows up, wanting instead everything to be
 free, and then complaining when there is no organized structure and there are 
 no de facto standards.
 
 it was just a vent for frustration brought on by prevailing winds.
