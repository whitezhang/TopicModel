   hello, i hope this is the right group to post this in.
   i've got a little problem.  i finally managed to get a real operating
 system (linux, as opposed to ms-dos) and i like it alot.  but, when i
 try to run 'startx', i get a strange response: my monitor goes into
 graphics mode and i get this big white rectangle on the screen - that's
 all! nothing else!  now, i've collected almost every faq in the world to
 help me but either it's too confusing or i must be missing something.
   my setup:
 	386dx (about 20mhz)
 	trident 8900c svga (w/1 meg)
 	4 mb ram
 	plenty of hd space
 any help is appreciated.
 thanx.
