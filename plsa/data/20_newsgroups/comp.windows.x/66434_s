 try the 'm.sc. computing science' course at the real newcastle university.
 it's a conversion course, but at least they teach real programming.
 
 in the space of 9 months we were taught pascal, simula, prolog, miranda.
 also, some basic low level stuff (68000) was covered as well.
 
 they also did concurrent programming and operating systems, some software
 engineering, plus quite a few optional units, including database theory,
 and some stuff about comms.   
 
 the pascal is to be replaced by c/c++ i think next year - i learn't this (and 
 x windows programming as well)
 anyway via a good selection of project over the final three months - depending
 on your tastes, the selection of skills learn't can be quite wide reaching.
 
 the one critiscism i would level at the course, which i would have thought
 invaluable, is the lack of an option to do the project period in industry -
 this would probably need a slightly longer project period (say six months), but
 would enhance the prestige and usefulness of an already excellent and thorough
 course.
 
 yes, i know this sounds like a plug for the course, why not!
