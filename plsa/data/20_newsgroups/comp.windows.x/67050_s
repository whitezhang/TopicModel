 
  we've developed a number of applications using devguide and found it to 
 be a very useful tool. i've been impressed with the level of integration it
 affords using the connection editor. i love the general ease of use.
  
  i talked with tali aben at sun today about devguide + motif. she was very
 helpful. we provided some input as to what we'd like to see in the next
 version of devguide. tali was very enthusiatic about our comments. i mentioned
 i was going to post this email message and she offered to receive additional
 comments from the net on what devguide should evolve into. 
  
  send your comments/wish-list, raving, et. al. about devguide to:

  pretty cool example of a company that cares what we want.... more of this
 and computers may have a future.
 
  frankly, i like the idea that it will offer some migration capability
 to doe/domf through an integrated tooltalk capability, pointed out in march's 
 sunexpert magazine. 
 
  technology works, we can crankout the interfaces with devguide. price is 
 outstanding.
