 i'm a solaris 2.1 user with a classic workstation.
 
 i have compiled xfig 2.1.7 version with -dopenwin flag to use it with 
 openwindows, but when i run it, the program runs and runs and runs (15 minutes)
 and never is ready to work with it. the labels are not completed and i can't
 push any button.
 
 i have no problem if i does not run the openwindows but x.
 
 any solution?
 
 thanks in advance and excuse for my english.
