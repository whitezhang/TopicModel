 i posted this a while ago and didn't recieve one reply, and now we
 have another bug report on the same subject. can anybody help me out?
 
 how can you ensure that accelerators work the same independent of
 case?  what i want is ctrl+o and ctrl+o to both be accelerators on one
 menu entry.
 
 in ora vol. 6, in the section on accelerators it says "for information
 on how to specify translation tables see vol. 4...", this is so you
 know what to put for the xmnaccelerator resource.  if you go to
 vol. 4 it says, "likewise, if a modifier is specified, there is
 nothing to prohibit other modifiers from being present as well. for
 example, the translation:
 
 	shift<key>q:	quit()
 
 will take effect even if the ctrl key is held down at the same time as
 the shift key (and the q key).
 
 this implies to me that setting xmnaccelerator to ctrl<key>o should do
 what i want, but it doesn't, it doesn't work if the user presses the
 control key, the shift key, and the o key.
 
 is it possible to supply > 1 accelerator for a menu entry? keep in
 mind when answering this question that when using motif you can't use
 xtinstallaccelerators().
 
 i am using motif 1.1.3 on a decstation 5000 but i have also tried it
 on an hp using motif 1.1.3 and 1.2.
