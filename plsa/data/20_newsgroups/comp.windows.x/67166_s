 i just implemented this and it seems i can just about achieve the display
 rates (20 400x400x8 frames / sec on ipx) that i get with sunview, though
 it's a bit "choppy" at times. also, loading the data, making an ximage,
 then xput'ing it into a pixmap is a bit cumbersome, so the animation is
 slower to load than with sunview. is there a better way to load in the
 data?

 shared memory putimage (also mentioned by nkissebe@delphi.beckman.uiuc.edu,
 nick kisseberth) looks interesting, but i need someone to point me to some
 documentation. is this method likely to give better results than server-
 resident pixmaps? i'd also be interested in looking at the xview code
 mentioned above...
 
 thanks for the help so far. if i get something decent put together, i'll
 definitely post it to the net.
