 we've been using it for a year on unix (sun and hp) and windows platforms.  in my
 opinion, it is the best toolkit on the market.  it supports a rich api to a high
 level ipc mechanism, file system abstraction, memory management, command driven
 application development, drawing, geometry management, and, oh yeah, open look,
 motif, ms-windows and mac (at the flip of a switch).
