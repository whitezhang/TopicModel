 i have the march/april version of the x journal open in front of me.
 
 i'll be working on programming x-clients this summer, and since i don't have
 much experience with programming x, i thought this issue might be helpful
 as it has a section on debugging, and a section on the 40 most common errors
 in programming x.
 
 at the end of the errors section, there are the following references for
 tutorials on x programming style.  they are:
 
 rosenthal, david -   a simple x11 client program
   proceedings of the winter 1988 usenix conference, 1988.
 
 lemke, d., and rosenthal, d. -  visualizing x11 clients
   proceedings of the winter 1989 usenix conference, 1989.
 
 
 does anyone know where i could find these in printed or (preferably)
 electronic form?
 
 or can you suggest any net resources devoted to the introduction to
 programming x (i'll be looking at the bookstore for books, so i am really
 only asking about what i can find on the net.)
 
 thanks,
 
 david simpson
