 
         i am looking for info on products that can take
 windows source on a unix box (such as sparc), and produce a
 motif executable.  another requirement is that mfc 2.0 should
 be supported.  i already know of:
 
         wind/u  by bristol technologies
         hunter sdk
         mainwin by mainsoft
 
         are there any others?
 
 	i will post a summary if it's wanted.
