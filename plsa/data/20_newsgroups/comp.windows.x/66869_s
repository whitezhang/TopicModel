 hello,
 
    when starting bx if you recieve an error message saying
 "cannot load app-defaults file..." check your xapplresdir
 environment variable and then put the file builderxcessory 
 ( this is the app-defaults file for bx ) in the directory
 specified by the xuserfilesearchpath environment variable.
 
    if you don't have an xuserfilesearchpath environment variable
 then set xuserfilesearchpath to be the directory where the
 builderxcessory file is. you can do this using the setenv
 command under csh. note that the name ends in .ad so you will
 have to set xuserfilesearchpath to {bx}/%n.ad to get the
 app-defaults to load correctly.
 
    to make sure the the app-defaults file can be read by all
 the users, make sure that a copy of or a link to the app-defaults
 file exists in /usr/lib/x11/app-defaults or 
 /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults, depending on how your system is
 set up.
 
    once you have taken care of this set the *systemdirectory
 resource to be the directory in which you have installed bx. 
 for example let's say i've installed bx in /t then my system
 directory resource should be set like this :
 
 *systemdirectory: /t/builderxcessory
 
     thanks,
