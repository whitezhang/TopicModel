 i've been offerred an old 4-bits/pixel greyscale xterminal.  aside from the
 "real people have already upgraded to risc architecture r5 servers", do i want
 this xterminal? 
 
 i'm concerned about the 4-planes...i've only ever heard of 1 (mono) and 8
 (colour) planes -- will i have any concerns with this 4-plane unit? 
 [specifically related to 4-planes vs 1 or 8]
 
 thanks!

 ps: all r5 apps run on r4/r3 servers,right?
