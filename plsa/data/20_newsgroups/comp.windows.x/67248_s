 i ran in to this problem i while ago, and from what i remember you should use
 xttranslatecoordinates etc. after realizing the main widget to calculate
 the location of the popup, then use something like xtvasetvalues on the
 popup widgets before ever using them.  calling setvalues repeatedly (e.g.
 every time something pops up) seems to be what slows you down.  i never
 delved deep enough to figure out exactly why though...
