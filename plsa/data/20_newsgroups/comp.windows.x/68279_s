 	i got a few requests asking for a summary, so i'll attempt one
 here:
 
 
 	here's the ones i know of:
 
 	wind/u		- bristol technologies
 
 	hunter sdk	- hunter systems
 
 	mainwin		- mainsoft
 
 	libwxm          - visual solutions
 
 
 	hunter 
 
 	the company is going through some big changes.  i expect
 to eventually see the hunter sdk pop up with a new name.  at the moment, it
 is difficult to get phone calls returned and otherwise obtain info.
 hopefully they will post something about themselves once things settle down. 
 
 	visual solutions
 
 	libwxm is a product that i just heard about.  they don't
 yet support mdi or mfc.  libwxm was used to port vissim, a mathematical
 modeling package.  does native motif widgets, like wind/u from bristol.
 contact carrie lemieux at 508 392 0100 for more info.  she's very helpful.
 
 	mainsoft
 
 	this translates windows source to a unix executable that
 can switch off between a windows or quasi-motif look and feel at
 runtime.  they skip the xt and xm (motif) x toolkit levels and go
 straight to xlib.  they don't yet support mfc.  they're at 415 896 0708.
 
 	bristol
 
 	this company that seems to be on the right track.  wind/u uses
 xlib/xt/xm to give a *real* motif app.  they seem to be doing the most work
 in trying to support things like dde, common dialogs, and more on the horizon.
 my contact there is knowledgeable, responds to my email, and wrote an example
 program for me showing how to obtain x widgets from windows handles.
 they're at 203 438 6969, or you can email info@bristol.com.
