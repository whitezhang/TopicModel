 
 is it possible to run an mit r5 based xserver on a sun with a rasterops tc
 colorboard (24bit board)?  i have the xsun24 patches for supporting sun's
 24bit frame buffers but does the rasterops appear as if its a cgtwelve or
 something else?  i know nothing about the rasterops other than we might be
 buying one to put in an ipx.
 
 cheers
