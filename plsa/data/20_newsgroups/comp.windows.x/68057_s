 ok, i'm being driven batty.
 
 
 trying to create popup-menus (ie. button3 press, and a menu
 appears).  i would really like to use the standard athena
 classes to achieve this goal, but for my best attempts
 i cannot get the menus to come up without using a menubutton
 as the parent of the widget tree.  i know this should be
 possible to to with an xtpopupspringloaded() and a
 little twiddling, but something is escaping me.
