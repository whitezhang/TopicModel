 xsun won't come up in color w/ this framebuffer! i am trying to use xkernel on
 some of these 4/110s i have a freshly built statically linkes copy of xsun
 that works just fine on cg6, cg4, bw2 type of framebuffers, but on the 4/110
 that have this type of frame buffer all i get is mono.
 
 cgtwo0 at vme24d16 0x400000 vec 0xa8 
 cgtwo0: sun-3 color board, fast read
 
 here is what i've tried.
 
 removing all the other /dev/cg* , /dev/bw , and /dev/fb and then selectivly
 recreating /dev/cgtwo0. xsun comes up mono. recreating /dev/fb, comes up mono,
 
 i've tried xsun & xsun -dev /dev/cgtwo0.
 
 ps xnews will come up in color but it's not statically linked, and the
 dynamically linked xsun comes up in mono also.
 
 pps xsun was compiled on w/ gcc 2.3.3 on a system running 4.1.3 and the 4/110
 is also running 4.1.3.
 
 thanks n advance
