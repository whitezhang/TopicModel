 you have to do the same sorts of things that xt does with its main loop.
 that is, you have to rig up a timer queue, and you have to put a 
 select(2) or poll(2) call in your main loop.  you can obtain the 
 file descriptor of the x display connection using 
     fd = connectionnumber (display);
 
 the functionality of the main loop dispatcher in xt is quite useful.
 the good news is, you can get the source and plagiarize!
