 i am having problems with a  motif application that when run on another machine
 (with different x paths, etc) can't find the xkeysymdb file.   this causes a large
 warning output:
 
 warning: translation table syntax error: unknown keysym name: osfactivate
 warning: ... found while parsing '<key>osfactivate:managerparentactivate()'
 warning: translation table syntax error: unknown keysym name: osfcancel
 warning: ... found while parsing '<key>osfcancel:managerparentcancel()'
 warning: translation table syntax error: unknown keysym name: osfselect
 warning: ... found while parsing '<key>osfselect:managergadgetselect()'
 ...
 ....
 ....
 etc.
 
 as the file is in a different location, but xt seems to only look for it in
 the place where it is on the machine the app was compiled on.  is there any
 way to read the xkeysymdb manually with an x/xt call so that additions to
 the xkeysymdb can be distributed with the application ?  i have used trace(1)
 to find out what was going on, but i need a fix so that these translations in
 the application can be recognised.
