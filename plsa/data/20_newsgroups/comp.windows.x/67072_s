 are we talking about an xterm which would accept the same escape sequences
 as that for vt340 (or colour decterm/dxterm)? i thought that was called
 colxterm (and my testing of it shows some oddities that might be bugs or
 might be my program going wrong).
 
 i'm also unsure of what is meant by "ansi mouse xterm"!
