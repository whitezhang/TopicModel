 as i've said before, there's no reliable way to find out the size of
 the window manager decoration.  if your window has been reparented, you
 can't assume that the window you're parented to is the window that
 holds all of the window manager decoration.  there may be several
 layers of windows.  doing multiple xquerytree's until you get to the
 root will work in most cases, but there's no guarantee that the outside
 decoration window is parented to the root window of the display (tvtwm).
