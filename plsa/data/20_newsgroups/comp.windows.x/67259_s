 if you're on the internet and your site isn't sheltered from external
 tcp/ip traffic, you can use the remote andrew demo to see what the
 andrew toolkit looks like:
 
 remote andrew demo service
 
 this network service allows you to run andrew toolkit applications
 without the overhead of obtaining or compiling the andrew software.  you
 need a host machine on the internet, and you need to be running the x11
 window system.  a simple "finger" command will allow you to experience
 atk applications firsthand.  you'll be able to compose multimedia
 documents, navigate through the interactive andrew tour, and use the
 andrew message system to browse through cmu's three thousand bulletin
 boards and newsgroups.
 
 to use the remote andrew demo service, simply run the following command
 on your machine:
 
     finger help@atk.itc.cmu.edu
 
 the service will give you further instructions.
