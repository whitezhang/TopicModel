 hi there netters,
 
 i require a window to appear at a co-ordinates (0,0) (top left corner) of my
 screen (root window). could some windows guru out there help me on how to
 go about doing this. i write the whole program which creates the window with
 the image it displays - i require the image to appear at the top-left corner
 so that i can grab it for recording on to video, using a minivas controller,
 which expects the window at the same spot every time.
 
 thanks in advance.
 
 sincerely,
 
 sanjeev sharma
