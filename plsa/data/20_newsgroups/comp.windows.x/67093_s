 i have a sun 3/60 that has a mono framebuffer (bwtwo0 ?) built on the
 motherboard.  the same system also has a cgfour (cgfour0 and bwtwo1 ?)
 daughterboard.  i have been using this system with a color monitor having a
 color "front" screen from the cgfour, and a mono "back" screen from the
 bwtwo1, both on the same tube.  i recentley picked up a 1600 x 1280 sun mono
 monitor, and i would like to make a two headed system with the cgfour0 and the
 bwtwo0.  i do not care if i loose the "back" screen on the color tube from the
 bwtwo1.  after looking through the xsun man page i am not sure if this is
 possible.  has anybody sucessfuly done this before?
