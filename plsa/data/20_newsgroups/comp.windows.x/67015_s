 
 
 is there aything available for x similar to quickeys for the macintosh --
 something that will allow me to store and playback sequences of keystrokes,
 menu selections, and mouse actions - directing them towards another
 application?
 
 if so, could someone send me information on its availability -- and if not,
 how hard do we think it might be to send input to other x applications and,
 hopefully, deal with their responses appropriately?  (if an application is
 going to take a few seconds to process i probably have to wait  for it to
 complete before sending another command.)
 
 thanks,
 
 david,
