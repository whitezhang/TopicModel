 x window installation on a sun4/470 with cg6 alone and with cg2 as
 screen:0.0 and cg6 as screen:0.1.
 
 questions:
 1)  are there any hardware configuration changes on the cg2 and/or
 cg6 devices that need to be made other than pulling out and inserting the
 cg2 frame buffer in the vme bus?
 
 2)  the cg6 is called a 'graphics accelerator' as apposed to a 'frame buffer'.
 what is the significance of this to the x server and how do we install
 the sunos driver / x to be compatable.
