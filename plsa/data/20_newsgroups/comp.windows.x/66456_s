 xdm does xgrabserver when it's running in secure mode (so do some
 screen-locks).  there's really no simple way to tell this is the case.
 
 you can take xdm out of secure mode;  probably not too cool.
 
 you can wrap your call to xopendisplay in some code which solicts
 a future sigalrm and longjmps past the xopendisplay from the signal
 handler.  an example of this can be seen in the xdm sources.
 
 note that longjmping out of xopendisplay probably causes a memory
 leak;  any program functioning this way probably needs to exit() 
 regularly.
