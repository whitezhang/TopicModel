 as applied to servers, the first three are fuzzy terms.  "multi-headed"
 tends to be used for any system with multiple monitors, sometimes even
 multiple screens even if they're multiplexed onto the same monitor (eg,
 a sun with a cg4 display).  "multi-screen" and "multi-display" would,
 if taken strictly, mean different things, but since the strict meaning
 of "multi-display" would refer to a system with multiple keyboards and
 pointers, when it's used it probably refers to the same thing
 "multi-screen" would: a system that provides multiple screens.
 
 "zaphod" is a term applied to the way the mit server switches the
 pointer from one screen to another by sliding it off the side of the
 screen.

 there is a protocol limitation that restricts a given display to at
 most 255 screens.  i know of no server that handles multiple displays
 on a single invocation, unless possibly my kludges to the r4 server can
 be looked upon as such; on a tcp-based system there is necessarily a
 limit of 65535 displays per machine, but this is not a limitation
 inherent to x.
 
 what you read was most likely talking about a limit in some particular
 implementation (probably the mit one).  if it claimed there was a limit
 of 12 inherent to x, the author of the article had no business writing
 about x.
