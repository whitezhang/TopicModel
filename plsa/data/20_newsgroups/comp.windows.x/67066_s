 
 i've just managed to get xdm running from an ncr 3000 (an svr4 486 box
 running xfree86 1.2) to my ncd xdisplay.  it's pretty much working, but
 i'm encountering a weird error.  i'm attempting to start an xterm from
 my .xsession file, but nothing happens.  redirecting stderr to a file
 using 'exec 2>$home/.xerrors' in .xsession reveals the error message:
 
   "xterm: error 14, errno 1: not owner"
 
 now, if i start xterm from the window manager, or from the command line,
 it works fine.  and starting other clients, like the window manager (mwm),
 and a clock, from my .xsession also works.
 
 anyone encountered this?  suggestions?
