 (version 3 for sunos 4.1) or xwindows
 running continuously on my machine for 3-4 days,
 the following message appears  when trying to open
 a new window, or to run any program that needs to open windows.
 
 xview error: cannot open connection to window server: :0.0 (server
 package)
 
 i would greatly appreciate any suggestions to solve this problem.
