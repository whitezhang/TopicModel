 
 i have a togglebutton widget (yes widget) and i have a routine
 which changes the color of the foreground and background of the
 label.  well, the background changes alright, but the label
 text does not redraw itself.
 
 i am guessing that i have to force it to redraw with an
 xexposeevent sent to it via xsendevent.  is this the best
 way to get the text up again?  i can't seeem to get
 xsendevent to work right.... if this is a good approach,
 might anyone have an example lying around to show me how to
 do this?  i've rtfm all evening and did not find a decent
 example.
 
 ps i keep getting segmentation faults in xsendevent, tho all
 the values are as expected.
 
 thanks in advance
