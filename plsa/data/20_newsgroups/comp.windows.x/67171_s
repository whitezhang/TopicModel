 hi,
   i am looking for an x app that will display dxf files. these are
   ascii text files that are normally associated with autocad. i have
   a large 9 meg. file of the state of wisconsin that i would like to
   views and or cut into smaller chunks.
 
   i also would like to find a complete file layout for dxf files.
 
   any information would be appreciated.
