   yes, it's possible... in fact, there's some gl widget code in
 /usr/lpp/gl somewhere... (it's named glib.c; my ibm's down right now
 though, so i can't find the exact location :)
 
   warning: this code feels quite bogus. it does things like calling
 noport() before winopen(), and then extracting an x window id from it
 anyway. it worked just fine under aix 3.1; i spent last weekend trying
 to port it to 3.2 (gl under 3.2 doesn't seem to like it), and it's
 turning into a hard job.
 
   check out your "info" pages; it has some pretty good documentation on
 whan you can and can't do when mixing gl and x, and how to go about
 doing so.
