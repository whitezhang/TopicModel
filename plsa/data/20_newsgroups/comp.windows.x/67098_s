 you can't make gl calls in an xmdrawingarea widget for sure.  
 : 
 : there is a widget already defined for gl.  it is the glxmdraw (motif) or
 : glxdraw (athena) widget.  it is similar to a xmdrawingarea, except that it
 : allows you to use gl calls to render into the window.  look at glxlink,
 : glxunlink, glxgetconfig, and glxwinset in the man pages.
 : 
 : 
 : the glxmdraw widget works pretty well.  opengl will be an improvement.
 
 i can vouch for that. the gl widget works pretty well. i have been using it
 for sometime now. i'm not sure though whether you can use xlib calls to draw
 into the gl widget. i haven't tried it yet nor have i read the accompanying
 documentation completely. try posting to comp.sys.sgi for more information.
 better still,you will find most of the answers in the  sgi manuals .. there
 is a little transition guide which explains the "mixed-model programming"
 paradigm(mixing x and gl).
 
 : |> does pex (graphigs?) have the same functionality of gl?
 : 
 : i think gl is a little easier to use and a little more powerful, but
 : that's just an opinion.  mileage may vary.
 
 well, pex is designed as an extension to  x and will be more seamless  but 
 then, it is buggy to start with .. opinions again.
