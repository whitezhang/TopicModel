 no doubt this is an old question, but i didn't find the answer in the
 faqs i could find, so - here goes:
 
 i have a sunview application that i want to convert to x (openlook,
 motiv, whatever). i remember hearing quite some time ago that there
 are tools to accomplish this task.
 
 	a) is that so?
 	b) are they public domain?
 	c) any good, i.e.
 	d) advantages over reimplementing the interface myself?
 
 thanks,
