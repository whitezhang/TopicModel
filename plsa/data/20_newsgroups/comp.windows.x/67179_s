   the mit tapes come with documentation written by keith packard on the shared
   memory extension to x. look in:  mit/doc/extensions/mit-shm.ms
   i found this invaluble. unfortunately, there is a bit of work to set up the
   shared memory segments, making an ximage from it, etc. also, there is an
   extension query to determine if the server supports it, but you still need to
   test if the server is running on the same host and if shared memory is enabled
   in the kernel. i have written layers of convience routines which make all this
   transparent.
   as for the xview code, well, i doubt that would be considered interesting.
   the interesting stuff is done in a c object library. people interested in this
   code can email me.
