 hi,
 
 i am about to write an application in x/motif that will require the
 embedding of a pseudo tty. so, before i re-invent the wheel, has anyone
 written/gotten a motif widget that does the job ? otherwise, i would
 appreciate any pointers to make such a beast.
 
 my environment is x11r4/motif 1.1 and x11r5/motif 1.2 (if this helps).
 
 
 thanks in advance.
