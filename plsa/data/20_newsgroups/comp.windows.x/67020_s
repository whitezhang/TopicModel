 if your expose event handler is truly intelligent about exposed
 rectangle information, then you can use xcleararea to generate an
 expose event (assuming that your background pixel is not none) for the
 enclosing rectangle of your new item.
 
 this is still not great, since any other items contained within that
 rectangle will still be unnecessarily redrawn.
 
 if your expose event handler simply redraws everything, you'll be
 doing much more work than just drawing the new item "on top" of the
 existing scene.
