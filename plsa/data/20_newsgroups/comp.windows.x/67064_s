 
 i recently compiled the x11r5pl22 sources using gcc-2.3.3 on
 a sun3/80. everything seems to work fine. usually. but at
 seemingly random times the server will just hang. i will
 click the mouse somewhere (never happens while my back is turned),
 and without warning, it will freeze there, requiring the server
 to be killed. sometimes it will run fine for weeks, sometimes
 only for minutes.
 
 (os: 4.1.1; frame buffer: bw2).
 
 has anyone seen this before, any ideas? (anything at all?)
 
 thanks,
 	--jeff
