 hi there
 
 (i posted this to comp.windows.x.intrinsics but got no response, so i'm posting
 here.)
 
 i'm wanting to connect a digitiser made for pcs into my workstation (an hp 720).
 it is my understanding the x windows can understand a variety of input devices
 including digitiser tablets.  however, this digitiser makes use of the serial
 port, so there would seem to be a need to have a special device driver.
 
 the hp manual pages say that the hp x server will accept x input from
 devices listed in the /usr/lib/x11/x*devices file (* = display number).
 i shouldn't think i would be able to simply insert /dev/rs232c as an input
 device in this file and expect a digitiser to work.  but maybe i'm wrong.  am i?
 
 what i would like to know is: does anybody out there have a digitiser connected
 to their workstation for use as a pointer for x (rather than just as input to a
 specific x application)?  if so, what were the steps required for installation?
 did you need a special device driver?  did the manufacturer supply it?  are
 there generic public domain device drivers around?  (i understand that
 digitisers generally use only a couple of standard formats.)
 
 any help would be greatly appreciated.
 
 cheers
