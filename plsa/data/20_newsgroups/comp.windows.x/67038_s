 i specifically made the above comment assuming that perhaps the code fragment
 came from a simple "open-draw-quit" client.  
 
 as per your question: why not have the button handler add the object, and
 then call the "window_redraw()" (or whatever) directly?  although, depending
 on how the overall application is structured, there may be no problem with
 rendering the object directly in response to the button press.
