 wasn't the shareware fee a "suggestion" by john?
 is so then it's up to the individual to make the choice whether or not to
 honour it and part with money.  personally if i was in his position i would
 do exactly the same thing, john has obviously put in lot of time and effort
 into xv and why shouldn't he receive some money for it.
 
 just my pennies worth
 
 (keep up the good work john)
