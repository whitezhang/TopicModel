 i've spent the past week tearing my hair out, trying to get the output of
 a piped "tail -f" to end up in a widget.  i've managed to make it work in
 some ugly ways, but either a) x blocks on the tail and won't allow user
 input, b) the "tail -f" functions like just "tail" and doesn't follow the
 expansion of the file, c) the "tail -f" doesn't die after i've closed
 the pipe and destoryed the widget, or d) pclose() blocks forever waiting
 for tail to die.
 	i _know_ this code has to exist.  anybody have it?  a general
 popen() case would be perfered but at this point i'll take anything...
 thanks.
