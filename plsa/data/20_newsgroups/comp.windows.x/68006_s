     i'm trying to build x11r5 mit core distribution on a sparcstation running
 sunos 4.1.1. the only thing i change is the projectroot in site.def. when the
 "make world" process goes to "cc -o xdm ...", i get the following error:
 
 ld: undefined symbol
    __c0095a2a
 *** error code 2
 
 and the process continues to finish. does anybody know what's wrong? thanx for
 any info.
