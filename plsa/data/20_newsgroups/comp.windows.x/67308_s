 hi xperts,
 
 this is a repost (no one responded to my desperate yell 8-(
 i can't believe there is no xview wizards any more 8-)...
 
 i'm using sliders in my xview apps, usually with editable numeric
 field. but i seem to have no control over the length of this field.
 in some apps it appears long enough to keep several characters,
 in some - it cannot keep even the maximum value set by 
 panel_max_value! 
 
 as i understand, panel_value_display_length, which controls
 number of characters to be displayed in text items, doesn't
 work in the case of slider, despite the fact that <panel.h>
 contains the following bit:
 
 	/* panel_multiline_text_item, panel_numeric_text_item,
 	 * panel_slider_item and panel_text_item attributes
 	 */
 	panel_notify_level	= panel_attr(attr_enum,			 152),
 	panel_value_display_length	= panel_attr(attr_int,		 182),
 
 which gives a hint that this attribute can be used for sliders.
 but 1) setting this attribute gives nothing, and 2) xv_get'ting
 this attribute gives warning: bad attribute, and returns value 0.
 
 strange thing is that dec's port of xview gives plenty of space
 in a text fields, but not sun's xview...
 
 can someone share his experience in managing sliders in xview with me,
 and clear this problem? 
 
 any help is very much appreciated.
