 
 
 i am working on a project to provide an emergency management
 information system.  in keeping with more classic command and
 control type systems, we are considering developing a dual screen monitor
 system in order to provide a status board on it's own monitor.  
 i have a number of x level questions regarding this:
 
 (we are devloping on unix systems using x/motif. platform will be 
 predominantly sun's, probably with ports to rs/6000 as well).
 
 i am assuming the standard dual monitor systems are configured
 such that we are talking about one x display and multiple screens,
 and not multiple x displays.   given this:
 
 	- is changing input focus from one screen to the other as simple
 	as tracking your mouse from one screen to the other?  there's
 	nothing special that needs to be done to shift focus between
 	screens?
 
 	- do i have to run separate window managers on the separate
 	screens or are there multiscreen window managers out there?
 	what are they; who sells them...
 
 	- is a multi-screen window manager the only way i can grab a
 	window frame and move a window from one screen to the next?
 
 	- is there any way for the application to transparently see
 	multiple screens as one logical x-y plane, or does the hardware
 	only provide for each screen to start at 0,0?
 
 	- any thoughts on the difficulties involved with designing a
 	system capable of using either multiple screens or a single
 	screen (perhaps running a virtual window manager to simulate
 	multiple screens instead)?  
 	i am assuming that this is not a major issue - that i can rely
 	on providing config files which will specify for each
 	configuration the screen placement of each window in the
 	application.  any thoughts or suggestions from past experience
 	are more than welcome.
