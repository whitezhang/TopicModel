 it seems like xtranslatecoord. doesn't work the way i expecting it.  right
 after performs a xmovewindow, i want to know the absolute window position
 with respect to the root window.  to get this info. i do a xtranslatecoordinates
 but the abs_x, and abs_y aren't right?  does anybody know of a way to find 
 out this information?
 
 thanks, please e-mail to hsteve@carina.unm.edu if it's possible
