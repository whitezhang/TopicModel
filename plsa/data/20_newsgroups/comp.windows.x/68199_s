 
 hi all,
 
 i've heard of a commercial package named zink, that could convert ms-windows
 source-code to xwindows source-code (c). the only problem is, the package
 isn't available in holland (at least, i can't find it anywhere :-( )
 
 is there another package (preferrably free- or shareware), that can do the 
 same thing? and if so, where can i find or buy it?
 
 thanks in advance
