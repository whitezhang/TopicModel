 # i think the original post was searching for existing implementations of
 # f.i. gouroud-shading of triangles. this is fairly complex to do with plain
 # x. simpler shading models are implemented already, f.i. in x3d (ask archie
 # where to get the latest version).
 # for gouroud, a fast implementation will be possible utilizing some extension
 # only, either mit-shm to do the shade in an image and fast update the window
 # with it, or pex/opengl which should be able to shade themselves. the portable
 # 'vanilla x' way would be to shade in a normal ximage and use xputimage(),
 # what would be good enough to do static things as f.i. fractal landscapes
 # or such stuff.
 # 
 # to speak about povray, the x previewer that comes with the original source
 # package is not that good, especially in speed, protocol-friendlyness and
 # icccm compliance. have a look on x256q, my own preview code. it is on
 # 
 # 141.76.1.11:pub/gfx/ray/misc/x256q/
 # 
 # the readme states the points where it is better than xwindow.c from
 # povray 1.0

 the version i have is using the x256q code instead of the default x windows
 code.  i have it currently running on a dec alpha running openvms axp and
 so far have been pretty impressed.  the only "side-effect" of x256q is that
 it requires xstdcmap -best be run before it will work, annoyning but not a
 show stopper.
