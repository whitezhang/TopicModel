 [apologies if i'm answering something already answered in the faq.
 our news feed has been losing a lot of articles lately - so i haven't
 seen the faq lately to check.]
 
 
 two ways:
  
  1) when you start the xterm, you can use command line options:
          -n icon_name           to set the icon label
          -t window_title        to set the window title
          -title window_title    equivalent to -t window_title
 
  2) you can use escape sequences to change things on the fly:
 
     the basic escape sequence is:
 	esc ] <p> ; <some_arbitary_text> bel
 
     where esc and bel are the ascii escape and bell characters,
     <p> is an ascii decimal digit -- '2', '1', or '0', depending
     on whether you are trying to set the window or icon title,
     or both, and <some_arbitary_text> is your desired label string.
 
     hence, this command will set the window & icon title:
          echo "\033]0;your_title_goes_here\007\c" 
 
     to set just the icon title:
          echo "\033]1;your_title_goes_here\007\c" 
 
     to set just the window title:
          echo "\033]2;your_title_goes_here\007\c" 
 
     of course, you may have to fiddle with exact syntax,
     depending on how the echo command works on your system
     and what shell you are using (i've shown system-v semantics
     under bourne or korn shells).
 
     [hint for sun os users:  use /usr/5bin/echo instead of
     /bin/echo or csh's built-in echo.  otherwise you'll have
     to embed literal esc and bel characters in the string
     instead of using convenient octal sequences.]
 
     if you want your titlebar updated continously, say to show
     your current directory, hostname, or somesuch, then you'll
     have to see if you can coerce your shell into spitting out
     the appropriate escape sequences when it prompts for commands.
     sometimes you can just put the appropriate escape sequence
     in the prompt string itself, sometimes not ...
