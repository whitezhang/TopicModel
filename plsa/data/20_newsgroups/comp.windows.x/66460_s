 can anyone recomend a good book or article on inter-client communications
 besides i.c.c.m.?
 
 i've looked everywhere i can and it seems everyone tells you how to do it
 but nobody shows you how.  o'reilly has no examples, iccm has no examples,
 asente & swick give no examples - in fact most of the books i've looked at,
 if they discuss icc at all, simply give a condensed version of the iccm and
 then refer you to the iccm.  i did find one example of how to use atoms and 
 properties in young's book and five hours after i bought young's book i had
 my applications talking to each other.
 
 i am not sure, however, if thats the best way.  i'd like to stay independent 
 of unix so pipes and/or sockets probably aren't the way to go.  but within x
 one can also use messages, the clipboard, and perhaps window groups.
 
 i need a text that discusses the various methods, discusses which method is best
 for which purpose, and gives examples.  without examples it's all just words.
 
 thanks in advance
