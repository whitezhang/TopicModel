 the motif application consists of multiple transient shells as children 
 of a single toplevel shell:
 
 +-----------+   +---------------+   +----------------+
 | appshell  |---| toplevelshell |---| transientshell |
 +-----------+   +---------------+ | +----------------+
                                   |
                                   | +----------------+
                                   |-| transientshell |
                                   | +----------------+
                                   |
 
 while a transient shell is popped-up, my application modifies the 
 sensitivity of a button in the toplevel shell which is hidden by the 
 transient shell window.  when the transient shell is popped-down, the 
 button sensitivity is correct but the button text remains unchanged 
 (i.e., solid/shaded).  subsequent selection of the button causes the 
 text to revert to the correct visual state.
 
 when tracing event messages sent to the application, many of the events 
 seen under mwm are not present under openwindows.
 
 if anyone has any suggestions or solutions please post or send me mail.
   thanks!
