 i have a program produces a continuous tone by calling xbell
 repeatedly at an interval equal to the duration of the bell. if it is
 run more than once on a display, the tones are buffered in the x
 server and the tone contunues after all occurrences of the program
 have exited. is there a convenient way of preventing this, e.g., by
 emptying the x server bell buffer when each program exits?
