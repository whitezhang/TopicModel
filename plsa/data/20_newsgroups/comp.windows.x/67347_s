 [please accept the following announcement for comp.windows.x.announce. -gf]
 
 a completely revamped version of the x11 browser interface to archie,
 xarchie, is now available as
 	export.lcs.mit.edu:/contrib/xarchie-2.0.tar.z
 
 for those not familar with archie or xarchie, i include part of the
 manpage intro:
 
   xarchie is an x11 browser interface to the archie internet information
   system using the prospero virtual filesystem protocol.  archie
   provides information about files available for ftp anywhere on the
   internet; xarchie displays this information using an easy-to-use,
   point-and-click interface.  xarchie allows you to further explore ftp
   sites by examining directories returned as query matches, and allows
   you to retrieve files located this way.
 
 xarchie 2.0 has been extensively tested on r4, r5, and a variety of
 other flavors of x, and on a wide range of machines. a summary of the
 new features (from the readme) follows:
 
   * major improvements include:
     - multiple selections allowed in browser for use with other new
       features (fwf multilist widget).
     - ability to expand directories in browser.
     - real fully-integrated ftp implementation.
     - ability to save and reload query results, as well as print them.
     - ability to resort results, and sort results by user-definable
       pseudo-weights.
     - online help browser.
     - color resources, done so that they don't break mono displays.
     - fwf fileselector widget for local file operations.
     - makefile.dst's supplied for the imake-impaired.
