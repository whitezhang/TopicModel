 are there any graphics texts with examples/demos/projects directly in
 x?
 
 the last time i taught the course, i used a popular graphics text that
 uses its own graphics package, with implementations available for
 x/mac/pc.  the problem was that after the course the students were good
 at programming in the artificial package, but frustrated that they
 couldn't really use their skill for other work.
