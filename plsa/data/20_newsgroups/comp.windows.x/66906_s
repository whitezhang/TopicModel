 
 i posted about this a while ago but without code excerpts noone was
 able to help me.
 
 the problem is that main_win.win is doing fine, but when i create
 detail_win.win, it does not receive it's initial expose events until
 main_win.win receives an event. here are the relevent calls:
 
 main_win.win = xcreatesimplewindow (mydisplay, defaultrootwindow(mydisplay),
                 myhint.x, myhint.y, myhint.width, myhint.height,
                 main_win.line_thick, fg, bg);
 xsetstandardproperties(mydisplay, main_win.win, main_win.text,
                 main_win.text, none, argv, argc, &myhint);
 main_win.gc = xcreategc (mydisplay, main_win.win, 0, 0);
 xmapraised (mydisplay, detail_win.win);
 xmapsubwindows (mydisplay, main_win.win);
 the event mask for main_win is:
         pposition | psize | structurenotifymask | exposuremask| keypressmask |
         enterwindowmask | leavewindowmask;
 the flags are
         pposition | psize
 
 i then create detail_win.win with the following calls (hints has new values):
 detail_win.win = xcreatesimplewindow (mydisplay, defaultrootwindow(mydisplay),
                 myhint.x, myhint.y, myhint.width, myhint.height,
                 detail_win.line_thick, fg, bg);
 xsetstandardproperties(mydisplay, main_win.win, detail_win.text,
                 detail_win.text, none, argv, argc, &myhint);
 detail_win.gc = xcreategc (mydisplay, detail_win.win, 0, 0);
 xmapraised (mydisplay, detail_win.win);
 event mask and flags are identical to main_win's flags and event mask.
  
 if anybody has any idea why the initial expose events of detail_win.win
 are not received until main_win.win receives an event i'd love to hear
 from them. other that that everything works great so there must be some
 detail i'm overseeing.
 
 thanks for any tips

 ps: the same message was accidentally appended to the "expose events"
 thread. sorry for any confusion caused.
