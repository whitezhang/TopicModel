 glad to hear that it's working for you!
 
 i couldn't find it on "export".  however, simon leinen
 <simon@liasun6.epfl.ch> has added an imakefile and an athena
 version, and made it available for ftp in the file
 liasun3.epfl.ch:/pub/x/contrib/xrpc.tar.z.  (note the ".z"
 suffix; you'll need gnu gzip -- also on liasun3 in /pub/gnu --
 to uncompress it.)  
 
 if this doesn't work, send me a note and i'd be happy to mail you
 a copy; but you probably won't get it until the start of may --
 i'm on holidays as of tomorrow! :-)

 p.s. are there any dublin x folks that want to go for a pint of
 guinness at, say, mulligan's...?
