 |even 24bit truecolor machines are in most cases running an emulated
 |8 bit pseudocolor visual, only to get standard x clients, motif apps and
 |thelike to run. i strongly suppose you to emulate at least:
 |
 |> 24 bit truecolor. should be no problem, only some translation. rounding
 |  should not make big misfits
 
 depends on the nature of the "rounding."  x allows the user to do bit
 arithmetic on pixel values, (i.e.,  xor foreground and backgroun pixel
 values together to calculate a foreground color that when used with a
 function of gxxor fill change foreground to background and vice-versa).
 if your rounding does not preserve these types of calculations then 
 clients that use them will break.
