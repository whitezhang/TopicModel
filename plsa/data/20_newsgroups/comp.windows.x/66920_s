 i'm having an x resource problem using brian wilson's wscrawl 2.0
 (a wonderful interactive conferencing program, by the way).  i'm 
 running openwindows 3.0 on a sparc 1+ under os 4.1.3.  i have
 the following defaults in my .xdefaults file (among many others):
   wscrawl.telepointername:	kevin
   wscrawl.syncscrollbars:		true
   wscrawl.continuoustelepointer:	true
   wscrawl.showpointercoordinates:	false
   wscrawl*background:		lightblue
   wscrawl*swindow*foreground:	yellow
   wscrawl*draw_area_frame*foreground:	blue
   wscrawl*keyboardfocuspolicy:	pointer
 
 naturally, i exited the server and restarted it after adding
 those lines to .xdefaults .
 
 if i run the following from a cmdtool (pwd = my home dir.):
   xrdb -m .xdefaults
 and then start up wscrawl, then all those defaults are used
 properly.  wonderful, yes?  except that i can't get them to be
 operative except by *manually* invoking the afore-mentioned
 xrdb command.  if i try:
   xrdb .xdefaults
 the defaults "won't take."
 
 so, i tried to change the xrdb call in my .xinitrc file from:
   xrdb  $home/.xdefaults
 to:
   xrdb -m $home/.xdefaults
 
 no go.  so i tried adding in:
   xrdb -m /home/kbw/.xdefaults
 at the beginning or end of my .openwin-init file.  still no go.
 
 any notions what gives?  thanks for the help.
