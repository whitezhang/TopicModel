 i suspect this is because vue creates a window (probably overrideredirect)
 that is the size of (or larger than) the root window. because the window
 manager does not know about this, you cannot move, resize etc. it. xv in the
 mean time is busy changing your root window to whatever you have requested
 but you never get to see it because vue's window is overlaid on top of the root
 window. 
 
 contact hp support and see whether vue can support coloured bitmap format
 such as xpm, if they cant then they probably create all their coloured
 backdrops inside the code.
