 i am glad and proud to announce the new mailing-list for the pd motif c++
 bindings. i got over 40 replies in about one week of people interested in
 such a list, and the software has now been properly installed, so the list
 is now up and running. for those interested in joining, please send e-mail
 to that extend to 'motif++-request@cv.ruu.nl' or 'rvloon@cv.ruu.nl'.
 
 the blurb everyone who joins gets follows, as well as the original 
 announcement for where motif++ can be obtained.
 
 enjoy!

 welcome to the motif++ mailing list!
 
 the motif++ mailing list is a mailing list dedicated to motif++, the pd c++
 wrapper library for motif, where people can ask questions about motif++, 
 swap stories, and give new ideas about new directions and improvements for the 
 bindings. 
 
 all requests of an administrative nature, like subscription, removal, etc.
 should be directed to motif++-request@cv.ruu.nl
 
 all e-mail sent to motif++@cv.ruu.nl will be sent to the entire list, so
 please make sure when using 'vacation' type programs that will reply to
 messages automatically, that the address for the mailing-list is excluded 
 from auto-replies.
 
 enjoy!

 hello motif world,
 
 over the past half year there have been a lot of relatively minor changes to
 the motif++ bindings. imake support has been improved, a few defaults have
 been changed, and a lot of other small things have been added.
 
 this is basically a release which drops the 'gamma' status. next release will
 incorporate some improvements by stefan schwarz, and possibly will support
 x11r5 and motif 1.2.x.
 
 note to all of those who keep copies of the archive: please retrieve this
 distribution (during off-peak hours), and delete all previous copies.
 
 here is the original announcement:
 
 history
 
 the university of lowell, supported by a grant of the open software foundation,
 has developed a wrapper-library, that encapsulates motif widgets in c++
 classes. all resources of these widgets can now be set through
 member-functions, while objects can be used in callback-functions. the library
 was made available for free or nominal cost for anonymous ftp at 129.63.1.1.
 however, the library contained a large number of bugs and oversights, and only
 worked under x11r3. due to lack of subsequent fundings, the bindings are no
 longer actively supported by the university of lowell.
 
 i, ronald van loon, at a certain point last year, have taken the lowell 
 bindings, fixing the bugs i came across, adding missing memberfunctions, and
 enhancing functionality and made the bug-fixed library available for the
 general public for anonymous ftp (made possible by rick murphy at dec).
 
 new release
 
 i am now pleased to announce a new and updated release of the motif++
 bindings. 
 
 this release offers:
 
 - full motif1.1 and x11r4 support
 - support for xbae widgetset 
 - two additional widgets, written by myself, that can be used to indicate
   progress in an application.
 - imake support. nb: this release relies heavily on the existence of imake
 		     and its config files on your site. i have tried to
 		     provide the bindings with a standard makefile, tweakable
 		     for those unfortunates without imake. i have not severely
 		     tested the standard makefile though. contact me if you
 		     have problems. the reason for calling this a gamma
 		     release lies in the fact that i do not have a multitude
 		     of platforms to test the imake-files on.
 - lots of testfiles (even somewhat useful programs)
 - an article i wrote on the usage of motif, x and c++, previously posted
   on usenet.
 
 where to get the new motif bindings
 
 ftp:
 
 anonymous ftp at decuac.dec.com (192.5.214.1), directory /pub/x11.
 
 note:
 
 please be patient as the network link is quite slow. please do not ftp large
 files during working hours.
 
 also note that there is also a motif++.31.jan.92.tar.z file at this site; this
 is an old version of the bindings.
 
 e-mail:
 
 those who don't have ftp can send me e-mail, and i will send the bindings by
 e-mail.
 
 request
 
 those who use the bindings and find bugs, or see room for improvement, please
 contact me, and i will try to incorporate them in a future release (in case of
 bugs, a bug-fix of course ;-). 
 
 more information 
 
 contact me at "rvloon@cv.ruu.nl".
 if you are desperate, then you can call me at
 +31 30 506711 (that is utrecht, the netherlands; those within the netherlands
 call 030-506711).
 
 enjoy!
