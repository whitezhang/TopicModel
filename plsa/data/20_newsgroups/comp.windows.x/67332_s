 we have an old sun3/60 here which gets occasional use.  when x11r5 is started
 on it any console messages during startup are undeletable.  after x is fully
 started we run an xterm as the "console" - the problem is that any messages
 that arrive before this starts go to the plain console.  "refresh window" fails
 to remove them.  the messages are a real pain since they sit in the middle of
 the screen obscuring anything else below them.
 
 at boot time the 3/60 lists two framebuffers  -  /dev/cgfour0 and /dev/bwtwo1.
 we're running x in color, and i suspect that maybe the offending messages are
 on the b/w framebuffer, and thereby not getting deleted.
 
 my question is: has anyone else seen this, and is there an easy way to get rid
 of these messages?

 (btw: sunos 4.0.3, x11r5, mwm).
 
 ps: i know i can redirect output of the relevant commands to /dev/null - i'm
     looking for a more general solution).
