 one can't.  the application may not have been started from a terminal
 emulator; if it was, the terminal emulator may not still exist, and if
 it does it may be in no condition to be "pop[ped] to the top" (eg, it
 may be iconified).  and even if you can, it may not do what you want -
 consider a virtual-root window manager like tvtwm, with the relevant
 window in a portion of the virtual desktop that's outside the real
 desktop.
 
 some (but not all) x terminal emulators provide environment variables
 giving a window id.  even if such a thing is present in the
 environment, it may not be what you want; it may correspond to a window
 on a different server, for example.
