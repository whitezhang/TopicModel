 i am trying to find out if my application is running on a local or a
 remote display.  a local display being connected to the same system
 that the client is executing on.  i have access to the display string
 but can i tell from the string?
 
 if the client is executing on host foo then ":0", "unix:0", "foo:0",
 and "localhost:0" are all local.  under ultrix, i believe that
 "local:0" is also a valid display name (a shared memory connection
 maybe?).  are there other strings that i should check for?  is there a
 better way to detect this?
 
 thank you for any help you can give me.
