 what i'd like to see is this scenario: 
 
 each widget, view, whatever, describes it's colors via a palette. 
 palettes can be shared and they only contain descriptive information. 
 they are not directly tied to the object that uses them.  palettes are
 held in the server.  a palette can accomadate, up to, the number of
 hardware color cells of color descriptors. 
 
 when the input focus is in a particular widget, that widget has access
 to all of the colors that are described in its associated palette.  all
 other widgets, transiently, get the closest approximation that can be
 generated by a union of the colors from the current palette and any free
 colors that are left over. 
 
 a widget specifies a color for imaging by providing an index (pixel)
 into its associated palette. 
 
 the bold part above is hard and would need to be done in the server.
