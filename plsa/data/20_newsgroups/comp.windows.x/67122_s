 
 	i want to press a function key and have a text string appear in an
 xmtext widget.  when i put
 
 	*xmtext.translations: #augment \n\
 		<key>f1:  insert-string(hello)
 
 in my resource file, the translation doesn't happen.  if i put
 
 	*xmtext.translations: <key>f1:  insert-string(hello)
 
 in the file, i get the text string hello when f1 is pressed, but no other 
 keys work, which makes sense since the default translation mode is "replace".  
 
 	do i have a syntax problem here, or something deeper?
