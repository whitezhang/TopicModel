 from osf into my normal x11r5 distribution, everything compiles and links
 fine, but xterm doesn't run.
 
 
 warning: representation size 8 must match superclass's to override background
 warning: translation table syntax error: modifier or '<' expected
 warning: ... found while parsing 'p^#j?;'p)=#'
 x error of failed request:  badcolor (invalid colormap parameter)
   major opcode of failed request:  85 (x_allocnamedcolor)
   resource id in failed request:  0x0
   serial number of failed request:  18
   current serial number in output stream:  18
 
 other than this, all the other core x stuff seems to be working ok.  any
 hints/tips appreciated, patches would be primo.
 
 thanks.
