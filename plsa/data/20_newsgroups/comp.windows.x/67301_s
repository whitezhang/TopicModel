 [i am posting this for a friend whose news service is "fubared as usual".
  i will forward replies to him, or if you want to try to reply directly,

 i have an event handler working for a buttonpressmask like:
 
   xtaddeventhandler( plot_data->display, buttonpressmask, false,
                     show_mouse_position, plot_data);
 
 but i would like to be able to have two types of actions: one to occur
 with the left mouse, the other the right, and perhaps one with the
 middle.  so my event handler would look more like:
 
 
   xtaddeventhandler( plot_data->display, left-buttonpressmask, false,
                     show_left_mouse_position, plot_data);
 
   xtaddeventhandler( plot_data->display, right-buttonpressmask, false,
                     show_right_mouse_position, plot_data);
 
 however i don't know how to make my left-buttonpressmask.  there didn't seem
 to be one in the event mask lists i had on hand (although button1motionmask
 looked promising).  my references also mentioned using "|" to or two
 mask events.  can you  use "&" to and two masks?  would i want to in this
 case? 
 
 any help would be appreciated.
 
 thanks,
