 i'm writing an x server for some video-generation equipment.  the
 hardware is "truecolor" in yuv space; in x terms it has a 24-bit
 static color visual.  i would really like to have the server just
 present this static visual, but i'm not sure if this will be 
 acceptable to "most" x clients.  the three problems i see are:
 
   1) the colormap, though huge, is static.
   2) all pixels would be 3 bytes wide.
   3) because the hardware actually lives in yuv space, the
      translation rgb->yuv will introduce some rounding error.
 
 being more of a server guy than a client guy, i ask: will these
 limitations thwart many x clients?  or will most of the x stuff
 floating around blithely accept what they're given?  i could write
 the server to also present a pseudocolor visual of, e.g., 8 bits, 
 but i'd rather avoid this if not necessary.
 
 i know there are no absolutes, but i'd appreciate hearing people's
 opinions and suggestions.  thanks!
