 alright.  ignore this.  i have delved a bit deeper (xkeyevent) and
 found what i was looking for.
 
 ev->state   has a bunch of masks to check against (lockmask is the one
 for capslock).  unfortunately, it appears that the numlock mask varies
 from server to server.  how does one tell what mask is numlock and
 which are for meta (mod1mask, mod2mask, mod3mask, mod4mask, mod5mask).
 eg, sgi's vendor server has mod2mask being numlock, whereas solaris
 1.0.1 openwindows 3.0 has mod3mask for numlock.  is there an
 unambiguous means of determining numlock's mask at runtime for any
 given server?  sorry for the wasted bandwidth and my appalling ignorance.
