 hi,
 	i am in the process of making the decision whether i should
 write c++ wrappers for motif myself or use motif++ or interviews.
 though i have downloaded the tar files, i fail to see any
 documentation. i have two questions:
 	1) if you have used these or similar c++sy toolkits what has been
 your experience?
 	2) where do i find reference books /documentation for them?
 
 any and all input will be greatly appreciated.
