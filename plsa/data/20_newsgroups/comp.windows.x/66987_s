 as part of my self-introduction to x i've been trying to do some simple
 icon animation (sort of like icondoit from mswindows).  changing your
 own applications icon is fairly simple:  if you have a widget id you can
 just xtsetvalues on xtniconifypixmap (or whatever) and you're done. alternately
 you can set window manager hints.  these methods don't seem to work with
 icons which your application doesn't specifically own.
 
 in my situation i have to change the icon of random windows sitting there in 
 my icon box so my question is:  given a window-id, how do you change the
 icon pixure ?  a working example would be very much appreciated.  if it makes
 any difference, i'm using motif 1.1 on vms t6.0-5ke.
 
 thanks -
 scott :)
