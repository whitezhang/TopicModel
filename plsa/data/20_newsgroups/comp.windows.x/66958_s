 i recently found the file xgolf on a german ftp site
 (reseq.regent.e-technik.tu-muenchen.de) but unfortunately the shar file
 was incomplete and the author's email address given in the readme file
 (markh@saturn.ee.du.edu) does not work.
 
 can anyone assist by giving the location of a full version of this (or
 any other golf game for x) game, or a way of contacting the author?
 
 please reply by email if you can help
