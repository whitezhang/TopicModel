 i'm trying to set up an ipx for another group. i copied all the
 x stuff that i compiled on my 4/280 (which runs sunos 4.1.1) using
 gcc 2.1, and most things run just fine. however, i did find a
 couple of bugs, and when i try to recompile those clients on the ipx
 (which runs 4.1.3), i get
 
 ld: undefined symbol
    _xshapequeryextension
    _xshapecombinemask
 
 i know that i can include libxext and get rid of those messages,
 but i can't figure out why i get them on the ipx and not on the
 4/280. any ideas?
