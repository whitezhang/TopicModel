 hello everybody!
 
 i have a little question:
 
 due to more features (pex, drag&drop) many applications when linked with for
 example motif 1.2 instead motif 1.1 need more memory in the xserver.
 x-terminals only have limited memory (normally no swapping possible). so my
 question:
 
 is there a possibility to determine via x protocol calls the size of free
 memory available to the xserver?
 
 so one can determine for example whether to start a pex application with the
 css on client side or on server side (when there is enough memory).
 
 please reply via e-mail, i'll summarize!
 
 sincerly,
         matthias
