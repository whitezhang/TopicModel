 have you set the foreground and background colors in w_gc1 to 
 something other than 0 and 1?  the whitepixel and blackpixel macros
 on your server may not return values suitable for depth 1 drawables.

 are you sure that the fifth plane of the data isn't all the same?  you could
 have different pixel values in the image, but the fifth plane (0x10 == 16)
 might all be the same value?

 if you just want to see the plane of data and want better performance,
 don't use clipmasks, just use pixmap1 as the stipple in a stippled
 rectangle fill.  many servers are very stupid about handling complex
 clip lists, and turn a bitmap clip region into hundreds and hundreds of
 little clipping rectangles, and clips every drawing primitive against every
 one of these little triangles.
 
 
 actually, i must also ask the faq's #1 most popular reason why graphics
 don't show up: do you wait for an expose event before drawing your
 rectangle?
