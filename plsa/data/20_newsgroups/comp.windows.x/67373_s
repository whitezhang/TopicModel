 i have the following problem on x11r5 servers.
 
 when a window of my is obscured by a pop up window which has
 the save under attribute set, the subwindows of my window are not restored.
 
 normally, the subwindows are redrawn when the parent window gets an expose
 event, but because the save under attribute is used for the pop up window
 that obscured my window, no expose event is sent.
 
 when exposuremask is set for the child windows, those windows are correctly
 updated when the popup window disappears, however then the application
 gets too many expose events and you see extra redraws.
 
 everything works fine with x11r4.
 
 is this something that is changed between x11r4 and x11r5 (obvious)?
 is it something i do wrong?
 is there something that the popup window should do (which is also mine)?
 is this a bug in x11 release 5?
 
 greetings,
