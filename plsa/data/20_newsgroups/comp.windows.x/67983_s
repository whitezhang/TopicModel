 our sparc workstation is now equippied with a gt-accelerator. we want to use
 it to display stereo images. the accelerator has double buffers. how can we
 access the buffers and switch between them ? with which functions can we do 
 that ? with functions from xgl, phigs, xlib or xlib-extension ?
 
 your help will be highly appreciated.
