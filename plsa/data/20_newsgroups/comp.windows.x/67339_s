 we tried to ship an x server once that only supported a 24bit
 truecolor visual. the main problems we encountered were:
 
 	1) clients written with logic like the following:
 
 	    if (defaultdepth() != 1)
 		/* assume default depth is 8bit */
 
 	   these clients need an 8bit deep visual in the root window
 	   to run correctly.
 
 	2) other clients didn't even bother to do that much, and just
 	   outright assumed they had a *dynamic* visual class, with a
 	   dynamic colormap. xstorecolors doesn't work on cmaps
 	   associated with static or truecolor visual classes, but
 	   many clients don't bother to check, they just start
 	   throwing xstorecolor calls at you.
 
 though both are clearly client error, this is the case with so many
 clients that it's easier for you to expose 8bit pseudocolor as a
 default root window visual, than it ever would be for all these client
 writers to change their clients to do the right thing.
