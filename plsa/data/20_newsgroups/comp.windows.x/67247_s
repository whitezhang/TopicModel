      i am working on an x-window based application that needs to 
 override some of the window manager focus processing.  i am 
 using x11r4 and motif 1.1 currently, although i will also be 
 working with open look in the future.
 
      what i need to do is under certain circumstances prevent the 
 user from switching from one window of the application to 
 another window.  let's say, for example, that window a is on top 
 of window b in the window hierarchy.  normally, if the user clicks 
 the mouse in window b it will be brought to the top of the 
 window hierarchy and placed on top of window a.  under certain 
 circumstances if the user clicks the mouse in window b i need to 
 beep and prevent window b from being raised on top of window 
 a.
 
       from the research and testing i've done so far, it appears that 
 this window ordering is handled by the window manager, in this 
 case motif.  i haven't found any way to override this default 
 processing through standard x window functions.  i can tell 
 when this switching occurs through focus change and mapping 
 notify events, but i can't find any way to tell motif not to make the 
 switch.
 
       the temporary solution i've currently come up with is very 
 kludgy but it partially works.  when i detect such a window switch 
 in those cases when the switch is not allowed, i manually force 
 the formerly top window back on top with an xraisewindow call 
 and beep with the xbell function.  this provides the necessary 
 functionality but looks ugly when the windows switch places 
 twice.
 
       does anyone know how i can tell motif (or preferably *any* 
 window manager) when i don't want the window order switch to 
 actually take place?  respond either by e-mail or posting to this 
 newsgroup.
 
 cheers....     randall
