 
 i've been reading the sci.crypt, alt.privacy.clipper and comp.org.eff.talk
 discussions about the clipper chip and find (as usual) that most of us
 think alike -- so there's a lot of repitition.  if each of these messages
 were sent to clinton as well as to the net (or instead of to the net), we
 might actually have some effect.
