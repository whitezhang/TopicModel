 i am testing idea block cipher implementations for correctness
 and needs some golden test vectors.  i've looked through
 the postscript idea chapter but the single example gives me
 zero degrees of freedom.  i'll contact the inventor if necessary
 but since we are not paying him money for use of his invention,
 i'd like to offload this from him.  anybody got vectors?
 (no disease vectors, please).
