 i have seen various references to 'triple des' recently. could anyone
 tell me what it is ? from context, i would guess that it means
 encrypting each block 3 times, with a different key each time, but
 i'd like to be sure.
 
 replies by email preferred - our news is unreliable.
 
 thanks,
 	richard
