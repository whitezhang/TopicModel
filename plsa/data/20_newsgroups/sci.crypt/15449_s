 how about this:  the
 telco has your clipper key.  the telco
 has your intended partner's key, if he is
 using one.  whenever you call, the message
 gets decrypted and reencrypted wihtout
 y key exchange.  i know it's a stupid
 system, but for the feds, it'd be
 great.  the point of this isn;t to
 take over the crypto market, btw.  clinton
 doen not want people to have any sort of crypto at
 all (just like busch).  but he needs some support
 for the "technology initiative" garbage he's
 pushing (industrial policy stuff) and a computer
 hip designed by the gov't is just the thing.
 
 who's going to thing about the (literal) billions of
 dollars it took for a government agency to design?
