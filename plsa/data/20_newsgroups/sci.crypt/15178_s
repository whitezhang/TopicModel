 <8.1> what are some known anonymous remailing and posting sites?
 
   currently the most stable of anonymous remailing and posting sites
   is anon.penet.fi operated by julf@penet.fi for several months, who
   has system adminstrator privileges and owns the equipment. 
   including anonymized mail, usenet posting, and return addresses 
   (no encryption).  send mail to help@penet.fi for information.
  
   hal finney has contributed an instruction manual for the cypherpunk
   remailers on the ftp site soda.berkeley.edu (128.32.149.19):
   pub/cypherpunks/hal's.instructions. see also scripts.tar.z (unix
   scripts to aid remailer use) and anonmail.arj (msdos batch files to
   aid remailer use).

   notes
   =====
   
   - cypherpunk remailers tend to be unstable because they are often
     running without site administrator knowledge. liability issues
     are wholly unresolved.
   
   - so far, all encryption is based on public-key cryptography and pgp
     software (see the question on cryptography). 
 
   - encryption aspects (message text, destination address, replies)
     vary between sites.
 
   - multiple chaining, alias unlinking, and address encryption are
     mostly untested, problematic, or unsupported at this time.
 
 _____
 <8.2> what are the responsibilities associated with anonymity?
 
   
   users
   -----
 
   - use anonymity only if you have to. frivolous uses weaken the
     seriousness and usefulness of the capability for others.
   - do not use anonymity to provoke, harass, or threaten others.
   - do not hide behind anonymity to evade established conventions on
     usenet,  such as posting binary pictures to regular newsgroups.
   - if posting large files, be attentive to bandwidth considerations.
     remember, simply sending the posting to the service increases
     network traffic.
   - avoid posting anonymously to the regular hierarchy of usenet; this
     is the mostly likely place to alienate readers. the `alt'
     hierarchy is preferred.
   - give as much information as possible in the posting (i.e.
     references, etc.) remember that content is the only means for
     readers to judge the truth of the message, and that any
     inaccuracies will tend to discredit the entire message and even
     future ones under the same handle.
   - be careful not to include information that will reveal your
     identity or enable someone to deduce it.  test the system by
     sending anonymized mail to yourself.
   - be aware of the policies of the anonymous site and respect them. 
     be prepared to forfeit your anonymity if you abuse the privilege.
   - be considerate and respectful of other's objections to anonymity.
   - ``hit-and-run'' anonymity should be used with utmost reservation.
     use services that provide anonymous return addresses instead.
   - be courteous to the system operator, who may have invested large
     amounts of time, be personally risking his account, or dedicating
     his hardware, all for your convenience.
 
   operators
   ---------
 
   - document thoroughly acceptable and unacceptable uses in an
     introductory file that is sent to new users.  have a coherent and
     consistent policy and stick to it. state clearly what logging and
     monitoring is occurring. describe your background, interest, and
     security measures. will the general approach be totalitarian or
     lassaiz-faire?
   - formulate a plan for problematic ethical situations and anticipate
     potentially intense moral quandaries and dilemmas. what if a user
     is blackmailing someone through your service? what if a user
     posts suicidal messages through your service? remember, your
     users trust you to protect them.
   - in the site introductory note, give clear examples  of situations
     where you will take action and what these actions will be (e.g.
     warn the user, limit anonymity to email or posting only, revoke
     the account, 'out' the user, contact local administrator, etc.)
   - describe exactly the limitations of the software and hardware.
     address the bandwidth limitations of your site. report candidly
     and thoroughly all bugs that have  occurred.  work closely with
     users to isolate and fix bugs. address all bugs noted below under
     ``(in)stability of anonymity''.
   - document the stability of the site---how long has it been running?
     what compromises have occured? why are you running it? what is
     your commitment to it?
   - include a disclaimer in outgoing mail and messages.  include an
     address for complaints, ideally appended to every outgoing item. 
     consult a lawyer about your liability.
   - be committed to the long-term stability of the site. be prepared
     to deal with complaints and `hate mail' addressed to you.  if you
     do not own the hardware the system runs on or are not the system
     adminstrator, consult those who do and are.
   - be considerate of providing anonymity to various groups.  if
     possible, query group readers.
   - keep a uniformity and simplicity of style in outgoing message
     format that can be screened effectively by kill files.  ensure
     the key text `anon' is  somewhere in every header.
   - take precautions to ensure the security of the server from
     physical and  network-based attacks and infiltrations.
 
   readers
   -------
   
   - do not complain, attack, or discredit a poster for the sole reason
     that he is posting anonymously, make blanket condemnations that
     equate anonymity with cowardice and criminality, or assail
     anonymous traffic in general for mostly neutral reasons (e.g. its
     volume is heavy or increasing).
   - react to the anonymous information unemotionally.  abusive posters
     will be encouraged further if they get irrationally irate
     responses.  sometimes the most effective response is silence.
   - notify operators if very severe abuses occur, such as piracy,
     harassment, extortion, etc.
   - do not complain about postings being inappropriate because they
     offend you personally.
   - use kill files to screen anonymous postings if you object to the
     idea of anonymity itself.
   - avoid the temptation to proclaim that all anonymous postings
     should be barred from particular groups because no `possible' or
     `conceivable' need exists.

 <8.3> how do i `kill' anonymous postings?
 
   james thomas green <jgreen@zeus.calpoly.edu>:
 
   > try putting this in your kill file:
   >   
   >   /anon/h:j
   >   /anonymous/h:j
   > 
   > this will search the headers of the messages and kill any that
   > contain `anon' or `anonymous' in them.  not perfect and won't
   > kill followups. 
   
   note that anonymous server operators have the capability to mask
   anonymous postings under which the above method will not work; so
   far this practice is not widespread, but it may become more common
   as a countermeasure to widespread anonymous filtering.
   
 _____
 <8.4> what is the history behind anonymous posting servers?
 
   originally anonymous posting services were introduced for
   individual, particularly volatile newsgroups, where anonymity is
   almost the preferred method of communication, such as talk.abortion
   and alt.sex.bondage.  one of the first was one by dave mack
   started in ~1988 for alt.sex.bondage. another early one was
   wizvax.methuen.ma.us run by stephanie gilgut (gilgut enterprises)
   but was disbanded due to  lack of funds.  the system provided
   anonymous return addresses. n7kbt.rain.com (john opalko) took up
   the functions of this server, including reinstating the anonymous
   alias file. the group ``alt.personals has been chewing through
   servers like there's no tomorrow.''
   
   spurred by the disappearance of `wizvax' and interested in
   researching the idea, karl kleinpaste
   <karl_kleinpaste@godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu> developed his own system
   from scratch in six hours. by this time the idea of extending the
   server to new, more `mainstream'  groups was starting to emerge,
   and he explored the possibility partly at the specific request  by
   multiple users for anonymity in other groups. ``the intended
   advantage of my system was specifically to allow multiple group
   support, with a single anon identifier across all.  this was
   arguably the single biggest deficiency of previous anon systems.'' 
   k. kleinpaste posted a message on rec.nude asking users whether an
   anonymous service would be welcome there, and judged a consensus
   against it. 
 
   k. kleinpaste introduced what he calls a ``fire extinguisher'' to
   `squelch' or `plonk' abusive users in response to complaints, and
   used this in three cases. nevertheless, after a few months of
   intense traffic he was eventually overwhelmed by the abuses of his
   server. ``even as restricted as it was, my system was subjected to
   abuses to the point where it was ordered dismantled by the
   facilities staff here. such abuses started right after it was
   created.''
 
   in ~nov 1992, johan helsingius (julf@penet.fi) set up the most
   controversial anonymous site to date. anon.penet.fi is based on
   scripts and c code written by k. kleinpaste and supports anonymized
   mail, posting, and return addresses. he initially wanted to confine
   the service to scandinavian users but expanded it to worldwide
   accessability in response to 'lots' of international requests.
   
   j. helsingius policy of allowing anonymous posting to every usenet
   newsgroup has been met with strong and serious ideological
   opposition (e.g. by news adminstrators in news.admin.policy).
   because of the relative newness and recent emergence of the medium,
   abuses by anonymous posters  tend to have higher visibility than
   ``routine'' abuses. his total commitment to preservation of
   anonymity is also controversial.
 
   for example, in a highly controversial and publicized case in ~feb
   1993,  an anonymous user posted a supposed transcript of desperate
   crew dialogue during the challenger shuttle disaster via
   anon.penet.fi to sci.astro. despite that the transcript had been
   posted in the same place up to a year earlier (then
   non-anonymously) and actually originated not with the poster but a
   new york news tabloid, subsequent responses consisted largely of
   vociferous outrage at the poster's use of anonymity, reverberating
   through many newsgroups. 
   
   the original poster, using the same anonymous handle, later conceded
   that the story ``seemed likely to have been fabricated,''
   suggesting the plausible possibility that the original intent was
   not to provoke outrage but gauge reactions on the authenticity of
   the story (albeit crudely), free of personal risk from perceived
   association with the item.  the ensuing commotion generated queries
   for the original article by late-entering readers. the anonymous
   user later posted deliberately offensive comments at his
   detractors.
 
   despite piercingly irate and outraged complaints, and even the vocal
   opposition and verbal abuse of k. kleinpaste and eminent news
   operators, j. helsingius has largely avoided use of the ``fire
   extingisher'' and the ``group bouncer'' mechanisms that limit the
   scope of the service. as of ~march 1993 the anon.penet.fi site is
   best described as `inundated': it has registered over 13,000 users
   in its initial three months of operation, forwards ~3000 messages a
   day, and approximately 5% of all usenet postings are anonymized
   through the site. the immense popularity is probably largely due
   to the capability for `global' anonymity which has allowed users to
   find creative uses in diverse areas not previously envisioned.
 
   johan helsingius has been subject to extraordinary pressure to
   dismantle his server in ~feb 1993. at one point k. kleinpaste
   threatened publicly to organize a sort of vigilante group of irate
   news operators to  send out revocation commands on all messages
   originating from the site.  j. helsingius has also alluded to
   threats of flooding the  server.  the server has crashed several
   times, at least once due to a saturation `mailbombing' through it
   by an anonymous user.  mr. helsingius reports spending up to 5
   hours per day  answering email requests alone associated with the
   service's administration. in response to the serious threats he
   disabled global group access temporarily for one week and
   encouraged his users to defend the service publicly.
   
   based on fast-moving dialogue and creative suggestions by
   ``cypherpunks,'' j. helsingius has identified many security
   weaknesses and valuable new features for the service, and is
   currently in the process of code development and testing. he is
   planning on upgrading the ibm compatible 386 machine to a 486 soon
   to handle the voluminous load and is  considering integrating a new
   system with very sophisticated functionality, including multiple
   email aliases, alias allocation control, public-key encryption,
   etc.
 
   a very sophisticated anonymous posting system was set up in dec.
   1992 by d. clunie <dclunie@pax.tpa.com.au> that used cryptography
   in both directions (to/from) the server for the highest degree of
   confidentiality seen so far.  however, it was running on a public
   access account, and he had to shut it down after only several
   weeks, upon receiving requests and conditions apparently ultimately
   originating from nsf representatives. d. clunie has released the
   software to the public domain.
 
   recently the idea of a newsgroup devoted to `whistleblowing' on
   government abuses has received wide and focused attention, and
   group formation is currently underway.  in the basic scenario the
   group would allow people to post pseudonymously using remailers,
   and even establish reputations based on their authentifiable
   digital signatures. the traffic may eventually reach reporters in
   the mainstream news media.  deltorto@aol.com has volunteered to
   attack multiple aspects of this project, including distributing
   easy-to-read documentation on posting, anonymization, and
   encryption.

   is going on with anon.penet.fi?'' in this document.
