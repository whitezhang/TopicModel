    glad to!  you are correct, it is illegal to send cryptographic
 code (and lots of other things) out of the country without a license.
 however, every us citizen has a general export license, allowing
 export of lots of things, including constitutionally protected speech.
 this has the effect that it is legal for us citizens to export some
 things which it is illegal for a us corporation to export without
 first obtaining a license.

    nope, talk to a good lawyer in the area of export law.  but, in
 general, the government has to have a very good national security case
 to try prevent the export of anything you personally might wish to
 publish.  (yes, i worded that the way i did intentionally.  it is a
 lot easier for the government to try to prevent the export of
 information than to charge someone with a crime after the fact.
 espionage is probably the only exception.)

     if you are a us citizen, you have a general license.  (i am not a
 lawyer, so take some of this with a grain of salt.  however, i have
 also had to swim through both itar and export regs in a few cases.)
