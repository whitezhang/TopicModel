 
 i have a question about digital communications encryption:
 
 	the fact sheet mentioned encryption/decryption microcircuitry with 
 special "keys" for law enforcement for wire tapping purposes.
 
 	if i wanted to, couldn't i develop  encryption of my own?  that
 is, if me and a partner in crime had unique encryption/decryption
 devices installed before the "tappable" one, couldn't we circumvent
 the "keys" system?  or replace it?
 
 	i'd be really interested in knowing how the e/d microcircuits might
 be made to prevent such befuddlement! (laymans' language, please! maybe a bit
 technical...)
 
 please e-mail to me, as i'm not in net news as much as i'd like to be!
