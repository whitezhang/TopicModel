 glenn,
 
 thanks for posting that.  i was surprised to notice, however, that one
 question i might have expected to be asked was not:  "are all forms of
 strong encryption other than the clipper to be made illegal?"  speaking
 of which, is anyone aware of whether that question *has* been asked of
 any knowledgeable or official spokesperson for the government?  i have
 not yet seen it mentioned in any of a dozen places it might have been
 reported, but i could have easily missed it.
