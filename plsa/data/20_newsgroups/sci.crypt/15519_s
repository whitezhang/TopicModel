 	the majority of the discussion involving this "clipper chip" seems to
 	pertain to the encryption of telephone conversations.  does anyone
 	know if that means this chip is designed to work primarily with analog
 	signals?  the language sort of suggests this, but it's hard to say.
 
 i'd lay a few bucks that its just data-in-data-out in parallel.  i suspect
 to make it a phone you'd need a codec and speech compression.  there would
 be a loss of bandwidth on the speech signal, which i suspect would scupper
 any of the suggestions i've seen here about putting a different encryption
 front end on it.
 
 there's no hint of any modulation scheme in the docs.  i'm sure it's purely
 a digital chip.  the back end will come later, but i'm *positive* it won't
 be left to the manufacturers - they all have to be the same modulation
 scheme to make it easy for the nsa to tap them.
 
 the only other possibility is that this is intended only for isdn phones.
 (puts a whole new spin on effs obsession about isdn if true, bwahahaha! ;-) )
