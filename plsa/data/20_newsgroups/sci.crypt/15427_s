 i wholeheartedly agree.  knowing that we have let our law enforcement agencies
 seize our property against the fifth amendment of our constitution tells me that
 we are absolving ourselves of our responsibility for self-governance.  we have
 to take our government back from the self-serving politicians who create laws
 and rules only to better their positions within the government.  we have allowed
 them to take too much power from the people of this nation.  that situation has
 to be changed.
 
 allowing the law enforcement agencies to use the seized property to pay-off drug
 informants who lie and continue to deal in drugs is tantamount to making a pact
 with the devil himself.  it's a vicious cycle.  the law enforcement agencies are
 motivated to seize property to fund their own activities.  and having no easy
 way for the citizen to regain the property intact once taken gives even more
 incentive for the agencies to take property.
 
 it's also interesting to note that two months ago rush limbaugh said that
 clinton would have the "plumbers" out in force shortly.  clinton and his
 henchmen firmly believe in strong ubiquitous government control.  anytime a
 leader believes in that, the leader will use every means possible to retain that
 control and take more.
 
 we have to take our government back.  otherwise we will end up living in the
 equivalent of a high-tech third world dictatorship.  we have to take
 responsibility for ourselves, our personal welfare, and our actions.
