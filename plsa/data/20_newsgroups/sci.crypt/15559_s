 an excellent idea.

 while i don't know the full scope of the activities of the eff, 
 from what little i've seen i think it would be better to lobby for 
 strong cryptography through a distinct organization.
 
 the eff has been associated with efforts to prevent the banning of sex
 and pictures newsgroups at various universities. horror stories about the
 contents of those groups (e.g. exploitative pictures of possibly underaged
 models) have already surfaced in the press. the white house bulletin
 already raised the specter of drug-dealing and terrorism, which is only one
 step removed from the old "crypto-wielding child molester" argument.  an
 eff lobbying effort for cryptography would be too easily derailed by the
 connection to child pornography and the like.
 
 similarly, lpf is connected with stallman and his gnu project.  in
 light of, say, the gnu manifesto, this means that in a public debate it
 stands to be labelled as "communist", "anarchist hackers", radical, etc.  
 
 i don't know about cpsr, but if it is an offshoot of physicians for social
 responsibility (best known for helen caldicott and her hysterical
 antinuclear lobbying) then it probably also carries unwelcome political
 baggage.
 
 perhaps for practical reasons a lobbying organization for cryptography
 would best be formed under the umbrella of eff or some other existing
 group, but its charter should then be distinct, independent, and limited to
 advocacy for the right to cryptography.  to reiterate dan bernstein's
 question: does any suitable organization exist?  if not, what are you going
 to do about it?
 
 having mentioned the possible dangers of unwelcome political associations,
 i would be remiss not to suggest something in the opposite direction:
 gathering the support of the nra by emphasizing the rkba side of the
 issue as well as the first-amendment side.
