    i've been thinking about how difficult it would be to make pgp available
 in some form on ebcdic machines.  the message authentication would be ugly,
 but i think at least the idea encryption could work, if pgp had a switch
 to tell it to use idea in ofb-mode or ecb-mode.  in ofb-mode, errors in
 translating ebcdic-->ascii-->ebcdic would only affect their byte, not the
 16 bytes that would be affected under cbc.
    is pgp set up to use different idea modes?  i don't recall notincing it
 in the executable, but i haven't gone through it as carefully as i probably
 should....
