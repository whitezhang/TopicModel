 really? why are so you worried about high school kids "getting their kicks"
 with scanners, as compared to what the feds can do, and have done, to their

 "better than the status quo" isn't good enough, i'd say. the same 
 technology could be implemented without a back door open to the state.
 
 we all know about power and corruption. but we all know that abuse is
 something that only happens to the other guy.
