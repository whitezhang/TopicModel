    actually, david, i don't think it's any more intellectually honest to
 say there are no backdoors than to say there are backdoors, unless you've
 had a chance to examine the algorithm and the silicon closely.  for all
 we know, skipjack could be easily broken, or impossible to break.  and
 clearly, if skipjack is not secure, then the clipper chip is not worth much.
