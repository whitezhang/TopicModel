   simple -- if you have a choice between:
 
  1. american manufacturers peddling cripple chips with a secret untested
      algorithm whose keys are held by people with a history of untrustworthy
      behavoir, or
 
  2. japanese (to pick the obvious example) manufacturers peddling encryption
      chips with an algorithm that has faced public scrutiny and keys under
      the control of the user,
 
 which would you choose?  at most, the american government can deny this
 choice to american citizens (and probably not that, if the glorious success
 of the war on drugs is any example); it can't do much about the global market.
