 since the at&t wiretap chip is scheduled to be distributed 
 internationally, allowing the u.s. government to spy on foreign 
 governments, companies and people as as well as to wiretap domestic 
 citizens, this is a world-wide issue.  thus distribution: world.

 why do we hackers care about the clipper chip?  do we give a shit
 about anybody's privacy accept our own?  and perhaps not even our
 own; are we so smart that we always know when we're talking to
 somebody who has a wiretap on their phone?
 
 i find the "call thru your computer" ideas may reflect this attitude.
 ideas that are of, by, and for hackers, and don't help anybody in the
 real world, aren't going to do anybody much good, including ourselves
 where voice phones are concerned.
 
 we *do* need an alternative to nsa-bugged telephones, but
 we're talking inexpensive *telephones* here, including hand-sized
 cellulars, that need strong crypto, real privacy.  make-shift
 computer hacker rigs that require living by your computer to
 talk privately over the phone are just a dumb stunt that doesn't 
 do anything for anybody's privacy in the real world.  
 
 what we need is a true *privacy chip*.  for example, a real-time 
 voice-encryption rsa, silicon compile it and spit out asic.  
 put this chip on the market as a de facto standard for international 
 business, diplomats, and private communications.  if the u.s. bans 
 it, we make it somewhere else and import it.  the japanese, german,
 dutch, taiwanese, korean, etc. electronics companies don't want the 
 nsa spying on them.  u.s. workers lose more jobs to government fascist
 stupidity.
