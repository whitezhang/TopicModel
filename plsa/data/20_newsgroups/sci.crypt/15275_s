 in reply to mail queries; i don't know if a video is available yet. i asked
 about a month ao and was told rsn.
 
 several have also asked which of chomskys books. my answer is all of them, and
 anything else you can get as well. how ever, due to irritations like the 24 hr
 day etc, i would say 'manafacturing conscent' first, them th last parts of
 'detering democracy' ie the bits about the "domestic 3rd world". chilling.
 
 anyone at mit have a good st. noam bibliography?
