 we've got a tempest receiver in the lab here, and there's no difficulty in
 picking up individual monitors. their engineering tolerances are slack enough
 that they tend to radiate on different frequencies. even where they overlap, you
 can discriminate because they have different line synch frequencies - you can
 lock in on one and average the others out.
 
 the signals are weird in any case, with varying polarisations and all sorts
 of interactions with the building. just moving a folded dipole around is also
 highly effective as a (randomised) means of switching from one monitor to
 another,
