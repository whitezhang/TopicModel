 summary on my recent question:

 unfortunately the answer is no - concealing the initialisation vector  
 essentially doesn't give any additional security. i got 3 answers (from  
 grady@netcom.com, mark.lomas@cl.cam.ac.uk, smb@research.att.com) that  
 opened my eyes. it's pretty simple:
 
 say e is encryption (and d decryption) with key k on 64-bit blocks.
 
 let c[0] be the initialisation vector,
 m[1], m[2], ... the message blocks,
 c[1], c[2], ... the cipher text blocks.
 
 then encryption in cipher block chaining (cbc) mode works by the formula
 
    c[i] = e(m[i] xor c[i-1]),
 
 and decryption by
 
    m[i] = c[i-1] xor d(c[i]).
 
 so if the attacker doesn't have c[0] this only affects the first message  
 block m[1]. but she can do her key search attack on m[2], m[3], ...
 
 the situation in cipher feedback (cfb) mode is a bit more complicated but  
 similar and left as an exercise for the reader :-)
 
 finally there is the modified output feedback mode (ofb) where des (or  
 whatever block cipher you use) simply acts as random generator by
 
    s[i] = e(s[i-1]) with initialisation vector (= seed) s[0],
 
 and encryption is given by
 
    c[i] = m[i] xor s[i].
 
 here the usual `known plaintext' attack against xor-bitstream ciphers  
 reduces the cracking to key search for k.
