 just a little nitpicking. wasn't it the government that required
 a standard railway gauge ? didn't that improve things ?
 
 please don't misunderstand. i'm utter suspicious of this clipper
 chip. why hold the design top secret ? was this a work around the
 law that says that any discoveries made by people working for the
 government is public domain. ( e.g. nih class library, etc. )
 des has its designs published all over the place and it is considered
 fairly strong ( although could be stronger ).
