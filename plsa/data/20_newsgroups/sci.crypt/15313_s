 
 q:   who was consulted?  the congress?  industry?
 
 a:   we have on-going discussions with congress and industry on
      encryption issues, and expect those discussions to intensify
      as we carry out our review of encryption policy.  we have
      briefed members of congress and industry leaders on the
      decisions related to this initiative.
 
 congress??  so we're playing politics before we talk to cpsr, academia,
 the public, internet users?  i`ve heard of top-down design, but top-down 
 democracy?? [just whose state/district are the chip manufacturers in?]
 
 q:   if the administration were unable to find a technological
      solution like the one proposed, would the administration be
      willing to use legal remedies to restrict access to more
      powerful encryption devices?
 
 a:   this is a fundamental policy question which will be
      considered during the broad policy review. [...bs about
      the wonderfulness of the key escrow system...]
 
      the administration is not saying, "since encryption
      threatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,
      we will prohibit it outright" (as some countries have
      effectively done); 
 
 they'll just provide an easily-compromised version to jq public.
 
                          nor is the u.s. saying that "every
      american, as a matter of right, is entitled to an
      unbreakable commercial encryption product."  
 
 maybe we need a cra -- cryptographic rights amendment.
 
                                                   there is a
      false "tension" created in the assessment that this issue is
      an "either-or" proposition.  rather, both concerns can be,
      and in fact are, harmoniously balanced through a reasoned,
      balanced approach such as is proposed with the "clipper
      chip" and similar encryption techniques.
 
 nice lullaby.  but why am i not soothed?

 why repeat themselves?  it appears to some (and the story looks pretty
 convincing to me, too) that the justice department stole a case-tracking
 system, modified it, and distributed it to "friendly" police and suchlike
 agencies around the world, eg. the canadian mounties.  of course, i have 
 no doubt they swore scout's honor that there were no backdoors.
 
 with that kind of intelligence, who'd want to be swamped with terabytes
 of commercial traffic?
