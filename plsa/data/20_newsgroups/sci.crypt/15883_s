 	again we have the trust in government problem here. members of 
 mr. sternlight's generation trust the government to a degree which
 members of my generation find ridiculous. i would suggest that mr. sternlight
 read about the cointelpro program, or about j. edgar hoover, or about
 the wire-tapping of martin luther king, then, after he has digested this
 information he can ponder the fact that while the government does not
 tap every conversation that they have a record of tapping many conversations
 that they have no right to, even under their own laws. given the long
 history of members of the us government ignoring the laws that apply
 to them, it is no wonder that so many people in here sound so paranoid, and
 given the fact that it is often difficult or impossible to punish these
 individuals once they are discovered, it is no wonder that so many people
 in here have so little faith in the escrow proposal for clipper.
