 i never advocated "hiding in the sand."  i'm advocating a peaceful
 solution while a peaceful solution is possible.  unless you want blood on
 your hands.

 english revolution-> what revolution?  they never had one.  
 india-> if they could get around their religion restrictions
 mexico-> point taken, i forgot about this one.  
 france-> napoleon bonepart would have something to say about this.
 holland-> i didn't know they had one, won't comment because i don't know
 enough.

 actually, i consider the issue on topic.  when you start gambling with
 fire crackers, sooner or later, somebody is going to lose a hand.

 fine.  exercise the right to free speech.  that's great!  but don't resort
 to armed violence until there's no other possibility.

 no.  i believe there are bad cops, and good cops.  there are bad people,
 and good people.  (and all that grey inbetween.)  
 
 i have had the pleasure of knowing a police officer who did his best to
 uphold the laws he swore to defend.  i have also seen what happens when
 police power is abused.
 
 don't generalize in either direction.  it just causes problems.

 me either.  nice can of worms, ain't it?
