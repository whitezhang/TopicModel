 my earlier argument that "clipper will encourage state and local cops 
 to commit criminal acts" is largely moot, now that we've learned that 
 the fbi will perform the actual tap.  [it will encourage the *fbi* to
 commit (even more) criminal acts, but that's not the point here.]
 
 but this gives another avenue of attack on the clipper proposal.  when
 the eff/aclu/cpsr foia requests are made, they should ask for details
 on the bureaucratic and equipment infrastructure that is proposed (or 
 even already budgeted) for the fbi to service tapping requests -- for now
 and the projected future. 
 
 from these figures, estimate the number of clipper-tap requests the fbi
 is expecting.  publish this figure.  compare it on a per-capita basis
 with the amount of tapping now known or suspected.
 
 also estimate how expensive it would be for the fbi to install more
 clipper-tapping stations, and how rapidly they could be built and
 installed ... ie, get the "plus or minus" epsilon for the near future.
 
 might be a mite disturbing for j. q. public to know these things.
 
 and despite all the technical details [btw, thanks to those who've been
 providing them!], we still don't know 
 
 1) how the tapping requests will be transmitted and authenticated (though
    it isn't too hard to guess a good scheme).
 
 2) how the results will be securely transmitted (fed ex the audio tapes?)
 
 3) how privacy will be re-established when an investigation is complete.
