 they don't have to track customer lists - they merely have to digitally
 listen to any phone line and eliminate any that don't have the clipper
 header/signature.  (no-one has said how it will be modulated - want a bet
 it's a non-standard and hence easily recognisable baudrate?)
 
 devices to scan exchanges and detect modems etc already exist.  i've seen
 them advertised in the trade press.
 
 once you eliminate crippled crypto devices and ordinary data modems, what's
 left is crypto worth looking more closely at.  i guess any substitute scheme
 will have to be v32bis or v.fast to disguise it, though then they just start
 looking at the data too...
 
 whatever happens though, the effect of this new chip will be to make private
 crypto stand out like a sore thumb.
