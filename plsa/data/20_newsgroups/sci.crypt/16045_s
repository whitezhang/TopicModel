 just thought of something.  yes, laptops can still be read, but it's not quite
 as easy as a normal pc with a crt.  my thought, airline pilots lately have
 been complaining about how laptops being used in flight mess with the plane's
 instruments.  if this can be hyped up, manufacturers may start building
 laptops with even lower emmisions.  it would probably still be possible to
 pick up with surveillance equipment, but at this point, it would be a lot
 cheaper to mask the remaining signals with tempest techniques.
