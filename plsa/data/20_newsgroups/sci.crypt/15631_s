 i hope there is something i don't understand about this system, but can
 someone tell me how these chips are going to be manufactured while maintaining
 each half key under total control of the separate escrow agencies? don't
 both halfs of the key have to come together (in some form) at the time
 the chip is constructed?
 
 or is it built like a fusable prom, with the chip being sent to the 1st
 escrow agency to program its 1/2 key, then the 2nd agency to program its
 1/2 key (but who invents the safeguards that prevent the 2nd agency from
 reading the information already programmed by the 1st)?
 
 this isn't intended to be a flame or anything, i am just really curious
 how to manufacture these things while still maintaining the key escrow
 security without simply saying "trust the manufacturer, they won't look".
