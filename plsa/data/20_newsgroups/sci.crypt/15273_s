 53 seconds to hash 20m of core (i bet i know who the source of your
 information is!). no, it's not acceptable if it's part of your login
 process. but if you are going to use network traffic as the source of
 pseudo-random information, do the right thing and pass it through a
 cryptographic hash function, not a compressor. aside from the fact
 that it will run faster, it will give better results (think of a
 cryptographic hash as a function that "distills" randomness).
 something along the lines of 
 	etherfind -t -x -n  | dd bs=1k count=10 2>/dev/null | md5
 should do the trick. -t gives you timestamps, and the lack of -u makes
 sure that dd does not get ten lines as opposed to ten k. the above
 takes a couple of seconds on a lightly-loaded ethernet.
