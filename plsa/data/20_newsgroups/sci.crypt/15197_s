 what is the expected run time (+/- a factor of 10) on a 486dx/50
 using the best known algorithm for finding the shortest path
 solution for rubicks cube from a randomly chosen position?
 
 i have read the faq and followed the recent discussion on rubicks
 cube but i don't believe this question has been answered.  notice
 that i am specifically looking for an algorithm that finds the 
 shortest path, not just any solution.
 
 it seems to me that the underlying assumption is that such a program
 would need to do a brute force search though 10^20 positions.  that
 seems an unreasonably pessimistic assumption to me and i want to 
 know if someone has significantly improved on that.
 
 i have some ideas of my own on how to approach this problem, but
 before i spend to much time developing them i wanted to know if
 someone else has already done the work.
 
 administrivia:  i have posted this to three groups and attempted
 to set the followup to rec.puzzles which seems to me to be the
 place to continue this discussion.  i will cross post a summary
 when and if it becomes appropriate.  email replies gladly accepted.
