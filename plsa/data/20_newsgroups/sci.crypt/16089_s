   wes's list is of "do"s and "don't"s for writing your congressional
 representatives is a fine one but i'd like to encourage people to pay
 extra attention to the point above.  as cliched as the saying may be
 it's nevertheless true that you can catch more flies with honey than
 with vinegar.
 
   while the writing styles prevalent on the net possess a certain charm
 please remember that the person reading your letter is likely to be
 uninfluenced or negatively influenced if you express your concerns in
 a way that makes you sound like a flake or a paranoid crackpot.  wild
 and unsupported accusations about the menace from the nsa will not
 carry much weight, nor are overblown conclusions about the inevitable
 consequences of the proposal likely to convince (especially not ones
 that attempt strained analogies to the rise of the nazi party.  please
 save the niemoller quote for another letter..)
 
   if you want your opinions to be taken seriously it is *very* important
 that you state those opinions in a manner that is understandable and 
 seems reasonable to a layman.  don't overburden your reader with technical
 details or expect them to know the history of various encryption 
 technologies.  before you mail it, hand your letter to a non-technical
 friend and ask them to sanity-check it.
 
   above all, realize that legislators are often motivated as much by
 self-interest as by anything else.  try to point out risks in terms that
 will be meaningful and motivating to them such as the loss of individual
 privacy rights or the damage restrictive export regulations do to american
 businesses' ability to compete in the global marketplace.  pull the 
 strings that you think will work with your legislator -- if your
 legislator is unlikely to be swayed by civil-rights concerns then point out
 how a government-granted monopoly for mycotronx damages the competitiveness
 of businesses in your district that manufacture or market phone or crypto
 technology.
