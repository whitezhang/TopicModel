 this is an addition (posted with permission) to some tech. details of
 cliper. they enligthen ??? the use of s1 and s2 for keygeneration.

 subject: re:  clipper chip
 
 i just had another conversation with nsa to clarify some of the features
 of clipper.  please feel free to distribute this and my other messages
 on clipper.
 
 the name of the encryption algorithm is "skipjack."
 
 martin hellman had written
 
                 and the serial number of the unit added to produce a three part
                 message which will then be encrypted under the system key sk
                 producing
 
                      e{ e[m; k], e[k; uk], serial number;  sk}
 
 to which i responded:
 
         my understanding is that e[m; k] is not encrypted under sk (called the
         "family key") and that the decrypt key corresponding to sk is held by
         law enforcement.  does anyone have first hand knowledge on this?
 
 i was correct in that e[m; k] is not encrypted under sk.  however, skipjack
 being a single-key system, there is, of course, not a separate decrypt key
 for the family key sk.
 
         the unit key, also called the "chip key," is generated from the
         serial number n as follows.  let n1, n2, and n3 be 64 bit blocks
         derived from n, and let s1 and s2 be two 80-bit seeds used as keys.
         compute the 64-bit block
 
                 r1 = e[d[e[n1; s1]; s2]; s1]
 
         (note that this is like using the des in triple encryption mode with
         two keys.)  similarly compute blocks r2 and r3 starting with n2 and n3.
         (i'm unlear about whether the keys s1 and s2 change.  the fact that
         they're called seeds suggests they might.)  then r1, r2, and r3 are
         concatenated together giving 192 bits.  the first 80 bits  form k1 and
         the next 80 bits form k2.  the remaining bits are discarded.
 
 the seeds s1 and s2 do not change.   the whole process is performed on
 a laptop computer, and s1 and s2 are supplied by two independent people
 so that no one person knows both.  the same s1 and s2 are used during
 an entire "programming session" to generate keys for a stream of serial
 numbers.  everything is discarded at the end (the computer could be
 thrown out if desired).
 
 the serial number is 30 bits and the values n1, n2, and n3 are formed
 by padding the serial number with fixed 34-bit blocks (separate padding
 for each value).
 
 the resulting keys k1 and k2 are output onto separate floppy disks, paired
 up with their serial number.  each pair is stored in a separate file.  the
 floppy disks are taken away by two separate people on behalf of the two
 escrow agencies.

 i am sure more technical detail will be known when time goes by.
 please remark, that in posting this, i do not automatically agree
 with it's contents and implications. so don't swamp my mailbox :-)
 
 i just think this is an valuable addition to the less than technical
 discussion that is rising here. and, no, i don't mind if you call
 s1 and s2 'backdoor', as i could imagine the key-generation process
 working without these seeds and the dependency of k1,k2 from the
 serial-number.
