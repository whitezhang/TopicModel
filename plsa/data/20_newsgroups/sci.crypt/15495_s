 	hmmm. a thirty bit serial number. and, we are told, the unit key u is
 	derived deterministically from this serial number. that means that

 oh hell, it's *much* worse than that.  you think they'll ever make
 more than a million of them?  serial numbers aren't handed out at random
 you know, they start at 1 and work up...  call it a 20 bit space maybe.
