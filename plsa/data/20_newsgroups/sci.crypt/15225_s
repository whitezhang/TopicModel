 i don't know if this is still true, but at one time coca-cola
 took elaborate measures to keep the formula secret.  for instance,
 several plants in different cities each made one of six partial
 concentrates, which were then shipped back-and forth and remixed
 in a complicated scheme so that no single plant made the whole
 formula.  by now, i would guess that pepsico's chemists would have
 reverse-engineered it; can't be all that exotic.  actually i
 prefer pepsi anyhow; in about 3 minutes i'm gonna put money
 into a pepsi vending machine...
