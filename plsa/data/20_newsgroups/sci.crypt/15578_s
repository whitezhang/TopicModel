 once the chips are released (in phones, or whatever), they are vulnerable to 
 phsyical inspection and observation.  now, i will grant that there will no 
 doubt be safeguards against "peeling" the chip, but the nsa has no monopoly 
 on cleverness.  the chip, and the algorithms it uses, will not remain secret 
 for very long.  any university with a vlsi lab has the required equipment, as 
 does any offshore semiconductor manufacturer.
