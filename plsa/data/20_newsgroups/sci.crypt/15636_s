 yes. reasonable parallels. (though i don't think russia ever claimed to be
 communist)

 i must protest your "...in a communist country". how do you know?
 there haven't been any, and are unlikely to ever be any. in some socialist
 dictatorships, you can't, whilst in some socialist democracies
 (such as france or australia)
 you can. of course, some people may disagree about france & australia being
 socialist...

 in some circumstances. i was at a public meeting last night (in the usa), where
 a protester, who was very nice and calm, and just said before the
 speaker started to beware of his opinions, was forced out of the meeting by
 two armed policemen.
 
 there are a lot of things that one cannot do in the usa. you may not
 notice them, but as an australian visitor, i notice them.

 yes, we are lucky at the moment. i hope that is still true in
 a few years time. because it didn't just happen...it required concious
 effort.

 of course don't over react --- but don't under react.
