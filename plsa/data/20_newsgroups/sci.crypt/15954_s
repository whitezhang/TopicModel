 david,
 
    neither (1) or (2) apply with the government, though. the feds, unlike
 apple, have repeatedly demonstrated that trust is an unsafe thread on which
 to hang your freedom. why?  because unlike apple in (2), the govt has no
 credibility to lose. i'm serious about this. one can name just about any
 agency -- the irs, rtc, fcc, faa, fbi, nsa, cia -- and find numerous examples
 of the public trust run roughshod over. worse, one can rarely find in such 
 examples any serious consequences to the offending agency. even supposing
 we could get a reign on trust somehow, there's always the matter of competence
 in govt agencies. can they even trust themselves?

   p.s. i was amused when you mentioned the usda as an example of an agency
 capable of managing the an escrow. i'm a consultant to the usda, and while those
 *i* work with are wonderful <grin>, the agency itself is ranked in industry
 publications such as govt computer news as one of the worst caretakers of
 its computer resources. recently, prime time live did a long segment on
 the usda's computer troubles. they are making a concerted effort to change,
 but intentions don't make a track record.
