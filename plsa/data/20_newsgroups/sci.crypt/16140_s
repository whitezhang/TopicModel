 they also have a lot of the other voters really irritated at them.

 okay, folks, i know i'm in the minority on this issue, but i can't
 let this assertion go unchallenged yet again.  i'm going to say this
 only once, in the hopes of not starting a flame war off of the main
 topic.
 
 guns are offensive.  cryptography is defensive.  see the difference?
 the only way you can use a gun is to hurt somebody else.  crypto-
 graphy helps prevent other people from hurting you.
 
 sorry for the digression.  let's not forget the issue that we do
 agree on: we want continued access to crypto technology of our
 choice, without key registration.
