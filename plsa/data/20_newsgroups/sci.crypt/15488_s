 hmm, here are a couple:
 
 1) if the algorithm becomes known, it will be easy to produce
 pin-compatible non-crippled chips that provide -real- encryption and
 privacy, because their keys are only in their users' hands.
 
 2) since skipjack is a symmetric key cypher, it needs some way to
 agree on a session key. the released information says that any
 protocol may be used (e.g., dh). from a theoretical point of view,
 this is probably true. however, from a practical point of view, those
 chips must have some kind of key exchange protocol built-in. what if
 it is good old rsa? this will mean that the producer will have to pay
 lots of bucks to pkp. by keeping the details secret this can be
 avoided...
