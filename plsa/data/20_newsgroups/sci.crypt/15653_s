 to me, a larger problem is that once disclosed, your keys could be used
 to decrypt any previously recorded conversations. i gather that from this
 proposal a warrant would be required to get the keys, but not to collect
 conversations! consider the scenario where an agency collects preemptively
 all encrypted conversations for certain people likely to be targets (and
 not necessarily "legitimate" targets), then arranges for some unrelated
 incident that can trigger a warrant:
 
    "your honor, we know that the suspect has received calls from noted 
 crime figure bugsy butthead [said calls arranged by the agency] and we must 
 therefore have this warrant to determine whether this suspect, in a
 sensitive govt post, is corrupt."
 
   i suppose that it is conceivable that there are session keys involved
 somewhere, but that doesn't seem likely; if there are, why wouldn't the
 technical overview mention them when it goes to such details as the number
 of bits held by each escrow authority?
 
   this scheme is full of holes, and stinks to high heaven.
