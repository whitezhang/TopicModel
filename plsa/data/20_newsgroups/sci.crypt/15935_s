 two safeguards:
 
 1. the fbi could be asked to produce the law enforcement block to the escrow
 agencies, and associate it with a particular court order;
 
 2. if the thing comes to trial the defense attorneys can probe this issue
 closely. it is not too different from proving that the speaker on a legal
 wiretap is the person the court order covered.
 
 putting it another way, this question is not very different from the
 pre-clipper question "what's to prevent the fbi from getting a court order
 to tap al capone and then using it to tap jonathan livingstone seagull
 instead?"
