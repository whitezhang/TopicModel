 thanks for posting this and making it available. this post will be long, i will
 comment on most of it, and am reluctantly leaving all of the original in place
 to provide context.
 
 please note that an alt. group has been set up for the clipper stuff.

 hum, at&t, vlsi and mykotronx are 'industry'?
 wonder what happened to ibm, this should be right up their street.
 and a mandateed scheme is voluntary? mr orwell would love this.

 telephone encryption and scrambleing are years behind digital ones like rsa,
 idea, or even des. the above, while literaly true, is a clasic straw-man claim
 in the context of non-real-time circuits such as e-mail and the like.

 note the use of the word "business" in the above. the whole tenor of this
 release seems to be establishing a ground rule that only "business" use
 is legitimate for debate. if you want the nothings you drop in your wife's
 ear to remain secret and private, that is not even on the agenda for debate.
 note that there is no role for you to contain private info in this. the only
 reference is to information already in the hands of others. the 'unauthorized
 release' bit is also drawing a long bow. most of these cases are by people who
 have legitimate access abusing it, and revealing, or often selling the info.
 these people are, of course, in this proposal, the people who will have the
 keys.
 
 the criminals also use lawers, courts, the cia, white-house officials and pens
 to go about their business. when will they be outlawed as well? yeah, several
 of them would be a better idea than clipper!
 
 them again, the protections of law and the courts have been seriously erroded
 over the last decade ofr so.

 note the repeated mixing of telephone scrabeling and encryption. a demo
 of the above claim on an ordanary pots would be a good nights entertainment
 i suspect. note also the 'many'. not 'all', as the general tone implies.

 the case record seems to indicate that what is needed is a brutal tightening
 of the current abuses. i have not heard, yet, of a case that was impeaded by
 the use of secure encryption by the men in black. the other side, abuse by law
 enforcers is well documented, even by govt agencies. and the phone vs other coms
 is blurred yet again.

 lets run that line twice. not **very** carefully what it says. the stated
 purpose of the key eschrow is to make the use of clipper compulsory. note the
 word "ensure". as to 'protect', or 'law-abiding', i will leave to you.
 so to the person who asked if it included the outlawing of other encryptions,
 the answer in this press release is, yes.

 just as they only can wiretap now with a warrent.

 where do you find many experts. any ex kgb people looking for a contract? :-)
 and as a later posting asks, what of the stu-iiis they already have. it will
 be very interesting to see if the military and us embasies start to use it.
 after all, it is secure, isn't it. the govt will answer that point by its own
 actions.

 encryption and codes have been around for millenia. they are generaly in
 equilibrium with the technology of the time. the systematic study of cyphers
 has resulted in a swing in favor of the encrypter, at the moment. i have no
 doubt that the factoring problem will fall in time. probably fofr practical
 purposes by the middle of the next century.

 note we drop back to 'phone-mode' again. if this is a true answer, it can be
 rephrased as " it sucks big time. anyone who can drive the crypt work-bench
 will use it for light amusement before breakfast."

 this link between the security of the key-eschrow, and the actual algorithm is 
 a real winner. given that i have 2 secret 40 bit numbers, could someone please
 explain how the details of an encryption algorithm will reveal them?

 the reverse engineering provisions of the 'mask-work' act could be relevent

 i would say "less secure, less conveniant, more expensive ( pgp is free ),
 less available, and more prone to being comprimised"
 proofs to the contarary will be welcome. note proof.

 they don't seem to be saying anything that makes much sense. and this proposal
 does prohibit it except in a very limited way. and, this is the one explicit
 reference to personal rights. it is a denial. and yes, i don't think that the
 mexicans, brazilians, and canucks are included in clinton et als magnanamous
 gesture.

 the 'false tension' is false. the balance is between two repugnant points. the
 right to privacy is hand-waved to non-existance by putting it behind the "false
 assessment". it is assumed that the removal of the right to take what ever steps
 you deem suitable to protect your privacy is non negotiable, hence is defined
 in the govenment language to be non-existant. if you don't agree, you must be a
 criminal, as only criminals don't agree with out laws. also note the non-
 question. "if what is here was not possible..."

 it indicates we know that bush dropped the ball in squashing that nasty < insert

 this one is a real giggle. in australia or france, they will have to reveal the
 keys, and the algorithm. don't think it's at the top of my list of things i must
 have, so the restrictions will protect me from saleks trying to sell me a bill
 of crock.
 
 any for any others using it, they must be nuts!
 
 good luck folks.
