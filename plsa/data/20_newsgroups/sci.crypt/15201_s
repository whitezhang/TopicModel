 i sent a response to the white house at
 
 	0005895485@mcimail.com (white house)
 
 and received a nice, automatic reply from micmail noting, in passing, that
 if i had included a snail address, i would get a reply in due course.
 
 for those who care, my reply was:
 
 	1.	yes, let's protect the voice network
 
 	2.	privately-developed crypto has always been available and
 		always will be -- so let's think about how to do law
 		enforcement given that fact not about how to hope to
 		legislate against it
 
 	3.	my needs for crypto as a system designer are not met by the
 		clipper chip.  i want freely to export uses of algorithms
 		(like des & rsa) which are already freely available in the
 		destination country
