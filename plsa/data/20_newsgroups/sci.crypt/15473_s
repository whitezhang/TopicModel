 here are two quotes from the white house.
 
 ``the administration is not saying, "since encryption threatens the
 public safety and effective law enforcement, we will prohibit it
 outright" (as some countries have effectively done); nor is the u.s.
 saying that "every american, as a matter of right, is entitled to an
 unbreakable commercial encryption product."''
 
 ``in making this decision, i do not intend to prevent the private
 sector from developing, or the government from approving, other
 microcircuits or algorithms that are equally effective in assuring
 both privacy and a secure key-escrow system.''
 
 these quotes bother me in three ways. (1) many people will read and
 remember that ``encryption threatens the public safety and effective
 law enforcement.'' (2) the administration is explicitly failing to
 acknowledge that every american is entitled to use strong encryption
 to ensure his own privacy. (3) the president, by implication, may
 intend to outlaw any cryptographic devices which ensure privacy but
 do not have a key-escrow system.
 
 i want to see an organization which will combat such statements.
 encryption does _not_ threaten the public safety, any more than ski
 masks do. every american _is_ entitled to use strong encryption which
 ensures his own privacy and is _not_ crippled by a key-escrow system.
 i guess i'm looking for a ``league for cryptographic freedom.'' or a
 ``national cryptography association.''
 
 to what extent does the eff serve this purpose? is a new organization
 necessary? does it already exist?
