 preventing black market chips w/non-escrowed keys is exactly what they
 mean by protecting the security of the key escrow system.  there are
 two parts to the security of such a system:
   
     (a) preventing decruption by unauthorized personel
     (b) assuring that the gummit can always decrypt clipper
         traffic when it authorizes itself to do so.
 
 of course, the ministry of propoganda will do a lot of tallking about
 (a) and very little about (b).

 ps: anyone care to guess what encryption scheme the gov't is using on
     its newly formed database of anarch-cryptists who oppose this entire
     lunacy?
