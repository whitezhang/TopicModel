 (a) to use for sensitive but not strategically important traffic,
 (b) if the system was cheap.
 
 for example, i don't own a cordless phone.  with clipper, i would.  if the 
 local men in blue really want to listen to me talk to my friends or order 
 pizza, i'm no worse off than i am now, and i don't have to worry about
 local kids or nosy neighbors.
 
 that is to say, clipper "raises the bar" on insecure channels.  it doesn't 
 make them secure, by any means, but a wall, even if the fbi can get a master 
 key by court order, is still better than a "keep off the grass" sign.

 so, where can i buy a des-encrypted cellular phone?  how much does it cost?
 personally, cylink stuff is out of my budget for personal use :)...
