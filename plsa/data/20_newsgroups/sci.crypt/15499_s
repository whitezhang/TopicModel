 please note that bill clinton probably has little if anything to do
 with the design, implementation or reasoning behind this chip or behind
 any "moves" being made using this chip as a pawn.
 
 remember, when you elect a president of the united states, it's not
 the case that all the republicans, etc. in the nsa and fbi and cia
 immediately pack their bags and get replaced by a team of fresh young
 democrats.  most of the government -- say, 96% -- is appointed or
 hired rather than elected.  since this clipper device has been in
 production for over six months, it probably has little or no 
 foundation in the currently elected democratic executive body.
