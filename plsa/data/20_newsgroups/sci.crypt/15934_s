 
 i think it very unlikely there are back doors in clipper, for two reasons:
 
 1. the government doesn't need them if it can get the key (and yes, i assume
 that the "official" government obeys court orders, etc.--and that the design
 of the chip and its approval were "official");
 
 2. it would defeat the whole purpose of providing secure crypto for american
 business that couldn't be read by our economic adversaries. if this were not
 a legitimate and genuine purpose, and as many think, the nsa can read des,
 why bother otherwise?
 
 rational responses preferred to conspiracy theories, thanks.
