     no kidding.  the most recent post i saw in alt.privacy.clipper (and i
 hope anyone interested in this topic ends up there) states that clipper
 has been in development for over four years.
 
     i am, however, more than a little po'd that clinton put his name on
 this monstrosity, or even allowed it to get out the door, for that matter.
 he's already heard from me, and i hope you'll all take the time to voice
 your extreme displeasure as well.
