 tom clancy omitted these key steps to try to prevent groups of people from
 building a nuclear bomb.  however, he asserts that you can find these key
 steps in any university library.  the main point of _five minutes to midnight_
 is that it is impossible to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons,
 since it has become easy to acquire the knowledge to build one, and fissible
 materials are nearly impossible to control.  read this article, or better
 yet, run to your library yourself and dig up some stuff on constructing a
 nuclear weapon.
