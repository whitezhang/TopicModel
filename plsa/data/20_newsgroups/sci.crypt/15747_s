 that wasn't my point. my point is that your implied position about the "waco
 massacre" is an assertion cum political position. according to a cnn poll,
 about 86% of americans think the fbi acted properly, and a majority think
 they should have done it (the tear gas) a lot sooner. a large majority also
 believe the fbi was not at all responsible for the death of the victims,
 koresh was. (let's avoid the kind of fruitless argument of the sort if a
 hadn't x'd, then b might not have y'd....)
 
 what you call the "big brother chip" is right now a proposal under
 discussion, and it is not yet clear that strong crypto is going to be
 banned.
 
 therefore neither justifies "any tactic is fair." thus the statement is
 nonsense. it is pernicious, because "any tactic" can lead to damaging
 others.
 
 as i see you know from the tone of your reply, there's nothing personal
 intended.
