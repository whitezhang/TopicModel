 let's put it this way, they have a charter and several executive orders
 to obey, among other things which *explicitly* prohibit sharing this
 information (unless things have changed withing the last little while).
 i suppose they could ignore it, if they choose.  but i doubt they would.
 for an authoritative look at the nsa, get bamford's "the puzzle palace".
 that's all i can say.
