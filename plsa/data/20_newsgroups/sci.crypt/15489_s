       just a question. 
       as a provider of a public bbs service - aren't you bound by law to gurantee
       intelligble access to the data of the users on the bbs, if police comes
       with sufficent authorisation ? i guessed this would be  a basic condition
       for such systems. (i did run a bbs some time ago, but that was in switzerland)
 
 the us doesn't yet have many laws covering bbss - they're not common carriers,
 they're not phone companies, they're just private machines or services
 operated by businesses.  there's no obligation to keep records.
 as perry metzger points out, if the police come with a search warrant,
 you have to let them see what the warrant demands, if it exists,
 and they generally can confiscate the equipment as "evidence"
 (which is not constitutionally valid, but we're only beginning to
 develop court cases supporting us).  a court may be able to compel
 you to tell them information you know, such as the encryption password
 for the disk - there aren't any definitive cases yet, since it's a new
 situation, and there probably aren't laws specifically covering it.
 but the court can't force you to *know* the keys, and there are no
 laws preventing you from allowing your users to have their own keys
 for their own files without giving them to you.
 
 even in areas that do have established law, there is uncertainty.
 there was a guy in idaho a few years ago who had his business records
 subpoenaed as evidence for taxes or some other business-restriction law,
 so he gave the court the records.  which were in hebrew.
 the us doesn't have laws forcing you to keep your records in english,
 and these were the originals of the records.  he didn't speak hebrew,
 and neither did anybody in the court organization.  don't think they
 were able to do much about it.
 
 it might be illegal for your bbs to deny access to potential customers
 based on race, religion, national origin, gender, or sexual preference;
 it probably hasn't been tested in court, but it seems like a plausible
 extension of anti-discrimination laws affecting other businesses.
