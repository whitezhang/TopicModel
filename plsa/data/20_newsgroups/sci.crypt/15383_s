 as a flaming libertarian paranoid extremist (:-), i'at a loss for
 specific objections that don't sound frighteningly technical.  any
 suggestions?  perhaps somebody could post a list of these?

 one way to do this might be to suggest that these companies should be
 implementing their own schemes, not being limited to the govt's
 scheme.
 
 i find that most of my reasons for opposition to the clipper scheme
 are algoritm insecurity and mistrust of the govt/nsa.  these are hard 
 to sell in letters to the editor and to nontechnical people.  any
 hints or advice.  maybe a small faq-type thing "why should i hate
 clipper" would be a good idea.
