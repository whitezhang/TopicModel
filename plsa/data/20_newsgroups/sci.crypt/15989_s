 the answer to your second question lies in the way you phrased the
 first one:  'the media is...'.
 
 the medis isn't 'is'.  the media 'are'.  'media' means 'more than one
 medium.'  there are thousands of publications.  some say this, some say
 that.  
 
      how can the bulk of the people be informed, when they won't read
      informative publications?
