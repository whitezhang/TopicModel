 presumably, the key split is so that no one group controls the privacy
 of the key, and that it would be infeasible to illicitly gain access from
 both agents.
 
 however, if one agent wishes to break the crypto without the cooperation
 of the other agent, a 40-bit key is not going to stand in the way of a
 brute force attack.  if an agency (for example, the nsa) were to hold one
 of the two key-halves, then i don't imagine they really need the other half of
 the key to start listening in.
 
 or was that the point?   <grin>
 
 
 (this is not to imply, at all, that i like the idea of the rest of the
 system.)
