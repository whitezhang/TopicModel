 i have a question that is a slight variation on the previously mentioned
 examples that perhaps people could give me some pointers on (it has been a
 couple of years since my con law class in college so i hope i am not
 missing something obvious here...)
 
 basic scenario:
 
 	i set up a bbs that uses public-key encryption and encryption of
 	files on disk.  the general setup is designed so that when users 
 	connect they send a private key encrypted using the system public
 	key and the user's public-private keypair is used to wrap the
 	one-time session keys used for encrypting the files on disk.  the
 	result of this is that even if i reveal the system private key it
 	is impossible for anyone to gain access to the files stored on the
 	machine.  what is possible is for someone to use the revealed
 	system private key to entice users into revealing thier personal
 	private keys during the authentication sequence.
 
 questions:
 
 	does the fact that the system private key does not provide any
 	information useful for a search give me any protection as far as
 	being coerced to reveal the key?  (i doubt it myself..)
 
 	it seems providing the system private key does not mean that i am
 	assisting in "entrapment" (the users would send thier key anyway
 	and are not being enticed into doing something they would not
 	otherwise do) but is there any other hook that can be used?
 
 	would the user private-key enticement require wiretap approval?
 
 any answers or general musings on the subject would be appreciated...
