  also not a lawyer, etc. but if i remember correctly the contempt of court
 business is used in order to compel cooperation with what is (perhaps
 questionably, different issue) the legitimate business of that court. quite
 literally the party is found guilty of holding the court "in contempt". now,
 the original scheme as suggested here would be to have the key disappear if
 certain threatening conditions are met. once the key is gone there is no
 question of contempt of court as there is nothing to compell, the key is no
 longer there to be produced.
 
   obstruction of justice would be a different issue but if the suspect in
 question would have some legitmate reason to protect his data from prying eyes
 (however extenuated) i think that this charge would be a hard nut to make. 
 
   perhaps it is time for a lawyer to step in and clear this all up?
