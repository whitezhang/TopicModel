 congress isn't forced to do anything.  not even follow their own rules,
 if it isn't expedient.  if caught with their collective pants down,
 they make some funny noises, perhaps crucify a skapegoat or two, then
 continue business as usual.  i notice those senators involved with
 the s&l scandal weren't hurt too much, if at all.  deconcini's personal
 stake in suppliers to those big aerostats hasn't affected his credibility
 at all, inside congress, at least.  he is still pushing his police state
 agenda...

 it will be like the old saw in new jersey and new york, chicago, etc
 when the politicians promised that this spiffy new gun registration law
 will not be used for future confiscation purposes.  sure enough, a few
 years later, when they were used just for that purpose, and folks
 complained, the response was "well, *i* didn't make that promise..."
 some politicians may not even wait a few years...  escrowed keys would
 have the same assurances of security.  besides, if someone wants to
 snoop, how are you to know - you don't think they will send you a letter
 saying "we are now snooping on your private conversations...", do you?
 what are the assurances the escrow people will not be forbidden to
 report any access attempts for one's keys?
 
 so much for government assurances of privacy.
 
 <in effect you must set up escrow agencies as a fourth branch of
 <the goverment and isolate them from any outside interferance. 
 <they will be able to directly tap into federal funds with no
 <accountability to anyone except through a court challenge.
 
 how?  the feds will just change the law, or just ignore it.  nothing
 new here...  they got the muscle, the resources, the guns...
 
 as an aside, since export of crypto is verboten because of itar,
 shouldn't the second amendment also come into play here?
