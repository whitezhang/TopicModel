    i know that at least one person on that list says the first he heard
    of clipper was in the friday morning newspaper! and another has
    already fired off a letter of protest to nist.
 
    my point? i suspect this list, interesting as it is for various
    reasons, does not represent the cabal that put this proposal together.
    some of them, yes. others, no. 
 
 i received mail from mitch kapor saying that he did not ask to be on
 the list, and does not know why he was added.  i'm sure the same
 applies to others on the list.  so, i guess my initial theory was
 right, that the clipper list was just someone's idea of a bad joke.  i
 guess i should be happy it wasn't a conspiracy.
