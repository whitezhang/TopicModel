 the attorney general publishes the number of court-ordered taps each year.
 it isn't enough (around a thousand) for the average non-crook, non-spy to
 worry about. in fact, considering any reasonable guess about the number of
 big-time crooks and spies around, it may not be enough even for most crooks
 and spies to worry about.
 
 there's no reason to believe that it will go up with clipper, since the
 number of taps now includes many targets too stupid to use encryption (based
 on the playbacks we've heard in court cases).
