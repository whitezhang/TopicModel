 have you heard of pgp? i assume from your post that you have not. pgp 2.2
 is a freeware rsa encryption program which includes digital signatures and
 comprehensive key management facilities. most sites also keep the source code.
 a growing number of people are using this excellent software to encrypt (to
 a very high standard) their email and data. get it before clinton outlaws it.
 
 two of the many sites are:
       rsa.com     /pub/pgp
       soda.berkeley.edu      /pub/cypherpunks/pgp
 
 hope this helps,
