 
 my thoughts on why the algorithm is secret :
 
    the chip is (regretably) likely to become a standard.   there will
    be many applications where economic factors dictate use of this
    chip, like it or not.
 
    if the alrogithm is public, and the code is as secure (absent the 
    access to escrowed keys) as represented, an enterprising sort 
    would make "compatible crypto chips for which no key had been
    escrowed".  this is likely what the release was refering to when 
    they refered to the secrecy of the algorithm protecting the
    security of the escrow system.
