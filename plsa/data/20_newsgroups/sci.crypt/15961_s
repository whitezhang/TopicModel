 exactly what would that show, ?! the "law enforcement block" is easy to
 create, given the government key and any serial number.

 *if* it comes to trail about the wiretap.... ya, some safegaurd that is.
 what if they just harass people as a result, or learn things they shouldn't
 have learned, etc?

 the whole point of the escrow system is to prevent the fbi from making 
 illegal wiretaps. why not have the fbi holds the
 keys and that's it? why do we need the escrow system at all?
 
 unless a 3rd party (a judge) verifies that the requested serial number
 is "right", and the fbi can get any key they like at anytime, the escrow
 system is useless.
