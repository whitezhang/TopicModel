 is this "white house e-mail address" really working yet? someone
 posted such an address on compuserve a few months ago, but apparently
 the white house wasn't really set up to recive hundreds (thousands?)
 of messages a day to that account and didn't want people to use it
 yet. so is this mci address something the people at the white house
 actually read, or is it another craig shergold story? i don't know --
 i'm just asking.
 
 unless the people at the white house print and distribute this mail
 every day, you may have better luck printing out a letter (on paper,
 that flat white stuff all over my desk) and snail-mailing it to the
 white house. i imagine writing to your local representative and
 senator wouldn't hurt either. heck, why not write to al gore while
 you're at it?
