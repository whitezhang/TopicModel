 good idea, but why put all the eggs in one basket?
 
 given that the escrow keys are generated 200 at a time on floppy disks, why
 not keep them there rather than creating one huge database that will have to
 be guarded better than fort knox.
 
 give each floppy to a different bank for safekeeping. the usa has over 10,000
 banks and thrifts - there are not likely to be more than 2,000,000 clipper
 phones sold.
