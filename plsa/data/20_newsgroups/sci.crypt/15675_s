 for those of you looking for information on ms-dos 6.0's
 file system compression api:
 
 today i called microsoft's dos 6.0 hotline at (800)228-7007.
 they told me that the dos 6.0 resource kit had the specifications
 for the compression interface.  the resource kit costs $19.95,
 plus tax and $5 shipping.
 
 i ordered a copy and will post further when i get it and know more
 about it.  i am posting now because the order turnaround is 15 
 working days.  
 
 if anyone knows for sure where's there's a good
 source of info on this api, please speak up.  i am 
 slightly skeptical about the resource kit's likelihood
 of having detailed programming info.

 (posted also to sci.crypt, since the api could presumably also
 be used for file system encryption.)
