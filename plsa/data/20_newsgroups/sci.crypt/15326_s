 following precedent in other areas, the government is likely to put a tax on
 encryption technology.  once the tax is imposed, it becomes a federal matter
 and suspicision of an unlicensed cryptographic tool will bring the batf or
 fbi tossing grenades into your house.  (the batf appears to be the logical
 agency to enforce such regulations: federal control over alocohol, tobacco,
 and firearms is similary based on taxes.)
 
 look at the fcc: they won't allow sale of any receiever that can receive
 bands that are supposed to be private.  this has nothing to do with any
 desire to prevent harmful interference. if the government can make a radio
 receiver illegal what makes you think they won't claim the right to control
 encryption?
