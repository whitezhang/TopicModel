 this sounds an awful lot like a password-guesser, not a weakness in
 des.  merritt and i pointed out this weakness in kerberos in a paper
 that came out about 2.5 years ago, in both computer communications
 review and usenix.  for that matter, it was loudly discussed on the
 kerberos mailing list even earlier.
 
 the problem has nothing whatsoever to do with des, and everything to do
 with bad password selection.
 
 i'm perfectly willing to believe that there are cryptanalytic attacks
 possible on des.  i'm quite dubious that private research labs know
 them.  and the parameters of a brute-force attack are quite well
 established; see, for example, the garon and outerbridge paper in the
 july '91 cryptologia.  you're not going to do it in an hour with only
 ``rather powerful des hardware''.  i'll leave the arithmetic as an
 exercise for the reader.  on average, you'll need to do 2^55 trials.
 pick your own parameters for how fast the des engine runs, and for
 how many such engines are used.
