 	then they'll probably also want to start tracking the customer
 lists of people purchasing soundblaster and similar boards, which can
 be configured with the use of some code and a modem, to act as a pretty
 decent digital-encrypting telephone. it's expensive, though, and kind
 of awkward. i don't know any drug lords, but i'm sure they'd favor
 something tappable over something secure as long as the user interface
 is nice.
 
 	when you've got hrh prince of wales saying stupid things over
 cordless phones, it's not hard to imagine that drug dealers, child
 pornographers, commies, lisp programmers, and other threats to the
 civilized world might transact incriminating business over "encrypting"
 cellular phones.
