 as john gilmore has pointed out repeatedly, if you produce the
 infrastructure that would permit a police state to function, all that
 is required to suddenly find yourself living in one is a change of
 attitude on the part of the government.
 
 our constitution was built by men who had to risk their lives to
 ensure freedom in our country. they designed the system to make it
 difficult for tyranny to arise. for instance, one of the reasons the
 fourth amendment was put there was to make it harder for the
 government to try to make smuggling a crime. think i jest? john
 hancock made all his money smuggling rum, which is, after all, a drug.
 
 think about it. the government has everyones keys in escrow, and the
 fbi gets their pet "wiretap without leaving the office" scheme. there
 is a coup, which happens every day all around the world. within hours,
 everyone in the country who might oppose the tyrants is being
 monitored more closely than ever before possible.
 
 without the tools being in place, a tyranny cannot stand. with tools
 like this in place, a tyrannical dictatorship could actually be
 successfully imposed.
 
 why give the government tools with which to enslave you? maybe you can
 trust bill clinton, but are you willing to tell me that you can trust
 every government that will ever arise in the u.s. hereafter? i am not
 willing to make that leap of faith.

 i'm a political dissident. as such, i am acutely aware of what happens
 to political dissidents in most of the world. in most of the world, i
 could be killed for my beliefs. call amnesty international some time
 to find out what happens to dissidents in most of the world.
 
 all that seperates the u.s. from most of those places is a thin piece
 of parchment in the national archives thats being constantly more and
 more eroded by such farces as the war on drugs. coups have happened in
 countries that have had stable democracies for over a hundred years.
 governments throughout history have fallen. no government has lasted
 for more than a few hundred years. often, they are replaced by
 dictatorships. do you really believe so intensely that it could never
 ever ever happen here that you are willing to bet your own life and
 the lives of your children and other loved ones on it?
 
 if we construct the tools with which tyranny could be enforced, we
 make it orders of magnitude more likely that it could happen, because
 if it happened with the tools already in place it could actually
 stick. 
 
 naive fools such as our leadership believe they can protect us where
 hundreds that have gone before have failed. thriving democracies led
 by men far more skillfull than bill clinton have fallen to
 dictatorship. rome had a thriving republic run by exquisitely skilled
 men before they became a tyranny.
 
 i, for one, am unwilling to trust that it could never happen here.
 only hubris would allow us to believe we are immune to what has
 happened elsewhere.
