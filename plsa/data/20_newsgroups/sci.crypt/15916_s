 i may be misreading you here.  are you saying the american revolution 
 wasn't a good idea because it was bad odds?
 
 i kind of doubt that any revolution, armed or otherwise, was ever started 
 without vast amounts of failed "working within a system".  a good sign of 
 a system being not worth preserving would probably be that very inability 
 to work within it productively.
 
 hopefully i've misunderstood.  (btw, i'm not a big fan of arms myself.
