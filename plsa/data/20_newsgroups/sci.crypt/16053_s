         looking at it from up here in the frozen north, it looks like
         you could do worse than get the nra involved. they have a
         kindred problem, a large number of voters, the right attitude,
         and lots of funds.
 
         from an ethical _or_ constitutional viewpoint, i haven't seen
         a good argument for cryptographic rights that doesn't also
         support the nra position on guns (and vice-versa).
 
         cheers,
                 marc
