 this is an interesting point.  as a very coarse rule of thumb, you can
 figure that the final price of a product is 3 to 5 times the cost of goods.
 (the exact multiplier depends largely on economies of scale: products that
 sell tens of millions of units/year will be at the low end, those that sell
 thousands of units/year will be at the high end.  i suspect cellular phones
 are in the middle).  this implies that adding a $25 chip would increase the
 cost of the phone by approx $100, or about 25% - 30%.
 
 i don't think you'll get a lot of consumer support for this.
