 it is said that celp vocoders can run on the highest speed 486s with
 some room to spare -- they turn 64kbit (8 bit samples, 8k samples/sec)
 into 4800 baud. however, dsp is hairy, and i have yet to see actual
 proof of this in the form of an implementation. i have heard fairly
 reliable rumors to the effect that a famous internetworking guru has a
 celp implementation that runs on sparcstation 1+'s with some room to
 spare, but i have not succeeded thus far in getting my hands on a copy
 -- the guru in question has a reputation for not releasing code
 without having beaten on it for a very very long time first. 
 
 dsp experts are heavily encouraged to try their own hand at this
 problem.
