 thats one problem that has so far been overlooked. these two escrow
 agencies will have to create a secure database and service the
 input and output of keys. who pays for this? if they refuse an
 illegal request from some congressman to deliver a key can their
 budget by cut to punish them? will congress be forced to fund
 them forever?
 
 the problem is that laws can change. congress may pass a law setting
 up an escrow agency with instructions that keys are private. some
 future congress may change that law. suppose pre-nazi germany had
 a clipper system. do you think the escrow agencies would have
 told hitler that he could not have the keys without a valid 
 court order?
 
 in effect you must set up escrow agencies as a fourth branch of
 the goverment and isolate them from any outside interferance. 
 they will be able to directly tap into federal funds with no
 accountability to anyone except through a court challenge.
