 i seriously doubt that any practical implementation of this proposal would
 place the onus on the individual to register keys.  realistically, the
 clipper-chip will probably emit an id code which will serve as the identifier
 when requesting the key fragments.  the chip manufacturer would register
 this identifier code vs. key combination when the chip is made and the
 (uninitiated) end-user can therefore remain completely outside the loop.
 the chip could be used in a cellular phone, a modem, or other device --
 it really makes no difference:  when the authorities detect the use of this
 encryption standard during surveillance, they would then capture the id
 and apply for the key in order to decrypt the data.
