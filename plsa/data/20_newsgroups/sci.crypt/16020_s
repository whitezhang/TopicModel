          is it realistic for the government to try to keep the details
 of the encrytion algorithm secret if it intends to use evidence from
 wiretaps in court?  won't defense attorneys attempt to obtain the
 details of the method if the prosecution attempts to present evidence
 from wiretaps in court?  is it certain that such attempts will fail?
