 assume in this case the usual canard-adversary of narcotraficantes.  they
 probably have more cash than the kgb did, and they're probably more generous
 at handing it out.  it will be easier than ever to find or cultivate walkers
 and pollards for the keys, and it will be easy enough to find someone to
 reverse-engineer the chip (unless the tamper proofing is damned clever and
 effective).
