 and in other parts of the world, european "socialists" would be known as
 fascist capitalist pigs.  get your head out of your labels and think carefully
 for once:
 
 according to the eff announcement on this thing, the nsa has been developing
 this turkey for *four* years.  the manufacturing contract was let *14 months
 ago*.  anyone out there who believes that the fact that clinton's name was
 on this white house announcement means that bush or any other republican is
 a staunch supporter of personal privacy is a fool.
 
 if this topic disturbs you, can the political finger-pointing and talk about
 what you can do about it.  if you've just got to point fingers, remember that
 this scheme was started when a secret policeman was president.
