 apart from the storage and search requirements, because the evidence
 is inadmissible:  wiretaps require a warrant.  and as soon as one
 such case comes to light, all previous cases are likely to be discovered,
 and thrown out.  there was an article in the ny times a few months ago
 about how many convictions in the state might be invalidated because
 they relied on pen registers -- and the court of appeals ruled that
 pen registers were equivalent to wiretaps, and hence required warrants
 under new york law.
