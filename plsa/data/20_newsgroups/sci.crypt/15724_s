 sigh... my version of 'rn' asked me whether i really want to send this
 posting!
 
 you may as well know that all this stuff about the secret source of the
 clipper announcement is because of a silly mistake.  i am the administrator
 of csrc.ncsl.nist.gov, alias first.org.  it's a system set up to help out
 the needs of first, a forum of incident response and security teams, which 
 includes a number of world-wide incident response teams such as cert/cc and
 other places in europe.  as to the vrfy and expn commands, they are normally
 disabled, since early on we didn't want crackers to find out the names of
 incident response folks on our mailing lists.  we had a disk crash several
 months ago which required completely rebuilding the o/s files - same old
 story, our backups weren't especially helpful.  as you can guess, i didn't
 remember to re-disable vrfy and expn until i saw people on the net trying to
 find out who was behind clipper@csrc...  when i saw people's names posted
 here, i felt it was time to clear things up.  so, expn and vrfy on csrc have
 always been disabled in the past for reasons having nothing to do with 
 clipper.
 
 i posted the white house announcements at the request of policy folks here
 because csrc also provides usenet service.  i posted them from an account
 called 'clipper.'  i also created an alias called 'clipper' that contains
 the addresses of members of the nist computer security privacy and advisory
 board, set up under law of the computer security act of 1987, and addresses
 of other individuals not affiliated with nist but involved in cryptography,
 security, and privacy - i believe that these individuals were included on
 this list because nist felt it important to get them the clipper information
 first-hand.
 
 the 'clipper' alias is there for the benefit of those named above.  it is 
 not a source for information, it was set up solely to monitor any initial
 traffic.  individuals on the list have requested that they continue to get
 traffic that is not already duplicated on usenet.
 
 while you can rightfully say we were a bit disorganized in handling this,
 i would ask that people stop speculating about any hidden agendas or motives
 of the individuals on the 'clipper' alias - i've already apologized to them
 for what's happened.  disabling expn and vrfy is an increasingly common
 practice (albeit unfriendly to some), and any effect of disabling it again
 was unintentional.
