 er, excuse me but since the escrow agencies aren't yet chosen, how can you
 say they have a "history of untrustworthy behavoir[sic]"?
 
 i'm sure each of us can think of agencies without such a history. price
 waterhouse has kept the secret of the academy awards for many years, even in
 the face of an aggressive press. the federal reserve open market committee
 has successfully kept decisions from leaking for the statutory period until
 publication. even the department of agriculture has successfully kept crop
 forecasts from leaking prematurely.
 
 frankly, i'd trust the above (not the d of a, of course since they might be
 subject to political pressure) far sooner than the aclu, eff, or cpsr which,
 though not exactly government apologists, have no particular track record
 for internal security that i know of.
