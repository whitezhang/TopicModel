 these substances are normally not the secret, but how to get at them. the 
 method of preperation is normally patented, which means that no-one else can 
 make the chemical in the same way, without undergoing an agreement with 
 american cyanamid. (but i guess you knew what a patent is :-) )
 
 if you know what substance is used, you'll also know its toxicity.

 the luminol reaction has the disadvantage of not lasting as long as the 
 commercial version.
 
 remember that cyano compounds are found in nature, and not all are poisonous.
