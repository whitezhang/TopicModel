 we might get further if we begin by accepting that the government 
 really couldn't be bothered less about the political opinions of the 
 right wing pro establishment types. just about the only circumstances 
 in which i could think that they would be interested in their political 
 views would be to recruit them as spooks. they can be guaranteed to give
 the government line when it counts. in us history it has been the 
 socialists such as myself who have been persecuted. 
 
 
 now before people start asserting that there is no mechanism by which
 the administration can get their new chip adopted without legal force
 lets try thinking.
 
 in the first place the clipper chip must have existed for several years as
 a defense project. therefore this is not a party matter at all. george bush
 was in any case hardly adverse to tapping calls, he was chief spook 
 remember.
 
 secondly the govt can quite easily apply pressure. they simply "ask" their
 chums who they give huge defense contracts to (motorola etc) to be "nice"
 boys. after all bill is giving them a nice little trade monopoly since the
 chips won't be avaliable to foreign firms.
 
 thirdly the people who consider the democrats to be socialist are not the
 same as the ones who consider socialists to be communist. people might know
 this if the us education system did not suffer from the mcarthyite and 
 dewy version of political correctness - the sort with tribunals and show 
 trials. ever seen ed meese pissed? i have, it was when he said that socialism
 and communism were the same thing and brought the house down with laughter.
 it took several minutes before we realised that he was serious.
