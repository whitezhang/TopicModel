 well, isn't this just a hoot! :)  all i read on this group is a bunch
 of ppl fearing the misuses of information by the big bad evil govt.
 this just happens to be a case of an ordinary-joe-netter, who decided
 that he would create and/or distribute some misinformation.  ppl buy
 into bs posts like this (i know, because i forwarded a copy of the
 post to my office mate, who turned around and was (although he won't
 admit it...sorry joe!) ready to get in a fight about f-o-r-f-e-i-t-u-r-e!!!)
 please, if we're going to hold our govt (which admittedly has had and
 still has its problems) to high standards, then mustn't we follow these
 too?  electronic freedoms only go so far.
