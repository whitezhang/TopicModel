 they may collect the data, but making sense of it is another matter.
 
 on sci.crypt i'm a graduate cs major (with strong math background) and
 experienced programmer taking a cryptology course.  (<< keyword for
 alleged nsa filters).
 
 on sci.skeptic i'm an ex-physics major who's a new-age flake, talking
 about silly things like how a person's expectations colors what he
 sees.
 
 on talk.religion.newage i'm a physics geek who enjoys squashing
 interesting idea with wasp science, although i do write occasional
 posts showing a minimal knowledge of zen, mythology, etc.
 
 i could go on, but i'm sure you see my point.  i'm a single person,
 but i react differently on different groups (admittedly, in part
 because i'm a contrarian you always shouts "but, on the other hand...").
 on top of that, i _loath_ certainty and have taken public positions
 in the past for no reason other than to challenge "conventional wisdom".
 i wish them luck in figuring out who "i" am based on that information.
 
 (they can probably figure out i'm liberal, with a technical degree
 but humanistic interests, from a common thread throughout my posts.
 but that describes a fair portion of the users of internet).
