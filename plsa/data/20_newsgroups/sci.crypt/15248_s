   the story begins: when julius caesar sent messages to his trusted
   acquaintances, he didn't trust the messengers. so he replaced every a
   by a c, every b by a d, and so on through the alphabet. only someone
   who knew the ``shift by 2'' rule could decipher his messages.
 
   a cryptosystem or cipher system is a method of disguising messages so
   that only certain people can see through the disguise. cryptography is
   the art of creating and using cryptosystems. cryptanalysis is the art
   of breaking cryptosystems---seeing through the disguise even when
   you're not supposed to be able to. cryptology is the study of both
   cryptography and cryptanalysis.
 
   the original message is called a plaintext. the disguised message is
   called a ciphertext. encryption means any procedure to convert
   plaintext into ciphertext. decryption means any procedure to convert
   ciphertext into plaintext.
 
   a cryptosystem is usually a whole collection of algorithms. the
   algorithms are labelled; the labels are called keys. for instance,
   caesar probably used ``shift by n'' encryption for several different
   values of n. it's natural to say that n is the key here.
 
   the people who are supposed to be able to see through the disguise are
   called recipients. other people are enemies, opponents, interlopers,
   eavesdroppers, or third parties.
 
 * what references can i start with to learn cryptology?
 
   for an introduction to technical matter, the survey articles given
   in part 10 are the best place to begin as they are, in general,
   concise, authored by competent people, and well written. however,
   these articles are mostly concerned with cryptology as it has
   developed in the last 50 years or so, and are more abstract and
   mathematical than historical. the codebreakers by kahn [kah67] is
   encyclopedic in its history and technical detail of cryptology up
   to the mid-60's.
 
   introductory cryptanalysis can be learned from gaines [gai44] or
   sinkov [sin66]. this is recommended especially for people who want
   to devise their own encryption algorithms since it is a common
   mistake to try to make a system before knowing how to break one.
 
   the selection of an algorithm for the des drew the attention of
   many public researchers to problems in cryptology. consequently
   several textbooks and books to serve as texts have appeared. the
   book of denning [den82] gives a good introduction to a broad range
   of security including encryption algorithms, database security,
   access control, and formal models of security. similar comments
   apply to the books of price & davies [pri84] and pfleeger [pfl89].
 
   the books of konheim [kon81] and meyer & matyas [mey82] are quite
   technical books. both konheim and meyer were directly involved in
   the development of des, and both books give a thorough analysis of
   des. konheim's book is quite mathematical, with detailed analyses
   of many classical cryptosystems. meyer and matyas concentrate on
   modern cryptographic methods, especially pertaining to key management
   and the integration of security facilities into computer systems and
   networks.
 
   the books of rueppel [rue86] and koblitz [kob89] concentrate on
   the application of number theory and algebra to cryptography.
 
 * how does one go about cryptanalysis?
 
   classical cryptanalysis involves an interesting combination of
   analytical reasoning, application of mathematical tools, pattern
   finding, patience, determination, and luck. the best available
   textbooks on the subject are the military cryptanalytics series
   [frie1]. it is clear that proficiency in cryptanalysis is, for
   the most part, gained through the attempted solution of given
   systems. such experience is considered so valuable that some of the
   cryptanalyses performed during wwii by the allies are still
   classified.
 
   modern public-key cryptanalysis may consist of factoring an integer,
   or taking a discrete logarithm. these are not the traditional fare
   of the cryptanalyst. computational number theorists are some of the
   most successful cryptanalysts against public key systems.
 
 * what is a brute-force search and what is its cryptographic relevance?
 
   in a nutshell: if f(x) = y and you know y and can compute f, you can
   find x by trying every possible x. that's brute-force search.
 
   example: say a cryptanalyst has found a plaintext and a corresponding
   ciphertext, but doesn't know the key. he can simply try encrypting the
   plaintext using each possible key, until the ciphertext matches---or
   decrypting the ciphertext to match the plaintext, whichever is faster.
   every well-designed cryptosystem has such a large key space that this
   brute-force search is impractical.
     
   advances in technology sometimes change what is considered
   practical. for example, des, which has been in use for over 10 years
   now, has 2^56, or about 10^17, possible keys. a computation with
   this many operations was certainly unlikely for most users in the
   mid-70's. the situation is very different today given the dramatic
   decrease in cost per processor operation. massively parallel
   machines threaten the security of des against brute force search.
   some scenarios are described by garron and outerbridge [gar91].
 
   one phase of a more sophisticated cryptanalysis may involve a
   brute-force search of some manageably small space of possibilities.
 
 * what are some properties satisfied by every strong cryptosystem?
 
   the security of a strong system resides with the secrecy of the key
   rather than with an attempt to keep the algorithm itself secret.
 
   a strong cryptosystem has a large keyspace, as mentioned above.  the
   unicity distance is a measure which gives the minimum amount of
   ciphertext that must be intercepted to uniquely identify the key and
   if for some key, the unicity distance is much longer than the amount
   of ciphertext you intend to encrypt under that key, the system is
   probably strong.
 
   a strong cryptosystem will certainly produce ciphertext which appears
   random to all standard statistical tests (see, for example, [cae90]).
     
   a strong cryptosystem will resist all known previous attacks. a
   system which has never been subjected to scrutiny is suspect.
 
   if a system passes all the tests mentioned above, is it necessarily
   strong? certainly not. many weak cryptosystems looked good at first.
   however, sometimes it is possible to show that a cryptosystem is
   strong by mathematical proof. ``if joe can break this system, then
   he can also solve the well-known difficult problem of factoring
   integers.'' see part 6.  failing that, it's a crap shoot.
 
 * if a cryptosystem is theoretically unbreakable, then is it
   guaranteed analysis-proof in practice?
 
   cryptanalytic methods include what is known as ``practical
   cryptanalysis'': the enemy doesn't have to just stare at your
   ciphertext until he figures out the plaintext. for instance, he might
   assume ``cribs''---stretches of probable plaintext. if the crib is
   correct then he might be able to deduce the key and then decipher the
   rest of the message. or he might exploit ``isologs''---the same
   plaintext enciphered in several cryptosystems or several keys. thus
   he might obtain solutions even when cryptanalytic theory says he
   doesn't have a chance.
 
   sometimes, cryptosystems malfunction or are misused. the one-time pad,
   for example, loses all security if it is used more than once! even
   chosen-plaintext attacks, where the enemy somehow feeds plaintext into
   the encryptor until he can deduce the key, have been employed. see
   [kah67].
   
 * why are many people still using cryptosystems that are
   relatively easy to break?
 
   some don't know any better. often amateurs think they can design
   secure systems, and are not aware of what an expert cryptanalyst
   could do. and sometimes there is insufficient motivation for anybody
   to invest the work needed to crack a system.
