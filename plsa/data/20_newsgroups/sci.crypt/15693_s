 gee. say they feed the 80-bit key through snefru-8 and take the first 60
 bits of the result, then use those 60 bits as the real key. how do you
 figure out that each key is one of 2^20 ``equal'' keys? you can try a
 birthday attack, but if the key can be changed only once a second then
 you will need several lifetimes to get reliable statistics. somehow i
 don't think you could catch the nsa at this sort of skulduggery.
