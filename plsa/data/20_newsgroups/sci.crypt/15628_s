     of course, nothing prevents you from buying a new lock with cash
 and installing it yourself. even modifying the core to match some
 arbitrary key is not difficult to do at home. i once knew someone who
 had fixed his locks in this way - his house, office and cars all took
 the same key (which he took good care of :-)

     very bad (yours, that is). have you ever had a safety deposit box?
 they work on a two-key system. the bank clerk has one, and you have
 the other (they are different keys). the bank does not keep a copy of
 your key. if you lose it, they have to drill out the lock, and replace
 the door. this is a time consuming and expensive process (which they
 will be happy to charge to your account :-).
 
      this process is exactly analogous to having a private key which
 is not in a escrow system, and the state having to crack your cipher
 to get the data.
 
      please do not use false analogies.
