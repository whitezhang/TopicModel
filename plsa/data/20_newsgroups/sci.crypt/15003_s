    better yet, instead of thrashing around on the dos file system, take
 it a step further.  write yourself a minimal "file system" program that
 is used to create/delete files, en/decrypt them to ramdisk, list a
 directory. put the util, password protected, on a floppy.
 
    the catch is that the storage space used by this util is not part
 of the dos file system.  instead, defrag your disk, thus packing all
 allocated clusters into clusters 0-n.  then use the back end of the
 partition to hold your 'stealth' file system.  or, leave a small 2nd
 partition on the disk that is not assigned to dos.  another approach
 might be to use a directory that contains a set of invariant files (dos
 system files, for instance).  due to dos allocating a minimum storage 
 unit of a "cluster" there is unused physical space on the disk between
 the tail end of each file and the end of its associated cluster. these
 dead spaces could be concatenated and used to hold your stealth file
 system.
 
    now you have a situation where no encrypted data "appears" on your
 disk at all :-).
