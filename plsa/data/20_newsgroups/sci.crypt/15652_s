 it might be nice to:
 
 1. cut out the ad hominem attacks on prof. denning, mr. sternlight,
 etc.  if you have something objective to say about their views, go
 ahead and say it (subject to point 2.).  personal attacks reflect more
 on the attacker more than on the attackee.  throw light, not heat!
 
 2. restrict the discussion to appropriate newsgroups. i submit that
 comp.org.acm and comp.org.ieee are not appropriate for this
 discussion.  you have now made subscribers to these newsgroups aware of
 the issue.  if they want to know more or participate in the discussion,
 they can easily join sci.crypt, comp.security.misc, alt.security, or
 comp.org.eff.talk.
