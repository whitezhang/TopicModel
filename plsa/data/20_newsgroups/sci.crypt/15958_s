 david,
 
   while i disagree strongly with you on the issue of our trusting the government,
 i think you have a good idea here. there is danger that, with funding coming
 from asset forfeitures, the government could continue to promulgate a bad
 product in spite of poor acceptance. making the product pay its way (as
 it must for private ventures) would be a good incentive for quality and
 listening to we, the ranters. :)
