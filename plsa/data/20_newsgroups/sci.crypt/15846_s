 there is one point i'd like to make, that most people seem to have forgotten.
 that is that one of the underlining principles in the constitution is a distrust
 of governmental authority and control. all those "checks & balances" is because
 they realize that you should distrust those in power. what everyone seems to have
 forgotten as well is the original reason that the bill of rights guaranteed the
 right to bear arms. it's inclusion was not to allow you to protect yourself
 against other citizens, but to prevent the government from taking away your only
 means of protecting yourself from an armed and aggressive government. its hard to
 oppress your citizenry when its armed against you.
 
 i am not a fanatic, i'm a retired naval officer. because i have spent so much
 time defending it, perhaps i understand its "purpose" as well as its "plan".
