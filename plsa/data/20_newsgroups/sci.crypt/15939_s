 i think everyone would just as soon work within the system.  the presence
 of the possibility of using the bullet box instead of the ballot box
 is supposed to be a deterrent - by keeping the price of massive abuse
 unacceptable.  however, governments being what they are, sure would
 like to remove that deterrence, which will make the need for armed
 citizens all the more great (you don't need 'em till you don't have 'em).
 then i think we can be more accurately called 'subjects' instead of
 'citizens'.  the idea of the people being sovereign over the government
 is sure not in vogue in the beltway these days, that is for sure...
 the administration is saying "we know best.  we will tell you what
 you need, or don't need..."  "after, that old-fashioned anachronism
 called the bill of rights is not needed in these 'enlightened times'...

 not if the government has its way:  there are eight bills before congress
 that will either ban, tax exhorbitantly, or register all useful weapons
 in the hands of the unconnected us subject.   can you say $200.00 just
 for a box of cartridges for practice?  one of the current administrations
 top priority items is to disarm all who are not well-connected, or that
 work for the government.

 another tactic is to toss out so many outrages at once that nobody can
 give justice to them all.  like is being done right now.
