 	this is a real address. my understanding of the current process
 that mail takes is it gets downloaded on floppy disk and is processed
 by retiree volunteers, who match the message against message profiles
 and check the message count. (i.e.: "yeah, that's a for gays in the
 military. what's this clipper stuff? must be against gays in the
 military...")
 
 	the higher-volume white-house email stuff is in the works,
 i know for a fact, but won't be online for probably another month
 or two at the soonest. my understanding is that the link speed will
 increase (direct internet instead of compu$erve to floppy) but the
 message processing will remain the same.

 	the white house email does get read. i agree that printing it
 and sending cc: to everyone you can think of is probably better because
 it is more visible, but the message processing (fitting messages against
 a template) is the same in either case.
