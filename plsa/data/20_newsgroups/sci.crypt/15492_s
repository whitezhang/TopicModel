  so in a few years there could be millions of these chips in the usa, all
 networked together? sounds like a good science fiction story - the government
 wants to crack foreign des (or whatever) messages, so they con the public into
 individually buying all of the components and installing them. soon the us
 could be covered by the largest parallel computer in the world, built on top of
 our current phone net.
