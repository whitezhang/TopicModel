 the description of the chip's operation evidently leaves out some of the
 key management aspects.  either the k_p is the secret key corresponding
 to a public key which is broadcast at message initiation, or it is the
 result of a diffie-hellman key exchange or something similar.  either
 way there must be some protocols beyond those described here.  it isn't
 clear whether they are implemented in the clipper wiretap chip or must
 be provided by other system components.
