 i suggest that you refrain from such insults unless and until you can
 produce some evidence to back up that claim.  given the measures proposed
 or passed in the last year or so, such as s.266 and the scanner ban,
 her proposal need not be any more than her own attempt at a technical
 solution.  it's entirely possible, in fact, that it was the notion of
 splitting the key, which came up in the debate, that softened this proposal.
