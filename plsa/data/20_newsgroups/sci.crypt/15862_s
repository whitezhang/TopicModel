 well, after a lot of trawling through archives, i found the post
 i reproduce in full below.  is it time to get together to develop
 a tcp/ip standard for crypto voice that we could then layer on
 point-to-point slip as *the* free standard for crypto voice like
 pgp is for mail?
 
 (ps note the date of this post.  appropriate, huh? :-) )

 in case you'd like to experiment with celp, you can obtain a software
 implementation of the 4800 bps fed std celp coder for free:
 
 the u.s. dod's federal-standard-1016 based 4800 bps code excited linear
 prediction voice coder version 3.2 (celp 3.2) fortran and c simulation source
 codes are now available for worldwide distribution at no charge (on dos
 diskettes, but configured to compile on sun sparc stations) from:
 
 bob fenichel
 national communications system
 washington, d.c.  20305
 1-703-692-2124
 1-703-746-4960 (fax)
 
 in addition to the source codes, example input and processed speech files
 are included along with a technical information bulletin to assist in
 implementation of fs-1016 celp.  (an anonymous ftp site is being considered
 for future releases.)
 
 copies of the actual standard "federal standard 1016, telecommunications:
 analog to digital conversion of radio voice by 4,800 bit/second code
 excited linear prediction (celp)" are available for $2.50 each from:

 the following articles describe the federal-standard-1016 4.8-kbps celp
 coder (it's unnecessary to read more than one):
