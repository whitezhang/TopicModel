 i can see high-voltage type display devices being vulnerable (crts,
 plasma displays, etc.)  but jason beat me to this question.  what
 about em radiation from low-voltage items like lcd displays?
 
 perhaps the critical element is the driver circuitry?  the cabling?
 what about a portable pc/mac/etc., where all the "noise" is bunched
 into one tiny area?
