     lets carry this one step further. suppose the text of the key is
 in itself conclusive evidence of the same crime for which the
 encrypted material is further evidence. i find myself envisaging a
 scenario like this:
 
 you have made some scans of peanuts strips. you encrypt them. the key
 is a phrase.
 
 the comic police haul you in. they seize your system. they find the
 encrypted file.
 
 cp:    "whats that file?"
 
 you:   "i take the fifth."
 
 cp:    "what's the keyphrase to that file?" 
 
 you:   "i take the fifth."
 
 judge: "you have to reveal the keyphrase" [i disagree, but i'm not a judge.]
 
 you:   "your honor, revealing the keyphrase, in it's own right, would 
 	tend to incriminate me of breaking laws, independent of what 
 	may or may not be in the encrypted file."  
 
 judge: "i grant you immunity from whatever may be learned from the key
 	itself"
 
 you:    "the keyphrase is: "i confess to deliberately evading copyright; 
 	the file encoded with this keyphrase contains illegal scans of 
         copyrighted peanuts strips.""
 
 judge and cp: "oh."
 
      how will they get you now? i'm not saying that they won't, or
 can't (or even that they shouldn't :-), but what legal mechanism will
 they use? should we be crossposting this to misc.legal?
