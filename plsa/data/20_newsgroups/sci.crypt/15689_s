 pgp is not available on the archive site rsa.com.  if it were, it
 would be highly amusing, since rsa.com (actually public key partners,
 but it's the same entity) is the organization holding the patents
 which they claim are violated if you actually "make, use or sell" pgp.
 i believe those patents also apply in canada, but i'm not a patent
 lawyer or anything.
 
 there is no such thing as freely redistributable code for rsa which
 can be used in north america without legal entanglements.  you may
 wish to consider rsaref, however, which *is* available from the ftp
 site rsa.com in /rsaref but probably doesn't meet your definition of
 "freely redistributable" (it's readily available in source, in c, and
 does rsa, md5, etc. and comes with a license allowing noncommercial
 use.  like any other strong crypto software, it's not exportable
 legally.  it can be modified with permission from rsadsi, which a
 number of people have received in the past.)  for reasons that aren't
 entirely clear to me, rsa says that only u.s. people should take
 rsaref from its server, although there aren't itar issues regarding
 canada.  the ripem distribution site (ripem.msu.edu) has rsaref in its
 distribution, and is ok for canadians.
