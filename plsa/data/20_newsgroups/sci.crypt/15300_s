 what they would need to do, though, is make sure that nobody has
 access to decent crypto in the first place.  they probably can't
 tell clippered voice from clippered triple-desed voice until they
 get their copy of your key.  any criminal who's going to use
 encryption will do it under cover of clipper.  the only way to avoid
 this will be to try to prohibit strong encryption.
 
 i probably shouldn't say this, but they could try to detect the use
 of an illegal cypher by transmitting in the clear some statistical
 properties of the plaintext.  an old-fashioned wiretap could then
 detect the use of pre-encryption, which would drastically increase
 the measured entropy of the input.  a countermeasure to this would
 be to use steganographic techniques which put out voice.
 
 you can tell if the nsa built this feature in: blow on the mike, and
 observe whether a band of thugs comes through your ceiling.
