 even more interesting: the smtp server at csrc.ncsl.nist.gov no longer
 recognizes the 'expn' and 'vrfy' commands...
 
    telnet csrc.ncsl.nist.gov smtp
    trying 129.6.54.11...
    connected to csrc.ncsl.nist.gov.
    escape character is '^]'.
    220 first.org sendmail 4.1/nist ready at tue, 20 apr 93 17:01:34 edt
    expn clipper
    500 command unrecognized
