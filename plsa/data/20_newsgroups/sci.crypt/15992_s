      why don't we move down even further toward the masses by setting this
 up on an ibm pc clone(probably needs to be a 386 or a 486) with a 
 sound blaster and a v.32bis modem.  those components are very widely
 available.  i don't know if the pc has enough horsepower to encrypt the data
 at realtime, but the sound blaster has 4 to 1 hardware compression and will
 work at any sampling rate from 4khz to 23 khz.
