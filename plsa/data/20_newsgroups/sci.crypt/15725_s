 reasonably fancy.
 
 standard "voice" circuits run at 56kbps inter-exchange in the us.
 therefore, you need to achieve 4:1 to get standard voice quality.
 
 if you're willing to give up some quality, you need only 2:1.  this is still
 acceptable from a speech standpoint; it will be a little less faithful to
 the original, but certainly intelligable.  that's all you really need for
 this application.
