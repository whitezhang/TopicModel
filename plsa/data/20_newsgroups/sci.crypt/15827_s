 i seem to recall rush saying that he has a compuserve account.  if anyone
 wants to e-mail him, all we need is his account number (i.e.: 12345,6789)
 and then we could e-mail him via gateway by using a dot instead of a comma
 like so: "12345.6789@compuserve.com".  (this is *not* his address.)
 
 so, does anyone know his e-mail address?  he *says* he uses it all the time.
 (i wonder if he reads alt.fan.rush-limbaugh...   his ego is big enough!)
