        the classic comment on new encryption algorithms comes from
 friedman:
 
 	"no new cypher is worth considering unless it comes 
 	from someone who has already broken a very hard one."
 
 historically, friedman has been right.  it's really hard to develop
 a good cypher.  ibm's lucifer, the precursor to des, turns out to have
 been fatally flawed.  most of the des-like systems other than des seem
 to be vulnerable to differential cryptanalysis.  the first two tries at
 public key encryption (remember knapsack cyphers?) were broken.  most
 if not all of the machine cyphers of the electromechanical era were
 broken eventually.  attempts in the computer era to home-brew encryption
 have been disappointing; the classic "a survey of data insecurity packages"
 in cryptologia contains analyses and breaking techniques for a few of the
 popular "security packages" of the late 1980s.
 
         a new, proprietary algorithm?  no way.
 
         if the us is permitting general export of this thing, it has
 to be weak; that's how the current regulations work.  currently there's
 a willingness to allow systems with short keys (32 bits appears to be
 no problem; the 56 bits of des are too many) or weak algorithms
 (i think word perfect qualifies under that rule) to be exported.
 i can't believe these guys shepherded their technique through the 
 pto and the state department's arms control division without finding that out.

 p.s. no, i'm not thrilled with clipper either, but that's a different issue.
