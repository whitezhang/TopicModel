 key to allow public key system encrypted postings. in theory that will work
 fine as long as the privae key remains secure.
 
 in practice it would be a good idea to check to see if that would be a
 violation of some net rule, practice, custom, etc. i don't say it would be,
 just that it would be a good idea to check. this is not like rot13 where
 everybody can have the key trivially.
 
 it would also be a good idea to check to see if such posts would be
 forwarded by the sites needed to make the chain work.
 
 of course there'd be no problem with a discussion group travelling over
 facilities entirely under the control of the members. probably there would
 also be no problem with a mailing list approach. it might even  be fun for
 some.
