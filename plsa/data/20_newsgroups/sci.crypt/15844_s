 he'll slam clinton for anything at all on the air.  i just do not
 understand why he remains so popular.  he'll take a piece of video of
 clinton walking along; find a frame in which clinton wrinkles his
 nose, say; freeze on it and blow it up full screen; and then rant for
 five minutes on how no one could possibly trust someone with such a
 face and such beady greedy little eyes.  i've seen this on his tv show
 (it was around the time of the inauguration).  can anyone call this
 stuff legitimate (i hate to say "informed") commentary?  how can
 anyone with half a brain in his or her head[1] continue to watch
 it[2]?
 
 the american tv-watching (and i guess radio-listening) public never
 ceases to amaze me.

 [1] oops, have i just inadvertently answered my own question?
 
 [2] i myself only see it when i run across it every couple months when
     channel-surfing late at night; the longest i've been able to stand
     him was about 10 minutes.
 
 (apologies for stripping the alt.fan.rush groups from the newsgroups
 line; the software here apparently rejects anything with groups we
 don't carry, and we don't carry those.  also i removed sci.crypt from
 followups.)
