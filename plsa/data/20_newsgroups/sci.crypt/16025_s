 	   a 'multi-line cleartext bridge?"
 			 ^^^^^^^^^
 	   and just were would you put that bridge?  if it isn't at one of
    the receiptants location, forget encryption at all.  you have blown any
    security you thought you might have had. 
 
 most of the people using encrypted conference bridges these days are
 military (or equivalent, like cia and other embassy personnel),
 so putting bridges on the recipient's location is normal -
 it's in a vault on a military base or ft. meade, and the
 secure phones are in sound-proof rooms with big locks on the doors
 because they're talking about classified stuff (or golf with other generals.)
 
 that paradigm will change as we start using encrypted phones in our
 offices or homes to carry on normal conversations about dinner plans
 and stock purchases and meeting schedules and technical info
 and the good batch of illegal frop that we got last weekend from bob;
 most people don't use sound-proof vaults, and may use bridges in their
 pbx or from the local phone company (3-way calls) or long distance
 or value-added phone company (e.g. alliance conference bridges).
 
 if clipjack is mainly used for the radio portion of cellular phones,
 the conferencing aspects don't change.  but there may be a market niche for
 trusted conference-bridge providers, though i suppose the inquisitors
 would try to get a blanket wiretap authorization for many bridges,
 just in case a bad guy might use the service.
