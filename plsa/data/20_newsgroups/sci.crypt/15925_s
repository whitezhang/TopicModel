 i posted an informational request about any electronically available
 articles on cryptographic algorithms a couple of days ago.  as i
 mentioned, i was interested, in particular, in des and public-key --
 but also wouldn't mind learning about others.  as i said, i can read
 an intro-graduate level text book, having had some mathematics, though
 not much number-theory per se.  i'd like to see the technical details
 of the mathematics of cryptography, as oppossed to the popularizations
 of things like _scientific am_ which just say, "then you find a
 *really* big prime number....".
 
 following my request, several people were so kind as to suggest
 reading-lists, which i hope to get around to.  two other people were
 so *very* kind as to send large documents, which i presume were actual
 articles (about 1000 lines each); but i've stupidly deleted them
 accidentally before having a chance even to skim them.  if they can
 forgive me for my careless use of file-commands, would the original
 senders be so kind as to resend? or anyone else who has good
 crypto-articles at a fairly technical mathematical level? also,
 ftp-able or gopher-able docs would be nice to know about.
 
 yours, lulu...
