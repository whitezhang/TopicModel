 with the following logical consequences
 	(a) using any code designed to obscure informatio which is 
 	    not easily breakable will be illegal, including
 		(i) using code words such as ``project p5''
 		(ii) speaking a language other than english
 		(iii) ever refering implicitly to events not known to
 			everyone, eg
 			"hi john. how was last night?"
 		      for all the listener knows, this may be a code for
 			"did you pick up the drugs ok last night?"
 		      of be a code for
 		        "ok. we blow up the pentagon at midnight."
 		(iv) mentioning anything that could not be perfectly
 		     understood by an average person with no education.
 		(v) words with more than one syllable.
 		(vi) speaking with a heavy accent that could bemisunderstood
 		     by people not used to it.
 		(vii) books with an "inner meaning"...such
 		      as "animal farm".

 yes.

 i have a wonderful encrypter you can borrow that converts a message
 eg "meet me at 11:30 to bomb the white house. bring some dynamite"
 to an apparently (relatively) innoculous message. this message
 here is an example of the output for the above message :-).
 
 >it's shocking and frightening to see that this is actually happening here.
 
 it is shockiong that it could happen anywhere.
 it is shocking that it could happen in a country 
 that has the arrogance to call itself free.
 
 what you can do:
 	(1) write to your congress person in plain text.
 	(2) write to your congress person in encrypted text.
 		(decrypter optional)
 	(3) send some random keystroked to your congressperson
 	(4) send some random keystrokes accross the us boundaries,
 		and keep the spooks busy trying to decode it.
 	(5) write your own encryption algorithms.
 	(6) don't buy clipper products.
 
 p.s. i can't work out why the us government doesn't want to sell
 them overseas. after all, they are rather easy for us interests to decode,
 so make a perfect tool for industrial/military espionage...lulling 
 anyone stupid enough to buy it into a false sense of security. you will
 notice that there is no mention anywhere about safety for non-americans.
 
 disclaimer: my opinions are mine alone, and do not represent anyone elses.
 i have nothing that i particularly want to hide at the moment...though i 
 consider the right
 to be able to use whatever method of coding data i like to be high on my
 list of priorities.
