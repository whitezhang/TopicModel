 the stragegy of the government is interesting.  the real fear comes from
 them doing more than this.
 
 this is a voluntary program, and thus harder for us to object to on
 the surface.
 
 their strategy is a business one rather than legal one.  they are
 pushing to get a standard in place, a secret standard, and if they
 get it as a standard then they will drive competitors out of the market.
 it will be legal to sell better, untapable encryption that doesn't have
 registered keys, but it will be difficult, and thus not a plan for
 most phone companies.
 
 you see, with clipper chip phones you'll be able to talk to any
 cellular company, or other phones or ports because they will follow
 the standard.  at&t has already announced a clipper chip encryption
 product.  the government has marketed hard to get major vendors to
 use these chips.   if they get enough market share, they will rule.
 
 and thus there will be very little market for systems that can't be
 tapped by the police.  the public isn't that concerned about it now,
 after all.  they freely do calls that anybody with an old tv can listen
 to today!  they won't pay big extra bucks for proprietary phones that secure
 them only from the police.
 
 well, some people will buy these phones, but they will only work with
 other proprietary phones, so the market will be small and the phones
 expensive.  unless they are made in numbers large enough to sell them
 cheap, only the mob will buy them.
 
 and this means that the fbi will want to track the customer lists of
 better encryption phones, because "the only reason a person would want
 one is to evade the police."
 
 interesting.
