 :i tried this code yesterday.  on my sparcstation elc it takes over

 ouch!  thanks for trying it.
 
 :i question whether celp is the best approach for this application.  it produces
 :great compression but at the expense of tremendous cpu loads.  we want
 :something that can be run on ordinary workstations or even high-end pc's
 :without dsp cards.  my guess is that some other algorithm is going to be

 yes.  i'm not sure if my xposting to comp.speech made it to here too, but
 i've found that a low sample rate (3300 samples/sec at 8 bits per sample)
 plus the pd 'shorten' lossless sound compression code actually does get
 speech into 14.4k with a simdgen left over.  this is *definitely* worth
 working on, folks.  and shorten works in well under real-time.
