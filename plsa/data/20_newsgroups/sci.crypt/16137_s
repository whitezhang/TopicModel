 evil and good walk hand in hand.  it is also important to note that
 the good in the tools lies in the wielder of the tools.

 i cannot accept this ridiculous leap in logic.  technology is neutral
 to good or evil.  when technology is used by "evil" men, it is called
 evil technology.  when it is used by "good" men, it is called good
 technology.  really, it is just technology that allows action to be
 realized more efficently and on a larger scale.

 try not to confused the development of technology with its use.
 certainly, "bright" people will be better at creating technology, but
 even young children know how to program vcr machines.  are vcr
 machines not extremely complex to create?

 adaptibility and flexibility is always better at enduring than the
 stiff and stubborn.  a young child is soft and supple; an old man is
 stiff and inflexible.  a dripping of water can cut through stone.
 this has nothing to do with technology, rather technology just
 allows us to magnify action.
