 maybe so, but it's quite common. there are millions of macintosh users who
 have no idea what's in apple's patented roms. many have modems connected.
 how do you know all your business secrets aren't being stolen? answer:
 1. because you trust apple;
 2. because if any such attempt, however sophicsticated, came out, it would
 destroy apple's credibility forever.
 
 in the clipper case, a representative body of experts is going to be allowed
 to audit it, and we'll have assurances (maybe even from the president) that
 other than the escrowed keys there are no back doors. while some may not
 have confidence in that (i am not among them), it's a lot more assurance
 than we get for many things we routinely trust in everyday life.
