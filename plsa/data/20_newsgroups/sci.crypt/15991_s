 
 i want to add link encryption to a module that multiplexes upper
 level routines into a single data link. the upper levels won't know
 about this, and thus key exchange shall only need to occur once (at
 the initial link establishment). i figure that i can do this with
 des and a diffie-hellman key exchange.
 
 is using a diffie-hellman exchange to establish a 64 bit des key
 acceptable, in other words, what are the pro's and con's of such a 
 setup? are there any important issues to watch out for (aside from
 filtering out unacceptable keys)?
 
 and in order to achieve this, i guess i will need to use 64bit math
 routines (for probable prime number calculation, exponentiation etc),
 so could someone point me towards a good package (this is strictly
 non-commercial).
