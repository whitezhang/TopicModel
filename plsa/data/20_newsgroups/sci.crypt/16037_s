 i have, my thesis was on sun tzu.
 
 more to the point:
 
 those who are called the good militarists of old, could make opponents
 lost contact between front and back lines, lose reliability between
 large and small groups, lose mutual concern for the welfare of the
 different social classes among them, lose mutual accomodation between
 the rulers and the ruled, lose enlistments among the soldiers, lose
 coherence within the armies.  they went into action when it was
 advantageous, stopped when it was not.
 
 today it is.  sitting on your hands will get you nowhere in this battle.
