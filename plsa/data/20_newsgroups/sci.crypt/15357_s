   and in russia, capitalists were persecuted for trading goods on the
 black market. and in the us, capitalist minded types are imprisoned and killed
 for things such as selling drugs, guns, pornography, and other victimless
 activities.  it doesn't matter whether you are socialist or capitalist,
 power and control are central to government. since citizens can't be trusted to
 run their own affairs, the government must watch them.  (for their
 own good of course. i mean, with strong cryptography, citizens might <gasp!>
 start to hide things from the irs, sell drugs/guns/pornography, and
 that cannot be allowed!)

   not very surprising to anyone who believes in "hands off" government. if
 you believe that your private life (both social and financial) are none of
 anyone else's business, the difference between socialism and communism is
 like the difference between murder by lethal injection or by
 chainsaw. the more centralized the economy is, the more potential
 abuses for accumulation of information on individuals. if you think
 credit companies are bad, ...  well, i'm sure a democratic socialist society
 would vote for absolute privacy of all citizens -- not!
