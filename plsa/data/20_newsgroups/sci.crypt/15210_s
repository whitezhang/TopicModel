 i somehow started to doubt technical competence of the
 people who designed the system.  why on the earth split the
 80-bit key in 40-bit parts to keep them in escrow separately
 (having 40 bit and large volumes of data voice links produce
 it should be relatively easy to break it) when they simply
 could keep 80-bit sequences in n (n>=2) independent places
 and then xor all the partial keys to get the actual key (n-1
 sequences should obviously be selected randomly and nth is the
 actual key xor-ed with the random sequences).
 
 (or is it a conspiracy? 1/2 :-)
