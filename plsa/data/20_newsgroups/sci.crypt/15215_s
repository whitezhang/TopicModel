 as of yet, there has been no description of the general principles
 behind the clipper proposal. for example, is this a public key system
 or a private key system? if the latter, then i don't see how the
 system could work (given that the keys are tied to the device and
 not the person).
 
 further, the escrowed 80-bit keys are split into two 40-bit chunks.
 i would guess that the availability of one of these 40-bit chunks
 and a reasonable key-search machine, would allow you to read the traffic.
 i'm not suggesting that this is a deliberate weakness of the system,
 but it does make you think. of course, this is easily fixable by 
 giving out two 80-bit chunks which could be x-ored to generate the 
 real 80-bit key.
