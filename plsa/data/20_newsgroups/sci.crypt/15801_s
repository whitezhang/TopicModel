 i was annoyed to find that this guy posted my private e-mail response to
 him, but since i believe what i said, i'll defend it anyway.

 by "almost" i mean the differential cryptanalysis attack.  the chosen
 plaintext attack requires a detailed analysis of about 2^36 chosen plaintexts
 drawn from a total of about 2^47 that need to be run, if i understand the
 situation correctly.  this is certainly a "break" under the meaning of the
 act, but does not constitute much less work than the brute force keysearch.
 
 the rest of his article assumes that we can figure out the skipjack
 encryption algorithm e by choosing the correct data to send through it and
 observe the results.  i wish him joy of it, and choose not to try that attack.
 
 i am not defending the system, and in fact am offended by the ideas of
 escrowed keys or a secret algorithm becoming a de facto industry standard.
 however, i also object to opposing it for the wrong reasons, since that
 weakens the case against it.

 no, it's quite different.  the government would have no percentage in
 choosing f to be a weak key, since it's not to their advantage to have
 anybody else know it.  the "experts" could thus assume that f is no worse
 than anything else during their analysis.  totally different situation
 from unknown s-boxes.  again, i'm not saying it would be good or
 satisfactory for the experts to just be given the raw algorithm without
 the rest of the surrounding details regarding the chip and protocols and
 so on -- simply that i doubt that they <would> be given all the
 information.
