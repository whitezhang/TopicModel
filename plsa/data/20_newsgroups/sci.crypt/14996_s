 my speculation does not include or depend upon a trapdoor in rsaref. i
 do not believe that rsa would consent to such.  
 
 however, there are other limitation in the concept of rsaref in which
 nsa has an interest.  it has an interest in a limited number of
 implementations, i.e., targets.  it has an interest in fixed key or
 maximum modulus size.  
 
 it has a legitimate (literally) right to pursue such interests.  within
 bounds, it probably has a right to pursue those interests by covert
 means.  at least it has the same right as the rest of us not to disclose
 all of its motives and intentions.  (institutions are not self-aware;
 they do not know their intentions in any meaningful sense.)
