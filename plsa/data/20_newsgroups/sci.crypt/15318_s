 it seems to me that all discussions about clipper security are almost 
 irrelevant - if i cannot choose the key, but have to use a key chosen for
 me by the foundry, the security of the whole universe of users is as good
 (or as bad) as the security of vlsi technologies inc.
 
 it is a trivial effort to run any ciphertext agains all the keys ever 
 manufactured - after all we are talking about 1 to 100 million keys that
 will ever be manufactured. the key depositories can be as secure and
 incorruptible as they wish to be, nobody cares anyway...:-(
 
 now if someone would convince me that the shipping docks of vti, att and
 others are impenetrable (remember: the chips have to ship with the key - 
 you or the dealer are going to submit it to the authorities eventually)
 i'd be a bit happier. but do we really believe that the various governments
 (including ours) won't have the full lists of all the keys ever manufactured?
 
 did i miss something here?
 
 my own opinions, quite obviously...
