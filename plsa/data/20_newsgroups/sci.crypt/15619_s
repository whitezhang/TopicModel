 i don't have ftp and i live in canada ( this means that it would be 
 illeagle for a u.s. citizen to send the program to me. their gigerment 
 wishes to restrict its dispersil ) but someone in europe must have ported 
 a coppy of rsa to the atarist by now.  how do i get a coppy of the rsa 
 from a non-ftp news feed?
