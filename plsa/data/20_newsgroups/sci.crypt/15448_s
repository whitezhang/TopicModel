 
 another objection occurred to me.  there was a comment about how
 supposedly there would only be one decode box, operated by the fbi.
 this is flat ridiculous, and i don't believe it for a millisecond.
 even *if* they in fact only build one (or two or some other small
 number) of these, that won't stop others from building one.  make
 it work like two clipper-chip phones, one listening to each side
 of the recorded conversation.  i'll have to have another look at
 the specs posted so far, but offhand i didn't see anything that
 would preclude this sort of thing.....
