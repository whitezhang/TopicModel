   the only theory that makes any sense is that s1 and s2 are either the
 same for all chips, or vary among very few possibilities, so that anyone
 trying to break the encryption by brute force need only plow through the
 possible serial numbers (2^30, about one billion), multiplied by the number
 of different s1, s2 combinations.
