    i've recently been reading a paper of merkle's (publixhed only on the
 net, i think) discussing three potential replacements for des.  was
 anyting ever done with these?  are khufu, khafre, and/or snefru still
 being discussed anywhere?  (i know snefru is referenced in the rsa
 faq, and i think it may also be in the sci.crypt faq.)
    on a related topic, can anyone point me toward good sites to find
 papers/articles/discussions of cryptology?  i think i've about exhausted
 the math/sci library here, which doesn't seem to have anything more recent
 than about '84.
  
    thanks.
