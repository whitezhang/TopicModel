 yes -- my error -- you will need the diff between the
 standard console.h and console.c supplied with
 symantec's think c 5.0.4 and the specially modified
 one that works with macpgp 2.2.
 
 i added the two diffs to the end of the signature
 file "macpgp2.2srcsignature" in pub/grady of netcom.com
 
 please download via anonymous ftp and, using sed (oops),
 cutting and pasting, fix-em-up.        
 
 will one of you mac-geniuses please port this to macapp
 or appmaker, or...?
