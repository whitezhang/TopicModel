 if "i forgot" doesn't have as much credibility as you'd like, consider
 this alternative.  somewhere on the hard disk, duplicated a few times,
 keep a 128-bit random number.  when the 128-bit digest of your
 passphrase is computed, it is xorred with the random number before being
 used as the key for your hard disk.  writing random junk over the random
 numbers makes the hard disk unreadable by anyone.
 
 now, if you were merely to *claim* that you have written random junk
 over the xor key, no-one would be able to tell whether or not you were
 telling the truth.  this is (a) perjury, and (b) vunerable to
 rubber-hose cryptography, but otherwise effective.
