 i'm looking for a copy of friedman's riverbank publication no. 16 "methods
 for the solution of running-key ciphers."  agean park press tells me that their
 publication c-23 "the riverbank publications, volume 1" is out of print.  can
 anyone snail-mail me a photocopy of no. 16?  if someone could it would be much
 appreciated.
 
 regards,
