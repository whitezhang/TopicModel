 one very interesting thing i notice about this is that the only use of
 the chip key is to encode the session key for the law enforcement field.
 it is not used at all by the encryption algorithm.
 
 it seems like it would be possible to create a device that would be
 otherwise compatible, but would send out a bogus law enforcement field.
 this might render the device unusable with "normal" devices if there's
 some sort of validation involving the law enforcement field, but it
 could certainly be used with other such modified devices.
 
 of course, this is irrelevant if the nsa has a backdoor in the
 algorithm, but it does make it possible to defeat the key escrow system.
