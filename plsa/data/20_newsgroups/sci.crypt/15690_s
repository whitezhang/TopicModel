 thank you very much. after reading the text some distinct questions
 arised to me, which i guess will also be asked by other people. perhaps
 would it be interesting to find an answer to these questions ?

 shorter or longer ?

 first question: when will the lawenforcmentfield be transmitted, and how
 does the remote clipper chip handle it? is it transmitted periodically
 in the stream of encrypted blocks, or just at the beginning ? does the
 phone at the other side discard those packets via a protocol whatsoever,
 or tries it to turn them into voice-output ? (which would not be disturbing)

 second question: why!?!? why is such a strange procedure used, and not
 a real rng ? this turns those s1,s2 in a kind of bottleneck for system-
 security.

 so no (technical) provision will be taken to place a 'timeout' on these
 warrants? this would be a unique possibility to realize such a technical
 restriction, by letting the escrow-agencies perform the decoding of the
 session key. just take modem-lines instead of secure fax. is this such
 a bad idea ?

 wow! (how does the randomizer work?) are the sha (and key exchange) secret,
 or publicly known ? key-exchange is dh, i guess ?
 
 it seems that those who are opposed to this chip shall have a tough time,
 your government realy means to act. :-(
