 	i was thinking about this, also. it's quite possible the
 system transmits, in clear, the serial number of the device being
 used. that way they can start a tap, get the serial number, and use
 the warrant for the first tap to get the key.
 
 	if they tap someone who's apparently using encryption, but
 don't find that prefix, then they'll assume it's an "un-authorized"
 encryption scheme.
