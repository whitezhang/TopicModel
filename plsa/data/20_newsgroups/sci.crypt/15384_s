 i recall seeing a post some time ago saying that if the details of
 an encryption scheme couldn't be revealed, then the encryption
 scheme is worthless.  i believe the statement was in response to
 somebody saying that they had some new snazzy scheme, but the
 algorithm was a secret.
 
 does this algorithm depend on the fact that the scheme is secret or
 is it for the stated reasons above?
