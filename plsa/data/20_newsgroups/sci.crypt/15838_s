 it is tempting (albeit chauvinistic) to believe that we have a new situation
 here, thanks to our pet computers.  this is not true.  david kahn's "the
 codebreakers", a history of cryptography, makes two things obvious:
 
 1.	cryptography is a spontaneous invention of private human individuals
 	and has been going on for thousands of years.  [teen-age slang and
 	cipher inventions provide a modern example of this spontaneous
 	creation.]
 
 2.	the systems people created on their own were roughly as secure as (and
 	sometimes more secure than) those used by military and diplomatic
 	users *of that time* (although they seem very simple and insecure
 	today). [e.g., in places, the bible used a more complex simple
 	substitution than caesar did for his military dispatches, but before
 	caesar.]
 
 i commend kahn's book to all who might be interested.
