 
 with all the talk about this clipper chip, i have developed one question...
 
 			how does it work???
 
 if you use this, then how does it get decrypted on the other end? does the
 other party (receiving the phone call/mail/etc) have to know some code to 
 undo it? do i use a different method for calling one party than i would for 
 another?. if the other party can decrypt it, doesn't that mean that someone
 else could also? i assume that if everyone has a different key, the only use
 would be storing secure data for later retrieval by the same key. this seems
 like a fundamental question to me, but i have very little experience with
 cryptosystems, other than des. if someone could give me an explanation as
 to how it would be used (remember that i have had little experience with
 this sort of thing) it would be very much appreciated.
