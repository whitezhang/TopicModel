 perry is right on target here. careful analysis of the clipper chip
 announcement reveals that is *not* likely to remain "voluntary" for
 very long...the cost of the system, the cost of generating and _then
 storing_ the escrow keys, and the admitted security holes pretty much
 make the clipperphone a loser.
 
 strong crypto will outcompete it, if strong crypto is allowed. this is
 the battle we face.
 
 we had rumblings of this totalitarian key registration thing a while
 back, and now the other shoe has dropped. the firestorm of commentary
 and criticism this time around reveals the almost immediate revulsion
 this wiretap chip (and automatic caller id and callee id, don't
 forget!) generates in everyone, or almost everyone, who hears about
 it.
 
 this is a battle we can't afford to lose.
