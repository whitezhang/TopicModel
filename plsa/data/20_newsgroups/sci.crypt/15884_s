 \maketitle
 
 a message-digest algorithm maps a message of arbitrary length to a
 ``digest'' of fixed length, and has three properties: computing the
 digest is easy, finding a message with a given
 digest---``inversion''---is hard, and finding two messages with the
 same digest---``collision''---is also hard. message-digest algorithms
 have many applications, including digital signatures and message
 authentication.
 
 rsa data security's md5 message-digest algorithm, developed by ron
 rivest \cite{rfc-md5}, maps a message to a 128-bit message digest.
 computing the digest of a one-megabyte message takes as little as a
 second.  while no message-digest algorithm can yet be {\em proved}
 secure, md5 is believed to be at least as good as any other that maps
 to a 128-bit digest.  inversion should take about $2^{128}$
 operations, and collision should take about $2^{64}$ operations.  no
 one has found a faster approach to inversion or collision.
 
 recent work by den boer and bosselaers \cite{den-boer-md5} presents
 a special kind of ``pseudocollision'' in md5's
 internal compression function, which maps
 a 512-bit message block $x$ and a
 128-bit input state $s$ to a 128-bit output
 state. they show how to find a message block $x$
 and two related input states $s_1$ and $s_2$ that yield the same
 output state: $f(x,s_1)$ = $f(x,s_2)$. their well-thought approach
 exploits structural properties of the collision function to find 
 a pseudocollision in about $2^{16}$ operations, much less than one
 would expect.
 
 practical implications of this pseudocollision work to the security of
 md5 are not evident. while a real collision in md5 implies a
 pseudocollision (or a ``pseudo-inversion''), a
 pseudocollision need not imply a real collision. indeed, a real
 collision, since it involves two different messages, would almost
 always involve {\em different} message blocks $x_1$ and $x_2$ such that
 $f(x_1,s_1) = f(x_2,s_2)$, but the pseudocollisions have the same
 message blocks. moreover, the input states $s_1$ and $s_2$ would
 generally be unrelated, but the pseudocollisions' input states are
 the same except for four bits.  there does not seem to be any way to
 extend den boer and bosselaers' approach to anything beyond the
 special pseudocollisions, a limitation they readily admit.
 
 it is reasonable, therefore, to believe that md5 remains secure. while den
 boer and bosselaers have found interesting structural properties in
 md5, the properties seem only to lead to special pseudocollisions
 and not anything approaching real collisions. further research, of
 course, will give a better understanding of the strengths of md5 and
 other message-digest algorithms, with the eventual hope that
 such algorithms can, in some sense, be proved secure.
