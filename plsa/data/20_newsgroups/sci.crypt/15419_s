 	are you sure you aren't being watched?  let me remind you that 
 watergate was only the tip of the iceberg.  nixon extensively used the nsa
 to watch people because he didn't like them.  according to _decrypting the
 puzzle palace_:
 
 	presumably, the nsa is restricted from conducting american surveillance
 	by both the foreign intelligence surveillance act of 1978(fisa) and a
 	series of presidential directives, beginning with one issued by
 	president ford following richard nixon's bold misuse of the nsa, in
 	which he explicitly directed the nsa to conduct widespread domestic
 	surveillance of political dissidents and drug users.
 
 	of course, just because there are laws saying the gov't is not 
 supposed to conduct illegal surveillance doesn't mean those laws can't be
 broken when they are in the way.
