 i found the personal attacks on prof. denning pretty disgusting.
 i don't agree with all her positions; but i think scholars can
 disagree without the argument getting into the gutter.
 
 if these personal attacks are what stopped prof. denning from
 replying on issues of substance, they have cause real harm
 to the serious debate here.
