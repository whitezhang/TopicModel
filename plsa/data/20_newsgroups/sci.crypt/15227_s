 	this doesn't handle superencrypted traffic. if the clipper
 doesn't impose any unfortunate performance side-effects there's no
 reason not to use it to superencrypt a stream of triple-des encrypted
 traffic. that way your traffic looks "normal" and perhaps anyone
 desiring to listen in won't even bother, since they know nobody's
 going to really trust crypto that has classified internals for
 important stuff.
