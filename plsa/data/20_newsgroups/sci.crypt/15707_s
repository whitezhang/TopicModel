 hell, just set up a spark jammer, or some other _very_ electrically-noisy
 device. or build an active farrady cage around the room, with a "noise"
 signal piped into it. while these measures will not totally mask the
 emissions of your equipment, they will provide sufficient interference to
 make remote monitoring a chancy proposition, at best. there is, of course,
 the consideration that these measures may (and almost cretainly will)
 cause a certain amount of interference in your own systems. it's a matter
 of balancing security versus convenience.
