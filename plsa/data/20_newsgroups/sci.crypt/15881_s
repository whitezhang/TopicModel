 we would like to keep it that way. thats the point. by reacting
 strongly and forcefully now, we will assure that we continue to remain
 free. you cannot overreact to a threat like this. the worst that
 happens if we overreact is that we waste time and effort. the worst that
 happens if we underreact is tyranny. i prefer overreaction myself.

 doesn't that tell you how precious and hard to maintain freedom is?
 
 only through centuries of overreaction have we managed to maintain
 ourselves in this state of even moderate freedom. i suggest that
 overreacting now and in the future is a good thing.
