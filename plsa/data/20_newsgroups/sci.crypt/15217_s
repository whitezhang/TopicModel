                             great... nice choice of bad guys to
                             convince everyone how "bad" unrestricted
                             encryption is.  why not use a child
                             molester instead?  of course, the word
                             *suspect* is never used here, so i guess
                             these people have already been convicted
                             and are operating this drug ring from
                             their jail cells.
 
 how about *this* question instead?
 
 q:   suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on
      a political opponent of a senior administration official and
      intercepts a conversation...
 
 kinda changes your interpretation of the event, doesn't it?  and yes,
 the presence of the clipper chip does change things, because it will
 not only give the people talking on the phone a false sense of security,
 it will also give federal law enforcement agencies the justification
 to deny use of strong encryption methods that are inconvenient to them.
 dang it all, it's supposed to be inconvenient (but not impossible).
 that's the only sure way to make sure that abuses are minimized while
 still allowing legitimate law enforcement access.

 uh huh... sure.  i predict that within two months (weeks?) of the chip's
 debut, the full technical details will be posted to sci.crypt.  and if
 this has any impact on the security of the key escrow system, then we've
 been lied to.  any cryptosystem worth its salt can withstand the light
 of public scrutiny, and there is no way you can be sure that an
 algorithm has no "unrecognized vulnerabilities" unless you have half
 the world trying to break it for a decade or so.  even then, you gotta
 be careful.
