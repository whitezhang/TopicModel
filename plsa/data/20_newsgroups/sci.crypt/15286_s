 i change login passwords every couple of months.  i sure would suck if i had
 to get a new sparc station everytime i wanted to do this.  it seems that this
 is what they expect you to do if you want to routinely change your password
 on your phone.  i'm sure the government contractor doesn't mind, but a system
 where you can cheaply change keys (des) has inherent security advantages, 
 regardless of the algorithms involved.

 they failed, of course.  seems as though that motorcade through downtown dallas
 trick only works once.
