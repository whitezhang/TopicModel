 this is true for the mass market, but not for those who need strong crypto
 and are willing to pay the price. after all, one can buy strong crypto today
 if one is willing to spend enough.
 
 thus the concern is not economic.
 
 the issue most worth worrying about is that after the system takes hold, the
 government will outlaw other systems, and something voluntary will become
 the only system available. that is a political, not an economic issue.
 
 as a separate matter, you may be making an implied advocacy for cheap secure
 crypto for everyone. it's true that the clipper chip would probably prevent
 that except via clipper, but "cheap, secure crypto for everyone" is a
 political discussion, not an economic one, and the whole point of clipper is 
 to resolve that political (policy) tension between securing legitimate
 communications and tapping the crooks.
