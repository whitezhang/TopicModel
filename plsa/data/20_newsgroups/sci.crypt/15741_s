 	in what way david?  our government is totally out of control,
 	whether you realize it or not.  i know you find it painful to
 	think of your old buddy uncle sam as evil but it's true.  other
 	democracies have fallen before.  ours is on its way and knee-jerk
 	sheep that instinctively trust government are helping it slide.
 	power corrupts david, why is that so hard to understand?
