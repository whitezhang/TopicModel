 i suspect the government feels it is enough to prevent companies from
 offering secure encryption services.  big companies don't take that
 kind of risk.  they're too visible and have too much to lose.
 
 the us government may not have to make encryption illegal to prevent its
 use.  if they could credibly say to ibm or mit: you will receive no us
 government money next year unless you follow these voluntary guidelines on
 use of encryption, i doubt either organization would delay making use of
 encryption a violation of local policies.  the us government gets much of
 its power by making it impractical to operate without getting money from the
 government while putting restrictions on use of such money that would be
 illegal if they were enacted as laws.
