 faq for sci.crypt, part 1: overview
 
 this is the first of ten parts of the sci.crypt faq. the parts are
 mostly independent, but you should read this part before the rest. we
 don't have the time to send out missing parts by mail, so don't ask.
 notes such as ``[kah67]'' refer to the reference list in the last part.
 
 disclaimer: this document is the product of the crypt cabal, a secret
 society which serves the national secu---uh, no. seriously, we're the
 good guys, and we've done what we can to ensure the completeness and
 accuracy of this document, but in a field of military and commercial
 importance like cryptography you have to expect that some people and
 organizations consider their interests more important than open
 scientific discussion. trust only what you can verify firsthand.
 and don't sue us.

 faq is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers 
 every 21 days.
