 meeting of the uk cryptoprivacy association
 - -------------------------------------------
 
 saturday, 8 may 1993, 1500
 
 to be held at the offices of:
 
   forest
   4th floor
   2 grosvenor gardens
   london  sw1w 0dh
 
 this is located at the corner of hobart place, a couple of
 blocks west of victoria station, and almost directly across from
 the dark green cabbie shelter.
 
 if you have trouble finding the place, please call the office on
 071-823-6550.  or, call me (russell whitaker) on my pager,
 081-812-2661, and leave an informative message with the
 telephone number where you can be reached; i will return the
 call almost immediately.
 
 discussion will range from the usual general topics, such as the
 use of secure public key cryptosystems to protect message data, to
 specific topics, such as recent moves by the u.s. government
 to restrict choice in data privacy (reference recent discussion
 on usenet groups, e.g. sci.crypt and alt.security.pgp).
 
 all are invited.  particularly welcome are members of the
 newly-formed uk community group ... the local
 eff-in-spirit-if-not-in-name folks.
 
 those who plan to attend should email me and let me know.
 please.
 
 all attendees are requested to bring diskettes - preferably
 ms-dos - with their pgp 2.+ public keys.  as is usual at these
 gatherings, several of us will bring our laptops, and will sign
 public keys, subject to the usual caveats (reference the
 documentation for pgp 2.2, specifically files pgpdoc1.doc and
 pgpdoc2.doc).
 
 if you do not already have a copy of pgp 2.2 (ms-dos), and would
 like to have a copy of this public domain program, please bring
 a formatted, medium or high density 3.5 inch floppy pc diskette;
 you will be provided a copy of the program.
 
 of course, you might prefer to ftp a version of the program from
 one of the various archive sites.  i suggest trying demon
 internet systems, which carries the full range of pgp (phil
 zimmerman's "pretty good privacy") implementations: directory
 /pub/pgp at gate.demon.co.uk.
 
 meetings are of indeterminate time.  those who are interested
 are invited to join the rest of us at a pseudorandomly
 determined pub afterwards.
 
 please note:
 - ------------
 in the past few months, interested people have emailed me,
 requesting faqs and special information mailings.  i regret
 that, except in very unusual cases (e.g. working press), i
 cannot, in a timely manner, respond to these requests.  i will,
 however - and for the first time - do a writeup of this meeting,
 which i will post in various places.
 
 what i *am* willing to supply is general information on our
 activities for the maintainers of existing faqs, such as that
 for alt.privacy.  faq maintainers can contact me at
 whitaker@eternity.demon.co.uk
