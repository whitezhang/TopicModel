 	the clipper standard *is* the first step toward outlawing other
 strong encryption standards.  if the government didn't intend to outlaw
 other forms of encryption, than clipper is just a big waste of time and money.
 why, you ask?  because anyone who is transferring data that any government
 agency could use against him/her would be a total fool to use the clipper
 system..so why add the backdoor-key if all lawbreakers will use alternate
 encryption methods? because they assume they can just do away with everything
 else.
 	i, for one, am planning on boycotting any equipment that contains
 clipper technology.
