 sounds to me like a *great* gimmick for a replacement market...every
 so often issue a "clipper alert" announcing that some key backup tapes
 are missing, that some drug lords got 'em, whatever. then the owners
 of these $1200 clipperphones have to trot down to their local key
 escrow agency and buy new chips and have them programmed.
 
 microtoxin, the clipper supplier, will make a killing...maybe this was
 the real idea. (anybody know if janet reno has stock in microtoxin,
 vlsi technology, or at&t?)
 
 could be a good opportunity to undermine this with some
 disinformation: float rumors that the key database has been stolen.
 all the chips need replacing. it angers people, undermines confidence
 even more, and kills sales.
 
 after the waco massacre and the big brother wiretap chip, any tactic
 is fair.
