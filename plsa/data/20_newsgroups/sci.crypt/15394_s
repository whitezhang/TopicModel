 there was an interesting column on the editorial page of the dallas
 morning news on saturday by walter williams, who i believe is a
 professor at georgetown (i wonder if he knows of dorothy "you're not in
 kansas anymore" denning).  the article was titled "government slowly
 eroding our liberties", and in it he tells a story attributed to the
 late leonard read who
 
         explained that if you wanted to take liberty away from
         americans, you had to know how to cook a frog.  mr. read
         said you can't cook a frog by boiling a pot of water and
         then throwing the frog in.  his reflexes are so quick that
         as soon as his feet touch the water, he will leap away.
         you must put the frog in a pot of cold water and heat it
         up bit by bit.  by the time the frog realizes he's being
         cooked, it is too late.  it is the same with americans.
         if anyone tried to take our freedoms all at once, we
         would naturally rebel and suppress the tyrant.  but as
         with successful frog cooking, our liberties can be taken
         a little bit at a time.
 
 the last line of the article says, "it's not too late for us, but the
 water is getting pretty warm."  i'd have toagree that it's warm and the
 clipper is keeping the temperature on an upward course.
