 i disagree, if for no other reason than that there are already other 
 standards in place.  besides, even if they restrict encryption on the nren, 
 who cares?  most of the internet is commercial anyway.  the nren is only for 
 geovernment and university research (read the proposals--it's a "data 
 superhighway" for cray users, not anything having to do with the internet).
