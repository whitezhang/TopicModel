 i came. i lurked. i read the faq.
 
 now having purchased the recommended books, and having taken to heart the advice that
 one knows nothing about crypto without having done a stint as a cryptanalyst, i would like
 to correspond with people interested in cryptology.
 
 i am working on implementing the cryptanalyst's workbench example in booch's ood with
 applications. i hope to start sending ciphers back and forth so each of us can practice cracking
 them.  i would like to start with simple ceaser's ciphers and progress roughly according to
 david kahn's book. of course i would be interested in general discussions and math also.
 
 i hope to have some foriegn correspondants so that we can test the response time of the
 "men in the suits" i've been hearing so much about. unfortunately as a product of the american
 education system i only know english.
 
 looking forward to any and all responses.
 
 james
