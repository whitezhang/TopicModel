    as promised, i spoke today with the company mentioned in a washington
 times article about the clipper chip announcement. the name of the company
 is secure communicatiions technology (information will be given at the end
 of this message on how to contact them).
 
    basically they are disturbed about the announcement for many reasons that
 we are. more specifically however, mr. bryen of secure communications
 brought to light many points that might interest most of the readers.
 
    his belief is that at&t was made known of the clipper well before the
 rest of the industry. this is for several reasons, several of which are:
 
  - a company of at&t's size could never be able to make a decision to use
    the new chip on the same day it was announced.
 
  - months ago they proposed using their own chip for at&t's secure telephone
    devices. at&t basically blew them off as being not interested at all.
    this stuck them as strange, until now...
 
 
    also i spoke with art melnick, their cryptographer, he expressed several
 concerns over the new clipper chip:
 
   - the obvious backdoor will be able to let many people decrypt the code.
 
   - once the key is released to authorities the security of the crypto
     system is lost forever. these keys can end up in the hands of any agency
     of the government.
 
   - the fact that the escrowed keys never change means that the algorithm
     is vulnerable over time to an attacker.
 
   - the classified algorithm may hide another backdoor. but he feels that
     it is probably to keep people from forging fake serial numbers, or
     changing the keys themselves.
 
   - additionally he feels that the nsa has probably spent enough time and
     money in working on a way to keep this chip from being reversed
     engineered, that he feels that reverse engineering it will be very
     difficult to do. he feels that they have developed a suitable technique
     to protect the chip from this attack. also he feels that the chip is
     hardware encoded with the algorithm and not microcoded onto the chip.
 
 additonally i spoke with mr. melnick about their algorithm. he couldn't tell
 me much about their new agorithm because it hasn't been patented yet.
 however he told me a little:
 
  - the algorithm will be released for public review after patents have been
    granted for it. this is so the crypto community can see that it is
    secure.
 
  - the algorithm is called nea for new encryption algorithm.
    the details were sketchy because now it is held as a trade secret
    until the patent was issued, but i was told that it will incorporate
    the following:
 
     - it will have fast encryption of data (exact specs not given, but
       mr. melnick stated "much faster than what an rs-232 can put out.")
 
     - it is a symmetric cipher, just like idea and des.
 
     - it will use 64 bit data blocks for encryption (like des and idea).
 
     - the key length was not given to me, but mr. melnick states that
       it is _adujustable_ and is "more than adequate for security."
 
     - the algorithm is written in c and assembler in software form, and
       can be ported to many platforms (unlike the the clipper chip which
       is hardware only and cannot be made into software) this i
       consider a definite plus for the nea for widespread use.
 
     - the algorithm will accomodate public key distribution techniques
       such as rsa or diffie-hellman. this will also be supported in the
       hardware chip.
 
     - right now the projected cost of the nea chip will be about 10 dollars
       for each!! (clipper will run 25 each chip [that is if it is produced
       enough, which probably won't happen]).
 
     - they currently sell a program called c-com that uses the algorithm
       and a special streaming protocol that does not divide the encrypted
       data into "blocks." this could prevent plaintext attacks if you know
       what the block header is. this program operates at all supported
       rs-232 speeds and uses the software implementation of the algorithm.
 
     - most importantly: it does not have a backdoor!!
 
 
 
 right now the company is afraid that the new clipper chip will put them out
 of business. this is a very real possibility. so they really need help in
 stopping the clipper chip from becoming a standard. if you want to contact
 them, they can be reached at..

 i talked to mr. bryen who represents the company. he can answer any
 questions you have.
