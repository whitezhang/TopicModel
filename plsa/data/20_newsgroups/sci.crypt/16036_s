 i was under the impression (from reading denning's description of the
 clipper's operation) that the same session key *is* used in both directions for
 encrypting the message text, but that each chip uses it's own key for
 encrypting the session key into the law-enforcement field.  so, you only
 need to know the u key for one of the phones involved to decrypt the
 messages in both directions.
