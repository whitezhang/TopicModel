 may not be in the newsfeed here.]
 
 there may be another reason (good from nsa's point of view, horrible
 from everyone else's) why the algorithm/chip design might be secret.
 
 first, note that the "experts" will only look at "details", and of just 
 the algorithm:
 
     in addition, respected experts from outside the
     government will be offered access to the confidential details of
     the algorithm to assess its capabilities and publicly report
     their findings.
 
 why not the chip design?  well, here's the possiblity:  in addition to
 encryption, the chip pre-processes voice signals to make them easier
 to analyze/transcribe electronically.  the chip, once widespread, might
 effectively be part of a massively parallel computer for "voice-
 grepping" the us phone network (or the criminal & wrong-thinking patrons
 thereof).
 
 i wouldn't put it past the nsa.  think how much easier it would make life
 for them.
 
 and if this is indeed the case, think of the possible public outcry should
 it become widely known.  thus the secrecy.
 
 it might be a good idea to have experts in dsp, voice recognition, and
 ai conversation-understanding to be on that panel, and insist they be
 given (authenticatable) design specs and implementation documentation.
