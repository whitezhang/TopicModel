 you've overlooked a fundamental truth:
 
 	both headcount and budget of any government agency are
 	monotonic increasing functions.

 perhaps they could talk the world's telephone companies into making equipment
 they could break into and tap.
 
 maybe they could convince people that distributed computing was a good idea
