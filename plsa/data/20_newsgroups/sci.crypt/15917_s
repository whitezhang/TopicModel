 is the u used in the law enforcement field from the phone which placed the
 call, from the unit whose 'start secure session' button was pressed first,
 or does each phone transmit its own law enforcement field?  even assuming
 one of the first two choices, the fbi is going to get a fresh n,u for its
 own database about every other phone call, eventually accumulating keys for
 all the phones used to connect to the line they are monitoring, not just
 the 'suspects' key.  (assuming the ever-thrifty fbi doesn't forget each key
 after its wiretap permission has expired.)  not quite a pyramid, but not
 bad, either.
