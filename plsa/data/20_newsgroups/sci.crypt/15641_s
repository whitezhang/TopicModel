 as far as i know isdn (call it swissnet here, and it's being plugged in) it's
 8 bit 8000hz (gives you one channel of 64kbit/sec) i guess you should not go
 below a sampling rate of 6000 hz if you want to have same quality as on an
 analog-line. anybody knows compression-algorithms & -factors for voice ?
