 taking this at face value (though it seems quite dissonant with much else
 that has been published here about brute force des cracking, unless russell
 was lucky with respect to the key), i'd be very interested in whether the
 program russell used is available? in whether he used a cleartext
 recognition algorithm in the program or whether he had to examine each
 decryption by hand? in whether he used a known plaintext attack?
 
 he probably should also tell us, given his address, what machine he used--a
 desktop, workstation, or super-computer.
 
 depending on his answer, this could be an appalling development calling into
 question both des and rsa/des. dunno about rsa/idea.
 
 if any bright programmer with a little idle machine time can crack a single
 des message in a couple of days (assuming no tricks that are
 message-specific), then here's my clipper key, nsa; give me the chip at
 once.  :-)
