 	i concur for a pc to pc version.  but for a interactive thing like
 internet talk radio?!?!  it makes me cringe at the amount of hogging such

 the phone system; take your electronics and use them on point to point 
 conversations through the phone and thats it.  if you need to tell someone 
 something secret and very important wouldn't it make more sense to write it
