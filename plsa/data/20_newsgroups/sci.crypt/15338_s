    hey, it's better than the status quo.
 
    i am far less worried about "the feds" tapping my phone than high school 
    scanner surfers who get their kicks out of eavesdropping on cellular and 
    cordless phone calls.
 
 i'm a political dissident. i'm scared shitless of the feds listening
 in on my calls. my opinions are the sort that would get me
 "disappeared" in a slightly less free society -- and who knows what
 sort of society we will be in in five or ten years? i have friends who
 have had their phones tapped -- none of this is theoretical to me.
 
 as for "its better than the status quo", well, first of all, you can
 get a cryptophone from companies like cylink today -- and they work
 well. in addition, a number of groups are now working on building
 software to turn any pc into a privacy enhanced phone right now -- and
 they are all working in overdrive mode.
 
    and yes, i'd rather just see all crypto restrictions lifted, but this is at 
    least an incrememental improvement for certain applications...
 
 there are no crypto restrictions... yet. you can use anything you want
 right now. the point is to maintain that right.
