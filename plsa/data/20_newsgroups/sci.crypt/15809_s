 ok, andrew, i'll provide some evidence. a friend of mine worked for an
 electronics manufacturer on with a west-coast office. they routinely sold
 equipment to the japanese. one day, the japanese started showing up with
 discount demands that were amazingly close to the cost to manufacture the
 products.
 
 this company routinely sent most of the manufacturing data to the field 
 offices. the japanese had simply intercepted it. so my friend, the computer
 systems admin, came up with a solution. he started sending the data out
 double-block-encrypted with des. 
 
 two days after this new distribution plan was implemented, the president of
 the company got a visit from a pair of government agents. they told him to
 "knock it off". the president gave in, since his company did a considerable
 business with the federal government.
 
 now, if the government wasn't monitoring the communications, how would they
 even know that the encryption system was installed? further, since encryp-
 tion isn't illegal, and des certainly isn't, what is the basis of the
 government's cease-and-desist demand?
 
 the spooks do whatever they think is necessary, with or without the blessings
 of the law. i'll say "no thanks" to clipper, or anything else the government
 produces. for the moment, double or triple des is probably adequate. and when
 the line is idle, send random garbage, just to keep 'em busy.
