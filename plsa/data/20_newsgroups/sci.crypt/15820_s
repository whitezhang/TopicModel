 please don't be insulted, but based on this i would say that your
 encryption algorithm is very likely not worth the paper it's printed
 on.  if the nsa gave export approval, that means they felt confident
 that they could crack it -- that's their job, mandated by law, and
 i'm sure they believe in what they do.  if they gave export approval
 to an encryption algorithm which they weren't confident of being able
 to crack, they would be derelict in their sworn duty to monitor foreign
 communications for us national security related material.
 
 just because many (most?) of us think that the government and the spooks
 are pugnacious slimeballs is no reason to lose sight of the fact that
 they do their jobs to the best of their ability, and further that said
 ability is rather high.  i hope that one day we can make them all
 obsolete....... but until then, we have to cope with their existence.
 export approvals are one thing they do that we can learn a lot from,
 for example.
