 compuserve is in columbus, oh.  so are the corporate headquarters of several 
 major insurance companies, the largest private r&d company in the world 
 (batelle memorial institute), dcsc (the defense construction & supply 
 center), ohio state university (one of the three largest us universities), 
 oclc (the online college library center), and so on.  you'd be amazed, 
 actually.
 
 columbus only *looks* like a cow town.
