 dear senator/congressman/president {fill in the blank}
 
 i am writing you to voice my strong opposition to president clinton's clipper 
 chip initiative. this proposal to establish a secret government designed
 cryptography chip with government key registration as the standard for voice
 encryption is very disturbing. the idea that citizens must register their 
 secrets with the government just in case they are trying to keep them secret 
 is patently unamerican. additionally, the press release for this program
 strongly implied that other forms of cryptography would be banned after the 
 clipper chip standard is in place. this latest attack on our civil rights is 
 deeply disturbing and is frankly a voting issue for me. 
 
 the presidents press release stated that the plan strikes a balance between the
 legitimate needs of law enforcement and a citizens right to privacy but this 
 is not the case. the fact is that since other strong cryptographic equipment 
 is avalible the criminals, drug dealers and terrorists mentioned in the press 
 release will simply use non clipper cryptography. meanwhile the average citizen
 may gain no protection against warentless wiretaps by the government since the 
 government escrowed key is derived deterministicly from the unit serial number
 which is broadcast by the chip durring its opperation. this seems like an 
 obvious back door for the nsa and law enforcement. if you still do nott 
 understand my objection to key registration, consider the way j. edgar hoover 
 blackmailed government officials like yourself; would you now use a phone to 
 transmit personal details of your life that the nsa and fbi have the keys to?
