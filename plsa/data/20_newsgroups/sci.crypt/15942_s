   so, you admit that clipper opens the doors wide for the following scenario:
 
   feds: we need the keys to joe blow's phone.
 
   escrow agent: joe blow?  you have a warrant to tap his line?
 
   feds: well, no, but we have a warrant to tap carlos "slime-devil" gonzales'
      line, and our tap shows that mr. gonzales is using mr. blow's phone.
 
   escrow agent: well, ok....
