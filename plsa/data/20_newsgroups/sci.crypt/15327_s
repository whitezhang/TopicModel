 i'm sure dorothy denning is an honest person and wouldn't lie to us.
 simply think up a question to ask her about her involvement, but be
 very careful to phrase it in such a way that there can be no jesuitical
 evasion or a true but wholly misleading answer.
 
 in this country, mi5 are *experts* at answering these questions; for
 instance there was a british journalist (jonathon moyle) killed in south
 america a couple of years ago.  parliament asked "was he an mi5 employee"
 "no." - turns out afterwards he wasn't paid, therefore wasn't an employee.
 they could equally have said he wasn't an agent - he went abroad on his
 private business with no brief from mi5, but was interviewed and debriefed
 at length only *on his return*.
