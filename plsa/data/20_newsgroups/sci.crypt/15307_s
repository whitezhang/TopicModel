     no. the lapd officers were tried first by the state of california
 on charges of police brutality, and secondly by the federal government
 on depriving rk of his civil rights - a different crime.
 
     the scenario i outline is more similar to the oliver north trial.
 ollie confessed to treason (aiding an enemy of the us) during senate
 hearings, under immunity. the team which was later to prosecute him on
 criminal charges had to sequester itself from all reports of on's
 immunized testimony. on's lawyer brought up the probability that at
 least someone on the team had heard about the senate testimony, and it
 was a strong factor against the prosecution, which is one of the
 reasons this on is still walking around free today.
