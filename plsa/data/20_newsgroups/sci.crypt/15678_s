 could somebody provide an overview of the proposed systems using the
 chip?  (ought to see if att has a spec sheet)  skipjack sounds like a
 normal digital encryption algorithm, so the data path will have to be
 	voice --> digitize --> compress --> encrypt 
 compression will be necessary to fit the data on the wire, unless
 they want to wait for isdn (that we should be so lucky...).  feeding
 pre-encrypted data into the compressor will cause it to chuckle at
 you; you'd have to tap into the guts of the phone and hack either
 the compressed data stream, or selected parts of the output stream
 before it hits the modem.  unless you want to pay for two fast
 modems on top of the encryption, and just plug the box in between
 your phone and the wall.
