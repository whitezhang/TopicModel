 i'm not sure it is a major limiting move... in the academic circles
 i've seen, arguing for increased government intervention and
 management is almost always a plus (not the least because it usually
 means more high paying jobs for academics as "advisors").  also
 consider that it looks like denning has some decent nsa / government
 connections, which is always a plus for an academic institute that
 wants more government funding and work tossed their way.
 
 despicable, yes; career limiting, well, the publicity probably
 outweighs the drawbacks.  and there are a whole bunch of people who
 think the whole thing is just peachy keen. if it's only going to be
 used against drug dealers, child pornographers, and terrorists, well
 it must be good. :p
