 the problem is, the people are not having the scope, or implicataions
 pointed out to them.  hell, most haven't even heard of clipper, and
 when they do, it will be in soothing language telling everyone how
 nice the government is at 'letting them have' privacy.
 
 how come the media is not telling about the provisions of the clipper
 decision?  the provisions of the crime bill?  the abuses of civil forfeiture?
 the government uses polls to support 75 percent of the people want
 gun bans, etc., yet the same pollsters have determined (according to
 the media) that 30 percent of the people are unaware of what the holocaust
 is...
 
 the people cannot be expected to give decent decisions when they are
 denied the information that all these abuses and whittling away of
 rights are going on quietly.  when they find out (when it hits them),
 it will be too late.  one cannot expect each citizen to spend all their
 time probing, searching, researching, etc.   for example, how big a
 percentage of the average population even has access to usenet?  way
 less than 1 percent, i bet.   how many outside of internet/usenet
 are even aware of what big brother is doing, or have been exposed to
 arguments of both sides of the issue?
 
 what the public will get is only one side:  the government's side.
 
 that is scary.

 how can the bulk of the people be informed, when the media refuses to
 do it?

 the people at large need to be informed.  but how?   i am but one person.
 i try to talk to everyone that will listen, but i can hardly make any
 kind of dent.
