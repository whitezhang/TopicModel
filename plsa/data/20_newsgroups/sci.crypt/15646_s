 but what about second sources for pin-compatible non-clipper algorithm
 chips that also have escrowed keys?  if a "reputable firm" produces a
 chip (with escrowed key) that is a pop-in replacement for the clipper
 chip in my phone, and uses an algorithm that is widely known and evaluated
 and "trusted," then what's the problem?
 
 the clipper is going to be reverse engineered anyway by any organization
 with sufficient resources (can you say "billions of cocaine dollars?") so
 those drug dealers they're so worried about will be slipping through the
 cracks.  we law-abiding (non-incredibly-wealthy) citizens, naturally, will
 not have this recourse.  but claiming that the algorithm can't be
 released to prevent people from using non-key-escrowed chips is plain
 deceitful... analysis of the chip output will provide information on
 the necessary headers and whatnot, so the "bad guys" could build chips
 using a *different* algorithm and still not escrow their keys.
 
 or, they could just buy bunches of cheap phones at k-mart every week,
 and play swap-the-clipper-chip with their cellular phone every day.
