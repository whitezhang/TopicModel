 	while i think it is unrealistic to suppose that the federal
 agencies will fail to promptly comply with a court order, there is 
 still a good point here.  local law enforcement will be unable to perform
 a wiretap without bringing in federal agencies.   based on the (possibly
 incomplete) understanding of the system quoted from d. denning, only the
 fbi will be able to decrypt the system key encryption layer, which seems
 to be needed even to identify what escrowed keys to request.  this moves
 a great deal of law enforcement power to the federal level.
 	the reason i like this point is that it may sway or even persuade
 people who don't generally line up with the civil liberties crowd.  a
 national police force is opposed by people from a broad range of political 
 viewpoints.
