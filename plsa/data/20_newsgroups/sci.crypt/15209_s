 	hmmm.  "check your facts."  good advice.  let's check mr. cain's
 facts a bit, shall we?

 fact:  it is unlawful to distribute code implementing rsa without a license
 to do so from pkp, whether or not one is charging for it.  furthermore,
 any use of rsa, other than for research purposes allowed under us patent
 law, is similarly unlawful.  therefore, the "average citizen" cannot use
 rsa to encrypt message traffic in the us without a license from pkp.
 
 there is no licensed, freely available product in the us that uses rsa
 encryption other than rsaref (and hence ripem), at least as far as i am
 aware.  if you know of another, please post it here.

 fact:  the last contact i had with rsa data security, inc was with some
 guy trying to sell me a license (unsolicited, i might add) for tipem.
 cost: $15k plus 2-5 percent royalties.
 
 i suppose it is a matter of opinion as to whether or not these terms count
 as "mucho bucks" or "incredibly reasonable."  either way, however, this
 definitely falls into the "routines *they* tell you to (use)".

 fact:  there are no restrictions (yet!) on the use of cryptography under
 us law, although this is beginning to look like it will change.  the only
 impediments to widespread use of rsa cryptography in the us are pkp's
 patents.
 
 	mr. cain, please shut up until you get your facts straight.
