 i've been a very intent nren spectator of the nren for years.  as a 
 commercial ip software vendor, it really is my professional opinion that the 
 nren, at this point, is irrelevant to private sector networking.  if it had 
 been deployed five years ago, it would have been a major development.  now,
 however, it's just an upgrade to the nsfnet, and an attempt to revive the 
 lagging use of the national supercomputer centers.  you could cut out the 
 nsfnet completely, and the internet would continue chugging along without a 
 hiccup (aside from a few universities).
 
 long-haul networking and internet connectivity have long since ceased to be 
 under federal sponsorship or regulation, at least in the usa.  the success of 
 the cix (commercial internet exchange) is a prime example of this.  while our 
 dear vp has been promoting his "data superhighway," the private sector has 
 been building it, without the nsfnet's restrictions.
 
 to illustrate, a connection from the machine on my desk to the machine your 
 article was posted from (pizzabox.demon.co.uk) involves *only* commercial ip 
 providers until it hits amsterdam.  no nsfnet.  no nren.  no "appropriate 
 use" restrictions.  it's even 1.544mbps (t1) until it hits the eunet 
 gateway...
