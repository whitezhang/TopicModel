 ed, as usual, makes a very good point.
 
 one time a friend of mine at sun sent me an e-mail.  he composed it using the
 sun openwindows 3 "mailtool" which handles (non-mime) "attachments" and the
 like.
 
 since i don't use "mailtool", i had to manually save it, cut & paste, and
 then "uudecode" the actual attachment.  what i got - after a not-inconsiderable
 amount of time spent doing this - was an audio file.  the original message
 was over 32kb of mail headers and uuencoded data; the resulting audio message
 was a single sentence that i transcribed as a 135 character message.
 
 if he had sent me the sentence in plain text, the e-mail would have been
 around 250 bytes, and it would have taken me about 3 seconds to process it at
 most.  instead, it was 32k and it took at least a minute.  a complete waste of
 (my) time and bandwidth, as far as i'm concerned.  sending plain text is still
 the most efficient method of transmission, given the same transport mechanism.
 i shudder to think what would happen if everyone started posting their usenet
 articles as audio files instead of plain text!  meltdown of the net predicted!
 film at eleven!
