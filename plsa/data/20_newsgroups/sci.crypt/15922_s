 clipper tm chip is a registered trademark of intergraph corp.
 
 the so-called clipper chip which was recently mentioned here
 and in other media
 with respect to encryption is being used in violation of that trademark.  
 
 the intergraph clipper chip is a unix microprocessor, originally 
 developed by fairchild semiconductors, and has no relationship
 to the encryption chip whatsoever.  
 
 i mention this here with the hope that someone reading this will
 intercede before the group alt.privacy."clipper" is established.
