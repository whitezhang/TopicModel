 	i think i should also point out that the mystical des engines
 are known plaintext engines (unless you add a ton of really smart
 hardware?)
 
 	the 'plaintext' is digitized voice, and exists for a very short
 time, probably in a couple inches of copper, tops. it's flatly not
 available -- your bug in my office can hear my voice, and even digitize
 it, but it's going to get a different bitstream.
 
 	it is horribly naive to suppose that regular folks can figure
 out how to crack skipjack, or clipper based telephones. i'm certainly
 not devoting a great deal of thought to it.
