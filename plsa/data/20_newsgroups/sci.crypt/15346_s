 as am i
 
 if "high quality secure nsa classified technology" means handing my key
 over to whomever, i'll take pgp any day.
 
 right now they are billing it as voluntary, i.e. bend over, here it comes.
 
 as soon as enough wiretap chip based units are out there, how much
 easier do you think it will be to redefine "on your own" to mean
 write it yourself and don't even think about distributing it...?
 
 get honest, no one is going to buy this trash if they know it's compromised
 already, and less will buy it if the algorithm is not disclosed.
 
 the nsa knows that making this stuff available to the public means
 handing it to whatever foreign powers are interested in the process.
 since when has export control stopped anyone (especially software wise)
 
 ask yourself carefully if " high quality secure nsa classified technology "
 is something they are going to hand out.  not unless you can drive a
 nsa van through the holes.
