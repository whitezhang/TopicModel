 why doing it in such a rough manner? it is much more professional to
 steal the chip from the phone and even to replace it with a
 pin-compatible do-nothing chip that does not encrypt at all. chances
 are that the victim will not notice anything, especially if it is done
 professionally.

 no, because the feds will still be able to decrypt the conversations.
 true, they'll blame the wrong guys, but nevertheless one cannot say
 something like "the drugs arrive tommorrow on the ship 'terminus'"
 when the feds are listening, even if they cannot identify who the
 speaker is.
 
 no, the criminals will just use some secure encryption. the new
 proposal does not stop criminals; it ensures that the government will
 be able to wiretap the average citizen and stops the casual snooper.
 to me, it also clearly looks as a step towards outlawing any other
 strong encryption devices.
