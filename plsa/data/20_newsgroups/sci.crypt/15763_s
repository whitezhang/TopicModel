 hello. i am the david sternlight keeper of the faq. unfortuantely i cannot
 find it at the present time.
 
 from the original faq:
 
 question: does anyone take david sternlight serious?
 
 fact: no one takes david sternlight serious. they review his opinions and
 in most cases immediately discard them or jerk them over to
 alt.fan.david-sternlight which actually should be alt.flame.david-sternlight.
 
 a photograph of david sternlight for the curious:

 question: why does david continue to relate mis statements regarding
 encryption and other topics?
 
 fact: david sternlight has a chemical imbalance of the right side of his
 brain.
