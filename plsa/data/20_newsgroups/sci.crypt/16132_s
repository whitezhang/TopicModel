 yesterday i read an article from someone who was requesting references for
 introductory texts on cryptography.  although i marked the article to
 return, it appears to have expired on this site.
 
 anyway, on one of the previous occasions when this subject arose i saved
 a couple articles which made suggestions.  one of the articles contained
 a quite impressive bibliography.  if the poster of the request (or anyone
 else) would like to email me, i would be glad to send out copies of these
 recommendations, including the bibliography.
