 nice to think, but naive.  the fact is that millions of people today
 are sending highly confidential information over unencoded, easy to
 receive cellular phones.  they figure the chances of being heard are
 small, so they risk it.
 
 and 99.9% of people don't understand crypto the way the least of the
 sci.crypt newbies does.   if clinton tells them it's good crypto,
 they'll believe him, and send important stuff over it, and be thankful
 that they're no longer using clear-voice fm cellular phones.
 
 only a tiny fraction of people will want more crypto.  worse, in the
 eyes of the government, which swears up and down the algorithim is
 spook-level secure (and it may indeed be) the only reason you could
 possibly want this extra level is to avoid police.
 
 by using it, you'll attract attention as a likely lawbreaker.
 
 "your honour, the suspect suddenly started using another level of
 cryptography and we can't tap his phone calls any more.  he must
 have something to hide.  please sign the warrant to search his
 house..."
