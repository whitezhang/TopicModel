 it has actually come up (or it will in a week or two) in nz.  i'll post the
 outcome when the trial finishes (which could take months btw).  overall it
 looks like you can't be forced to reveal a password, if anyone can provide
 a convincing legal argument to the contrary (ie an actual court case) i'd
 be most interested...
