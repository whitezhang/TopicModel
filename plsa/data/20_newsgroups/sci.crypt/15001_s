 people have been encrypting notes in their notebooks for hundreds of years
 -- maybe over a thousand.  it's a long tradition dating at least back to
 the alchemists.
 
 i know of nothing bad happening to them.  i would assume that nothing bad
 would happen to you, given this long history establishing encryption as
 the property of individuals, to do with as they please.
