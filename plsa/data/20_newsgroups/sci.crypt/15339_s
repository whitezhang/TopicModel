    excuse me?  this has *already* happened.  there's a couple of humps in
    the tent already.  ask the folks at qualcomm what became of the
    non-trivial encryption scheme they proposed for use in their cdma
    digitial cellular phone standard?  there *already* are restrictions in
    place.
 
 you have it slightly wrong. they dumped the encryption system because
 they could not export it -- not because they could not produce it for
 u.s. use. there are no legal restraints on citizen use of strong
 cryptography -- yet.
