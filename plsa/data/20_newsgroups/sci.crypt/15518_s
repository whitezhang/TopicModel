 well, i'm not a lawyer, but from what i can tell this is completely
 and utterly untrue.
 
 you see, this country has this thing called a "constitution".
 
 if you legitimately aquire the device, and you yourself are
 not a government employee or otherwise encumbered, i don't think they
 can stop you from revealing anything about the device you can
 determine. remember the pentagon papers precedent? the first amendment
 applies here.
 
 the u.s. does not have an official secrets act. we do have laws that
 will punish you for revealing what classified information you learned
 in your capacity as a government official, contractor, etc, and we
 have laws that prohibit stealing such information. however, if they
 sell you the chip, i can't see that they can make reverse engineering
 it and revealing the details illegal.
