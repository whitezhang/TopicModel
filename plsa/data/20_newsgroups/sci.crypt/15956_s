 no no no no no no no.
 
 it will go like this:
 
 feds: we need the key to phone 334re67d99.
 
 escrow: you have a warrant to tap the line phone 334re67d99 is on?
 
 feds: yes.
 
 escrow: fine, here is our key.
 
 what happens is, feds tap a line; find clipper is being used; extract
 serial number; get key; decipher convo.  the serial number is never
 registered to a specific owner, it is _sent_ as part of the
 conversation.  if i give you my clipper phone, you do not need to
 re-register it (mainly because it was never 'registered' to me in the
 first place).
 
 there are a lot of things that bother me about clipper, but this is
 not one of them.  let's get our facts straight and not waste effort
 demolishing straw men.
