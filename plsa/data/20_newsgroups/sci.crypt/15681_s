 useful?  i find his estimate of the annual value to law enforcement
 of $5 million quite useful, if rough (e.g. wiretaps may be
 preferentially used on otherwise-hard-to-catch criminals, resulting
 in an underestimate).  this comes to twenty cents a head over the
 u.s. population.  i would find some rigorous numbers on this quite
 useful -- it would make for nice slogans: "your privacy is worth
 $0.37", or whatever it turns out to be.
