 this is a very curious thing to say. stu-iiis (nsa-designed secure
 telephones cleared for classified traffic) are already readily
 available to law enforcement agencies. word has it they're standard in
 every fbi office, for example.  something like several hundred
 thousand of these phones exist in all. they are clearly the us government
 standard.
 
 so why does the doj need to buy new phones that, unlike stu-iiis, will
 not be certified for classified traffic, and in all likelihood will
 not be compatible with existing stu-iiis?
 
 unless, of course, they're gearing up for large scale decryption of
 civilian clipper users, and they need compatible hardware...
