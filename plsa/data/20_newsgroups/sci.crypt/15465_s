 and the initiative for actual implementation.  clinton is not just an
 innocent bystander here - they didn't just slap his name on it without
 consulting him.  what exactly is his extensive history of individual

 with this?  he just went back on his pledge to cut the espionage
 budget, and is now asking for more money than even bush wanted.
