 unknown to me, found it interesting. i thought i would post an article i
 found in the saturday, april 17, 1993 toronto star:
 
                   'clipper chip' to protect privacy
 
    washington (reuter) - president bill clinton announced yesterday a
 plan to plant a new "clipper chip" in every government telephone and
 computer line to prevent eavesdropping.
 
    eventually the chips, developed by the government's national
 institute for standards and technology, would be used by commercial and
 private electronics communication users.
 
    the white house said that to assure privacy, each device containing
 the encryption devices would be assigned two unique "keys" - numbers
 that will be needed by government agencies to decode messages.
 
    the attorney-general has been assigned the task of arranging that the
 keys are deposited in two "key-escrow" data bases. access to them would
 be limited to government officials with legal authorization to conduct a
 wiretap, the white house said in a statement.
