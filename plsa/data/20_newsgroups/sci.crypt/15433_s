 read the constitution yourself.  the second amendment says the right to bear
 arms shall not be infringed, so a well regulated militia may be more easily
 formed.  i have an interpretation of the second that shows there are no 
 qualifications to the right to keep and bear arms.  if you want, i can e-mail
 it to you.  by the way, gun talk belongs in talk.politics.guns.
