 you can find what you're looking for on hundreds of sites worldwide.  try
 
 	anonymous ftp to nic.funet.fi (finland)
 
 	/pub/unix/4.3bsd/net2/lib/libc/gen/crypt.c.z
 
 this includes source code for fully-functional des encryption and decryption.
 
 there are some who believe that public domain code is exportable, some
 who don't.  make your own judgements, but it seems obvious to me.
