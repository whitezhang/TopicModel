 okay, let's suppose that the nsa/nist/mykotronix registered
 key system becomes standard and i'm able to buy such a system
 from my local radio shack. every phone comes with a built in
 chip and the government has the key to every phone call. 
 i go and buy a phone and dutifully register the key. 
 
 what's to prevent me from swapping phones with a friend or 
 buying a used phone at a garage sale? whooa. the secret registered
 keys just became unsynchronized. when the government comes 
 to listen in, they only receive gobbledly-gook because the 
 secret key registered under my name isn't the right one. 
 
 that leads me to conjecture that:
 
 1) the system isn't that secure. there are just two master keys
 that work for all the phones in the country. the part about
 registering your keys is just bogus. 
 
 or 
 
 2) the system is vulnerable to simple phone swapping attacks
 like this. criminals will quickly figure this out and go to
 town.
 
 in either case, i think we need to look at this a bit deeper."'jbl)mw:wxld2
