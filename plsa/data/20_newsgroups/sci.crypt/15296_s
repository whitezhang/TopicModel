 one presumes the system could work as follows:
 
 a) blank clips are manufactured by mykotronx and vlsi.  the number
 produced is carefully audited and they are shipped to the first
 escrow house.
 
 it programs the chips with its half the key, and prints out a paper slip
 with the key half and non-secret chip serial number.   the reams of paper
 are filed in locked boxes in the vault, a fuse is burnt in the chip so
 that the key is now unreadable.
 
 the chip then goes to the next escrow house, where the same thing is
 done.  this continues through n escrow houses, perhaps, could be more than
 2.
 
 the last one provides the chip to the cellular phone maker.
 
 and yes, this has to be a public key system or it would be almost
 impossible to handle.  it might not be rsa, but that does not mean
 that pkp doesn't get paid.  until 1997, pkp has the patent on the
 general concept of public key encryption, as well as the particular
 implementation known as rsa.
