 but the nsa will not be doing any wiretapping.  the actual wiretapping will,
 presumably, be conducted by the fbi.  of course, the capability for this was
 provided by the nsa, but i think that they are still within the limitations
 of their charter.
 
 i realize this is a fine point, and some may differ, but this is my opinion.
 although i don't care for clipper and won't support or use it, i don't see
 the nsa as having overstepped their bounds.
