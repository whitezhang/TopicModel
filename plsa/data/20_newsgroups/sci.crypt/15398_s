 agreed. no agency such as the nsa (or whoever) would approve the public 
 release of a crypto-system, if they didn't already have the technical
 means or the know-how to decrypt everything at their whim. surely the whole
 point of all this madness is to make joe public think that his/her
 communications will be kept safe, while james bond at the nsa can, if need
 be, have full, decrypted access to someone's communications? that'll be
 quite a heist, if they can pull it off. 
 
 
 i thought that the us government were going to release the algorithm to a
 panel of "carefully chosen experts", who would then "study it deeply, and
 report their findings"? exactly who will these people be? academics? or
 government-sponsored researchers? tiny-toons?

 i can only hope that the same sort of thing doesn't start filtering over
 into the ears of the uk government, and if the european parliament gets
 wind of it, well, we can kiss goodbye to any form of democracy in europe 
 at all.

 hallelujah! :-)
