 for those with out ftp access, try nitv-bbs (see .sig).  i have the following:
 (all from nic.funet.fi, garbo.uwasa.fi, sony.com, and ftp.uni-erlangen.de)
 
 platform    execs   source   patch4src   xtras  bbs file area    fido freqname
 
 dos           x       x                    x      login         pgpdos, pgpsdos
 mac           x       x                           nonibm        pgpmac, pgpsmac

 unix          x       x                           nonibm        pgpunx
 
 ? = haven't looked in the archive to see if it has source or not (usually 
 because i can't handle the format).  for fidonet freq magic-names, the
 pgps??? names are source code, others are either execs or execs + src 
 [+ extras], or in the case of next, just a patch (you still need one of
 the full source code packages).
 
 nitv-bbs is free.  this is not an ad, it is a public service announcement.
