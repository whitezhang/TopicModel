 oh? hellman said ``each user will get to choose his or her own key.''
 that's the key which i called k_p, the session key. according to
 hellman, if alice and bob are communicating with the clipper chip,
 then alice chooses ``her own key'' and bob chooses ``his own key.''
 this is incompatible with the suggestion that when alice and bob are
 talking, they use a _common_ k_p, chosen by classical or public-key
 approaches.
 
 the protocol/key-management description published so far is either
 incomplete or incorrect. it leaves me with no idea of how the system
 would actually _work_. i hope the cpsr foia request succeeds so that
 we get full details.
