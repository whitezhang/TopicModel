 the point you all seem to have missed was covered when the uk cellphone
 scrambling system was discussed.  incidentally, my mp has responded to
 my questions on that issue, and it appears that the uk and other `approved'
 countries will get the secure a5 encryption, and `dodgy' countries will
 get a5x.  existing mobile equipment will drop to clear mode when used with
 a5x systems, but newer equipment will use a5/a5x/clear depending on the
 capabilities of the base station.
 
 the cops/feds do *not* need to be able to get hold of your private key to
 listen in to cellular conversations.  encryption is not end-to-end, but 
 cellphone to base-station - it *has* to be this way so that cellular users
 and fixed installations can talk to each other.  for cellular to cellular
 calls, the transmission is decrypted at the base-station, passed to another
 base-station and re-encrypted.  the cops/feds can listen to the unscrambled
 call *provided* they get a warrant to tap into the cellular provider's
 equipment.  the only reason for wanting a crackable system is so they can
 listen without having to obtain a warrant.
 
 but, maybe the clipper system is secure, and they really do need a warrant
 to get the key out of escrow before they can listen in using a scanner (see
 above - they don't *have* to go down this route anyway).  i have my doubts,
 but even if true once they have the key they will *never* again need a
 warrant to tap into that particular phone whenever they want.  `well, judge,
 it appears he wasn't a drug-dealer after all, so naturally we'll stop
 listening in'...
 
 you have every reason to be scared shitless.  take a look at the records
 of mccarthy, hoover (j. edgar, not the cleaner - though they both excelled at
 sucking) and nixon.
