 the paper was distributed (against the wishes of the nsa - i have a copy
 with a few 'illicit distribution' footnotes scribbled on it :-), and eventually
 published at one of the crypto conferences.  things were looking good.
 
 then xerox patented the algorithms.  <plonk!>
 
 i don't know of anything which uses them.  also, khafre was broken at a
 later conference and from work on a related algorithm i don't think the
 existing khufu would hold up too well against a converted differential
 cryptanalysis attack, although it can probably be changed to resist this
 type of attack....
