 
 dwight tuinstra posts a very interesting message in which he comments on the
 effects of the clipper chip on state and local police. actually, reading
 between the lines, it could be a very good thing for civil liberties in one
 respect, since it will at least prevent cowboy cops and cowboy state and
 local agancies from reading your traffic if they tap it illegally.
 
 there has been extensive discussion in the eff forum, for example, about
 inadmissible taps being used to develop information that could then lead to
 admissible evidence.  this might put a stop to such things, which must from
 time to time be simple fishing expeditions.
