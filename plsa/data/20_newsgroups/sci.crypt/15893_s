 if the administration *really* believes big-time drug dealers are the threat
 (personally i thought it was the cia and the air force that did all the real
 drug shipping :-) ) then they *ought* to take this seriously: unlike the
 kgb, drug dealers can make a most convincing argument for cooperation: "help
 us and we'll be nice and give you some money, don't help us and we'll start
 cutting off your favourite body parts"
 
 after all, it was probably an argument like that that persuaded jack ruby to
 shoot oswald in full view of the police.  life in jail probably seems much
 more preferable to most people than several weeks of something nasty
 followed by no life at all...
