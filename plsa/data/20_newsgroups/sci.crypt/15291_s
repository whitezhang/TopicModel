 umm...  i beg to differ with the phrase ``only conceivable meaning''.
 the sdns protocols, for example, make explicit provision for multiple
 encryption systems, as does pem.  (and i'd love to see how they'd
 mandate this new system for pem without disclosing it....)
 
 mind you, i'm not saying that multiple algorithms will actually be
 used -- but the relevant technologies certainly provide for them, which
 certainly casts doubt on your choice of words.
