 yes -- great chapter.  elizabeth friedman (sp?) comes shining through.
 
 however, the chapter also notes that these rum runners invented their own
 crypto -- hired ex-military folks, in fact.  (how's that for a revolving
 door?)
 
 now, given that today's rum runners (coke runners, actually) have even more
 money than yesterday's, it's reasonable to expect them to have even better
 cryptography.  i doubt they have a chip foundry of their own yet, but ....
 
 so, my question of the fbi/nist/nsa is: "how are you going to make the rum
 runners use the clipper chip?"
 
 answer:  	you're not.
 
 question:	ok -- in that case, your justification for taking away our
 		rights has evaporated.  how do you justify our loss of rights
 		if you can't use the drug dealers and terrorists?
