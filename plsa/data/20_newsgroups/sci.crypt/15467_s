 other alternatives include output of vmstat, iostat, pstat and friends
 with various flags, or even better crash. 
 
 e.g. on an rs/6000 (aix 3.2) you can get lots of relatively
 unpredicatble data out of crash. (the output from the following script 
 usually gives about 600k of goo on a moderately busy system.)
 
 #!/bin/sh
 crash <<!
 proc -
 tty
 stack
 pcb
 callout
 vfs -
 socket
 vnode
 inode -
