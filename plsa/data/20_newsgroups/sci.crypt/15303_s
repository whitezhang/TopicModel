 well, isn't that interesting.  dorothy denning, mitch kapor, marc
 rotenberg, ron rivest, jim bidzos, and others.  the government, rsa,
 tis, cpsr, and the eff are all represented.  i don't suppose anybody
 within any of these organizations would care to comment?  or is this
 just the white house's idea of a cruel joke on these peoples' inboxes?
