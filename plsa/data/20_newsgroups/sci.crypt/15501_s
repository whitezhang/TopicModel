 secrecy in clipper chip
 
 the serial number of the clipper chip is encrypted with the system key and
 transmitted as one part of a three part message.
 
 presumably the protocol can be recovered (if by nothing else, differential
 analysis).
 
 postulate if you will, a chip (or logic) sitting between the clipper chip
 and its communications channel.  the purpose of this chip is twofold:
     
 	1) transmit channel
 
 	    the spoof chip xors the 30 bit encrypted serial number with
 	    a secondary keying variable.  this renders the serial number
 	    unrecoverable with just the system key
 
 	2) recieve channel
 
 	    the spoof chip xors the incoming encrypted serial number
 	    with a secondary keying variable (assuming the serial number
 	    is necessary for local operation).
 
 this has the net result of hiding the serial number.  this gets more
 interesting when the number of serial numbers issued becomes large,
 making it difficult to distinguish between valid serial numbers and
 a spoofed serial number.  without knowing the system key, you could
 lie about the serial number, but risk detection of the lie.
 
 if you had the system key and the encryption algorithm you could
 successfully lie with a lower probability of detection by emulating the
 format of your own serial number.
 
 makes you wonder whats being hidden here?   seems  like the secrecy is
 to prevent you from lying about who you are.
