 as someone who just lived through a switch from sunos4.x.x. to
 solaris, i'll heartily agree with this. 
 
 obcrypt: one of my main gripes with solaris is its braindead mailx,
 which is -almost- enough like mail to get you hoping, but crashes
 horribly when you try to do anything useful with it. (like use pgp-
 capable sendmail replacements.)
