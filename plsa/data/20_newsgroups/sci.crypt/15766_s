 it also falls within the purview of the aclu, but that doesn't mean
 the aclu (or the eff) would be the most effective instrument to 
 "win the hearts and minds" in favor of access to cryptography. 
 
 it's precisely slogans like "cryptography makes censorship impossible"
 which stand to torpedo any attempt to generate a broad consensus in favor
 of encryption.  it is not true, and in the context of a public debate it
 would be a dangerous red herring.  advocates of strong crypto had better
 prepare themselves to answer such charges in pragmatic terms that laypeople
 and politicians can sympathize with. the usual mumblings about
 constitutional amendments are not enough.
