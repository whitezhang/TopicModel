 the people on usenet are clearly a special bunch.  we live the net, which
 is the future of our culture.  usenetters have rapid electronic access to
 information.  society in general must depend on cnn.  
 
 i can only hope we can make this information accessable by the public before
 the radical fringe, which _is_ the majority, destroys the fabric of
 this country.  freedom is never easily won.
