 besides being an infringement on our civil liberties (not the subject
 in this post), the name "clipper chip" seems very confusable with the
 "clipper" chip of intergraph.
 
 originally designed by a team at fairchild semiconductor, clipper was
 a 32-bit risc microprocessor. it is still used in some workstations,
 notably those from intergraph, the supplier of cad tools. intergraph
 acquired the clipper product line when fairchild was sold to national
 semiconductor several years back.
 
 when i first saw "clipper chip" in the announcement, i immediately
 thought the article was referring to the clipper chip i know.
 
 this seems to be grounds for intergraph to sue, but then i'm not a
 lawyer. i'd say i'm a cryptologist, but i don't want to incriminate
 myself under the laws of the new regime.
