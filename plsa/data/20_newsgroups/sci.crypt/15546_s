 it seems likely to me that that a large subset of encrypted communications
 would be archived to tape so they could be read if sometime in the future
 probable cause arises and a warrant is obtained.  i can even imagine this
 being found legal and constitutional, since nothing is actually listened to
 until a valid warrant is issued and the keys are obtained.
 
 imagine archiving all pay-phone conversations, so if someone turns out
 to be a drug dealer, you can listen to all their past drug deals.  and
 archive calls to/from suspected mafia members, potential terrorists,
 radicals, etc.  imagine the convenience for the police of being able to
 get a warrant now and listening to all the calls the world trade center
 bombers made in the past year.
 
 since archiving would be such a powerful tool and so easy to do, why
 wouldn't it happen?
