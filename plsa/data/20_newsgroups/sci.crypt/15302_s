 i'd lay long odds that it was the other way around.  clinton didn't
 just pull this plan out of any bodily orifices; the nsa has to have
 been working on it for years.  while it's possible that denning (and
 other prominent people) just happened to start arguing for such a
 system, it seems more likely that there was a suggestion involved.
 if this guess is wrong, i apologize.
