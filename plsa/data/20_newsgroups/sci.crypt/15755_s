 it's not a question just of who is holding the phone.  it's a question of
 what circuit to wiretap in the first place.  if two drug dealers are both
 using stolen cellular phones, the fbi doesn't know which lines to tap
 -- unless of course they're tapping *all* phones (maybe *all* cellular
 phones).  if they haven't tapped the connection (ie., at least one end of
 the connection) then they don't know what key to request.
