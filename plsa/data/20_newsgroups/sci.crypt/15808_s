 i just signed up for this group, so i hope i'm not missing something
 in a faq, but i'm looking for a good introduction to the mathematics
 of encryption -- particularly des and public-key, though others would
 be interesting also.  probably a good library could help me out, but i
 thought it might be even easier if i could obtain a nice article
 entirely electronically (besides, i have this rather *rational* phobia
 of libraries for reasons stemming from this "dissertation" thing
 hanging over my head :-)).  
 	i have a basic knowledge of mathematics... number-theory is a
 bit unfamiliar to me, but i've had a few graduate-level math courses
 in some other areas; anyway, i'm not a complete novice to the field.
 so probably something aimed at a basic graduate introductory level
 would be about right.  something, anyway, which is more specific than
 "a really big prime number is generated to code the message".
 	if someone knows of a good text available by ftp (or gopher),
 or would like to email me one... please let me know.  i'll probably keep
 reading this group; but it would be nice if you would email me at the
 same time, so i don't miss it.
 
 thanx, lulu...
