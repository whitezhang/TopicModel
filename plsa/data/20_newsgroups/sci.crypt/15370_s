    once it hits land you can record it if you have telco access.  the
    telco isn't supposed to give that without a warrant.  that's the rule today.
 
    but even so, the evidence would not be admissible, i think, unless the
    judge so ordered.  i think that even interception of the crypttext
    without a warrant would be illegal.   cops can't record today's plain
    cellular calls and then ask a judge, "hey, can we have permission to
    listen to those tapes?" can they?
 
 how long do you think it will be before it becomes legal for the
 police to record encrypted conversations "it's not violating your
 privacy because we can't read the encryption without a warrant", with the usual
 good-faith exception if they accidentally record a non-encrypted conversation.
 
 besides, it's covered by the drug exception to the fourth amendment...
