 i have a couple reasons why i would be more likely to trust this algorithm:
 	1. the algorithm will be made totally public, once it is patented.
 	2. the keys will not be escrowed.
 of course if either of these is not true, i will not use this new algorithm.
 since i have never seen this new algorithm, i have no idea how secure it is
 yet.

 i can't make any judgements about the algorithm itself yet, but i do notice
 that the creators of this algorithm are being more open about how the
 thing works, and is willing to make it public, showing that after a bit
 of scrutiny, any weaknesses will probably be revealed, while we don't know
 about clipper.
