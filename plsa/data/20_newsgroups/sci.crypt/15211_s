 getting rid of the keys is actually pretty easy to do automatically on
 a communications link, as opposed to storage where the keys have to be
 retained somehow as long as the owner wants to be able to retrieve the
 data.
 
 the right way to do communications security is to generate a random
 session key with diffie hellman, use it for a while and then destroy
 it. once it's gone, there's no getting it back, and no way to decrypt
 recordings of the conversation.
 
 to make sure you aren't being attacked by a man in the middle, you
 have to authenticate your dh exchanges. the at&t secure phone does
 this by displaying the dh key so you can compare them verbally over
 the phone. this is nice and simple, but it relies on user awareness
 plus the inability of the man in the middle to duplicate the users'
 voices.
 
 a better way is to authenticate the exchanges with rsa. since you'd
 never use rsa for actual encryption, compromising your rsa secret key
 would only allow someone to impersonate you in a future conversation,
 and even that only until you revoke your public key.  they would still
 not be able to decrypt recordings of prior conversations for which the
 session keys have been destroyed.
 
 i'm convinced that this is how the government's own secure phones
 (the stu-iii) must work. neat, eh?
