    hmmmm.  i think, with really large keyspaces like this, you need to
 alter the strategy discussed for des.  attempt decryption of several
 blocks, and check the disctribution of the contents.  i don't think it's
 at all feasible to keep 2**80 encryptions of a known plaintext block on
 *any* amount of tape or cd-rom.  and certainly not 2**128 such encrypted
 blocks.  (anyone know a cheap way of converting every atom in the solar
 system into a one bit storage device?)
  
    actually, a keysearch of this kind shouldn't be much worse than the
 simpler kind in terms of speed.  it's just that you have to do it over
 for *every* encrypted message.
  
    dumb question:  has anyone ever done any serious research on how many
 legitimate ascii-encoded 8-byte blocks there are that could be part of
 an english sentence?  for attacking des in ecb mode, it seems like a
 dictionary of this kind might be pretty valuable....
