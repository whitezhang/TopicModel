 	hate to mess up your point, but it is incredibly easy to learn how
 to make a nuclear weapon.  the hard part is getting the radioactives to
 put in it.  have you ever read tom clancy's _the sum of all fears_?  it
 describes in great detail how a palestinian terrorist group constructed a
 nuclear bomb using stolen (actually found) plutonium, with some help from
 an east german nuclear physicist.  for some non fiction, read tom clancy's
 article _five minutes till midnight_.  it shows how a terrorist group could
 construct a nuke using neptunium, a low grade radioactive waste product
 dumped in toxic waste sites and forgotten about.  he also claims information
 on constructing a nuke is easily found in any large library.  sounds
 kind of scary, doesn't it? :-(

 	don't know whether you could get busted for warning of a speedtrap.
