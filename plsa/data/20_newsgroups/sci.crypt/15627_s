 i guess the cryptowranglers read this group too.  but of
 course i knew that because it is so easy to do.  there is
 not a single doubt in my mind that every byte that passes
 every significant gateway or 'bone is captured for the
 colligation of data about __________?  (maybe your name is here).
 
 maybe we should start a newsgroup for the distribution of encrypted 
 posts intended of members of affinity groups with a shared private
 key.  for example at the coming up cypherpunks meeting, a private
 key corresponding to that particular meeting could be passed out
 by a moderator.  minutes, followup comments to other participants,
 and so on could be posted to the alt.encrypted group for the use
 of the people who attended. communiques intended by the group for
 non-attendees could of course just be signed using the private key
 but otherwises not encrypted.
 
 starting a alt.encrypted newsgroup rather than just maintaining
 mailing lists is better for several reasons.  first, it would be
 easier to archive for people who might join a group "late" and
 who might like to easily read earlier posts; second, traffic analysis
 to know exactly to whom an affinity message is directed would be foiled;
 three, a newsgroup is much more public and would serve to publicize
 available privacy measures on the internet.
 
 and it would be fun to accumulate a secret keyring full of such
 keys -- it beats giving out t-shirts as a door prize.
 
 we could send a copy of alt.encrypted directly to judge william
 sessions or admiral studeman to save them the time of having it
 collected for them.
