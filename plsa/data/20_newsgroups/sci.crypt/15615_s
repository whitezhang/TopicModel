 generally, an organization has influence in proportion to:
 
 	the narrowness of its objectives
 	the number of members
 	the strength of belief of its members
 
 this is why the pro- and anti-abortion groups are so strong: narrow objectives,
 lots of interested members who are real passionate.
 
 for this reason, mixing with the nra is probably a bad idea.  it diffuses
 the interests of both groups.  it may well diminish the passion index
 of the combined organization.  it is not clear it would greatly enlarge
 the nra.
 
 so, i believe a new organization, which may cooperate with nra where the
 two organization's interest coincide, is the optimum strategy.
