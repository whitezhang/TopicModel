 								yeah!
 
 	the algorithm is classified because a military contract (or similar
 government equivalent to military) has been let for this "proprietary"
 design that the feds say that nsa developed.  is there a patent?  is that
 patent publicly available?  my betting is that that too is classified.
 
 	if the algorithm were made public, or reverse-engineered, it would
 compromise not only the goal of justice of being able to read every chip
 users cypto-data but would reduce profits for the selected chip maker.
 
 	wouldn't that just be too bad?
