 so what? justices william brennan, thurgood marshall, john paul
 stevens, and byron white are associated with a plurality supreme court
 decision that prevented the removal of "anti-american, anti-christian,
 anti-semitic, and just plain filthy" books from a public high school
 library [_board of education v. pico_ (1982)]. does this mean that
 they could no longer defend free expression and privacy?
