 she hasn't.  dorothy denning has spent many years earning the
 professional respect of her colleagues, and something won in this
 manner is not easily lost.  her support of the clipper -- no matter
 how unpopular that position may be -- serves far more to enhance the
 clipper's respectability than to diminish her own.
