 wouldn't this method be vulnerable against a "birthday" attack?
 currently a cracker needs to find the _only_ (*1) key that produces
 the given ciphertext.  he has to try about 2^63 keys on the average.
 in the proposed method the cracker only needs _any pair_ of key halves.
 if he can store about 2^32 guesses for one half, he is likely to find
 a mathching pair in about 2^32 guesses.  (here i have assumed that the
 des-encryption is reversable, if the key is guessed.  is this so or do
 the modifications of the s-boxes by the salt bits make it non-reversable?)
 
 *1 probably there is only one key; i think there is 1 chance in about 128
 that there are two or more keys (can anyone verify this?), but this doesn't
 help the cracker much.
