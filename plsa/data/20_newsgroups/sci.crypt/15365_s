 
 i envision incorporation of new standart into
 various communication systems, thus making it prevalent on the market & 
 therefore cheap. the way to do that may be detaching crypto chip from 
 communication equipment. it seems logical to provide clipper chip 
 to the end-user not as a part of phone, fax, modem & like but in the
 form of smart-card compatible with various telecomm. products. banks 
 will encourage extensive use of new cards to make transactions by phone.
 natural step will be to cross-reference this card to the person in the 
 government databases - or else this new version of "wiretap proposal" 
 make no sence at all; one wish to eavesdrop (spell.) on the particular 
 person, not on the particular modem or phone.
  
 as a side note, i disagree with one poster, who said he won't care about
 ability of the government to eavesdrop, since they can do that now 
 anyway. clipper will take away electronic survelliance from citizens, 
 making it monopoly of the government. may be, we can find examples when
 interceptions made by (unauthorised) people uncovered crimes of 
 state officials ?
