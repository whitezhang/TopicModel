 hmmmmmm.  $30 seems a bit expensive.  how big is the chip?  what kind
 of packages will be used?  3 volt or 5 volt technology?  how much
 current will it draw?  i think there are many practical questions
 that haven't been answered, especially since this chip already exists!

 ok, i've got a big problem with all of this.  how in the world do you
 expect to sell these chips for even $30 after all the overhead involved
 in this programming procedure?  2-4 people, a laptop, only 300 chips at 
 a time:  give me a break.  and how long does all of this take?  even if
 it is a minute per chip, it will take the greater part of a day to 
 turn out 300 of these things.  how long do you suppose it will take to
 program those 10,000 chips mentioned above?  this is highly impractical!

 so where can i find info on this at&t device?  what kind of vocoder
 does it use?  does it require isdn phone lines?  if not, is it full
 duplex?  how does it sound?  what kind of synchronization scheme is
 used?  will all other little black boxes have to conform to at&ts choices
 of protocol, etc.?  will anybody else be allowed to build boxes that
 conform to these specifications?
