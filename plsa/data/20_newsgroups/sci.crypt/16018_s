     maybe you are using the wrong amendment.  if someone were to seize
 a safe containing your (paper) records, and demand that you produce
 the combination, the applicable defense would be on grounds of
 unreasonable search and seizure.  the police would be entitled to
 subpoena documents relating to a specific matter, but any broad search
 such as implied by impounding all your records would be unconstitutional.
 in the case of the safe, they would probably get a locksmith and
 assert that they only examined documents covered by the warrent.
 (sure!)  in the cryptographic case, their only resort would be
 rubber-hose cryptography.
 
     (this would also make a good "mental experiment" to use in
 choosing escrow agents.  would you trust this proposed agent with a
 key to your hard disk?--or half the key for that matter.)
