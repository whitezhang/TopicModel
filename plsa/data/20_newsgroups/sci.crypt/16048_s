 
 i am writing an article on clipper for network world.  i am looking for
 comments and opinions (that i can quote) on the scheme, its implications
 for security and privacy, its acceptance here and overseas, etc. 
 
 i hope this to be a balenced article, with opinions from various quarters.
 the only  catch is that your name and company affiliation will appear in
 print.
 
 i am on very tight deadline (i need to finish this wednesday night).  please
 call or e-mail responses.
 
 thanks,
 bruce
