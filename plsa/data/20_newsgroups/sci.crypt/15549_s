         washington (upi) -- the war on drugs is about to get a fresh
 start, president clinton told delegates to the national federation
 of police commisioners convention in washington.
         in the first speech on the drug issue since his innaugural,
 clinton said that his planned escalation of the drug war ``would make
 everything so far seem so half-hearted that for all practical
 purposes this war is only beginning now.'' he repeatedly emphasized
 his view that ``regardless of what has been tried, or who has tried
 it, or how long they've been trying it, this is day one to me.''
 the audience at the convention, whose theme is ``how do we spell
 fiscal relief?  f-o-r-f-e-i-t-u-r-e,'' interrupted clinton frequently
 with applause.
         clinton's program, presented in the speech, follows the
 outline given in his campaign position papers: a cabinet-level drug
 czar and ``boot camps'' for first-time youthful offenders.  he did,
 however, cover in more detail his plans for improved enforcement
 methods.  ``this year's crime bill will have teeth, not bare gums,''
 clinton said.  in particular, his administration will place strict
 controls on data formats and protocols, and require the registration
 of so-called ``cryptographic keys,'' in the hope of denying drug
 dealers the ability to communicate in secret.  clinton said the
 approach could be used for crackdowns on other forms of underground
 economic activity, such as ``the deficit-causing tax evaders who
 live in luxury at the expense of our grandchildren.''
         clinton expressed optimism that the drug war can be won
 ``because even though not everyone voted for bill clinton last
 november, everyone did vote for a candidate who shares my sense of
 urgency about fighting the drug menace.  the advocates of
 legalization -- the advocates of surrender -- may be very good at
 making noise,'' clinton said.  ``but when the american people cast
 their ballots, it only proved what i knew all along -- that the
 advocates of surrender are nothing more than a microscopic fringe.''
