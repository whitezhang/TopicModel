 hey, it's better than the status quo.
 
 i am far less worried about "the feds" tapping my phone than high school 
 scanner surfers who get their kicks out of eavesdropping on cellular and 
 cordless phone calls.
 
 it would be stupid to rely on even a "clipperized" channel for truly 
 sensitive material, but it *does* seem to finally offer a reasonable way to 
 guard against casual eavesdropping.  for example, even with my strong "right 
 to bear arms" view of the private right to possess and use strong 
 cryptosystems, the system as described provides enough security that i would 
 actually buy a cordless phone, and would be much less wary of using cellular 
 phones, walkie-talkies, and so on.  as long as it's only used for mass-market 
 voice scrambling, i actually don't see a problem with it.
 
 if you want more security than it offers, use something different.  use pkcs 
 for electronic mail, celp over des or triple des with diffie-hellman key 
 exchange for your voice traffic, or whatever.
 
 and yes, i'd rather just see all crypto restrictions lifted, but this is at 
 least an incrememental improvement for certain applications...
