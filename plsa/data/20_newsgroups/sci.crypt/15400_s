 a typical example of seep-minded thinking. we all know that david
 sternlight is a jerk, but i'm afraid that in this case 90% of the
 population will think like him. realize it guys - nsa, dorothy
 denning, and the us government have already won the battle...
 
 unless... unless you succeed to wake up the people... but nah, that's
 too unlikely... the events are happening too fast, cryptography is a
 too sophisticated issue, and almost nobody cares anyway... a few
 thousand of net.readers won't make the difference, if millions are
 caught asleep... too sad... :-(((((
