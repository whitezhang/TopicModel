 about 18 months ago, i heard a report on npr about a 900-number
 "1-900-sto-pper" or some such, for placing untraceable calls.
 you call them, and on "bong" tone dial the number you want to
 call; they told the npr interviewer that nothing short of a
 court order (which they'd fight) would make them release their
 records.
