 i can buy a des keysearch machine off the shelf now for approx $500k, but
 it is not sold by that name. go buy a circuit emulation machine (eg. quickturn)
 containing a bunch of fpgas, (say 500 to 1000 3090's), and program each
 to be a des search engine. lets say 500 chips, running at 10mhz = 5g tests/sec.
 time is 14e6 sec max = 23 weeks, 12 weeks average. can't wait that long?
 buy a bigger machine.
