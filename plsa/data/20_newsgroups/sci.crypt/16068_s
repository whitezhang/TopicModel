 well, regardless of what policy liabilities anyone in washington may think
 eff has, it is going ahead aggressively attacking the assumptions that are
 behind the administrations clipper chip initiative.  for all the reasons
 stated here.  in washington, you have to work under the assumption that 
 everyone has some liabilities.  government and non-governmental 
 organizations alike all share the same glass house.  eff is variously
 identified as the hacker defense fund, the first amendment absolutists,
 the new communists, etc, but it is also an acknowledged leader in the
 civil liberties arena and is respected as a serious player in the 
 policy circles.  so unless there is another organization with the
 credibility and clout and right policy stance that you know of in
 washington, please don't count eff out as a valid representative of
 your views in the clipper chip matter.
