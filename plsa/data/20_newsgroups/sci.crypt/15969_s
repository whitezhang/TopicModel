    it's not clipper, it's any encryption system.  i've seen a number of
    designs; they generally involve a multi-line cleartext bridge.
 
 depending on the encryption system, so long as everyone has the same
 key, it can be done.  for example, i was using "vat", which is an
 internet audio tool, for a conference call, and we were encrypting the
 session.  (unfortunately, one site was doing more work, and didn't
 have the cpu for it, so it didn't sound all that good at a different
 site)
 
 so, you don't neccessarily have to have a clear-text bridge.  but if
 you do, its totally internal to one of the sites involved in the
 conversation....
