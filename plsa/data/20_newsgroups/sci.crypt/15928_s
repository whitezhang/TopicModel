 nobody@alumni.cco.caltech.edu correctly states jerry berman's 1985 view on
 privacy, but he mistakenly assumes that this represents berman's 1993 view as
 eff executive director.
 
 as one of the people who convinced jerry that legal protections for privacy
 are insufficient, and that technical measures, especially public key
 cryptography, are also vitally necessary, i can tell you that jerry and eff
 are fully committed to this position.
 
 the previous poster is apparently unaware of a long series of eff positions in
 support of this view.  i suggest those interested read eff's position on
 clipper or our other work in digital privacy.  check ftp.eff.org for more
 details.
 
 one of the great things about human beings is that they are capable of change
 and evolution in their thinking.  the idea that crypto is critical to privacy
 is one which is no longer limited to certain net afficianados, but is 
 spreading to parts of the public policy community in washington.
