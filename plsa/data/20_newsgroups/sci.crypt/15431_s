 
 the system, or 'family', key would appear to be cryptographically
 useless, since *every* chip must know it and be able to remove its
 effects from the bitstream.  i daresay that it will be widely known
 almost immediately after this system is deployed, and since it's been
 pointed out that there is not a separate decrypt key -- the same key
 is used for both encryption and decryption -- there goes any benefit
 to the use of a system-wide key in skipjack.

 taken to calling themselves 'hackers', but i consider them irrelevant
 to the true meaning of the word; just as the mafia calls themselves
 'businessmen' but nobody pays that fact any attention."            rab'90
