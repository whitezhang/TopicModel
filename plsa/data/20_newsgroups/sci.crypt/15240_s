 it occurs to me that if they get a wiretap order on you, and the escrow
 houses release your code to the cops, your code is now no longer secure.
 
 it's in the hands of cops, and while i am sure most of the time they are
 good, their security will not be as good as the escrow houses.
 
 
 what this effectively means is that if they perform a wiretap on you,
 at the end of the wiretap, they should be obligated to inform you that
 a tap was performed, and replace (for free) the clipper chip in your
 cellular phone so that it is once again a code known only to the
 escrow houses.
 
 do the police normally reveal every tap they do even if no charges are
 laid?   in many ways, it would be a positive step if they had to.
 judges set time limits on warrants, i assume.  at the end of the time
 limit they should have to renew or replace your chip.
 
 
 that's if we go with this scheme, which i am not sure i agree with.
