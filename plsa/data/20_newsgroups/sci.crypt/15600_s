    but there is a much more pernicious problem with the scheme as
 proposed.  building a brute force machine to test 2^40 possible keys
 if you have the other half from one escrow agent is easy.  (one chip,
 one test per microsecond gives you one break every two weeks, and that
 break gives you all messages involving that phone.)
 
    the xor scheme so that the files from one escrow agent gives you
 nothing is an improvement, but notice that xoring with (truely random)
 bit strings allows for an arbitrary number of escrow agents.  using +
 for xor, sk for the escrowed key, and a and b for two random bit
 strings, hand sk+a+b, sk+a, and sk+b to three escrow agents.  it is
 possible to come with an encoding scheme to match any escrow pattern,
 for example 3 of 4, such that fewer cooperating escrow agents gives
 the cracking agency no benefit.
