   there is a description of something called a "fair crypto system" in the
 may 1993 issue of byte, p. 134, attributed to mit professor silvio micali.
 
   the way it works is as follows:
 
   you generate your private key s, and break it up into pieces s1, s2, s3,
 s4, and s5, such that (s1 + s2 + ... + s5) mod p = s.
   you give each piece s1, s2, etc. to a different escrow agency.
   the agencies each compute g^sn mod p, and forward the result to the public
 key telephone book keeper.
   the public key telephone book keeper multiplies all the g^sn mod p, reduces
 the result to mod p, and this will be the user's public key.
 
   now, if there were several hundered recognized escrow agencies, and the user
 could give a piece of the key to each of the ones he trusted, the result would
 be something of an improvement over the proposed clipper system.
 
   i still don't think key escrow is a good idea, for both philosophical and
 security reasons, but i do offer this suggestion simply to determine whether
 escrow advocates are at all interested in considering alternatives in good
 faith, or whether the goal is to insure the use of only two agencies selected
 for spinelessness in the face of official requests.
