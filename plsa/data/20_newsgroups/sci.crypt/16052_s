         there's a better way. doesn't qualcom have a secure design
         that it decided not to market?  since they aren't going to
         use it, wouldn't the patriotic thing be to put the design in
         the public domain? how about selling a "cryptography
         educational kit" with the critical parts? something that could
         end up as a pc option board with two phone jacks?
 
         cheers,
                 marc
