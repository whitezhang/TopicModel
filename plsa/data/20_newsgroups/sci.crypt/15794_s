    i hope there are some silicon jocks on the committee who can follow
    the algorithm through to hardware.  while i doubt the nsa would pull
    any monkey business on this point -- they have to expect that the
    chip will be reverse-engineered sooner or later -- it's an obvious
    opportunity to introduce additional holes.
 
 the chip isn't the place to pull the monkey business - you do it in
 the key generation, either by having a mathematical backdoor,
 or by having the program on the laptop that supposedly generates the
 keys also save a copy of s1 and s2 and leak it out somehow,
 or by having the program that supposedly puts the official keys
 on the chip actually put a *different* key there (very hard to detect,
 since the escrow agents have to either trust the nsa laptop or
 give each other the s* keys, and they still don't know the algorithm.)
 or have the chip-burner at the factory make copies of the keys.
 or whatever.
