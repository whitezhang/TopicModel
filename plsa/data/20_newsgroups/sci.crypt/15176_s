 identity
 ========
 
 _____
 <1.1> what is `identity' on the internet?
 
   generally, today people's `identity' on the internet is primarily
   determined by their email address in the sense that this is their
   most unchanging 'face' in the electronic realm.   this is your
   login name qualified by the complete address domain information,
   for example ``ld231782@longs.lance.colostate.edu''.  people see
   this address when receiving mail or reading usenet posts from you
   and in other situations where programs record usage.  some obsolete
   forms of addresses (such as bitnet) still persist.
 
   in email messages, additional information on the path that a message
   takes is prepended to the message received by the recipient.  this
   information identifies the chain of hosts involved in the
   transmission and is a very accurate trace of its origination.  this
   type of identify-and-forward protocol is also used in the usenet
   protocol to a lesser extent.  forging these fields requires
   corrupted mailing software at sites involved in the forwarding and
   is very uncommon.  not so uncommon is forging the chain at the
   origination point, so that all initial sites in the list are faked
   at the time the message is created.  tracing these messages can be
   difficult or impossible when the initial faked fields are names of
   real machines and represent real transfer routes.
 
 _____
 <1.2> why is identity (un)important on the internet?
 
   the concept of identity is closely intertwined with communication,
   privacy, and security, which in turn are all critical aspects of
   computer networks. for example, the convenience of communication
   afforded by email would be impossible without conventions for
   identification.  but there are many potential abuses of identity
   possible that can have very severe consequences, with massive
   computer networks at the forefront of the issue, which can
   potentially either exacerbate or solve these problems.
 
   verifying that an identity is correct is called `authentication',
   and one classic example of the problems associated with it is
   h.g.well's ``war of the worlds'' radio broadcast that fooled
   segments of the population into thinking that an alien invasion was
   in progress.  hoaxes of this order are not uncommon on usenet and
   forged identities makes them more insidious.  people and their
   reputations can be assaulted by forgery.
 
   however, the fluidity of identity on the internet is for some one of
   its most attractive features. identity is just as useful as it is
   harmful.  a professor might carefully explain a topic until he
   finds he is talking to an undergraduate. a person of a particular
   occupation may be able to converse with others who might normally
   shun him.  some prejudices are erased, but, on the other hand, many
   prejudices are useful!  a scientist might argue he can better
   evaluate the findings of a paper as a reviewer if he knows more
   about the authors.  likewise, he may be more likely to reject it
   based on unfair or irrelevant criteria.  on the other side of the
   connection,  the author may find identities of reviewers useful in
   exerting pressure for acceptance.
 
   identity is especially crucial in establishing and regulating
   `credit' (not necessarily financial) and `ownership' and `usage'. 
   many functions in society demand reliable and accurate techniques
   for identification. heavy reliance will be placed on digital
   authentication as global economies become increasingly electronic. 
   many government functions and services are based on identification,
   and law enforcement frequently hinges on it.  hence, employees of
   many government organizations push toward stronger identification
   structures.  but when does identification invade privacy?
 
   the growth of the internet is provoking social forces of massive
   proportions. decisions made now on issues of identity will affect
   many future users, especially as the network becomes increasingly
   global, universal, widespread, and entrenched; and the positive or
   adverse affects of these actions, intended and inadvertent,  will
   literally be magnified exponentially.
 
 _____
 <1.3> how does my email address (not) identify me and my background?
 
   your email address may contain information that influences people's
   perceptions of your background.  the address may `identify' you as
   from a department at a particular university, an employee at a
   company, or a government worker.  it may contain your last name,
   initials, or cryptic identification codes independent of both.  in
   the us some are based on parts of social security numbers.  others
   are in the form 'u2338' where the number is incremented in the
   order that new users are added to the system.
 
   standard internet addresses  also can contain information  on your
   broad geographical location or nationhood.  however, none of this
   information is guaranteed to be correct or be there at all.  the
   fields in the domain qualification of the username are based on
   rather arbitrary organization, such as (mostly invisible) network
   cabling distributions.  the only point to make is that early fields
   in the address are more specific (such as specific computer names
   or local networks) and the later ones the most general (such as
   continental domains).  typically the first field is the name of the
   computer receiving mail.
 
   gleaning information from the email address alone is sometimes an
   inspired art or an inconsistent and futile exercise.  (for more
   information, see the faqs on email  addresses and known
   geographical distributions below.)  however, unix utilities exist
   to aid in the quest (see the question on this).

 _____
 <1.4> how can i find out more about somebody with a given email address?
 
   one simple way is to send email to that address, asking.  another
   way is to send mail to the postmaster at that address (i.e.
   postmaster@address), although the postmaster's job is more to help
   find user id's of particular people given their real name and solve
   mail routing problems.  the sysadmin (i.e. `root@address') may also
   be able to supply information.  users with related email address
   may have information.  however, all of these methods rely on the
   time and patience of others so use them minimally.
 
   one of the most basic tools for determining identity over the
   internet is the unix utility 'finger'.  the basic syntax is:
 
     finger user@here.there.everywhere
 
   this utility uses communication protocols to query the computer
   named in the address for information on the user named.  the
   response is generated completely by the receiving computer and may
   be in any format.  possible responses are as follows:
 
   - a message `unknown host' meaning some aspect of the address is
     incorrect, two lines with no information and '???'.
   
   - a message 'in real life: ???' in which case the receiving computer
     could not find any kind of a match on the username. the finger
     utility may return this response in other situations.
   
   - a listing of information associated with multiple users. some
     computers will search only for matching user ids, others will
     attempt to find the username you specified as a substring of all
     actual full names of users kept in a local database.
   
   at some sites 'finger' can be used to get a list of all users on the
   system with a `finger @address'.  in general this is often
   considered weak security, however, because `attackers' know valid
   user id's to `crack' passwords.
 
   more information on the fields returned by `finger' is given below. 
   more information on `finger' and locating people's email addresses
   is given in the email faq (such as the whois lookup utility).  just
   as you can use these means to find out about others, they can use
   them to find out about you.  you can `finger' yourself to find out
   what is publicly reported by your unix system about you.  be
   careful when modifying `finger' data; virtually anyone with
   internet access worldwide can query this information.  in one
   amazing case, the new york times writer j. markoff uncovered the
   identity of r. morris, author of the internet worm,  through
   the use of an anonymous tip and 'finger'.  see the book cyberspace
   by k. hafner and j. markoff.
 
 _____
 <1.5> why is identification (un)stable on the internet?
 
   generally, identity is an amorphous and almost nonexistent concept
   on the internet for a variety of reasons.  one is the inherent
   fluidity of `cyberspace' where people emerge and submerge
   frequently, and absences are not readily noted in the `community'. 
   most people remember faces and voices, the primary means of casual
   identification in the 'real world'.  the arbitary and cryptic 
   sequences of letters and digits comprising most email addresses are
   not particularly noticeable or memorable and far from a unique
   identification of an individual, who may use multiple accounts on
   multiple machines anywhere in the world.
 
   currently internet users do not really have any great assurances
   that the messages in email and usenet are from who they appear to
   be. a person's mailing address is far from an identification of an
   individual.  
   
   - anyone with access to the account, e.g. they know the password,
     either legitimately or otherwise, can send mail with that address
     in the from: line.
   
   - email addresses for an individual tend to change frequently as
     they switch jobs or make moves inside their organizations. 
 
   - as part of current mailing protocol standards, forging the from:
     line in mail messages is a fairly trivial operation for many
     hackers.
     
   the status and path information prepended to messages by
   intermediate hosts is generally unforgeable. in general, while
   possible, forgeries are fairly rare on most newsgroups and in
   email.  besides these pathological cases abve there are many basic
   problems with today's internet protocols affecting identification
   on the internet:
 
   - internet mail standards, described in rfc-822, are still evolving
     rapidly and not entirely orderly.  for example, standards for
     mail address `munging' or `parsing' tend to vary slightly between
     sites and frequently mean the difference between finding
     addresses and bouncing mail.
   
   - domain names and computer names are frequently changed at sites,
     and there are delays in the propagation of this data.
   
   - addresses cannot be resolved when certain critical computers
     crash, such as the receiving computer or other computers involved
     in resolving names into addresses called `nameservers'. 
   
   - a whole slew of problems is associated with  `nameservers'; if
     they are not updated they will not find name addresses, and even
     the operation of what constitutes `updating' has different
     interpretations at different sites.
   
   the current internet mailing and addressing protocols are slightly
   anachronistic in that they were created when the network was
   somewhat obscure and not widespread, with only a fraction of the
   traffic it now sees.  today a large proportion of internet traffic
   is email, comprising  millions of messages.
 
 _____
 <1.6> what is the future of identification on the internet?
 
   some new technologies and standards are introducing facial images
   and voice messages  into mail and these will improve the sense of
   community that comes from the familiarity of identification.
   however, they are not currently widespread, require large amounts
   of data transfer, standardized software, and make some compromises
   in privacy.
 
   promising new cryptographic techniques may make 'digital signatures'
   and 'digital authentication' common (see below).  also, the trend
   in usenet standards is toward greater authentication of posted
   information.  on the other hand, advances in ensuring anonymity
   (such as remailers) are forthcoming.  see below.
 
 
 privacy
 =======
 
 _____
 <2.1> what is `privacy' on the internet?
 
   generally, while `privacy' has multiple connotations in society and
   perhaps even more on the internet, in cyberspace most take it to
   mean that you have exclusive use and access to your account and the
   data stored on and and directed to it (such as email), and you do
   not encounter arbitrary restrictions or searches.  in other words, 
   others may obtain data associated with your account, but not
   without your permission.  these ideas are probably both fairly
   limiting and liberal in their scope in what most internet users
   consider their private domains.  some users don't expect or want
   any privacy, some expect and demand it.
 
 _____
 <2.2> why is privacy (un)important on the internet?
 
   this is a somewhat debatable and inflammatory topic, arousing
   passionate opinions.  on the internet, some take privacy for
   granted and are rudely surprised to find it tenuous or nonexistent.
   most governments have rules that protect privacy (such as the
   illegal search and seizure clause of the u.s. constitution, adopted
   by others) but have many that are antithetical to it (such as laws
   prohibiting secret communications or allowing wiretapping). these
   rules generally carry over to the internet with few specific rules
   governing it.  however, the legal repercussions of the global
   internet are still largely unknown and untested (i.e. no strong
   legal precedents and court cases).  the fact that internet traffic
   frequently passes past international boundaries, and is not
   centrally managed, significantly complicates and strongly
   discourages its regulation.
 
 _____
 <2.3> how (in)secure are internet networks?
 
   - `theoretically' people at any site in the chain of sites with
     access to hardware and network media that transmits data over the
     internet  could potentially monitor or archive it. however, the
     sheer volume and general 'noise' inherent to this data makes
     these scenarios highly improbable, even by government agencies
     with supposedly vast funding and resources.
   
   - technologies exist to `tap' magnetic fields given off by
     electrical wires without detection.  less obscurely, any machine
     with a network connection is a potential station for traffic
     detection, but this scenario requires knowledge and access to
     very low-level hardware (the network card) to pursue, if even
     possible.
   
   - a company network general inc. is one of many that manufactures
     and markets sophisticated network monitoring tools that can
     'filter' and read packets by arbitrary criteria for
     troubleshooting purposes, but the cost of this type of device is
     prohibitive for casual use.
 
   known instances of the above types of security  breaches at a major
   scale (such as at network hubs) are very rare. the greatest risks
   tend to emerge locally.  note that all these approaches are almost
   completely defused with the use of cryptography.
     
 _____
 <2.4> how (in)secure is my account?
 
   by default, not very.  there are a multitude of factors that may
   reinforce or compromise aspects of your privacy on the internet. 
   first, your account must be secure from other users. the universal
   system is to use a password, but if it is `weak' (i.e. easy to
   guess) this security is significantly diminished.  somewhat
   surprisingly and frighteningly to some, certain  users of the
   system, particularly the administrator, generally have unlimited
   access regardless of passwords, and may grant that access to
   others.  this means that they may read any file in your account
   without detection.
 
   furthermore, not universally known, most unix systems keep fairly
   extensive accounting records of when and where you logged in, what
   commands you execute, and when they are executed (in fact, login
   information is usually public). most features of this `auditing' or
    `process accounting' information are enabled by default after the
   initial installation and the system administrator may customize it
   to strengthen or weaken it to satisfy performance or privacy aims. 
   this information is frequently consulted for troubleshooting
   purposes and may otherwise be ignored.  this data tracks
   unsuccessful login attempts and other 'suspicious' activities on
   the system. a traditional part of the unix system that tracks user
   commands is easily circumvented by the user with the use of
   symbolic links (described  in 'man ln').
   
   unix implementations vary widely particularly in tracking features
   and new sophisticated mechanisms are introduced by companies
   regularly. typically system adminstrators augment the basic unix
   functionality with public-domain programs and locally-developed
   tools for monitoring, and use them only to isolate `suspicious'
   activity as it arises (e.g. remote accesses to the 'passwd' file, incorrect
   login attempts, remote connection attempts, etc.).
   
   generally, you should expect little privacy on your account for
   various reasons:
   
   - potentially, every keystroke you type could be intercepted by
     someone else. 
 
   - system administrators make extensive backups that are completely
     invisible to users which may record the states of an account over
     many weeks. 
 
   - erased files can, under many operating systems, be undeleted. 
 
   - most automated services keep logs of use for troubleshooting or
     otherwise; for example ftp sites usually log the commands and
     record the domain originations of users, including anonymous
     ones.
 
   - some software exacerbates these problems.  see the section on
     ``x windows (in)security''.
 
   indepedent of malevolent administrators are fellow users, a much
   more commonly harmful threat. there are multiple ways to help
   ensure that your account will not be accessed by others, and
   compromises can often be traced to failures in these guidelines:
 
   - choose a secure password.  change it periodically.
   - make sure to logout always.
   - do not leave a machine unattended for long.
   - make sure no one watches you when you type your password.
   - avoid password references in email.
   - be conservative in the use of the .rhost file.
   - use utilities like `xlock' to protect a station, but be
     considerate.
 
   be wary of situations where you think you should supply your
   password.  there are only several basic situations where unix
   prompts you for a password: when you are logging in to a system or
   changing your password.  situations can arise in which prompts for
   passwords are forged by other users, especially in cases where you
   are talking to them (such as internet relay chat).  also, be  aware
   that forged login screens are one method to illegitimately obtain 
   passwords.

 _____
 <2.5> how (in)secure are my files and directories?
 
   the most important privacy considerations are related to file
   rights, and many lapses can be traced to their misunderstood nature
   or haphazard maintenance. be aware of the rights associated with
   your files and directories in unix. if the `x' (`execute') right on
   your parent directory is off for users, groups, and other, these
   users cannot gain information on anything in your directories. 
   anything less may allow others to read, change, or even delete
   files in your home directory. the rights on a directory supersede
   the rights associated with files in that directory. for a
   directory, 'x' means that access to the files (or subdirectories)
   in the directory is possible -- if you know their names.  to list
   the contents of the directory, however, requires the 'r' right.
  
   by default most accounts are accessable only to the owner, but the
   initial configuration varies between sites based on administrator
   preference.  the default file mode specifies the initial rights
   associated with newly created files, and can be set in the shell
   with `umask'.  the details of rights implementations tend to vary
   between versions of unix.  consult man pages on `chmod' and `ls'.
 
   examples
   --------
 
     traver.lance % ls -ld ~
     drwx------ 15 ld231782     1536 jan 31 21:22 /users/ld231782/
 
   here is a listing of the rights associated with a user's home
   directory, denoted by `~'.  the columns at the left identify what
   rights are available. the first column identifies the entry as a
   directory, and the next three columns mean that read, write, and
   execute rights, respectively, are permitted for that user.  for
   directories, the `x' right means that contents (file and
   subdirectory names) within that directory can be listed. the
   subsequent columns indicate that no other users have any rights to
   anything in the directory tree originating at that point.  they
   can't even `see' any lower files or subdirectories; the hierarchy
   is completely invisible to them.
 
     traver.lance % ls -l msg
     -rw-r--r--  1 ld231782   35661 jan 29 23:13 msg
     traver.lance % chmod u=rw,g=,o= msg
     traver.lance % ls -l msg
     -rw-------  1 ld231782   35661 jan 29 23:13 msg
 
   here the modes on the file `msg' were changed to take away rights
   from `group' and `other'. 
   
   note that `ls -l <file>' requires both the 'r' right to get the list
   of files and subdirectories, and the 'x' right to access the files
   and subdirectories in order to get their size, etc. for example,
   suppose the directory `foo' has rights dr--r--r--,  the following
   is possible:
 
     ls foo
 
   these commands would fail independent of file rights:
   
     ls -l foo
     ls -l foo/file
     cat foo/file
     cd foo
 
   if the directory `foo' has rights d--x--x--x, the following are
   possible if it is known beforehand that `foo' contains an 'r'
   readable file named `file':
   
     ls -l foo/file
     cat foo/file
     cd foo
   
   the following commands fail:
   
     ls foo
     ls -l foo

 <2.6> how (in)secure is x windows?
 
   x windows is the primary software developed by the mit athena
   project which is funded by u.s. government grants to develop
   applications to harness the power of networks in enhancing
   computational tasks, particularly the human-computer interface. 
   the software implements a client-server interface to a computer via
   graphical windows. in this case the `client' is the application
   requesting or utilizing  graphical resources (such as windows or a
   mouse) and the `server' is the machine that provides them.  in many
   situations the client is an application program running on the same
   machine as the server.
 
   the great utility of x windows comes from its complete dissociation
   of the client and server so that windows may be `broadcast' to a
   server at a remote location from the  client. unfortunately this
   dynamic power also introduces many deep, intricate, and complicated
   security considerations.  the primary security and privacy issue
   associated with x windows is that much more sensitive data may be
   sent over a network, and over wider regions, than in the case where
   the human is situated near the host computer.  currently there is
   no encryption of data such as screen updates and keystrokes in x
   windows.
 
   due to either intentional design decisions or unintentional design
   flaws,  early versions of the x window system are extremely
   insecure. anyone with an account on the server machine can disrupt
   that display or read it electronically based on access to the
   device unix:0.0 by any regular user.   there are no protections
   from this type of access in these versions.   the problem arises
   because the security is completely based on machine addresses
   rather than users, such that any user at a `trusted' machine is
   himself trusted. quoting from x documentation (man xsecurity):
   
   > any client on a host in the host access control list is allowed
   > access to the x server. this system can work reasonably well in
   > an environment where everyone trusts everyone, or when only a
   > single person can log into a given machine...this system does not
   > work well when multiple people can log in to a single machine and
   > mutual trust does not exist. 
   
   with the access control list, the `xhost' command may prevent some
   naive attempts (i.e. those other than the direct-access unix:0.0
   evasion); the syntax as typed on the host machine is  ``xhost
   +[name]'' where [name] is the domain name or internet address of an
   authorized client machine. by default clients running nonlocal to
   the host are disabled.  public domain programs to disrupt a display
   momentarily (such as 'flip' or slowly mirror the screen image, or
   cause pixels to 'melt' down to the bottom) have been circulating on
   the internet among hackers for several years and played as pranks
   on unsuspecting or inexperienced users.  much more serious security
   breaches are conceivable from similar mechanisms exploiting this
   inherent weaknesses.  (the minimal, easily-bypassed `trusted'
   security mode of `xhost' has been jokingly referred to as ``x
   hanging open, security terrible.''). 
 
   new versions of the x window system (x11r5 and higher) by default 
   make server access as secure as the file system using a .xauthority
   file and 'magic cookies'.  remote machines must have a code in the
   .xauthority file in the home directory that matches the code
   allowed by the server.  many older programs and even new
   vendor-supplied code does not support or is incompatible with
   `magic cookies'. the basic magic cookie mechanism is vulnerable to
   monitoring techniques described earlier because no encryption of
   keys occurs in transmission.  x11r5 also includes other
   sophisticated encryption mechanisms.  try `man xsecurity' to find
   out what is supported at your site.  even though improved security 
   mechanisms have been available in x windows since ~1990, local
   sites often update this software infrequently because installation
   is extremely complex.

 <2.7> how (in)secure is my email?
 
   by default, not very.  the characters that you are reading are
   almost certainly encoded in ascii, the american standard code for
   information interchange that maps alphabetic and symbolic
   characters onto numeric codes and vice versa.  virtually every
   computer system uses this code, and if not, has ways of converting
   to and from it.  when you write a mail message, by default it is
   being sent in ascii,  and since the standard is virtually
   universal, there is no intrinsic privacy.  despite milleniums worth
   of accumulated cryptographic knowledge, cryptographic technologies
   are only recently being established that afford high priority to
   privacy as a primary criteria in computer and network design.  some
   potential pitfalls in privacy are as follows:
 
   - the most serious threats are instances of immature or unscrupulous
     system operators reading private mail in the `spool files' at a
     local site (i.e. at the source or destination of the message),
     such as a university. 
   
   - system administrators may also release files to law enforcement
     agencies, but conventions and protocols for warrants involving
     computer searches have still not been strongly established and
     tested legally.
 
   - note that bounced messages go to postmasters at a given site in
     their entirety.  this means that if you address mail with an
     incorrect address it has a good chance of being seen by a human
     other than the recipient.
 
   - typically new user accounts are always set up such that the local
     mail directory is private, but this is not guaranteed and can be
     overridden.
 
   - finally, be aware that some mailing lists (email addresses of 
     everyone on a list) are actually publicly accessable via mail 
     routing software mechanisms.  this `feature' can be disabled.
 
   most potential compromises in email privacy can be thoroughly
   avoided with the use of strong end-to-end cryptography, which has
   its own set of caveats (for example, unscrupulous administrators
   may still be a threat if the encryption site is shared or
   nonlocal).  see the sections on ``email privacy'' and ``email
   policies.''
 
 _____
 <2.8> how am i (not) liable for my email and postings?
 
   as punishment or whatever, your system administrator can revoke
   certain `privileges' such as emailing, usenet posting or reading
   certain groups, file transferring, remote communications, or
   generally any subset of capabilities available from your account. 
   this all is completely at the discretion of the local administrator
   and under the procedures followed at a particular site, which in
   many cases are haphazard and crisis-oriented.  currently there are
   virtually no widespread, uniform guidelines or procedures  for
   restricting use to any internet services, and local administrators
   are free to make arbitrary decisions on access.
 
   today punitive measures are regularly applied in various situations.
   in the typical scenario complaint(s) reach a system adminstrator
   regarding abuses by a user, usually but not necessarily preceded by
   complaints to the user in email, regarding that person's
   objectionable email or postings.  `abusive' posters to usenet are
   usually first given admonitions from their system administrators as
   urged by others on the `net'. (the debate persists endlessly on
   many newsgroups whether this is also used  as a questionable means
   of attacking or silencing `harmless crackpots' or censoring
   unpopular opinions.)
   
   system administrators at remote sites regularly cooperate to
   'squelch' severe cases of abuse.  in general, however, by tradition
   usenet readers are remarkably tolerant of diverse views and uses of
   the system, but a colorful vocabularly of slang helps describe
   their alternatives when this patience is sapped: the options
   wielded by the individual user are to simply advance to the next
   message (referred to as ``hitting the `n' key''), or to `plonk'
   annoying posters (according to the hacker's dictionary, the sound a
   jerk makes at the end of a fall to the bottom of a kill file).
 
   in cases where punitive actions are applied, generally system
   administrators are least likely to restrict email.  usenet postings
   are much more commonly restricted, either to individual users or 
   entire groups (such as a university campus).  restrictions are most
   commonly associated with the following `abuses':
 
   - harassing or threatening notes, `email terrorism'
   - illegal uses, e.g. piracy or propagation of copyrighted material
   - `ad hominem' attacks, i.e. insulting the reputation of the
     poster instead of citing the content of the message
   - intentional or extreme vulgarity and offensiveness
   - inappropriate postings, esp. binary files in regular groups
     `mail-bombing': inundating mail boxes with numerous or massive
     files
 
   major problems originate from lack of distinctions in private and
   official email or postings.  most users have internet access via
   accounts at businesses or universities and their activities on the
   internet can be construed as representative of their parent
   organizations. many people put disclaimers in their `signatures' in
   an attempt dissociate their identity and activities from parent
   organizations as a precaution. a recent visible political case
   involves the privacy of electronic mail  written by white house
   staff members of the bush administration.  following are some
   guidelines:
 
   - acquaint yourself with your company or university policy.
   - if possible, avoid use of your company email address for private
     communication.
   - use a disclaimer.
   - keep a low profile (avoid `flamewars' or simply don't post).
   - avoid posting information that could be  construed to be
     proprietary or `internal'.

 _____
 <2.9> how do i provide more/less information to others on my identity?
 
   the public information of your identity and account is mostly
   available though the unix utility `finger' described above. 
   
   - you have control over most of this information with the utility
     `chfn', the specifics vary between sites (on some systems use
     `passwd -f').
    
   - you can provide unlimited information in the .plan file which is
     copied directly to the destination during the fingering. 
     
   - a technique that works at some sites allows you to find out who is
     'finger'ing you and even to  vary the .plan file sent to them.
     
   - your signature is determined by the environment variable signature
     
   - usenet signatures are conventionally stored in the .signature file
     in your home directory.
     
   providing less information on your online identity is more difficult
   and involved.  one approach is to ask your system adminstrator to
   change or delete information about you (such as your full name). 
   you may be able to obtain access on a public account or one from
   someone unrelated to you personally.  you may be able to remotely
   login (via modem or otherwise) to computers that you are not
   physically near.  these are tactics for hiding or masking your
   online activities but nothing is foolproof.  consult man pages on
   the 'chmod' command and the default file mode.  generally, files on
   a shared system have good safeguards within the user pool but very
   little protection is possible from corrupt system administrators.
 
   to mask your identity in email or on usenet you can use different
   accounts. more untraceable are new `anonymous posting' and
   remailing services that are very recently being established.  see
   below.
 
 ______
 <2.10> who is my sysadmin?  what does s/he know about me?
 
   the requirements and screening for getting a system administration
   job (and thereby access to all information on a system) vary widely
   between sites and are sometimes frighteningly lax, especially at
   universities.  many unix systems at universities are largely
   managed by undergraduates with a background in computing and often
   `hacking'.  in general, commercial and industrial sites are more
   strict on qualifications and background, and government sites are
   extremely strict.
 
   the system adminstrator (root user) can monitor what commands you
   used and at what times.  s/he may have a record (backups) of files
   on your account over a few weeks. s/he can monitor when  you send
   email or post usenet messages, and potentially read either.  s/he
   may have access to records indicating what hosts you are using,
   both locally and elsewhere.  administrators sometimes employ
   specialized programs to  track `strange' or `unusual' activity,
   which can potentially be misused.
 
 ______
 <2.11> why is privacy (un)stable on the internet?
 
   for the numerous reasons listed above, privacy should not be an
   expectation with current use of the internet.  furthermore, large
   parts of the internet are funded by the u.s. nsf (national science
   foundation) which places certain restrictions on its use (such as
   prohibiting commercial use).  some high-level officials in this and
   other government agencies may be opposed to emerging techniques to
   guarantee privacy (such as encryption and anonymous services).
 
   historically the major threats to privacy on the internet have been
   local. perhaps the most common example of this are the widespread
   occurrences of university administrators refusing to carry some
   portion of usenet newsgroups labelled as `pornographic'. the
   `alternative' hierarchy in the usenet system, which has virtually
   no restrictions on propagation and new group creation, is
   frequently targeted (although this material may appear anywhere).
 
   from the global point of view traffic is generally completely
   unimpeded on the internet  and only the most egregious offenders
   are pursued.  for example,  verbatim transcriptions of copyrighted
   material (such as newspaper or magazine articles) are posted to
   usenet with regularity without major consequences (some email
   complaints may ensue).  more astonishing to some is that currently
   significant portions of usenet traffic, and less so internet
   traffic, is comprised of sexually-explicit digitized images almost
   entirely originating from copyrighted material (newsgroups such as
   `alt.sex' regularly have the  highest traffic).
   
 ______
 <2.12> what is the future of privacy on the internet?
 
   some argue that the internet currently has an adequate or
   appropriate level of privacy.  others will argue that as a
   prototype for future global networks it has woefully inadequate
   safeguards.  the internet is growing to become a completely global,
   international superhighway for data, and this traffic will
   inevitably entail data such as voice messages, postal mail, and
   many other items of extremely personal nature. computer items that
   many people consider completely private (such as their local hard
   drives) will literally be inches from global network connections.
   also, sensitive industrial and business information is exchanged
   over networks currently and this volume may conceivably merge with
   the internet.
   
   most would agree that, for these basic but sensitive uses of the
   internet, no significant mechanisms are currently in place to
   ensure much privacy. new standards are calling for uniform
   introduction of `privacy enhanced mail' (pem) which uses encryption
   technologies to ensure privacy, so that privacy protection is
   automatic, and may significantly improve safeguards.
 
   the same technology that can be extremely destructive to privacy
   (such as with  surreptitious surveilance) can be overwhelmingly
   effective in protecting  it (e.g. with encryption). some government
   agencies are opposed to unlimited privacy in general, and believe
   that it should lawfully be forfeited in cases of criminal conduct
   (e.g. court-authorized wiretapping).  however, powerful new
   technologies to protect privacy on computers are becoming
   increasingly popular, provoking some to say that ``the cat is out
   of the bag'' and the ``genie can't be put back in the bottle''.  in
   less idiomatic terms, they believe that the spread of strong
   cryptography is already underway will be socially and technically
   unstoppable.
   
   to date, no feasible system that guarantees both secure
   communication and government oversight has been proposed (the two
   goals are largely incompatible). proposals for ``registration'' of
   secret keys (by d. denning on sci.crypt, for example) have been met
   with hot controversy at best and ridicule and derision at worst,
   mainly because of concerns for the right to privacy and objections
   of inherent feasibility.  electronic privacy issues, and
   particularly the proper roles of networks and the internet, will
   foreseeably become highly visible and explosive over the next few
   years.
 
 
 anonymity
 =========
 
 _____
 <3.1> what is `anonymity' on the internet?
 
   simply stated, anonymity is the absence of identity, the
   ultimate in privacy. however, there are several variations on
   this simple theme.  a person may wish to be consistently
   identified by a certain pseudonym or `handle' and establish a
   reputation under it in some area, providing pseudo-anonymity.
   a person may wish to be completely untraceable for a single
   one-way message (a sort of `hit-and-run'). or, a person may
   wish to be openly anonymous but carry on a conversation with
   others (with either known or anonymous identities) via an
   `anonymous return address'.  a user may wish to appear as a
   `regular user' but actually be untraceable.  sometimes a user
   wishes to hide who he is sending mail to (in addition to the
   message itself). the anonymous item itself may be directed at
   individuals or groups.  a user may wish to access some
   service and hide all  signs of the association. 
   
   all of these uses are feasible on the internet but are currently
   tricky to carry out in practice, because of all the tracking
   mechanisms inherent to operating systems and network protocols. 
   officials of the nsf and other government agencies may be opposed
   to any of these uses because of the potential for abuse. 
   nevertheless, the inherent facelessness of large networks will
   always guarantee a certain element of anonymity.
 
 _____
 <3.2> why is `anonymity' (un)important on the internet?
 
   anonymity is another powerful tool that can be beneficial or
   problematic depending on its use.  arguably absence of
   identification is important as the presence of it.  it may be the
   case that many strong benefits from electronic anonymity will be
   discovered that were unforeseen and unpredicted, because true
   anonymity has been historically very difficult to establish.
 
   one can use anonymity to make personal statements to a colleague
   that would sabotage a relationship if stated openly (such as
   employer/employee scenarios).  one can use it to pass information
   and evade any threat of direct retribution.  for example,
   `whistleblowers' reporting on government abuses (economic, social,
   or  political) can bring issues to light without fear of stigma or
   retaliation. sensitive, personal, potentially damaging information
   is often posted to some usenet groups, a risky situation where
   anonymity allows conversations to be carried on completely
   independent of the identities of the participants.  some police
   departments run phone services that allow anonymous reporting of
   crimes; such uses would be straightforward on the network.
   unfortunately, extortion and harassment become more insidious with
   assurances of anonymity.
 
 _____
 <3.3> how can anonymity be protected on the internet?
 
   the chief means, as alluded to above, are masking identities in
   email and posting. however, anonymous accounts (public accounts as
   accessable and anonymous as e.g. public telephones) may be
   effective as well, but this use is generally not officially
   supported and even discouraged by some system adminstrators and nsf
   guidelines.  the nonuniformity in the requirements of obtaining
   accounts at different sites and institutions makes anonymous
   accounts generally difficult to obtain to the public at large.
 
   many communications protocols are inherently detrimental to
   anonymity.  virtually every protocol in existence currently
   contains information on both sender and receiver in every packet.
   new communications protocols will likely develop that guarantee
   much higher degrees of secure anonymous communication.
 
 _____
 <3.4> what is `anonymous mail'?
 
   one approach to `anonymizing' mail has been to set up an `anonymous
   server' that, when activated by email to its address, responds by
   allocating and supplying an `anonymous id' that is unique to the
   person requesting it (based on his email address).  this will vary
   for the same person for different machine address email
   originations. to send anonymous mail, the user sends email directed
   to the server containing the final destination. the server
   `anonymizes' the message by stripping of identification information
   and forwards the message, which appears to originate from the
   anonymous server only from the corresponding anonymous user id. 
   this is the `interactive' use of anonymity or pseudonymity
   mentioned above.
 
   another more `fringe' approach is to run a `cypherpunk' remailer
   from a regular user account (no root system privileges are
   required). these are currently being pioneered by  eric hughes and
   hal finney <hal@alumni.caltech.edu>. the operator runs a process on
   a machine that anonymizes mail sent to him with certain
   characteristics that distinguish it from his regular incoming mail
   (typically fields in the header). one has been implemented as a 
   perl script running on unix.  several of these are in existence
   currently but sites and software currently are highly unstable;
   they may be in operation outside of system administrator knowledge.
   the remailers don't generally support anonymous return addresses. 
   mail that is incorrectly addressed is received by the operator. 
   generally the user of the remailer has to disavow any
   responsibility for the messages forwarded through his system,
   although actually may be held liable regardless.
 
   these approaches have several serious disadvantages and weaknesses:
   
   - the anonymous server approach requires maintaining a mapping of
     anonymous id's to real addresses that must be maintained
     indefinitely.  one alternative is to allow `deallocation' of
     aliases at the request of the user, but this has not been
     implemented yet.
 
   - although an unlikely scenario, traffic to any of these sites could
     conceivably be monitored from the `outside', necessitating the
     use of cryptography for basic protection,.
 
   - local administrators can shut them down either out of caprice or
     under pressure from local, network, or government agencies.
   
   - unscrupulous providers of the services can monitor the traffic
     that goes through them.
 
   - most remailers currently keep logs that may be inspected. 
 
   - the cypherpunk approach tends to be highly unstable because these
     operators are basically  network users who do not own the
     equipment and are accountable  to their own system
     administrators, who may be unaware of the use and unsympathetic
     to the philosophy of anonymity when the operation is discovered,
     regarding it as illicit use. 
 
   - in all cases, a high degree of trust is placed in the anonymous
     server operator by the user.
 
   currently the most direct route to anonymity involves using smtp
   protocols to submit a message directly to a server with arbitrary
   field information.  this practice, not uncommon to hackers, and the
   approach used by remailers, is generally viewed with hostility by
   most system administrators.  information in the header routing data
   and logs of network port connection information may be retained
   that can be used to track the originating site.  in practice, this
   is generally infeasible and rarely carried out.  some
   administrators on the network will contact local administrators to
   request a message be tracked and its writer admonished or punished
   more severely (such as revoking the account), all of this actually
   happening occasionally but infrequently.
 
   see the sections ``known anonymous mail and posting sites'' and 
   ``responsibilities associated with anonymity''.
 
 _____
 <3.5> what is `anonymous posting'?
 
   anonymous servers have been established as well for anonymous usenet
   posting with all the associated caveats above (monitored traffic,
   capricious or risky local circumstances, logging).  make sure to
   test the system at least once by e.g. anonymous posting to
   misc.test (however some operators don't recommend this because many
   sites `autorespond' to test messages, possibly causing the
   anonymous server to allocate anonymous ids for those machines). 
   see the ``responsibilties associated with anonymous posting''
   before proceeding.
 
   another direct route involves using nntp protocols to submit a
   message directly to a newserver with arbitrary field information.
   this practice, not uncommon to hackers, is also generally viewed
   with hostility by most system administrators, and similar
   consequences can ensue.
 
   see the sections ``known anonymous mail and posting sites'' and 
   ``responsibilities associated with anonymity''.
 
 _____
 <3.6> why is anonymity (un)stable on the internet?
 
   as noted, many factors compromise the anonymity currently available
   to the general internet community, and these services should be
   used with great caution.  to summarize, the technology is in its
   infancy and current approaches are unrefined, unreliable, and not
   completely trustworthy.  no standards have been established and
   troubling situations of loss of anonymity and bugs in the software
   are prevalent.  here are some encountered and potential bugs: 
   
   - one  anonymous remailer reallocated already allocated anonymous
     return addresses. 
   - others passed signature information embedded in messages
     unaltered. 
   - address resolution problems resulting in anonymized mail bounced
     to a remailer are common.
   - forgeries to the anonymous server itself are a problem,  possibly
     allowing unauthorized users to potentially glean anon id - email
     address  mappings in the alias file.  this can be remedied with
     the use of passwords.
   - infinite mail loops are possible with chaining remailers.
   
   source code is being distributed, tested, and refined for these
   systems, but standards are progressing slowly and weakly.  the
   field is not likely to improve considerably without  official
   endorsement and action by network agencies.  the whole idea is
   essentially still in its infancy and viewed with suspicion and
   distrust by many on the internet, seen as illegitimate or favorable
   to criminality.  the major objection to anonymity over regular
   internet use  is the perceived lack of accountability to system
   operators, i.e. invulnerability to account restrictions resulting
   from outside complaints.  system adminstrators at some sites have
   threatened to filter anonymous news postings generated by the
   prominent servers from their redistribution flows.  this may only
   have the effect of encouraging server operators to create less
   characteristically detectable headers.  probably the least
   problematic approach, and the most traditional to usenet, is for
   individual users to deal with anonymous mail however they prefer,
   e.g. ignoring it or filtering it with kill files.
   
 _____
 <3.7> what is the future of anonymity on the internet?
 
   new anonymous protocols effectively serve to significantly increase
   safeguards of anonymity.  for example, the same mechanism that
   routes email over multiple hosts, thereby threatening its privacy,
   can also be used to guarantee it. in a scheme called `chaining' an
   anonymous message is passed through multiple anonymous servers
   before reaching a destination.  in this way generally multiple
   links of the chain have to be `broken' for security to be
   compromised. re-encryption at each link makes this scenario even
   more unlikely.  even more significantly the anonymous remailers
   could be spread over the internet globally so that local weaknesses
   (such as corrupt governments or legal wiretapping within a nation)
   would be more unlikely to sacrifice overall security by message
   tracing. however, remailers run by corrupt operators are possible.
   
   the future of anonymous services on the internet is, at this time,
   highly uncertain and fraught with peril. while specific groups seem
   to benefit significantly from anonymous posting capabilities, many
   feel that unlimited newsgroup scope for anonymous posting is a
   disruptive and dangerous idea and detracts from discussions in
   `serious' groups.   the introduction of unlimited group anonymity
   may have fundamental repercussions on usenet conventions and
   distribution mechanisms such as moderated and `alt' groups have had
   in the past. for example, as part of new group creation, the
   charter may specify whether `anonymous' posting is (un)welcome. 
 
   nevertheless, the widespread introduction and use of anonymity may
   be inevitable. based on traffic statistics, anonymous services are
   in huge demand. pervasive and readily available anonymity could
   carry significant and unforeseen social consequences.  however, if
   its use is continued to be generally regarded as subversive it may
   be confined to the underground.  the ramifications of widespread
   introduction of anonymity to usenet are still largely unknown. it
   is unclear whether it will provoke signficant amounts of new
   traffic or, instead of expansion, cause a shift where a greater
   portion of existing traffic is anonymized.  conceivably the
   services could play a role in influencing future mainstream social
   acceptance of usenet.
