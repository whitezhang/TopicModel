 the final stages of denial... i can hardly imagine what the result
 would have been if the clinton administration had actually supported
 this plan, instead of merely acquiescing with repugnance as they've so
 obviously doing.  i don't believe the chip originated with the clinton
 administration either, but the clinton administration has embraced it
 and brought it to fruition.
 
 both of the major parties have what they consider excellent reasons
 for limiting your freedoms and violating your privacy, and even seem
 to feel that they're doing you a favor.  if this is really surprising
 to anyone it means they've been willfully ignoring quite a bit of
 previous evidence.  there's only one political party (not calling
 anarchists a party) that considers your freedom and privacy goals
 worthy in and of themselves.  if you're voting for the big two, you're
 supporting a reduction of those rights (given their goals and their
 histories), regardless of whether you personally support that
 reduction.  to paint clinton and gore as unwitting tools is really
 stretching things.
