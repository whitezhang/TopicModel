 	i am an idiot. the plaintext that's relevant is the session key.
 if you know that, you probably don't need a roomful of chips, do you?
 if you were going to brute force something interesting, that'd be the
 message stream, which is sort of approximately known by, say, a bug in
 my office. then your roomful of chips could get the session key. which
 i change every morning.
 
 	really, it's just a whole lot easier for the illicit wiretappers
 to stick a bug in your phone.
