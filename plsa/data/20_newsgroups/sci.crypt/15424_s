 if we do not trust the nsa to be a registrar of clipper chip key halves,
 i would not trust mitre either.  mitre does lots of work for nsa, at least
 in the trusted product evaluation program (evaluation of commercial off the
 shelf software for its efficacy in safeguarding classified information), and
 i assume in other, less open, programs.
 
 there are at least two other ffrdcs (federally funded research and development
 corporations) that work for nsa: aerospace corporation and the institute for
 defense analysis.  now, if nsa were to be untrustworthy (a position that i
 am neutral about, for purposes of this posting), it would be in a position to
 exert economic pressure upon mitre to release key halves on demand.  it could
 just say, "if you don't cooperate with us, we'll place all our evaluation
 contracts with aerospace and ida."
 
 i am not saying that people at nsa, mitre, aerospace, or ida are dishonest
 folk.  but since they are people, and people occasionally go bad, the
 system works better if organizations that you are depending upon to be
 independent really are.
 
 and, of course, i speak for myself, not my employer.
