 sorry if i was less than clear.  :-) i was referring to our own efforts
 to receive export permission from nsa for the pkzip encryption
 algorithm, not to any effort on the part of phil katz or pkware.
 
 i should point out that the original version of this algorithm was
 designed by roger schlafly and that we (meaning roger and myself) were
 twice denied an export license for it.  the second go 'round was just
 this past fall.
 
 i had no knowledge of phil's attempts in this.  i do not even *know* for
 sure if he choose to implement the algorithm as it was designed by
 roger, though i *believe* that was at least the case for versions prior
 to 2.0.  and then there's the question of key management.  :-)
 
 and even if our applications were identical, there is no reason to
 assume the nsa would treat them that way.  :-)
