   the reason i could theoretically trust apple (though i'm a pc person
 myself :-) ) is that apple has to worry about their customers deserting
 them if they screw up badly enough.  the government doesn't have any such
 worry; it can change the rules by force to get the outcome it wants.  this
 is the ultimate reason why private enterprise is usually more efficient
 than government agencies.
