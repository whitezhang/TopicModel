       don't get fooled by exponents 2^80 (possible keys) is not in the
 same league with 10^80 (particles in the universe).  2^80 < 10^25.
 remember avagadro's number?  there are about that many elementary
 particles (not molecules) in one mole.  pretty small universe!  or if
 you can put 5 gigabytes on one tape, you would need about 10 trillion
 tapes (allowing several bytes per entry).  still more than all of the
 existing magnetic media on the planet, but wait a few years.  (i'm
 including existing audio and video cassettes in the total.  ten
 trillion is about 2,000 per person worldwide...  gives new meaning to
 the suspicions of hiden messages.)
