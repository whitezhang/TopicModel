 the computer science department of the university of california, santa 
 barbara, and bell-northern research (a subsidiary of northern telecom), 
 will be held on the campus of the university of california, santa barbara, 
 on august 22-26, 1993. original research papers and technical expository talks 
 are solicited on all practical and theoretical aspects of cryptology. it is 
 anticipated that some talks may also be presented by special invitation of the 
 program committee.
 -------------------------        
 instructions for authors:  authors are requested to send 12 copies of a 
 detailed abstract (not a full paper) by april 26, 1993, to the program chair

 the bibliography or the title page) is placed on all submissions. submissions 
 must arrive on time or be postmarked no later than april 21, 1993 and sent by 
 airmail in order to receive consideration by the program committee. it is 
 required that submissions start with a succinct statement of the problem 
 addressed, the solution proposed, and its significance to cryptology, 
 appropriate for a non-specialist reader. technical development directed to 
 the specialist should follow as needed.
 -------------------------        
 abstracts that have been submitted to other conferences that have proceedings 
 are not eligible for submission.
 
 submissions must be anonymous. this means that names and affiliations of
