 (sorry about double posting, but i forgot something.)
 
 "make, use or sell" in this context have non-standard meanings:
 
 "make" means making an encrypted message.  "use" may mean using pgp, or
 using an encrypted message.  "sell" would probably mean selling an
 encrypted message.  it is the message created by a "patented" process
 incorporated in pgp, which infringes.
