 <4.1> what unix programs are related to privacy?
 
   for more information, type `man [cmd]' or `apropos [keyword]' at the
   unix shell prompt.
 
     passwd - change password
     finger - obtain information about a remote user
     chfn   - change information about yourself obtainable by remote
              users (sometimes `passwd -f')
     chmod  - change the rights associated with a file or directory
     umask  - (shell) change the default (on creation) file access
              rights
     ls     - list the rights associated with files and directories
     xhost  - allow or disable access control of particular users to an
              xwindow server
     last   - list the latest user logins on the system and their
              originations
     who    - list other users, login/idle times, originations
     w      - list other users and what they are running
     xhost  - access control list for x window client use
     xauth  - control x window server authentication
     
     .signature  - file in the home directory appended to usenet posts
     .forward    - file used to forward email to other accounts
     .xauthority - file used for x window server authentication keys
     $signature  - variable used for name in email and usenet postings
 
   the 'tcpdump' packet-tracing program is loosely based on smi's
   "etherfind" although none of the etherfind code remains.  it was
   originally written by van jacobson, lawrence berkeley laboratory,
   as part of an ongoing research project to investigate and improve
   tcp and internet gateway performance.  a current version is
   available via anonymous ftp from host ftp.ee.lbl.gov (currently at
   address 128.3.254.68) file tcpdump.tar.z (a compressed unix tar
   file). this program is subject to  the 'standard' berkeley network
   software copyright.

 <4.2> how can i learn about or use cryptography?
 
   a general introduction to mostly theoretical cryptographic issues,
   especially those frequently discussed in sci.crypt, is available
   in faq form:
 
   >  compiled by:
   >        cme@ellisun.sw.stratus.com (carl ellison)
   >        gwyn@brl.mil (doug gwyn)
   >        smb@ulysses.att.com (steven bellovin)
 
   nist (u.s. national institute for standards and technology)
   publishes an introductory paper on cryptography, special
   publication 800-2 ``public-key cryptograhy'' by james nechvatal
   (april 1991).  available via anonymous ftp from
   csrc.ncsl.nist.gov (129.6.54.11), file pub/nistpubs/800-2.txt. 
   also via available anonymous ftp from wimsey.bc.ca as crypt.txt.z
   in the crypto directory.  covers technical mathematical aspects
   of encryption such as number theory.
 
   more general information can be found in a faq by paul fahn of rsa
   labortories via anonymous ftp from rsa.com in /pub/faq.ps.z.  see
   the `readme' file for information on the `tex' version.  also
   available as hardcopy for $20 from   rsa laboratories, 100 marine
   parkway, redwood city, ca  94065.  send questions to
   faq-editor@rsa.com.
 
   phil zimmerman's pgp (pretty good privacy) public-domain package
   for public key encryption is available at numerous sites, and is
   in widespread use over the internet for general unix-based file
   encryption (including email).  consult the archie ftp database. 
   also see the newsgroup alt.security.pgp.  mailing list requests
   to info-pgp-request@lucpul.it.luc.edu.
 
   from the ripem faq by marc vanheyningen
   <mvanheyn@whale.cs.indiana.edu> on news.answers:
 
   > ripem is a program which performs privacy enhanced mail (pem)
   > using the cryptographic techniques of rsa and des.  it allows
   > your electronic mail to have the properties of authentication
   > (i.e. who sent it can be confirmed) and privacy (i.e. nobody can
   > read it except the intended recipient.)
   > 
   > ripem was written primarily by mark riordan
   > <mrr@scss3.cl.msu.edu>. most of the code is in the public domain,
   > except for the rsa routines, which are a library called rsaref
   > licensed from rsa data security inc.
   > 
   > ripem is available via anonymous ftp to citizens and permanent
   > residents in the u.s. from rsa.com; cd to rsaref/ and read the
   > readme file for info.
   > 
   > ripem, as well as some other crypt stuff, has its `home site' on
   > rpub.cl.msu.edu, which is open to non-anonymous ftp for users in
   > the u.s. and canada who are citizens or permanent residents.  to
   > find out how to obtain access, ftp there, cd to pub/crypt/, and
   > read the file getting_access.
 
   note: cryptography is generally not well integrated into email yet
   and some system proficiency is required by users to utilize it.
 
 _____
 <4.3> what is the cypherpunks mailing list?
 
   eric hughes <hughes@toad.com> runs the `cypherpunk' mailing list
   dedicated to ``discussion about technological defenses for privacy
   in the digital domain.''  send email to
   cypherpunks-request@toad.com to be added or subtracted from the
   list. from the charter:
 
   > the most important means to the defense of privacy is encryption.
   > to encrypt is to indicate the desire for privacy.  but to encrypt
   > with weak cryptography is to indicate not too much desire for
   > privacy. cypherpunks hope that all people desiring privacy will
   > learn how best to defend it.

 <4.7> how can i run an anonymous remailer?
 
   cypherpunk remailer source is at soda.berkeley.edu in the
   /pub/cypherpunks directory.  it's written in perl, and is
   relatively easy to install (no administrative rights are required).
   karl barrus  <elee9sf@menudo.uh.edu> has more information and
   modifications. also, most remailer operators mentioned above are
   amenable to discussing features, problems, and helping new sites
   become operational. address all points in the section
   ``responsibities of anonymous use'' in this document prior to
   advertising your service.  you should be committed to the long-term
   stability of the site and avoid running one surreptitiously.

 <5.1> what is ``digital cash''?
 
   with digital encryption and authentication technologies, the
   possibility of a widespread digital cash system may someday be
   realized.  a system utilizing codes sent between users and banks
   (similar to today's checking system except entirely digital) may
   be one approach.  the issues of cryptography, privacy, and
   anonymity are closely associated with transfer of cash in an
   economy.  see the article in scientific american by david chaum
   (~dec.1992).
 
   an experimental digital bank is run by karl barrus
   <elee9sf@menudo.uh.edu> based on suggestions by hal finney on the
   cypherpunks mailing list.  to use the server send mail to
   elee7h5@rosebud.ee.uh.edu message with the following text:
 
     ::
     command: help
     
     user@host
 
   where `user@host' is your email address.
  
   
 _____
 <5.2> what is a ``hacker'' or ``cracker''?
 
   these terms arouse strong feelings by many on their meaning,
   especially on the internet.  in the general news media in the past
   a person who uses computers and networks to malicious ends (such as
   breaking into systems) has been referred to as a hacker, but most
   internet users prefer the term ``cracker'' for this.  instead, a
   ``hacker'' is perceived as a benign but intensely ambitious,
   curious, and driven computer user who explores obscure areas of a
   system, for example---something of a proud electronic pioneer and
   patriot.  this is the sense intended in this document.  see also
   the ``hacker's dictionary'' and the faq `alt-security-faq'.
  
  
 _____
 <5.3> what is a ``cypherpunk''?
 
   from the charter of the cypherpunk mailing list:
 
   > cypherpunks assume privacy is a good thing and wish there were
   > more of it.  cypherpunks acknowledge that those who want privacy
   > must create it for themselves and not expect governments,
   > corporations, or other large, faceless organizations to grant
   > them privacy out of beneficence.  cypherpunks know that people
   > have been creating their own privacy for centuries with whispers,
   > envelopes, closed doors, and couriers.  cypherpunks do not seek
   > to prevent other people from speaking about their experiences or
   > their opinions.
 
   see information on the cypherpunk mailing list below.
 
   see also the cryptoanarchist manifesto and the cryptography glossary
   in soda.berkeley.edu:/pub/cypherpunks.
 
 _____
 <5.4> what is `steganography' and anonymous pools?
 
   closely associated with encryption is `steganography' or the
   techniques for not only pursuing private (encrypted) communication
   but concealing the very  existence of the communication itself. 
   many new possibilities in this area are introduced with the
   proliferation of computer technology.  for example, it is possible
   to encode messages in the least-significant bits of images,
   typically the most 'noisy'. in addition, when such an item is
   posted in a public place (such as a newsgroup), virtually
   untraceable  communication can take place between sender and
   receiver.  for  steganographic communications in the electronic
   realm one another possibility is setting up a mailing list where
   individual messages get broadcast to the entire list and individual
   users decode particular messages with their unique key.   an
   anonymous pool has been set up by miron cuperman
   (miron@extropia.wimsey.com) for experiments.  send email to
   <pool0-request@extropia.wimsey.com>  with one of the following
   commands in the subject line:
 
     subscribe
     unsubscribe
     help
 
 _____
 <5.5> what is `security through obscurity'?
 
   `security through obscurity' refers to the attempt to gain
   protection from system weaknesses by hiding sensitive information
   or programs relating to them.  for example, a company may not make
   public information on its software's encryption techniques to evade
   `attacks' based on knowledge of it. another example would be
   concealing data on the existence of security holes or bugs in
   operating systems.  or, some reliance may be made on the fact that
   some standard or mechanism with potential problems is serious
   because they are ``not widely known'' or ``not widely used.'' this
   argument is occasionally applied to mechanisms for email and usenet
   posting `forgery'. `security through obscurity' is regarded as a
   very feeble  technique at best and inappropriate and ineffective at
   worst (also called the ``head-in-the-sand approach''). see the faq
   for alt.security.  
   
   some remarks of john perry barlow, cofounder of the electronic
   frontier foundation, directed to nsa agents at the first
   international symposium on national security & national
   competitiveness held in mclean, virginia  dec. 1, 1992:
 
   > digitized information is very hard to stamp classified or keep
   > contained. ... this stuff is incredibly leaky and volatile.  it's
   > almost a life form in its ability to self-propagate.  if
   > something hits the net and it's something which people on there
   > find interesting it will spread like a virus of the mind.  i
   > believe you must simply accept the idea that we are moving into
   > an environment where any information which is at all interesting

 <5.6> what are `identity daemons'?
   
   rfc-931 describes a protocol standard that allows unix programs to
   query a remote user's login name after connection to a local
   communication socket (a connection of this type is established
   during ftp and telnet sessions, for example).  the standard is not
   widely supported, perhaps 10% of internet sites currently implement
   it but the number is increasing.  the mechanism is detrimental to
   anonymity.  regular users cannot disable it but system
   adminstrators can circumvent it.  this standard may represent a
   trend toward greater authentication mechanisms.
 
 _____
 <5.7> what new standards are needed to guard electronic privacy?
 
 
   remailing/posting
   -----------------
   
   - stable, secure, protected, officially sanctioned and permitted,
     publicly and privately operated anonymous servers and hubs.
   - official standards for encryption and anonymity in mail and usenet
     postings.
   - truly anonymous protocols with source and destination information
     obscured or absent and hidden routing mechanisms (chaining,
     encrypted addresses, etc.)
   - standards for anonymous email addressing, embedding files, and
     remailer site chaining.
   
   general
   -------
   
   - recognition of anonymity, cryptography, and related privacy
     shields as legitimate, useful, desirable, and crucial by the
     general public and their governments.
   - widespread use and implementation of these technologies 
     by systems designers into
     hardware, software, and standards, implemented `securely,'
     `seamlessly,' and `transparently'.
   - general shift of use, dependence, and reliance to means other than
     wiretapping and electronic surveillance by law enforcement
     agencies.
   - publicity, retraction, and dissolution of laws and government
     agencies opposed to privacy, replaced by structures dedicated to
     strengthening and protecting it.

   > traditions of the free and open flow of information and
   > communication.
   
   eff was started by the multimillionaire mitchell kapor, founder of
   lotus software, and john barlow, lyricist for the grateful dead
   rock band.  a highly publicized endeavor of the organization
   involved the legal defense of  steve jackson games after an fbi
   raid and an accompanying civil suit  (see section on ``steve
   jackson games'').  the foundation publishes eff news (effector
   online) electronically, send requests to effnews-request@eff.org.
   
   in a letter to mitchell kapor from the chairman of the subcommittee
   with primary jurisdiction over telecommunications policy dated
   november 5, 1991,  representative  edward j. markey complemented
   mitchell kapor on his ``insights on the development of a national
   public information infrastructure'' which ``were appreciated greatly
   by myself and the members of the subcommittee'' (complete text in

 <6.2> who are computer professionals for social responsibility (cpsr)?
 
   the computer professionals for social responsibility have been
   working to protect and promote electronic civil liberties issues
   since ~1982.  the group has three offices (palo alto, cambridge,
   washington, dc) and 20 chapters. it is involved in  litigation
   against the fbi, the nsa, nist, the secret service and other other
   u.s. government agencies  to declassify and provide documentation
   on issues such as operation sundevil, the fbi wiretap proposal,
   nsa's interference in crypography, the breakup of the 2600 raid in
   arlington, va in nov 1992. members speak frequently in front on
   congress, state legislators and public utility commissions to
   testify on privacy, information policy, computer security, and
   caller identification.
 
   cpsr has created an extensive internet privacy library available
   via ftp, gopher, wais, and email at cpsr.org, currently comprising
   the largest collection of privacy documents on the internet.  for
   more information, anonymous ftp  cpsr.org:/cpsr/.

 <6.3> what was `operation sundevil' and the steve jackson game case?
 
   in the early 1990's a fear spread among u.s. law enforcement agencies
   on the illicit activities of `hackers' and `phreakers' involved in
   such activities as credit card fraud and long-distance call thievery.
   
   (see ftp.eff.org:/pub/sjg/general_information/effector1.04):
 
   > `operation sundevil,' the phoenix-inspired crackdown of may
   > 8,1990, concentrated on telephone code-fraud and credit-card
   > abuse, and followed this seizure plan with some success. 
   > [bulletin board systems] went down all over america, terrifying
   > the underground and swiftly depriving them of at least some of
   > their criminal instruments.  it also saddled analysts with some
   > 24,000 floppy disks, and confronted harried justice department
   > prosecutors with the daunting challenge of a gigantic nationwide
   > hacker show-trial involving highly technical issues in dozens of
   > jurisdictions.
 
   massive `show-trials' never materialized, although isolated
   instances of prosecution were pursued.  the movement reached a
   crescendo in texas with the highly publicized case of illegal
   search and seizure involving the steve jackson games company of
   austin texas on march 1, 1990.  from the column gurps' labour lost
   by bruce sterling <bruces@well.sf.ca.us> in fantasy and science
   fiction magazine:
 
   > in an early morning raid with an unlawful and unconstitutional
   > warrant, agents of the secret service conducted a search of the
   > sjg office.  when they left they took a manuscript being prepared
   > for publication, private electronic mail, and several computers,
   > including the hardware and software of the sjg computer bulletin
   > board system.  yet jackson and his business were not only
   > innocent of any crime, but never suspects in the first place. 
   > the raid had been staged on the unfounded suspicion that
   > somewhere in jackson's office there `might be' a document
   > compromising the security of the 911 telephone system.
 
   fbi agents involved in the seizure were named in a civil suit filed
   on behalf of steve jackson games by the electronic frontier
   foundation.  see information on eff below.  from an article by joe
   abernathy in the houston chronicle ~feb 1, 1993:
   
   > austin -- an electronic civil rights case against the secret
   > service closed thursday with a clear statement by federal
   > district judge sam sparks that the service failed to conduct a
   > proper investigation in a notorious computer crime crackdown,
   > and went too far in retaining  custody of seized equipment. 
   > 
   > secret service special agent timothy foley of chicago, who was in
   > charge of three austin computer search-and-seizures on march 1,
   > 1990, that led to the lawsuit, stoically endured spark's rebuke
   > over the service's poor investigation and abusive computer
   > seizure policies.  while the service has seized dozens of
   > computers since the crackdown began in 1990, this is the first
   > case to challenge the practice. 
   > 
   > sparks grew visibly angry when it was established that the austin
   > science fiction magazine and game book publisher was never
   > suspected of a crime, and that agents did not do even marginal
   > research to establish a criminal connection between the firm and
   > the suspected illegal activities of an employee, or to determine
   > that the company was a publisher. indeed, agents testified that
   > they were not even trained in the privacy protection act at the
   > special secret service school on computer crime. 
   > 
   > "how long would it have taken you, mr. foley, to find out what
   > steve jackson games did, what it was?" asked sparks. "an hour?

   > arpanet's  functions not only continued but steadily improved. 
   > the use of  tcp/ip standards for computer networking is now
   > global.  in 1971, a  mere twenty-one years ago, there were only
   > four nodes in the  arpanet  network.  today there are tens of
   > thousands of  nodes in  the internet,  scattered over forty-two

 <7.2> how internet `anarchy' like the english language?
 
   according to bruce sterling <bruces@well.sf.ca.us>:
 
   > the internet's `anarchy' may seem strange or even unnatural,  but
   > it makes a certain deep and basic sense.  it's rather like the 
   > `anarchy' of the english language.  nobody rents english, and
   > nobody  owns english.    as an english-speaking person, it's up
   > to you to learn  how to speak english properly  and make whatever
   > use you please  of it (though the government provides certain
   > subsidies to help you  learn to read and write a bit).  
   > otherwise, everybody just sort of  pitches in, and somehow the
   > thing evolves on its own, and somehow  turns out workable.  and
   > interesting.   fascinating, even.   though a lot  of people earn
   > their living from using and exploiting  and teaching  english,
   > `english' as an institution is public property, a public good.  
   > much the same goes for the internet.   would english  be improved
   > if  the `the english language, inc.'  had a board of directors
   > and a chief  executive officer, or a president and a congress?  
   > there'd probably be  a lot fewer new words in english, and a lot
   > fewer new ideas.

     usenet?  what are the costs involved?
   - famous or obscure examples of compromised privacy
     on the internet.
         - ftp site for the code (not the code) to turn the .plan file into a
                 named pipe for sensing/reacting to remote `fingers'.
   - knowledge on the `promiscuous' mode of receipt or transmission 
     on network  cards.
   - details on the infamous experiment where a scientist resubmitted 
     previously accepted papers to a prominent journal with new and
     unknown authors that were subsequently rejected.
   - x windows, eff, cpsr faqhood in news.answers.
   
   commerical use of this document is negotiable and is a way for the
   author to recoup from a significant time investment. email feedback
