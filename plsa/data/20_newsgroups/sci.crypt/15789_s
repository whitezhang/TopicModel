 	have the feds shut down the people making sound blaster? what
 about apple and next? apple, next, sun, and others make systems that
 can handle cd-quality audio in and out, and can perform arbitrary
 transformation on it in the process of transmitting it across a network
 or modem.
 
 	perhaps there's a market for a portable vocoder. not a crypto
 device, simply an rs232<->voice converter. make it capable of recording
 speech and playing it back simultaneously. it has applications for
 multimedia, computing for the handicapped, internet talk radio, irc,
 etc, etc, etc.  it wouldn't be a cryptographic device at all - but i
 suppose someone could have it hooked to a 486 laptop with a v.32bis
 modem and some crypto software. i'd market the thing with an api for
 text-to-speech using simple phonemes and the ability to use speech
 samples. and, of course, i'd publish the interface to it so other
 folks could write any applications they wanted to talk to the thing.
