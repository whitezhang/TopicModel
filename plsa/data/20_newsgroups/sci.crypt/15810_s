 a circut court judge in illinois once said "when dealing with a government
 that seeks continually new and more creative ways to spy on its' citizenry,
 one cannot discourage the move to empower the common citizen with the means
 to parry this attack on personal privacy."
 
 (unfortunately the comment was with regard to the banning of radar
 detectors....)
 
 the point remains.  more and more i see the government slowly washing
 away privacy.  even unwittingly.  do you think i will ever live in a
 soceity that issues smart cards to citizens at birth?  do you think i
 will live in a soceity that insists i register my crypto keys so they
 can keep track of what i'm saying?  even if there is no evidence of my
 guilt?  do you think i will ever live in a soceity that seeks to meddle
 in the affairs of its' citizenry without recourse of any kind?  i'm tired
 of it.  there is (imho) no compromise with an administration that seeks
 to implement these proposals under the guise of enhancing privacy.
 
 more than the proposals themselves, i read the language of the press
 releases, the obvious deception involved in presenting these pieces to
 the public, and i am sickened.  i am revolted.  i am repulsed.
 
 90%, perhaps even 95% of this country could care less about the
 clipper chip, the wiretap bill, the smart card, because they are so
 entrapped in the rhetoric of the clinton administration.
 
 this saddens and frightens me.
 
 i am a conserveative believe it or not.  a law and order conserveative.
 but the move to a centralized authoratarian regime really scares me,
 mostly because i know you cant go far wrong underestimating the
 intelligence of the american people.  tell them it's going to keep
 them safe from drug dealers and terrorists, and they will let you
 put cameras in their home.
 
 even in the wake of waco, you find those who support the increasingly
 totalatarian moves.

 to be quite honest, the way things are going, i'd call it self defense.

 and i dont want mine growning up in the eyes of a security camera
 24 hours a day.
