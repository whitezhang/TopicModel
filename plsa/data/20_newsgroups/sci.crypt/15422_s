 you can find the salient difference in any number of 5th amendment
 related supreme court opinions. the court limits 5th amendment
 protections to what they call "testimonial" evidence, as opposed to
 physical evidence.
 
 the whole question would hinge on whether a crypto key would be
 considered "testimonial" evidence. i suppose arguments could be made
 either way, though obviously i would hope it would be considered
 testimonial.
