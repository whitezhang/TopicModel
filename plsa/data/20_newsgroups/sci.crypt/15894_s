 fun!  three questions:
 
 1) what hardware did you use?
 2) when you found the key, was there anything about it that was special
    that meant you had been lucky to find it early? (like the first 30 bits
    all being 0)
 3) ... or did you mean a dictionary attack rather than a binary key attack?
