 in light of my recent paranoia concerning government proposals, i'd love to
 see a unix-based encryption scheme that:
 
 1) kept some files encrypted on the host machine (say, all the files in your
    home directory)
 2) used a key system that could not be compromised by eavesdropping over a
    modem line.
 
 it seems that this would require modifications to a shell program and a
 way of telling whether a file was encrypted or not, among other things.
 
 i'd love to know about potential security holes in such a system.
 
 does such a system exist?  if it were made easy-to-use and readily
 available, i think it would be a good thing(tm).  i realize that this
 would probably just involve putting a nice front-end on a readily available
 and very secure encryption scheme, but it should be done.
 
 thanks for the ear,
 brad
