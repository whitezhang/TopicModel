 codecs.  they have to get about 6:1 compression on 8 bit samples to squeeze
 them down v32bis.  i played around with the lossless 'shorten' program
 last night, but it only managed 2.5:1.  i've got some specimen celp code
 but it's not obvious that it runs in real time; i think it's just proof-of-
 concept code, and i have some mucking about with file formats to do before
 i can put my own sample through it.
 
 looks like the current option is to use a voice-mail modem with built-in
 dsp chip to do this in hardware.  that means two modems for a system,
 putting the cost at $600 upwards.  ouch.  maybe soon we'll be able to
 do it in software on high-powered games consoles - isn't the 3do an
 acorn risc machine inside?  that cpu runs like shit off a shovel... and
 will be nicely mass-market too.
