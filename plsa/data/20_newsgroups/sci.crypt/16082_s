 the *security* of the system does depend only on the secrecy of the keys.
 
 the ability to tap is an inherent *insecurity* which depends fundamentally on
 the secrecy of the algorithm.  to spell it out, because so many people seem to
 miss the point, if the algorithm were published, anyone could create a chip
 which would work correctly with the skipjack chips but which would not have
 its key registered.
 
 i believe there is no technical means of ensuring key escrow without the
 government maintaining a secret of some kind.  for example, the secret could be
 the private keys of the escrow agencies; their digital signatures would be
 required before a key could be used.  in this case, the nsa/nist/whoever has
 decided that protecting the entire algorithm is easier/cheaper/more secure than
 other possible protocols.
