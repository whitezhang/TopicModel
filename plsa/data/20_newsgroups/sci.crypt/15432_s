    for example, i don't own a cordless phone.  with clipper, i would.  if the 
    local men in blue really want to listen to me talk to my friends or order 
    pizza, i'm no worse off than i am now, and i don't have to worry about
    local kids or nosy neighbors.
 i do tend to agree.  sigh.
 
    so, where can i buy a des-encrypted cellular phone?  how much does it cost?
 
 of course, if we didn't have government monopolies on cellular phone service,
 there probably *would* be some available.

    the second and fourth amendments do come to mind.  
 
 the second amendment is especially apt, given the itar definitions of
 crypto equipment as munitions, and the gun-control people's increasing
 ability to define things as "assault weapons" and make them illegal.
 triple-des is obviously used for "assault phones", while
 cripple will be legal, and triple-cripple may fall into the gray area
 of "illegally upgrading to an assault phone"...
