 the nra is successful because (among a number of things), on the drop of
 a hat, they can get a congresspersons office flooded with postcards,
 faxes and phone calls.  certainly, with our way-cool internet powers of
 organization, we can act in the same way, if such action is appropriate.
 
 as long as we are kept informed of events, anyone on this bboard can make
 a call to action.  hopefully, we're a strong enough community to act on
 those calls.  i realize this is a little optomistic, and i'm glad eff is
 working in the loop on these issues, but don't underestimate the
 potential of the net for political action.
