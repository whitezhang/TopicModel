 a nice formulation for the introduction of the first encryption
 devices with built-in trapdoors - just like the feds wanted...

 bla-bla.

 indeed, and the current proposal does nothing to prevent the latter.

 this doesn't say much. there are many incredibly weak encryption
 algorithms in commercial use today...

 except from the government.

 nope. the criminals won't be stupid enough to use the new chip,
 they'll use something secure. this technology provides only means to
 intercept the phone conversations of people who are stupid enough to
 use it.

 that is, the government has the keys. it doesn't matter much if they
 are in one or in two of its hands...

 correct. it does, however, provide those americans with the false
 sense of privacy.

 if the screening is not public, it cannot be trusted. some people do
 not trust des even today, after all the examinations - only because
 some parts of its design were kept secret.

 so they'll use a different technology to hide their illegal
 activities. so will those law-abiding citizens, who do not trust their
 government not to misuse its abilities to decrypt their conversations.

 huh? later it says that the new technology will be export restricted.

 in short, the new technology can:
 
 1) protect the law abiding citizen's privacy from the casual snooper.
 
 it cannot:
 
 1) protect him from the government, if it decides to misuse its
 ability to decrypt the conversations.
 
 2) protect him from the criminals who succeed to break the new
 encryption scheme or to steal the keys, or to bribe the people who
 handle them, etc.
 
 3) prevent the criminals from using secure encryption for
 communication.

 correct. however, it does not provide them that much privacy as it
 claims.

 if it's not entirely open to public examination, it cannot be
 trusted. besides, who can prove that the devices used for examination
 and the ones built into your phones will be the same?

 bullshit. the proposed technology provides a false sense of security,
 encryption devices with built-in capabilities for breaking the
 encryption, does not prevent the criminals to use strong crypto, and
 is a step to outlaw strong crypto.

 ok, i'm not american, it's not my business, but i just couldn't resist
 to comment... the whole plot looks so totalitaristic... it's up to
 you, americans, to fight for your rights.

 p.s. now is the time for david sternlight to pop up and claim that the
 new system is great.
