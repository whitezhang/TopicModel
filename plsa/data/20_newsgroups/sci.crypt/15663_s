 at the company i worked for previously, i received a file that was des encryped
 and the person that had sent it, went on vaction.  rather than wait two weeks
 i set up a straight frontal attack with one key at a time.  it only took two(2)
 days to crack the file.  no, i don't have any faith in des.
