 you're right, and i retract the suggestion.  still, i wonder.  that
 there are only 60 bits of key information should, in principle, be
 detectable.  maybe some variant of the tests rivest et al. did to
 demonstrate that des was probably not a group?  it should make an
 interesting paper -- a black-box analysis of a cryptosystem.
