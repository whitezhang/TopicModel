 a person i know, belonging to a research lab of a rivate
 company, claimed to me during a priavte conversation that, given the
 equipment in his lab, he could crack a kerberos ticket in 15 minutes to
 an hour. he had access to rather powerful des hardware, but not of an
 extraordinare kind, i believe. the attack was possible because of the
 amount of known plaintext in the ticket, which itself constitutes a small
 message. this was two years ago.
 des is no longer usable for encryption of really sensitive data. for a
 lot of purposes, however, it is still very adequate.
