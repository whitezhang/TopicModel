 i just found out from my source that this article was a joke.  heh heh..  
 it seemed pretty damn convincing to me from the start -- i just didn't
 notice the smiley at the end of the article, and there were a few other
 hints which i should of caught.
 
 anyway -- i guess this 'joke' did turn out to resemble clinton's true

 sorry about that...
