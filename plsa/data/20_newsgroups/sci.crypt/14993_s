 this actually supports bill's speculation - if there is a backdoor in
 rsaref and if pkp is supported secretly by the nsa, then it is more
 than natural that they will welcome any public-key implementation that
 uses rsaref and will strongly oppose themselves against any
 implementation that doesn't.
 
 i personally cannot see how one could put a backdoor in a
 long-precision modular arithmetic library that comes in source, but,
 of course, the fact that -i- cannot see it means nothing...
