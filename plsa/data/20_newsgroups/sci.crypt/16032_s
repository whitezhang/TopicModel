 why not?  it hasn't been released, so there's no way for you to evaluate it 
 yet.  after all, apple could have been smart and had aoce use an md5 hash 
 encrypted with rsa, just like pkcs signatures.  they could even be actually 
 pkcs compliant, for all you know; why not wait until it is released, and hard 
 information is available, before passing judgement on it?
 
 aoce's algorithm's aren't secret because apple's being fascistic--aoce itself 
 remains secret (except for apple demos at macworld :)), simply because it's 
 not done yet.
 
 it may be flawed, and it may not.  however, you can't tell which until you 
 actually see it.  i, at least, am quite impressed with what i have seen so 
 far, and have no expectation of being disappointed.
