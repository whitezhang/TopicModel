 let's assume, for the moment, that the system really is secure unless
 you get both halves of the encryption key from the two independent
 escrow houses.  let's say you even trust the escrow houses -- one is
 the aclu and the other is the eff.  (and i'm not entirely joking about
 those two names)
 
 in that case the prince of wales has nothing to worry about on this
 system.  indeed, as pointed out, since the current systems, even the
 current digital systems, are very easy to decode -- right now anybody
 with an old tv can hear them -- for most people, this will be viewed
 as an "oh goody" step upwards.
 
 and look at how tolerant the public is.  they're willing to let the
 neighbours with the radios hear right now.
 
 it was suggested by one person that a *lot* of non-evidentiary wiretapping
 is going on right now without warrants, because anybody can do it and it's
 just an ecpa violation.  this would stop that.  all tapping would need
 a warrant, or a breach of security at the escrow houses.
