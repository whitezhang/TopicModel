 the key question is whether non-clipper encryption will be made illegal.

 the clear middle ground implied by these statements is to say that americans
 have the right to clipper encryption, but not to unbreakable encryption.
 this implies that, ultimately, non-clipper strong encryption must become
 illegal.
 
 (as an aside, isn't the language here jarring?  all this talk about
 "harmonious balance" when they're talking about taking away people's
 right to communications privacy?)
 
 although the article emphasizes voice communication, data and mail encryption
 is mentioned as well:

 it looks like the worst nightmares raised by dorothy denning's proposals
 are coming true.  if the government continues on this course, i imagine
 that we will see strong cryptography made illegal.  encryption programs
 for disk files and email, as well as software to allow for encrypted
 voice communications, will be distributed only through the
 "underground".  people will have to learn how to hide the fact that
 they are protecting their privacy.
 
 it's shocking and frightening to see that this is actually happening here.
