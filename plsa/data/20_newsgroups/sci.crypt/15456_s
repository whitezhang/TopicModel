 i would think that you could reduce the defense of using non-clipper
 based encryption technologies to defending freedom of expression 
 (ie, free speech).  that you have to right to express whatever you
 want in whatever form your little heart desires so long as you do
 not impinge on the rights of others.
 
 encrypted text/sound/video is just another form of expression of that
 particular text/sound/video.  just like digitized sound is another 
 means of expression of sound -- streams of 100100101111 instead of
 continuous waveforms.
 
 also, it shouldn't be up to the government at all.  encryption 
 _standards_ can be decided upon by independent standards orgainizations
 (apologies for the acronym).  one can note how well this has worked
 with iso and the metric system, sae, etc.  independent entities 
 or consortia of people/industries in that particular area are far
 more qualified to set standards than any one government agency.
 consider for example what the ascii character set would have looked
 like if it was decided by the government.
 
 i hope this helps folks to formulate their defenses.  i'm still working
 on mine and hope to be faxing my congressmen soon...
