 not at all. two weeks ago i registered a concern about some programming
 that was being conducted by a student organisation here at the
 university of texas at san antonio.  as a result, i was interrogated
 by the capus police, who also attempted to create a positive-identification
 file (photo, fingerprints, etc.). i refused to permit this, and filed a
 complaint with the university administration.  the vice-president for
 business affairs (the 'boss' of the campus police) stated that he had no
 interest in the legal/constitutional implications of those actions.
