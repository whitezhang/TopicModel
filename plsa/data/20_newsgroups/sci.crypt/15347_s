 
 being a browser of this group for some time,
   and being very concerned about the clipper chip proposal,
     i am hoping someone with more knowledge can help out.
 
 who would be the most influential people to write to, protesting 
 the obvious next step hinted at by this proposal ?
  (heads of what committees, etc.)
 
 what are the major flaws in the plan ?
  (from a cryptological standpoint)
