 there are chips which perform the voice compression/expansion.  they can't
 be expensive, because they exist in many phones connected to pbxs or on the
 pbx line cards, as well as in a lot of equipment which compresses
 voice-grade circuits to save the cost of long-distance, leased t1s or
 satellite circuits.
 
 i can't remember the generic term for these chips.  my impression is that
 this was a big deal 10 years ago, but circuits have gotten so cheap that
 it isn't done much now.
