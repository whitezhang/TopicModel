 i must respectfully disagree with this assertion, brad.  the government is
 notoriously sloppy with physical, communications, and information security.  they
 can't keep their computers safe, and they're "trying".  read "dea is
 not adequately protecting national security information" [gao/imtec 92-31] for an
 excellent example of what i'm talking about.
 
 private sector organizations tend to be even more lax in their security measures.
 i believe that the escrow organizations will be penetrated by foreign
 intelligence services within months, if not weeks, of their selection.  private
 organizations that lack the resources of a full-fleged intelligence service will
 take longer - perhaps on the order of one to two years.  nonetheless, the
 penetrations will take place, without question.
