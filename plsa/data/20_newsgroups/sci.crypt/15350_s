    i was wanting to ask the same question dan bernstein asked--how does the
 clipper chip exchange keys?  if the public key is only 80 or 160 bits long,
 does anyone know of any public-key schemes that are secure with that key
 size?  (diffie-hellman or maybe el gamal, with p set to a constant value?)
    presumably, the real scheme is something like:
  
    1.  exchange/verify public keys.
    2.  send encrypted (randomly-generated) session key.
    3.  encrypt / decrypt voice trafic with some sort of fast stream cipher.
  
    can anyone elaborate on this, or show me what i'm missing here?
