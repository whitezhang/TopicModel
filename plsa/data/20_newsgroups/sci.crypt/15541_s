   assuming that the bad guys can easily obtain substitute chips which don't
 cause any noticeable effect to either the user or the person at the other end
 of the line (if there is any significant difficulty to obtaining such chips,
 some of the criminals will decide to fall back on the murder/kidnap method).

  this assumes that the feds are tapping clipper phones belonging to ordinary
 citizens (getting such a phone is the whole point of the crime under
 discussion).  to be sure, i wouldn't put it past them -- but raising the
 possibility of such crime has the benefit of forcing the feds to either
 'fess up about such intentions in advance or state that using clipper
 exposes the user to an additional criminal threat. <g>

   agreed.
