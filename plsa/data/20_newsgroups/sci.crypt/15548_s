    it depends on the attack.  adding a bit to the key doubles the amount of
 work to be done in a straight brute-force attack, where you try every single
 possible key until one works.  processing and storage requirements for this
 kind of attack on a 128-bit key seem like they ought to make it effectively
 impossible.  however, there may be other attacks whose difficulty is (for
 example) proportional to, say, 2**sqrt(n), or some such.  also, a long
 key does you little good if there is a way to incrementally guess a little
 of the key at a time....
