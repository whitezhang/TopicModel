         but that's just the problem. there is no such thing as
         "mime-formatted". by analogy, mime is a content-labelling
         standard for the box, not a specification for the contents
         themselves. it provides a standard for "like-minded"
         individuals to exchange mail containing an agreed-upon data
         format.
