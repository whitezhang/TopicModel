 	the protocol/key-management description published so far is either
 	incomplete or incorrect. it leaves me with no idea of how the system
 	would actually _work_. i hope the cpsr foia request succeeds so that
 	we get full details.
 
 wouldn't it be easier just to ask denning@cs.georgetown.edu? ;-)
