 the clipper chip will have no effect.  current generation pcs, portable
 and desktop, all have analog voice -> digital voice and vice versa
 capabilities.  so, i only need a modem output to the telephone,
 and i can interpose any encryption screen on my voice traffic i want.
 
 not even a big deal, but it will pass muster if the have a way
 of checking whether i am using their clipper chip encryption without
 a full decoding.
 
 i have been chided for stating that dorthy denning was intellectually
 dishonest in the acm debate and in this newsgroup.  i have previously
 refrained from suggesting that she is arguing on behalf of consulting
 clients.
 
 now, i say that it is clear that dorthy denning has been functioning
 as a lobbyist, not a computer scientist.  she has used legal ethics
 (truth is what you can convince anyone of), not scientific ethics
 (truth is understanding the external world).
 
 maybe we can revoke her acm membership? 8)
