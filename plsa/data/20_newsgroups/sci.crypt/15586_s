 i apologize for being so dense but this sentence reads as if it
 was lifted from a luis bunuel screenplay.  am i missing something?
 why on earth would drug smugglers even _use_ the device then?
 obviously, they'll be using something like triple encryption des instead.
 as long as alternatives to clipper remain legal, clipper accomplishes
 absolutely nothing, zero, as far as law enforcement is concerned.
 the whole scheme is an absolute, total, incredible, waste of government
 time and money as long as other encryption schemes that are any good 
 remain legal.  in order for clipper to work as intended all strong
 cryptosystems have to be outlawed.
