 you seem to be assuming that all arrests are of equal value, and that
 the use of wiretaps is spread uniformly among them.
 
 given this comparatively tiny number of wiretaps, and the associated
 difficulty and cost involved (judges, technicians, etc) i expect that
 law enforcement reserves the use of wiretaps for the most valuable
 cases.  since the "value" of an arrest can vary over an enormous range
 (eg. jaywalking -> mass murder) i think your $5 million estimate may
 be too low by a couple of orders of magnitude.
