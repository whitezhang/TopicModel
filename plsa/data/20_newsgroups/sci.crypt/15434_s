 (it's nist, not nsa.  nsa is not supposed to have anything to do with this.)
 they didn't say that.  they said is was better than some commercial-grade
 encryptions.  i, for one, wouldn't trust them if they did, unless they
 release the algorithm for investigation.

 i wouldn't trust the nsa.  i think i would trust the president on this, but
 i'm not certain he would be told.

 i want to emphasize the i am not speaking for beckman instruments at this

 that our customers come first, ahead of our government's whims.
