 it depends on the mode you're using.  for a single 64-bit input block, a
 one-bit error will have a 50 percent chance of corrupting each of the 64
 output bits - in other words, it essentially turns the output block into
 a random number.  if you're encrypting data in cbc mode, however, only the
 one 64-bit block will be affected.  the next block, and all that follow it
 will be decrypted properly.
 
 it's a good idea to have some kind of error correction in your system if
 corrupted bits are likely.
