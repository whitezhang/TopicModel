 gentlefolk,
 
         it seems to me that the "step 1" of taking a warrant to the
         telco to get a wiretap is so much stinky red herring (don't
         you love animal metaphors).
 
         with each phone broadcasting the serial number of its chip
         ("e(n;f)" is not syntactically different than "n"), all they
         have to do is aim a reciever in the general direction of
         today's target and use the serial number to identify the
         session they want, and get the chip number of the other end of
         the conversation. even without the key, this is great for
         traffic analysis. i can think of several ways to learn the
         right serial number.
 
         it looks like one intended effect of the clipper is to
         eliminate the awkward business of getting the telco to
         cooperate (or risking getting caught in the act with your
         alligator clips erect). this is particularly handy if you have
         s1 and s2.
 
         btw, did anyone explain why they are scrambling the serial
         number?
         
         cheers,
                 marc
