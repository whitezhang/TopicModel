 :    does dorothy denning read this group?  if not, is someone on the group
 : forwarding questions like these to her, or martin hellman, or anyone else
 : who's seen more details about the chip?
 
 of course she does; it's just she's been toasted so often for being
 an nsa patsy that she's keeping her head down.  you can always mail
 her directly as denning@guvax.acc.georgetown.edu,
 denning@cs.cosc.georgetown.edu or denning@cs.georgetown.edu
