 i forwarded an old posting about celp speech compression:
 
 	in case you'd like to experiment with celp, you can obtain a software
 	implementation of the 4800 bps fed std celp coder for free:
 
 	the u.s. dod's federal-standard-1016 based 4800 bps code excited linear
 	prediction voice coder version 3.2 (celp 3.2) fortran and c simulation source
 	codes are now available for worldwide distribution at no charge (on dos
 	diskettes, but configured to compile on sun sparc stations) from:
 
 i've since been told that the source of this is on cygnus.com
 in /pub/celp.speech.tar.z
 
 i'm not in a position to; any sun tcp/ip gurus out there who think they
 can marry this with netfone by the end of the week? ;-)  seriously.  i
 think someone with real net access and two sparcs could have this running
 by the end of the week.  then we ask the pgp guys to add a bytestream
 crypto filter.  two weeks at the most.  [damn, i wish i had my sparc
 back... i'm stuck on a 25mhz 386sx]
 
 
 share and enjoy!

 ps  you'll have to use archie to find netfone - i have a copy but no note
 of where it's from; author in the docs is kelvin@autodesk.com and he
 appears to be located in france
