 of a change is it?  att's last product in this area (a) was priced over
 $1000, as i suspect 'clipper' phones will be; (b) came to the customer 
 with the key automatically preregistered with government authorities. thus,
 aside from attempting to further legitimize and solidify the fed's posture,
 clipper seems to be "more of the same", rather than a new direction.
    yes, technology will eventually drive the cost down and thereby promote
 more widespread use- but at present, the man on the street is not going
 to purchase a $1000 crypto telephone, especially when the guy on the other
 end probably doesn't have one anyway.  am i missing something?
    the real question is what the gov will do in a year or two when air-
 tight voice privacy on a phone line is as close as your nearest pc.  that
 has got to a problematic scenario for them, even if the extent of usage
 never surpasses the 'underground' stature of pgp.
