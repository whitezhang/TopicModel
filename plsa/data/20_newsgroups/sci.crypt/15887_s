 my choice for the escow house would be the smithsonian, and someplace on
 the west coast.  my biggest concern isn't that the escrow house could
 be compromised (it will be), but the fact it has been compromised will
 be kept secret.  
 
 the keys could be kept under glass, with 24-hour c-span coverage.  if you
 thought your key had been stolen just turn on the cable, and wait until
 the roving camera reachs the musuem case with your key.  or if you think the
 c-span satellite has been compromised, take a tour of the smithsonian
 yourself, and view the seal on your key.
