 are you sure that the field is in the area you found the antenna
 farm?  the tomb ("ymvos") of marathon which herodotus specifies as near
 the fighting area is in an area open to the public.
 
 you must be referring to the u.s. army base of "nea makri".  it was
 built by the u.s. in the same manner as bases all over the world
 (w. germany, spain, philippines, turkey etc.) were built.  i think
 it was a telecommunications hub.  over the recent years u.s. forces
 have withdrawn from the base and removed all military equipment.  the
 area is currently under the control of the greek navy until the all
 interested parties (local goverment, central goverment, political parties
 agree on what should be done with the land (park, recreation area,
 real-estate.)
 
 (this has nothing to do with cryptography, security and the eff; i have
 redirected followups to soc.culture.greek)
