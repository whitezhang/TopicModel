 thousands?  tens of thousands?  do some arithmetic, please...  skipjack
 has 2^80 possible keys.  let's assume a brute-force engine like that
 hypothesized for des:  1 microsecond per trial, 1 million chips.  that's
 10^12 trials per second, or about 38,000 years for 2^80 trials.  well,
 maybe they can get chips running at one trial per nanosecond, and build
 a machine with 10 million chips.  sure -- only 3.8 years for each solution.
 
 idea uses 128-bit keys.  shall i bother doing the calculations for you?
 hint:  multiply 3.8 years by 2^(128-80).  and you can't do idea at that
 speed; key setup takes much too long.  i wouldn't be surprised if that
 were the case for skipjack, too, though there's no way of knowing just
 yet.  des used only xor because that's what was feasible with mid-70's
 technology.  modern chips can do a lot more.
 
 nsa may or may not know how to crack skipjack and idea (i doubt it for
 the former; i have no idea for the latter, though it does seem to be a
 strong cryptosystem).  but it ain't gonna be by exhaustive search.
