 
 ok, i heard a lot of talk about the nsa's infamous control over encryption
 export through the itar.  here's a question.  say i develop this great new
 encryption system, and i want to sell my software worldwide.  the thought
 police then come in and say "this algorithm is a threat to national security.
 you will not be permitted to export it."  at this point, what kind of trouble
 could i get into if i ignored the itar and sold my program to international
 customers anyway?
