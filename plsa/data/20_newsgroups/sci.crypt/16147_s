 er, people are going to make personal attacks on prof. denning whether she
 posts here or not.  that much should be obvious from looking at the traffic
 over the last few weeks.  therefore i conclude that the existence of personal
 attacks is irrelevant to any decision concerning whether to post.
 
 i suspect that prof. denning is actually using the attacks as an excuse for
 not posting, and that the real reason for the silence is that clipper is not
 the sort of proposal any self-respecting cryptographer can support via
 reasoned argument.
