 they key depositories are irrelevant. in order for the applicable law
 enformcement agencies to be able to know what keys to request from
 escrow, the system will have to squawk its serial number in clear text
 as part of the link establishment protocol. whoever owns the program 
 that assigns keys to each serial number won't need access to the key
 depository.
 
 in other words, the fbi may need a court-ordered release of escrowed
 keys, but the nsa has the keys before the chip is ever manufactured.
 there is no need to go through the escrow or to try all keys. while
 relations between law enforment agencies have sometimes been strained,
 there is also a long history of trading favors. this will re-establish
 the nsa as a very important agency for everyone to get along with,
 because they can give you untraceable encryption leaks without court
 orders.
 
 the more i think about this affair, the fouler it smells. i'd rather
 have a des with an engineered-in backdoor ...
