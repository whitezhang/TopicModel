     if they released the algorithm, it would be possible for someone
     to come up with an implementation which was identical, but
     lacking an escrowed key.
 
     note that the press announcement mentioned that the algorithm was
     being kept secret for security of the key escrow system.  in this
     case security means "an escrowed key for every clipper chip".
 
 
     assuming you believed all that is said about the effective of
     the algorithm, and the escrow system, which would you buy :
 
      (a)  chip from firm a with the escrowed key
      (b)  second source chip from reputable firm b with no key
           in government escrow.
 
     there would obviously be powerful economic incentives for a second
     source, non escrowed, vendor.
