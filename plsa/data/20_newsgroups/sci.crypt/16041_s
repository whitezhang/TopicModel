       i am aware of the restrictions imposed by the munitions act
    on the export of cryptographic technology, however, is it illegal to
    transmit encrypted data from the u.s. to another country?  if so,
    then which laws apply to this situation?
 
 from the us law perspective, unless you're engaging in illegal speech,
 it's not illegal to use encryption.  yet.  the nsa is allowed to try
 to listen, but you're not obligated to make it easy for them.  yet.
 the other country may have more repressive laws about that;
 i gather france's bureaucracy wants to know what you're saying, 
 and in the old soviet union, they didn't need laws to make things illegal :-(
 
 (paranoia follows, for those of you who want to play it safe :-)
 the fact that the nsa is listening may affect your willingness to use
 wimpy crypto technologies, but it may also affect your willingness to
 use technologies that violate rsa's patents, e.g. if you use pgp, the
 nsa may tell rsa that you're doing so, and if the secret service catches on,
 they may decide that the mere fact that rsa hasn't filed a lawsuit
 against you doesn't mean that you don't deserve to have your computer
 confiscated for possible patent violation, munitions law violation,
 espionage, money laundering, drug importation, and creatin' a disturbance,
 and then not give it back because you *did* violate the patent even
 though they had to drop all the other charges, unlike that nasty steve
 jackson who had the gall not to be guilty of *anything*.
