    aspect of our lives. 
    clinton is just more clever than the other guy. looks like gun control for
    privacy technology. one small step at a time.
 
 remember "defend firearms - defeat dukakis", followed by bush's soon-after-
 election support for gun-control?   this is the democrats' version
 "defend free speech - reject republicans" followed by speech control.

    hmmm, i feel better now. i believe the white house when they tell us
    this first step is, in fact, the final step. all is ok. we've nothing to fear.
    they're here to help us.   god bless america.
