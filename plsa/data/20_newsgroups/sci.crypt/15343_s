 short summary of what bellovin says hellman says the nsa says: there is
 a global key g, plus one key u_c for each chip c. the user can choose a
 new session key k_p for each phone call p he makes. chip c knows three
 keys: g, its own u_c, and the user's k_p. the government as a whole
 knows g and every u_c. apparently a message m is encrypted as
 e_g(e_{u_c}(k_p),c) , e_{k_p}(m). that's it.
 
 the system as described here can't possibly work. what happens when
 someone plugs the above ciphertext into a receiving chip? to get m
 the receiving chip needs k_p; to get k_p the receiving chip needs u_c.
 the only information it can work with is c. if u_c can be computed
 from c then the system is cryptographically useless and the ``key
 escrow'' is bullshit. otherwise how is a message decrypted?
