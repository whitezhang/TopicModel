 clipper chip is a response to the fact that there is no business
 or professional body in a position to establish a standard and
 provide chipsets to implement it for analog or digial transmission
 systems.
 
 rsa might be in position to do it, if they had active cooperation of
 a couple of manufacturers of cellular phones or desktop phones.
 
 large companies in the voice/data comm business are out, because they
 all have contracts with the gov which would be used to pressure them.
 
 if we, as professionals in crypto organizations, eff, etc. were to
 put our collective minds and interests toward establishing a
 crypto standard for transmission, and getting our companies to
 implement it, we might avoid government control.
 
 otherwise, i think it will happen to us by default.  gov isn't probably
 strong enough or foolish enough to prevent strong crypt.  they
 are strong enough, and we may be foolish enough, to push through
 the clipper chip.
 
 is rsa independt of the gov enough to spearhead this?  i, for one,
 would *gladly* pay royalties via purchasing secure phones.
 
 if not this, we should provide an algorithm which can be implemented
 in either sw or hw and publish it, then push to make it the defacto
 standard in the way that pgp and ripem are becoming such.
 
 we are opposing, charging the bunker.  we should be nimble and clever.
 the gov is strong, not clever.
