 i hate to follow up to my own posting, but i should perhaps clarify
 some things so i won't get flamed.
 
 first of all, when i'm talking about ``factoring the modulus'' or a
 ``breakthrough in factoring'', what i really mean is a breakthrough in
 the cryptanalysis of rsa.  i know that factoring and breaking rsa are
 not proven to be equivalent; it's just so damn convenient not to
 repeat this every time.
 
 i also have to admit that i don't really know if the ``non-group''
 property of a cipher is essential only for key chaining.  i have
 thought about it a little while, but i can't find a way that a
 cryptanalyst could exploit a group structure.  that, of course, means
 nothing at all.
 
 then i wrote,

 what i meant was that as long as the only advantage of the
 cryptanalyst is a faster computer, then we will probably have rsa for
 a long time to come, because even if 1024-bit moduli somehow could be
 broken with fast computers (not with a new algorithm), then people
 would simply use longer moduli.  both users and cryptanalysts benefit
 from better technology in the same way.
 
 hope this keeps the flames away...  have fun.
