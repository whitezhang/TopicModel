 if brad's analysis is correct, it may offer an explanation for why the
 encryption algorithm is being kept secret.  this will prevent competitors
 from coming out with clipper-compatible phones which lack the government-
 installed "back door."  the strategy brad describes will only work as long
 as the only way to get compatible phones is to have ones with the government
 chips.
 
 (it would be nice, from the point of view of personal privacy, if brad
 turns out to be right.  as long as people still have the power to provide
 their own encryption in place of or in addition to the clipper, privacy
 is still possible.  but the wording of several passages in the announcement
 makes me doubt whether this will turn out to be true.)
