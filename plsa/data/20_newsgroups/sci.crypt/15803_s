 there's an out for him.  the announcement talked about strong cryptography
 i believe.  specifically:
 
 	nor is the u.s. saying that "every
      american, as a matter of right, is entitled to an
      unbreakable commercial encryption product."
 
 every vendor claims his product is unbreakable -- so this was sloppy wording.
 
 i am not claiming that we private citizens should have access to the nsa's
 best, secret algorithms.  i don't want any nsa algorithms, actually.
 
 i'll let them break my pitiful amateur algorithms -- and rsa's.
 
 all i want is what i have already -- the ability and right to invent and use
 my own algorithms, share them with my friends and sell them.
