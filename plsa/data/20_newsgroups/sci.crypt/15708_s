 the recent discussion in this news group suggests that a key search attack  
 against des is quite feasible now. but normally des is applied in cbc or cfb  
 mode where one chooses a random init vector of 8 bytes. questions:
 
  - makes it sense to handle the init vector as an additional key? then we have  
 a 56 + 64 = 120 bit key.
  
  - if yes: is anything known about the security of this key scheme? can we  
 break it faster than by exhaustive search through the 120 bit key space?
