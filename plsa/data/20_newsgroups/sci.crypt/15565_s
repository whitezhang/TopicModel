 can we use murder instead of copyright violation, just to keep things

 p.s. i'm sorry to waste bandwidth on a quibble, i just don't want
 anyone to get confused.  i think a bunch of kiddie porn gifs make
 a better test case than a bunch of peanuts strips and that is criminal
 both in posession and distribution.
