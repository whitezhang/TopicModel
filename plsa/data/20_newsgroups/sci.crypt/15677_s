 excellent point, and there's a related point i'd like to make.
 they'll have to back up these databases themselves, won't they?
 how many tape copies will there be, and how secure will the
 tapes be?  if they store them off-site, it wouldn't be too
 hard to hijack them in transit.  if they're all kept on-site,
 one good bomb attack by some group intent on freeing us from
 the threat of government snooping will take care of the problem
 once and for all.  i can see it now -- "hi, we're from the
 government and we, um, misplaced our copy of your key.  could
 you mail us a copy?"
