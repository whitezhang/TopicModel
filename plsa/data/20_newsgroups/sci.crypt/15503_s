 i agree.  so why is cylink the only (and expensive) game in town?
 
 note: i think cylink is great, and if my boss would double my salary, i'd buy 
 a bunch of their stuff :).
 
 one thing that clipper offers is interoperability, at a higher degree of 
 security than we currently have in non-proprietary voice encryption systems.
 this means it will be cheaper than anyone's proprietary scheme, and easier to 
 deploy.  this is, of course, either a bug or a feature depending on how you 
 look at it :).

 great!  where can i buy it?
 
 another note: if "clipper" increases the incentive to bring stronger 
 encryption to the mass market, all the better.  it's far overpriced at 
 the moment.

 i don't care where we *need* to get it from, i care where we *can* get it 
 from, and whether it will interoperate with everyone else.

 you can build them right now as long as you don't want to export (a 
 restriction i firmly oppose).  the only thing stopping people from making 
 cheap encryption is greed: they want a lock on the market.

 oh, come on.  only if you trust it farther than it deserves.  a clipper phone 
 *is not* a substitute for a cylink phone, or a stu-iii.  it's a substitute 
 for the "voice scramblers" advertised in the back of radio electronics.

 i disagree.  modulo itar, it's not the government that has sabotaged the 
 market.

 can you tell me where exactly we have given up that right?
