 
   in order to have formulate a rational position on what cryptography
 policies are acceptable, we must set forth a list of basic requirements.
 i would propose the following as a starting point:
 
   1. the algorithm must be publicly known, and must have a record of
        surviving attempts by outside experts to find weaknesses.
 
   2. the system implementation must make it possible to verify that the
        advertised algorithm is, in fact, the one that is being used.
 
   3. the key must be quickly changeable by the user, and must be of a
        sufficient length and complexity to defeat any brute-force search
        possible now or in the reasonably near future.
 
   note that these requirements are not incompatible with some form of key
 escrow system; the may 1993 issue of "byte" describes an example of an
 encryption system which can clearly be implemented in a manner consistent
 with the above requirements while requiring that parts of the key be
 escrowed in order to have one's public key listed by a central distributor.
