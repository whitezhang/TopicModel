 i am sure that mike is correct on this point.  i am also pretty sure that
 administering "truth serum" would be ruled a violation of your right
 not to incriminate yourself.  but, what is the salient difference?
 both drawing blood and injecting "truth serum" incapacitate you for
 a while, but do no permanent damage.  is it simply that we have come to
 view one as acceptable, while the other is viewed as a fundamental
 violation of one's rights?  if this is the case, how do we expand the
 protections of the 5th amendment to incorporate new technologies without
 the results being a hodgepodge of different judges personal opinions?
