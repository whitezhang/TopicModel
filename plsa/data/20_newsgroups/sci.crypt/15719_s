 first of all, the chip doesn't do that.  it runs at 16 megabits/second,
 which is far beyond what you need for voice.  it's obviously intended
 for data as well, and on high-speed lines at that.
 
 second -- what advantage is there to doing the processing in the phone?
 i don't care how fancy that chip is; it's not as fancy as the roomful
 of analyzers at fort meade running the program they'll have 5 years from
 now.  they can't update every clipper chip that's out there.
 
 third -- if they did do this preprocessing in the chip, it would probably
 have a serious effect on recognizability of the voice patterns.  if
 nothing else, that would hurt the acceptability of the product.  the
 v.32bis modems are just barely fast enough to do a good job on properly-
 massaged voice as is; add any more to the mix, and you're completely out
 of the ballpark.
