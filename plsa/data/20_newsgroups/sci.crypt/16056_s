 it also goes like this:
 
 fed1: we need to listen into <mafia head/druglord/terrorist/bbs sysop>'s
       conversations but don't have probable cause for a tap.
 
 fed2: who do we have a tap on?
 
 fed1: <some other enemy of the state>.
 
 fed2: so get the keys - we can always claim that phone's being used on the
       tapped line.
 
 there's got to be some way to associate an instrument with an individual or
 the state effectively has a tap, possibly not admissible (given the war on
 drugs exceptions to the 4/5 ammendments, who knows) but none the less
 listenable tap on any phone.
