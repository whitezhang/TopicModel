 you should realize that form letters are the *worst* way to influence
 your congresscritters; exact copies are routinely placed on the lowest
 rung of the opinion ladder.
 
 if you want to write (and i think you should!), take the time to really
 *write* a letter.  things to emphasize:
 
 	- it's been said that usenet is available to the 'technical
 	  elite', i.e. the techies at corporate sites and universi-
 	  ties.  emphasize that you are part of the group that will
 	  be making/developing/using clinton's 'data superhighway.'
 
 	- explain how you are intimately familiar with both computing
 	  and data communications. (if this is the case; don't call your-
 	  self an 'expert' after wiring in a 1200 bps modem.)   this
 	  will distinguish your letter from the random flamers.  don't
 	  turn it into braggadocio; just tell them that you know the
 	  technical sides of the issue.
 
 	- don't overdo jargon and gobbledygook.  remember, your letter
 	  will be first read (in all likelihood) by a staffer who may
 	  even be a college student; if they don't understand it, your
 	  views won't even make the 'running total' sheets.
 
 	- be concise; don't ramble.  rants are *definitely* out of place.
 	  cite references, if necessary, but only use "accepted" references
 	  like academic journals.  "my neighbor jim" is *not* a real refer-
 	  ence.  8)
 
 	- unfortunately, very few congresscritters *really* understand
 	  electronic communications.  encourage them to pick up access
 	  to compuserve, america online, or one of the free-nets.  offer
 	  to send them samples.  if you are in a position to do so, offer
 	  them (or their staffers back in the home state) access to your
 	  systems.  offer to give a demonstration the next time they're in
 	  town.  your offer to get *personally* involved in helping them
 	  *will* give your opinions more credence.
 
 	- in addition to sending mail to your representatives, send mail
 	  to the members of the committee (or subcommittee) that is dealing
 	  with the issue.  if your congresscritter isn't on the committee,
 	  they can't be of much help until the matter comes to the floor.

 ps> i'd suggest drawing analogies between digital communication and the
     more traditional media, but usenet doesn't have a decent track record
     in the analogy department.  8)
