 i totally agree.  but how do you propose we take government back?  they
 obviously don't listen to the people or want the people to know who is
 responsibile for what (a person telnetted the site of the clipper chip
 release, to see what the entity 'clipper' was, and got a few lists.
 but when another person tried a bit later, the commands were disabled)
 does not sound like an administration that wants to have any accountability
 or information they don't control given to the people.  the secret
 development and implimentation of the clipper chip decision further
 backs that up.  you can bet unaurhorized encryption methods and software
 will be considered 'terrorist tools' and also subject to civil forfeiture,
 along with the systems that are running it.  you watch, see if i am wrong.
 
 the government is not going to be very cooperative about the people taking
 it back.  and they have all the resources, unlimited access to the media
 for propeganda, and almost all the guns (soon to be all the guns if
 clinton's agenda succeeds)...   those that do not play ball?  waco
 might be a good example of what to expect...  the warrant (just released)
 stated the reason for the raid was the bds spent a very large sum
 for weapons, over an undetermined amount of time.  i don't recall
 spending a lot of money on guns, etc being illegal ... yet, that is.
 
 clinton might go down in history as the worst thing to ever happen to
 the us of a. ... now to be known as the 'peoples socalist democratic
 republic of america'  (psdra).
 
 big brother is listening!!!
 
 hail big brother... (and sister...?)  only ten years late!!!
