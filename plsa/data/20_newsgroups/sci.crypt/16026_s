 i heard somewhere (can't name the source) that tempest does not necessarily
 pick-up just crts, but it can pick up emissions from almost any chip.  if
 that is true, the kind monitor would not make any difference becuase everything
 on the screen can be picked-up from the video controller.  can anybody verify
 or refute this?
