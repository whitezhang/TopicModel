 it's all easy with a dsp. the olivetti quaderno, for example [*great* 1kg
 subnotebook/palmtop pc -- sorry for the plug, folks, but olivetti don't
 seem to be doing a good job marketing it themselves :-)] includes sound
 digitisation hardware; they provide vocoders for their dsp which produce
 varous bit-rates. there's one which gives pretty acceptable voice
 quality at 13kbit/sec, just right for a v.32bis modem.
 
 their dsp can play and record at the same time, too -- so you wouldn't
 need to play "two-way-radio". you can also download code to the dsp
 subunit, though you'd need a software development kit for the dsp in 
 question [dunno which it is...] if you wanted to produce your own 
 vocoder for, say, v.32 speeds.
