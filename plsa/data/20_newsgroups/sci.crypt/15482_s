    just a question. 
    as a provider of a public bbs service - aren't you bound by law to gurantee
    intelligble access to the data of the users on the bbs, if police comes
    with sufficent authorisation ? i guessed this would be  a basic condition
    for such systems. (i did run a bbs some time ago, but that was in switzerland)
 
 you are obliged to let the police search the equipment if they have a
 proper court order. you are under no legal obligation to keep the data
 intelligble. if you wish to run your bbs entirely with all data
 encrypted such that if the police show up they cannot read anything,
 well, thats their problem. there are no legal restrictions on domestic
 use of cryptography in the united states -- yet.
