    "simply?" "everyone" should have this attitude?   the only people
    who can have this attitude are the most hard-core
    computer hackers, who never make phone calls away from their
    computer
 
 in 10 yeards everybody will be talkig into his or her pda anyway.
 that should solve most of the problem.
