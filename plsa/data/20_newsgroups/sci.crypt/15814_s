  
    the clipper chip's user key is formed by:
  
            r1 = e[d[e[n1;s1];s2];s1]
            r2 = e[d[e[n2;s1];s2];s1]
            r3 = e[d[e[n3;s1];s2];s1]
  
    why is the triple-encrytion used?  is it just to gain an effective
 increase in keyspace to defeat a potential keysearch?  (if so, why use
 80 bit keys?)  not knowing anything about the skipjack algorithm, it's
 not really possible to guess whether this makes it harder or easier to
 guess s1,s2.
  
    why are n1, n2, and n3 formed as they are?  it would be facinating to
 see the skipjack algorithm, to look for ways of attacking it that require
 three ciphertext blocks formed in that odd way.
  
    where do the 34-bit constant values that are concatenated with the
 serial number to form n1,n2,n3 come from?  are they changed from chip to
 chip, or session to session?  (even if they're published in the ny times,
 if skipjack is resistant to known-plaintext attacks, when using triple-
 encryption, then there's no break in security.  but why allow that kind
 of weird format?  if those three 34-bit values are truly-random bits, then
 maybe it's used to ensure that a known-plaintext attack on skipjack, if
 it exists, can't be easily used to derive s1 and s2 for a whole production
 run of these chips....)
  
    does dorothy denning read this group?  if not, is someone on the group
 forwarding questions like these to her, or martin hellman, or anyone else
 who's seen more details about the chip?
