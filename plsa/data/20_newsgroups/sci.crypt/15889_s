 	well, actually, this one's easy. it's their job. the nsa is
 supposed to develop cryptosystems. if the government chooses to go
 ahead and sell those cryptosystems to the masses, so be it.
 
 	this sounds a lot like slamming the competition, not a cry
 for justice. these guys are way out on a limb, if i read that right.
 they've commited their new algorithm to silicon before it's been
 made public. what are they gonna do if shamir writes a paper showing
 how to crack the entire class of algorithms in 5 minutes with a slide
 rule and a pencil?
 
 	if they weren't busy throwing muck to smear their competitors,
 i'd feel kinda sorry for 'em. still do, a little.
