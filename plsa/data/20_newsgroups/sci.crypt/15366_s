 some thoughts:
 
 has any work been done on encapsulating encrypted data inside "non-encrypted"
 data files?  many file formats can be written with "gaps" in them to hide
 other data.  new file formats could be designed to have alternate data hidden
 by dispersing it amongst the "legitimate" data.  the hidden data would only
 show up with the right key(s), and a file with hidden data would be
 indistinguishable from one without.  so, only the correct key(s) would reveal
 the presence of an "illegal" document.
 
 if i devise a custom file compression algorithm and only i and a friend have
 the uncompressor, and otherwise the file appears to be total gigerish, do i
 have the right to transmit the file?  will we have to "escrow" all our data
 file formats?  are gangs required to escrow their hand signals, colors and
 catch phrases?
 
 i think that it's important to evaluate the content of electronic speach by
 replacing the media with pen and paper or verbal speach and then re-ask the
 question.
