 i agree that notifying your elected officials of your feelings on this
 (and any other, for that matter) issue is the way to go.  and by the
 way, the phone #s on the list posted the other day were all in washington
 d.c.  --  for most of you, your elected officials will also maintain
 a local office in your area code.
 
 when i 'manage' my elected officials, i use their local office #'s
 exclusively, and my fax modem and windows-print-capture software are
 my tool of choice.  they see my words as i have stated them, rather
 than a summary as they would if i called in /voice/ and left a
 comment with the office staff.
