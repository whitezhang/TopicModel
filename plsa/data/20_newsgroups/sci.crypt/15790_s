 i just joined this group recently and really do not know much about
 cryptography, but a couple things came to mind while reading through
 the posts.
 
 1.  is the clipper chip going to be exported?  if not, how will
 people communicate with other countries?  will they have to do
 that in un-crypt-mode.  will other encryption techniques be
 legal (assuming the government cracks down on using others) when
 going overseas, but not within the states?
 
 2.  i've read about authentication systems that use an electronic  
 security card that looks like a calculator to create an encrypted
 pin based on the time/date.  the host system has the algorithm
 built into it as well so that it can authenticate a user.
 is there some form of encryption technology that would create
 keys that are only valid at a certain instant in time?  the 
 systems would then allow a "window" of time around this instant
 where the key would work.
 i realize that this technique would increase the amount of information
 needing to be stored because you would need entire algorithms rather
 than just keys.  but for smaller scale things it might work.
 could some similar method be used to make the two 80-bit keys that
 are issued to police/fbi/etc to tap a phone only usable for one-week
 (for instance).  if further surveilance was needed, they would have
 to go back to the escrow service to get another key.  this would
 make it useless for local police to database keys they have used.
 
 i assume this is not possible because the receiving phone would need
 to be able to decypher the message.  but any thoughts on the subject?
