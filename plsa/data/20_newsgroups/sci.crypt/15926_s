 then it was either _really_ good luck or you had some _very_ fast
 machine.  des has 2^56 possible keys, each two of which are simply
 to convert into each other, so you have to expect 2^54 trial encryptions
 in the mean case, assuming known plaintext.
 2^54 / 2 / (24*60*60) / 1000000 is ca. 104250.
 so you must have managed to do 104250 encryptions per microsecond.
 ce infosys builds a very fast des chip that manages 2 (!) encryptions
 per microsecond.
 
 yes, i'm not very seriously bothered about the security of des yet;
 though you might prefer to use triple des or idea, both of which
 use more key bits.
