 	whats the difference between a v.32bis modem and a v.32bis modem?

 absolutely.  i just meant that no secure *dedicated* crypto device has
 ever been given approval.  guerrilla underground devices should be well
 possible with today's high-speed modems (not that i can think of many v32bis
 modems that are approved either mind you - just the overpriced couriers)
 
 can someone tell me if hardware compression is or is not needed to run
 digital speech down 14.4k?  i think it is; i've heard it's not.  lets
 say 8 bit samples.  would *raw* data at the corresponding sampling rate
 be usable?  if not, how fancy does the compression need to be?
