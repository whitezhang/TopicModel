 this is the one part that really scares me. without
 the keys, it can likely be determined if a person
 is using the "state approved" encryption method,
 and if not then that persons life is forfet, and
 the profits go to making more busts, and more 
 profit.

 human nature has not changed very much in only a few
 hundred years....
