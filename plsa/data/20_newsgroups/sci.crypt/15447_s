 just a question. 
 as a provider of a public bbs service - aren't you bound by law to gurantee
 intelligble access to the data of the users on the bbs, if police comes
 with sufficent authorisation ? i guessed this would be  a basic condition
 for such systems. (i did run a bbs some time ago, but that was in switzerland)
