 i haven't been able to open an ftp session with that machine.
 
 operating under the assumption that the address was wrong, i tried using
 nslookup and nicname/whois...

 that's all i could find about the ncsl domain...oh, and i tried an mx lookup
 on the machine in question, which failed.  nicname/whois domain lookups at
 both registries failed, too. 
 
 so i thought, "hey, i'm just not using the tools right" and tried calling
 the bbs number -- no answer.
 
 i'm probably doing something wrong...or, perhaps, the machine has been put
 behind a firewall.  but it does look like csrc.ncsl.nist.gov has become an
 un-machine.  if someone would try ftp'ing to it, or knows what's up, i'd
 really appreciate the info.
