 the average amerikan today seems to think that the government should be
 able to eavesdrop on everyone (else).  opinion polls show that most
 people belive the bill of rights to grant too much freedom to people,
 when it is not identified as such (btw, if anyone knows of a cite for that,
 i'd love to have it).  not only does this mean that these people are 
 willing to give up everyone (else's) rights, they don't even know what 
 the bill of rights actually says.
 
 how can we show the average person (not the average usenet reader) that
 people are actually entitiled to these rights?  so many people don't
 care if the government is taking more and more control of us all, a little 
 at a time.  
 
 if there was some sort of awareness of what the government is trying
 to do by a majority of the us population... just think about what
 could be accomplished - but there are so many that trust, unthinkingly,
 in whatever the media and government tell them.
