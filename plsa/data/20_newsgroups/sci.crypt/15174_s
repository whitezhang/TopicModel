 sadly, it does not. suspects can be compelled to give handwriting and
 voice exemplars, and to take blood and dna tests.

 no, but they could compell you to produce the key to a safe where, as it
 happens, evidence that will convict you is stored. 
 
 the crypto-key disclosure issue hasn't come up yet, but current law
 suggests that it's a loser for the defendant--he'll be compelled to turn
 over the key.
 
 the test for compelled self-incrimination is whether the material to 
 be disclosed *in itself* tends to inculpate the discloser. in the example
 i gave above, the safe key itself has no testimonial value--ergo, it can
 be disclosed under compulsion (e.g., subpoena duces tecum).
 
 moreover, the government can always immunize the disclosure of a crypto
 key--compelling you to disclose the key at the price of not using the fact
 of your disclosure as evidence in the case against you. of course, they
 can use whatever they discover as a result of this disclosure against
 you.
