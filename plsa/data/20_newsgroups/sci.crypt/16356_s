 one unreliable data point: while looking over the shoulder of a
 recording engineer, i decided that he was seeing a raw error rate of
 about 1 in 1e6 on a cd ``master.''  both the extrapolation to
 mass-market cds and my state of mind while doing the arithmetic (i was
 waiting for him to finish so we could go get something to eat) are
 questionable.
