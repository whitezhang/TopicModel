 my mdc cipher (which uses any one-way hash function as a cfb-mode stream
 cipher, the current implementation uses md5) uses a key of up to 2048 bits
 (that is, you can use a 1-bit key if you want and copy it over the entire
 2048-bit range, or you can use the entire 2048 bits).  runtime is
 independant of key size, the system runs slightly slower than md5 itself.
 i presume rc2 and rc4 use a similar system (or possibly they just hash an
 arbitrary-length key down to n bits, maybe 128, using something like md5).
