 the tax protesters are legally correct, but they are put in jail anyway.
 
 the weakness of the governments legal position is shown by the fact that when
 someone protesting tax or gun laws on legal grounds gets a federal jury trial
 (very rare) the feds blatantly stack the jury, with the same old faces turning
 up time after time.
 
 however teel should have mentioned that though his advice is legally sound, if
 you follow it you will probably wind up in jail.
