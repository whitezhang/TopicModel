 not that i think anyone cares, but this pattern (using other examples
 of course) was discussed 2,000 years ago by aristotle in
 _nicomachean_ethics_.   note that you can't use this insight to reason
 backwards; e.g.:  since the conservatives see the media as liberal and
 the liberals see the media as conservative, the media are fair!  (though
 i've seen this "reasoning" implied)
