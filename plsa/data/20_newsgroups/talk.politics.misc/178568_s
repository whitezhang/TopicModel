 51 arrested for defying judge's order at abortion protest rally

    melbourne, florida --   [...]
 
    circuit judge robert mcgregor's order prohibits anti-abortion pickets
    within 36 feet of the property line of aware woman center for choice.
    even across the street, they may not display pictures of dead fetuses
    or sing or chant loud enough to be heard by patients inside the clinic.
 
    the protesters say the ruling all but wiped out the first amendment
    to the constitution.
 
    ``this is our sidewalk,'' said joe carroll, 33, a landscaper who
    marched with his children, mary grace, 8, and john, 7.
 
    ``i am not a rescuer.  i am not a trespasser.  it's just that this is
    my sidewalk.  i am not really protesting abortion.  we are protesting
    denial of our rights of assembly, religion, speech.  this judge is
    trashing the constitution.''
 
    the children's grandmother led them away, sobbing, as carroll and
    his father were arrested.
 
    outside the clinic, eleanor smeal, president of the washington,
    d.c.-based feminist majority foundation, called for the florida
    legislature and congress to pass laws as tough as the judge's
    order, which covers only brevard and seminole counties.
 
    ``this cannot go on,'' she said.  ``this is not freedom of speech,
    this is total psychological warfare with violence.  it is ridiculous
    to have to ask clinics to go court-by-court . . . to get protection.''
