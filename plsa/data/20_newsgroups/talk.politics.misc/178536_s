 not at all.  i am not a member of the religious left, right, or even
 center.  in fact i don't consider myself very religious at all [ this will
 probably result in flames now :) ].  in fact phil, you should leave
 religion out of it.  it just clouds the issue.

 how typical.  so you think we shouldn't avoid these 'events' [ i shall
 refrain from the word disaster since it seems to upset you so much.  :( ]
 when we can.  in case you didn't realize it, the natural disasters [ oops,
 sorry events ] you are refering to  we have no control over.  man-made
 ones we do.
 
 i guess you missed the show on ch 20 earlier this week about the disaster
 [ oops there i go again... i meant to say event ] on the exxon valdez.
 just a natural every day occurance to spread oil on 300 miles of beach. i
 would like to know which natural event [ hey i remembered not to say disaster ]
 that would be similar to this.

 hmm, i suppose you could be right.  they are as natural as a tree, or a
 sunrise.  not !

 so look, if you want to worship a oil slick ( or toxic waste dump or live
 in a house that has a cesspool in the front yard ), fine, you have my
 permission to do so [ yea right like you need my permission... ], it just
 won't be in the neighborhood where i live.  but don't try to push your
 shortsighted tunnelvision views off on the rest of us.
