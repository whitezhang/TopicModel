 and of course, in states like kentucky and virginia, not well-suited to
 large-scale plantations, slave labor was used to make one of the most 
 valuable agricultural products of all: more slaves.  in some ways, this
 treatment of humans beings as breeding livestock is the most horrifying
 aspect of american slavery.

 this is an interesting question.  steinbeck's _grapes of wrath_
 (published in the 1930s), uses agricultural mechanization of cotton
 production in arkansas as the cause of the joad family being evicted
 from the land.  how many years were involved in the mechanization of
 cotton farming?  when did this first appear?
