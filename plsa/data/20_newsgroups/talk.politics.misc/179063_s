 :      here's a hypothetical question...  if clayton said something like "all
 : those niggers are really stupid."  (please don't be offended, i'm not racist
 : but merely using an example of clayton's malign logic).  and then said he
 : read a report that a lot of blacks in inner cities dropped out of school, i
 : bet he wouldn't have your support.  yet he can claim that all homosexuals are
 : dishonest, evil, lying child molesters without *personally* having a single
 : homosexual friend or acquaintance and you'll sit there and support him.
 
 :      god created a place for bigots.  it's called hell and clayton is going
 : to burn there for a long time.  i pray for him to find in his heart the
 : christian values he espouses so that he can learn to love his gay brothers
 : and sisters, because anyone with so much hatred in his soul coulld never
 : be righteous.
 
 there is a difference between supporting claytons opinions and supporting
 his right to speak.  i want you to know that you cannot educate and/or
 elevate ones understanding by calling him names.  clayton has an opinion
 which in his mind is as valid as any opinion anyone else on the net has.
 if you were to walk up to black person to talk about blacks in the inner
 city and began the conversation with "those niggers in th.......".  you
 would lose the attention of that black person by the time you spoke your
 second word.  all name calling and derisive remarks do is turn off the
 audience you are trying to address.  clayton is guilty of that and as
 such has distracted attention away from his message to bits and pieces
 of his conversation.  i don't understand why people want to repeat his
 mistakes!
