    an addition to anti-discrimination laws which includes homo and bisexuality
 ? one would assume it would be because politicians were listening to the people
 coming up with rational arguments rather than variations on bigotry. logic
 sometimes prevails.
    btw, glad to see that you've admitted sexual attraction to children is a
 seperate sexual orientation. didn't think you had that much honesty.
