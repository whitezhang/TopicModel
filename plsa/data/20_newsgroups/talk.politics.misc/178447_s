        well, i don't think your query was exactly polite, but i will try to
 give you a polite responce.  something atypical of the net, but here it goes.
 
        black is a descriptive adjective that describes mr. king.  from many
 of the newspaper, radio, and tv news reports i have seen, this adjective      
 is commonly in front of his name.  i have never seen anyone complain about
 the use of this adjective when used in a benign manner.  i did not say that
 mr. king was a no good black!  i do not know mr. king and would not make this
 ascertian without some evidence to this effect.  i used it purely as a 
 descriptive adjective in the same manner than many ( most ) news people have
 used it in the past.
 
 
       the entire second trial was about race, ted.  i don't feel compelled to
 discuss mr. king's racial background, but had mr. king been white there would
 not have been a second trial.  you probably are saying that the beating would
 not have occurred if he were white, but that is an extremely difficult call
 to make.  it is possible the case, but not definately.  
 
       i still think your actions are crap, ted.  they are far more divisive than
 me using the adjective 'black' in a non-derogenory manner.  would you have
 been happier if i had used 'african-american' ?  if so, then you really are
 lost in the world of pc.  you have already been instrumental in getting one
 persons net access revoked, and i wonder if you have sent a copy of my 
 message to my sys admin with a plea that i am not worthy of posting.
 
      the way you went about this 'polite' inquiry makes me believe it was 
 anything but.
