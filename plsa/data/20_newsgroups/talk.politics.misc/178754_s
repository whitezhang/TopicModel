 	well, this is still the land of the free for the time being. individuals
 are supposed be able to do what they please unless it infringes upon the rights
 of someone else. owning fully automatic machine guns is also permitted by
 law if you have a class iii federal firearms license and have paid the transfer
 tax. if you are refering to the .50 cal the feds claim the bd to have had, 
 i have used .50 cal for 3000 yard target shooting. it a legitimate and 
 challenging sport.

 	ah, i see mr spock! how logical! well, again, this is the usa and
 we have had a long tradition for standing up for individual freedoms and
 liberties. that is what is written in the constitution, if you dont like it,
 then find another government where the citizens are its slaves. you'd
 like it there with that philosophy of yours.

 i intend to encourage her to learn how to handle a handgun!

 	a threat to whom? he was out in the middle of nowhere waiting for
 the apolcalypse. his neighbors even said that he never bothered anyone!
 who can you justify your statement?

 	one of these days, you too will pick up a firearm and learn to use
 it and you will defend your second amendment right, knowingly or not, willingly
 or not. the statistics are not in your favor.
 	in this age you must support the liberty of the individuals. if not, 
 then this nation is condemmed to a totalitarian regime. orwell's 1984 is
 comming true, only ten years late.

 "...when all government ... shall be drawn to washington as the centre of all
 power, it will render powerless the checks provided of one government on
 another and will become as venal and oppressive as the government from which
 we separated."
