 go for it.  i have yet to see anybody justify the
 prohibition on drugs and the ensuing war on drugs.  in the world of
 *.politics here on usenet, it is you that is crazy.  anybody--who gives

 atrocity, this all out war on individual rights.
 
 just _try_ to justify the war on drugs, i _dare_ you!
