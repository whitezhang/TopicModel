 very simple.  an 'insurance commissioner' is a bureaucrat - a regulator.
 it is his/her duties to make rules to enforce laws.  he/she cannot
 make laws.  if there is no law that covers a specific subject, say
 scam insurance companies, a regulator cannot create one.  so they have
 to go to a proper legislative body to get such a law enacted.  for
 the california insurance commissioner, there are two possible legislative
 bodies:  the california state legislature and the u.s. congress.  we all
 know how little the california state legislature accomplishes, esp. 
 along the lines of insurance reform legislation (negative movement).  so
 garamendi wants the feds to do it, because: (a) he has a better chance
 of getting a federal law through, and (b) since many of the scam
 companies work across state lines/national borders, it is better to
 have a law that reach out into other jurisdictions.
