 i wouldn't worry too much about it, though.  we are starting to find
 out how politically impotent homosexuals really are.  the colorado
 boycott has fizzled, slick willie was effectively prevented from
 implementing his military policy wrt homosexuals by members of his
 _own_ party, this new study casts a large shadow of doubt on their
 claims of large numbers, and coming this saturday they are going to
 wind up with _tremendous_ egg on their face when, i submit, no more
 than perhaps 35,000 queers will show up in washington while they are
 promising crowds in the millions.  and most of the ones who will be
 there will look like act-up and queer nation, not the guy working in
 the next cubicle.  as if that's really going to play in middle
 america.
 
 pretty soon they will find themselves retreating back into the closet
 where they belong.
