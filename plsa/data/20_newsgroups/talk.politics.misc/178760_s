 yes you are.  when you and the rest of the homosexual community
 pass laws to impose your moral codes on me, by requiring me to
 hire, rent to, or otherwise associate with a homosexual against
 my will, yes, you are in my face.  until homosexuals stop trying
 to impose their morals on me, i will be in your face about this.
