 wait a minute.  i agree with you that people have to take responsibility
 for their own behavior (i assume that's what you meant by the word
 "account"), but also for "the behavior of their immediate community"?
 
 first of all, how "immediate" are you talking about, and secondly, i
 have a lot of trouble with any theory of social behavior or justice
 which charges anyone with the duty of taking responsibility for or
 accounting for the actions of a different person...
