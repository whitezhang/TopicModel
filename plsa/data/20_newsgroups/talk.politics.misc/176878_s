 got him!  cramer is now claiming that pedophilia is a sexual orientation
 rather than a chronicly homosexual condition.  this changes the whole
 argument in as much that is pedophilia is a sexual orientation all
 of its own peds cannot be called homosexual.  peds are peds who
 may have a preference as to the sex of the child they molest (though
 most do not have a preference) but that is a subset of their basic
 ped nature.
 
 cramer has as much as admitted that peds and gay men are different
 orientations.  all we need now is to get him to admit that
 the apparent similarities he keeps on about are just optical illusions.
