 well, they never should have gotten into this situation.
 
 look at the history of this group. david koresh has been arrested
 ?twice?  by local police. both times, he accepted the arrest warrant
 and went peacefully. so, the feds decide to arrest him. how do they
 choose to arrest a person with a record of peaceful obedience under
 arrest? they throw a concussion grenades at his building. 
 
 in addition, we know that we've been lied to. initially, we were told
 that they suspected him of molesting children and having several
 wives. but these are not atf offenses, were they? so they changed
 their story, several times. and the original warrant is still sealed.
 and we were told about the rockets and ammunition they had... but did
 anyone notice any ammo exploding in the fire? they claimed that koresh
 hadn't left the compound in months... but people in town report seeing
 him just a week before the raid.
 
 how would i have handled it differently? 
 
 well, first, i haven't seen any evidence that the bds did anything
 wrong. there's a sealed warrant, and a collection of stories which
 keep changing about what they did. so i might not have done anything.
 
 ok. now, supposing that i know what the bds are being arrested for.
 well, they've got a history of accepting arrests... so, i send
 officers to the door with a warrant. wearing bulletproof vests.
 covered from a distance by sharpshooters. now, there's no good reason
 to suspect that these people will do anything, right? why didn't
 anyone try serving a warrant?
 
 ok. going further. they refuse the warrant. it becomes necessary to
 raid. you plan a raid. you hear an hour before that there was a leak,
 and they know your coming. so what do you do?  well, change your
 plans, right? nope... they go ahead with it anyone... including
 sending in unprotected men to break into the place. it was idiotic. i
 don't know what i would have ended up doing. but that original raid
 should never have happened.
 
 the shit that came later should never have happened.
 
 the full record of the raid should be released to the public to let us
 know what the hell really happened there.
 
 the lies should never have been told.
