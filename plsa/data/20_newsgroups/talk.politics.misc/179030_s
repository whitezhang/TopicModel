 well, for one thing most, if not all the dividians (depending on whether
 they could show they acted in self-defense and there were no illegal
 weapons), could have gone on with their life as they were living it.
 no one was forcing them to give up their religion or even their
 legal weapons. the dividians had survived a change in leadership
 before so even if koresch himself would have been convicted and
 sent to jail, they still could have carried on.
  
 i don't think the dividians were insane, but i don't see a reason
 for mass suicide (if the fire was intentional set by some of the
 dividians.) we also don't know that, if the fire was intentionally
 set from inside, was it a generally know plan or was this something
 only an inner circle knew about, or was it something two or three
 felt they had to do with or without koresch's knowledge/blessing, etc.?
 i don't know much about masada. were some people throwing others over?
 did mothers jump over with their babies in their arms?
