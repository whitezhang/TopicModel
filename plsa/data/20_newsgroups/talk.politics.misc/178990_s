 has this video been made public?  the fbi spokesman also said they 
 first knew of the fire when black smoke started pouring out, but
 later said that *three* different fbi agents saw b-d members starting
 the fires.
 
 also the fbi claims to have listening devices (bugs) in the compound.  
 will they make public the tapes of what the b-d said?

 well sealing the initial search warrent, keeping the media miles away,
 not letting the b-d talk to the public, making contradictory statements,
 not releasing the vidio & tapes are not steps to ensure public confidence 
 in their actions.
