 	_however_, a sizable fraction of _these_ are willing to get
 abortions. one study found that at some places at least, 1/6 of the
 women professed to be "born again". furthermore, a large fraction of
 catholics use "artificial" birth control methods frowned on by the
 church. so this abortion-rejecting health-care market might be much
 smaller than one would think.
 
 	but never underestimate the willingness of some professed
 opponents of abortion to get them.

 	goes one pro-choice slogan i once saw on someone's car (or was
 it a pickup truck?). i had been following an old railroad line that is
 to be used for a bart extension in south san francisco, and i saw this
 car with this bumper sticker along the way.

 	operation rescue? dennis kriz, be aware of some of the company
 you keep. i'm talking about seriously militaristic right-wingers who
 would _love_ to execute those who provide and get abortions. although there has
 been only one such assassination so far, i wonder how many other
 opponents of abortion would be willing to perform such assassinations
 if they could get away with it.
