 what kind of brainless clod posted the above garbage? would they be
 so kind as to explain how this is "clinton's" initiative, when it
 has been before congress for "at least the past 6 months"?
 
 jeez, the next thing you know, they'll be blaming the weather on the

 the civil war on him. maybe the thirty years war?
