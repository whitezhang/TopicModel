 we were having a discussion about whether bush would have done anything
 differently. on the basis of panama, grenada, tripoli, kewait etc we 
 decided that bush would have asked for a surgical airstrike  or used a 
 cruise missile, some people suggested that he would have used the nuke
 warhead cruise, others pointed out that he would be too cheap to use 'em.
 
 what was missing? armoured vehicles!

 the person who murdered 17 children was koresh. he kept them there and 
 brought about their deaths deliberately.
 
 you may consider that i am a complete bastard and a not very nice chap.
 thats quite true. i don't pretend to be. being nice is what amateurs
 try to do. if you want to talk politics you are talking hard decisions
 such as whether the lives of the troops should be risked attempting
 to rescue the children. anyone who has held the office of president
 of the united states since fdr has held the threat that if the usa
 or its allies were to be threatened then the usa would risk nuclear 
 holocaust in order to protect freedom. beleive it or not, that is not
 the sort of threat that nice chaps make. do they have a gun nutters
 section of the us version of cnd by any chance?
 
 
 there are cases where society has to be protected from
 madmen such as koresh or hitler. if it were not for the consideration
 of the 17 children in there the question of the tactics to be used would
 not be a matter of anything but academic significance. it is not for
 the govt to prevent people from commiting mass suicide.
 
 the latest reports are that cult members were shot attempting to
 leave the compound by koresh loyalists during the fire. if proven
 that would entail the final nail in the coffin of those who want to
 promote koresh as some sort of role model or hero.
 
 
 i need hardly add that it is koresh that has created the holocaust in
 this case by the deliberate arson of the ranch appocalypse.
