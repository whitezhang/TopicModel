 but you stated that this study was presented in a very accurate and
 dependable way.  this is confusing to the issue.
 
 and if you read this title it implies that; gay sex (homosexual sex)
 activities are low compared to the general population that they surveyed.

 well let us quibble- look at the above statement that you posted, i have marked
 it with '^^^^^^', it states that 1% are exclusively homosexual- it states 2% are
 or have engaged in homosexual sex.
 
 and please not the use of adjective here "homosexual sex".
 
 now i stated that if we take 1% as homosexal this is a valid viewpoint.
 
 i believe that you are either 1) you are not writing what you think you are
 writing, 2) you can't read or remember what you wrote.
