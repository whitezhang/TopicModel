 well, the fact of the matter is that poverty is imperfectly related to 
 social and political instability, while economic inequality is much more
 strongly related.  in virtually all major revolutions including
 england (the puritan revolution), france, russia and china, the 
 revolutions occurred as economies were undergoing substantial long term 
 growth and poverty was declining.  what sets off revolutions is massive
 inequality coupled with a perception on the part of those at the bottom
 that social change is possible.
 
 if "poverty (were) the main engine of social instability," this typical
 historical pattern would not hold.  in fact, revolutions would have been
 far more typical before the nineteenth century than since that time.

 sorry, buddy, but some other "blowhards" managed to include the "general
 welfare" in another portion of the constitution.
 
 article i section 8: "the congress shall have the power to lay and collect
 taxes...to pay the debts and provide for the common defence and general
 welfare of the united states..."
 
 i guess they wanted to make sure everyone understood they meant what they
 said in the preamble.

 but as noted above, the constitution doesn't say that, does it?

 but since it explicitly includes both the general welfare and defense
 in article i, section 8, i guess you'll grant that botha are constitutional
 functions.  right?
