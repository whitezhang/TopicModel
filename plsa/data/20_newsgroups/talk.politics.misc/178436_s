 exsqueeze me?  i saw *your* original post in alt.discrimination.
 your post was cross-posted to three groups.  my followup was cross-posted
 to two of those three (omitting soc.motss).
 
 now, instead of engaging in meta-discussion off the topic, could you answer 
 the question posed?  if your statement is so "beign"(!?), you should have no
 trouble politely responding to a polite query.
