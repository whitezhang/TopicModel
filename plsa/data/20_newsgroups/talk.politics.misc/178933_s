 can people please stop the 'i think/know the batf/fbi are completely
 responsible but they'll cover it up so that the investigation will
 show that koresch is responsible' bs. in an investigation of this
 size with the feds, state, and civilians involved in the
 investigation it would be practially impossible to cover up.
 and with republicans like arlen spector calling for investigations,
 this isn't going to be handled with kid gloves.
