 the lebanese government can provide guarantees that israel will not be
 attacked from lebanese soil, and when the syrians leave.

 	the three are very different issues.  israel has stated
 repeatedly that it will not give up the whole golan, but may be
 willing to give part of it to syria as part of a peace agreement.
 
 	israel has already annexed areas taken over in the 1967 war.
 these areas are not occupied, but disputed, since there is no
 legitamate governing body.  citizenship was given to those residents
 in annexed areas who wanted citizenship.
 
 	israel should keep control of parts of the west bank, imho.
 the parts that should be kept are the westernmost mountain ridge,
 which contain few arab towns, and many suburbs, as well as overlooking
 the city of tel aviv.  the eastern mountain ridge should be
 abandonded.  this is where most of the arabs live and it is less
 militarily relevant.  israel should also maintain a presence in the
 jordan valley.

 	there are a number of reasons for people to move (they were
 not moved, but chose to move) into disputed areas.  note that since
 these moves were made by free willed human beings, not "settlers," i
 will address two aspects of your question, why the government would
 allow &/or encourage them to move, and second why they did move.
 
 	the government had a number of reasons for encouraging people
 to move across the green line.  they included security and politics.
 
 	the first reason was security.  a large jewish presense makes
 it difficult for terrorists to infiltrate.  a jewish settlements also
 act as fortresses in times of war.
 
 	a second reason was political.  creating "settlements" brought
 the arabs to the negotiation table.  had the creation of new towns and
 cities gone on another several years, there would be no place left in
 israel where there was an arab majority.  there would have been no
 land left that could be called arab.
 
 	the fact that there are a hundered thousands jews in place
 changes the face of any peace settlement, and restricts what land can
 be given away.
 
 	individuals who crossed the green line had several reasons for
 doing so.  they include financial, religious, and political reasons.
 
 	many of the communities created were "bedroom" communities.
 suburbs.  a house 20 minutes outside of tel aviv cost half less if it
 was on the wrong side of the green line.  people who moved there
 wanted a decent home at a nice price.
 
 	some of the communites created were religious.  they built
 their neighborhoods in areas where there were jews until the riots of
 the 30's and 40's.  there are communities like this in hebron, gaza,
 and all over.  there are also communities built near religious sites.
 
 	the last reason people moved was to establish a political
 jewish presense outside the green line.  they built communities to
 control important intersections, important hilltops, roads, and other
 places.
 
 	the point is, there are many reasons people moved over the
 green line, and many reasons the government wanted them to.  whatever
 status is negotiated for disputed territories, it will not be an "all
 or nothing" deal.  new boundaries will be drawn up by negotiation, not
 be the results of a war.
