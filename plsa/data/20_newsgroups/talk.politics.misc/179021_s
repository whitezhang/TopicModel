 meeting between slick willie and homosexual activists:]
 
 lormond: "but clinton will not be attending a rally by homosexuals in
 washington later this month.  he will instead be out of town, on a
 retreat with senate democrats."
 
 robertson: "yeah, he'd better retreat."  [laughter, followed by
 sustained applause]
 
 [later, in a report by correspondent deborah whitsen on the fizzling
 boycott instigated by homosexuals against colorado:]
 
 whitsen: "colorado ski resorts have seen record crowds this year
 despite a call by homosexual activists for boycott of the state ...
 there have been record snowfalls in the mountains this year, and the
 skiers have been coming in droves ..."
 
 robertson: "and god said, let it snow ..."  [more sustained applause]
