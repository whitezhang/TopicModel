 absolutely.  if yoni and bibi natanyahu are "typical jew leader"s,
 then i personally am proud to aspire to such a status (disregarding
 hamaza h. salah's negative connotation of jews).  yoni was a great
 man and a harvard grad who died for his country and people.  bibi
 is also a great leader who will undoubtedly be a major force in
 middle east politics for many years to come.
