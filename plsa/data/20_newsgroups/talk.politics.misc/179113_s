 hatemonger: someone who reminds people of why homosexuals are dying
 in such large quantities of aids -- because their sexual compulsions
 prevented them from keeping their number of sexual partners below
 four digits.

 if i know about it, and don't express my disapproval, it certainly
 would make you suspicious about me, wouldn't it?

 a five year old is child molestation.

 fooled me.  they march in a number of gay parades around the country.

 it is nothing like racism or sexism.  you choose to be a homosexual.
 my distaste for homosexuality is because of what homosexuals do.
