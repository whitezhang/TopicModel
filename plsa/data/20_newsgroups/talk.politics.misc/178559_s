 excuse me for sticking my nose in, but any parent/parents who do not allready 
 immunize their children (especially if it is already free), don't deserve one 
 frigging dime of tax money for health care for themselves, or public health 
 care service.
 
 (i know the immunization program and the coming national health care issue are 
 slightly seperate issues, but anybody who wouldn't help their kids, don't 
 deserve my tax help).
