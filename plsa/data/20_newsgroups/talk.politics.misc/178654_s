 i must object to the characterization of those opposed to the
 government's handling of the waco situation as "gun supporters".
 your argument tries to paint the batf critics as right-wing
 gun nuts, and just mixes up two issues.
 
 i am one of the batf/fbi critics, and yet i am a liberal
 and just as anti-gun as you are.  i just happen to believe
 that everyone has civil rights, even religious crazies.
 they're all human beings, not some nest of wasps that
 you're trying to exterminate.
 
 the batf created the crisis situation by the way they handled
 the original raid.  it was well known that koresh regularly
 went jogging outside his property.  he could have been served
 with a search warrant then.  he could have been arrested if
 he had refused to comply.  instead officers armed with grenades
 invaded the property.  this escalated into a shooting war
 with tragic deaths on both sides.
 
 those were the first two mistakes:  the bad judgment of
 asking for a no-knock warrant, and the bad and probably
 illegal way the already-unwise warrant was served.
 
 at this point, the situation escalated to where it was
 described as an armed standoff and a hostage crisis.
 that's when the government started covering their traces,
 sealing the warrant, revising their reported history of
 the incident, etc.
 
 things were already building up to disaster.  now the
 government could have simply closed the supply routes
 and waited.  but according to janet reno, that option
 had "never been seriously considered".  so, supposedly
 because the agents were "frustrated and fatigued", and
 because there supposedly were no backups, they felt
 they had to go in.
 
 now it's entirely possible that koresh was responsible
 for the fire.  if that's so, he deserves the blame
 for the deaths of the people in his compound.
 
 but the government's hands are far from clean.
 their first raid demonstrated bad judgment plus
 contempt for the 4th amendment.  the motivations
 for the second raid are just too unbelievable.
 and their coverup of the events of the first
 raid undermines their credibility in anything
 they do thereafter.  we have only some very
 biased fbi agents' word for what happened.
 
 and please let's not turn this into a pro-gun vs. anti-gun
 discussion.  anti-gun people do not believe that gun-owners
 deserve to get frontally assaulted by armed government
 agents.  and koresh's civil rights exist whether his
 guns were legal, illegal, illegal-but-should-have-been-legal,
 or whatever!
