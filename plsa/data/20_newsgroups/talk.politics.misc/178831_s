 i'm sorry about your friend.  really.  but this anecdote does nothing to
 justify the "war on drugs".  if anything, it demonstrates that the "war"
 is a miserable failure.  what it demonstrates is that people will take
 drugs if they want to, legal or not.  perhaps if your friend were taking
 legal, regulated drugs under a doctors supervision he might not be in the
 position he's in now.
