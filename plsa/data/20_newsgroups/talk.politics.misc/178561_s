 in my lifetime, your philosophy -- socialism masquerading as a liberal

 absolutely.  so the response of socialists is take us even further
 into socialism.

 to the extent that people have been encouraged to not be responsible
 for themselves, yes.
 
 # # # # come on.  you and i both know that the major problem of this society

 # # # hey, she's too proud to go on public assistance, but the only jobs

 #

 sonoma county.
 
 # you live in a strange and wondrous place, sir.  inexpensive housing,
 
 not exactly cheap, but not los angeles, either.
 
 # lots of employment, and utterly surrounded by socialists.  well, i suppose
 # that's the sort of environment that would attract socialists, or at least
 # not dissuade them.
 
 no, it's that areas with a lot of wealthy breed socialists -- all the
 spoiled rich kids, feeling guilty about their wealth.  but not guilty
 enough to give it away -- they just look for politicians to take my
 more limited wealth away.

 yup.

 i can tell you that relatives i have known, the drugs came first, the
 food was secondary.
