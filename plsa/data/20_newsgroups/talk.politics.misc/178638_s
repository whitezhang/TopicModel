 what's despicable is that this sordid incident is being glommed onto by all
 sorts of people desperately trying to "get a revolution." it makes
 "ambulance chasing" by lawyers seem like a harmless pastime.
 
 for the last few months, benighted souls have been calling c-span on issues
 as mundane as budget resolutions, saying that "i don't know, i just have
 the feeling there is going to be a revolution in this country," and so on.
 
 get real! for a real case study in revolution, go to blockbuster video
 and check out "underground," a film made about the weather underground in
 the 70's. even with all the strife back then, the "revolution" never did
 come. and waco is supposed to be the spark of the end times?
 
 in the tape, it is interesting to see the way the weatherpersons dance
 around the issue of one of their defining moments, which was when a few
 of their comrades managed to blow themselves up manufacturing bombs in
 a greenwich village townhouse. the problem, one of them said, was that
 they were so caught up in their armed struggle that they *forgot* about
 their own personal safety and weren't "careful." but of course that was
 *society's* fault, a society that didn't instill a sense of worth in
 the people, so they neglect their own safety.
 
 current apologists for koresh may pick up some important rationalization
 tips from this tape!
