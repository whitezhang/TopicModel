 how about letting in the press?
 
 how about letting koresh out to talk to the press?
 
 maybe if he had been allowed to talk with the press/tv for a couple of
 days he would have surrendered peacefully.
 
 
 how about letting the relatives of koresh`s followers talk?
 
 
 seems to me when you isolate someone, try to send them crazy by playing
 loudspeakers through the night of tibetan chants, etc., you don`t have
 much to stand on when they behave as if they are crazy.  (i`m not too
 sure of their sanity to start with.)
 
 i am very suspicious when the government controls all communication,
 and sends the press 2 miles away. 
 i have a gut feeling that no-knock warrant, which is sealed, would not
 stand up to scrutiny.
 
 i don`t think no-knock warrants are what the constitution writers had
 in mind when they gave us rights against improper search and seizure.
 i don`t think an all-powerful central, high-taxing government was
 what the constitution writers had in mind when it delagated rights
 to the citizens and states and restricted central government.
