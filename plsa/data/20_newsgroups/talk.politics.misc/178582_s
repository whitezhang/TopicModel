 let me say this about that, as a retired navy officer; 
 
 i agree. cut it.  but let's not stop there. 
 
 eliminate the c-17 transport. overwight, overdue, overbudget, it was
 supposed to carry tanks. new tanks are now too big for the airplane. 
 
 scrap the seawolf ssn-21 nuclear submarine. the breakup of the ussr has
 left us with a number of sticky military problems, but none of them will
 require "god's gift to submarines".

 afford for even one to crash. and airplanes do crash.
