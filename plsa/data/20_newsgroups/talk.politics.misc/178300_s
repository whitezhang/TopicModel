 	in the hopes of adding a little life to, what seems to be, the
 same old debates, i would like to add a few bits of info and ask for
 comments.
 
 1) a couple days ago the headlines were splashed with stories of proof
    that the north vietnamese had held u.s. hostages after the war ended.
 	way back in today's newspaper (page a7 of san francisco chronicle)
    there is an article about the document that held the proof.
 	[used without permission]
 
 	"the document, which was discovered in the archives of the soviet
     communist party in moscow, is a russian translation of what is described
     as a september 1972 report prepared for the vietnam politburo by general
     tran van quang, who is identified as the deputy chief of staff of the
     north vietnamese army."
          [later on in the article after it talks about the claim of 1,205
            americans in north vietnamese prisons]
 	"phong said the easiest way to prove that the document is a 
     fabrication is to review quang's career. in 1972, he said, quang was 
     not deputy chief of staff; he was the army commander in military region 4
     in central vietnam."
 
 2) i heard on the radio that the church of scientology has filed for 
    bankrupcy becuase the employees of cocolat , owned by cos, filed a 
    class action suit against them for requiring the employees to pay dues
    to become members of the church. anyone heard more about this?
 
 3) micheal jackson went into business with micheal milken. no lie.
