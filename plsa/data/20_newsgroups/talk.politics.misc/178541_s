 could it be because you're british, phill, and living in germany?
 while the ec working rules are more liberal than what we have in
 the 1989 us-canada fta, there's probably a law about that (having
 health insurance coverage is a condition of my being down here,
 for example).
 
 you have mentioned this once before, yet both the ny times profile on
 the german sickness funds (late jan.) and pamphlets that my girlfriend
 gives to her language students from the german consulate both say that
 it is "voluntary" (okay, there were quotation marks (-;) and that only
 90% of the population is covered by the sickness funds (analogous to
 our provincial health insurances, but not divided by province/state).
 
 another guy in health care policy says that the turkish guest workers
 aren't covered ... he's written to me a couple of times (he's not a
 post-er).  i'll ask him ...
