 # #    a new natonal study on male sexual behavior, the most thorough

 homosexuals lie about the 10% number to hide the disproportionate
 involvement of homosexuals in child molestation.  they also lie
 about "10%" to keep politicians scared.

 but many of the people who will be marching aren't homosexuals, but
 other members of the leftist agenda.
 
 # #the article also contains numbers on the number of sexual partners.
 # #the median number of sexual partners for all men 20-39 was 7.3.
 # 
 # don't forget that 25% had 20 or more partners....
 
 not surprising.  remember, that study includes homosexuals as well.
 
 # #compared to the table i have already posted from masters, johnson,
 # #and kolodny showing male homosexual partners, it is apparent that
 # #homosexual men are dramatically more promiscuous than the general
 # #male population.  
 # 
 # and what did this study show for number of sexual contacts for those
 # who said they where homosexual? or is that number to inconvient for
 # you....
 
 it wasn't published.
 
 # #it's a shame that we don't have a breakdown for
 # #straight men vs. gay/bi men -- that would show even more dramatically
 # #how much more promiscuous gay/bi men are.
 # 
 # fuck off
 
 typical homoseuxal response.
