 wasn't the beef with the english over "taxation without representation",
 not taxation itself?  
 
 from my admittedly dim recollection of us history, most of the problems 
 we americans have had with taxes have been with unfair/unjust taxation
 schemes, not with taxes themselves.  it's pretty hard to run a government
 without any means of support.
