 : first, the median does not imply that half of the men are
 : above and half below 7.3: it simply means that 7.3 is the mid-point
 : between the maximum number of partners and the minimum (which is most
 : likely zero).  
 
 actually, the median *is* defined as the 50th percentile.  if the
 median number of sexual partners for men is 7.3, it means that 
 at least 50% of men have had 7.3 or fewer sexual partners, and
 at least 50% of men have had 7.3 or more sexual partners.
 
 (question: what is 0.3 of a sexual partner?  :)
 
 to confuse matters more, take the following data set:
 
 [5.0, 6.0, 6.0, 7.0, 7.0, 7.3, 8.0, 9.0, 9.0, 9.0, 250.0]
 
 the mean (arithmetic average) of the above set of numbers is 29.4.
 the sample standard deviation is 73.2.
 the mode is 9.0.
 the median is 7.3.
