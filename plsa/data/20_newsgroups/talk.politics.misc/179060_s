 local media hasn't said much, if anything, about the mow.  also, when
 i called a straight friend in arlington to tell him i would be on his
 doorstep this weekend, he didn't know anything at all about the march.
 this is a gay-sympathetic person who notices things like this.  i
 thought it was strange that he was unaware of what was happening.  it
 made me wonder just how much coverage is getting to "mainstream" america.
