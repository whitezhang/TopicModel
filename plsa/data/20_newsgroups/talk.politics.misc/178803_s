 i think the subtle difference here is that koresh took his own life before
 he could be prosecuted.  jesus allowed himself to be captured, and tried, 
 and was sentenced to death.  that's a big difference, whether you're 
 christian or not.  that and the fact that the bible goes on to say that he
 "arose again on the third day".  now, if koresh manages that one....  :)
    (note that i'm not admitting to being of the religions stated above...just
 pointing out the story the way the bible tells it).
