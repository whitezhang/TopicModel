 isn't is funny how someone who seems to know nothing about homosexuality 
 uses a very flawed (imho) source of information to pass jusgement on all 
 homosexual and bisexual men.  it would seem more logical to say that since 
 the heterosexual group of men is larger then the chances of promiscuity 
 larger as well.  in my opinion, orientation has nothing to do with it.
 
 men are men and they all like sex.  i am a gay male.  i have had sex three 
 times in my life, all with the same man.  before that, i was a virgin.
 
 so... whose promiscuous?
 
 just because someone is gay doesn't mean they have no morals.  just because 
 someone is heterosexual doesn't mean they do.  look at the world....  
 statistics alone prove that most criminals are by default hetero...
 
 look closely at the person, not the group.
 
 all flames will be ignored.  :)
