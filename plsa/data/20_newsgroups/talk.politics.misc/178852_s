 actually, jerry brown essentially did...and clinton, in his demagogue
 persona, condemned brown for it in the crucial ny primary last year.
 
 however....
 
 why don't the republicans get their act together, and say they
 will support a broad-based vat that would have to be visible
 (the vat in canada is visible unlike the invisible vats they
 have in europe)
 and suggest a rate sufficient to halve income and corporate
 and capital gains tax rates and at a rate sufficient to give
 the clintons enough revenue for their health care reform, and
 force an agreement with the democrats that the top income tax
 rate would then be frozen for the forseeable future and could
 be increased only via a national referendum.
 
 why not make use of the clintons to do something worthwhile...
 shift the tax burden from investment to consumption, and get
 health care reform, and a frozen low top marginal tax rate
 all in one fell swoop.
