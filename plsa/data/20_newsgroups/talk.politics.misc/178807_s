 	perhaps i don't get my news from the right sources. reading
 the washington post practically every day, i had considered the "facts"
 i stated above to be a matter of public record, and hardly in dispute.
 so, if "others on the net" - and in the rest of the media as well, are
 claiming something else, i'll be glad to entertain such claims in an
 open-minded manner. to date, this is the first i've seen of any claim 
 that the batf used any weapons before the branch davidians opened 
 fire on them. so - please -  enlighten me.
