 do you have a cite for the case?  you don't give enough
 information to be able to compare the two situations.
 if the demonstrators had been blaring loud rock music 
 into the landlord's home all day and night, then i could
 see how the opinion would be justified.  but this court
 order had prohibited abortion protesters from displaying
 pictures of dead fetuses, which doesn't disrupt the privacy
 of anyone inside the clinic.

 perhaps in the privacy of their homes, but not on public
 property.  did the korean grocery store owner in new york
 city have a right to be free from the speech of the protesters 
 outside his store?  patrons inside the store could hear the 
 protesters asking them to re-consider shopping there -- how 
 is that different from the abortion protesters asking women 
 to re-consider getting an abortion at a clinic?

 even if the protesters' speech could be considered
 "harassment" (which it is not), hate speech laws have 
 generally been struck down by the courts.  i don't see 
 how the words ``don't kill your baby'' or ``abortion is 
 murder'' could be considered harassment.

 some of the protesters were arrested for simply praying
 quietly on a public sidewalk.  yeah, i could see how
 that might be equivalent to "bombing" and "murder".
 uh huh.  let us know when you get a grip on reality.
