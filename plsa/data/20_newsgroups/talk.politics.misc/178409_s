 reasonable doubt dates back to human rights. we are now in the time of
 civil rights. civil rights are issued by the state with whatever strings
 attached they choose as the grantor of said rights. and if that means that 
 verdicts are determined by the needs of the state rather than by guilt or 
 innocence in a traditional sense, so be it. being subjective rather than 
 objective may make it harder to anticipate what is right, and you may be 
 sacrificed for being wrong inadvertantly once in a while, but that really is a 
 small price to pay for the common good don't you think?
