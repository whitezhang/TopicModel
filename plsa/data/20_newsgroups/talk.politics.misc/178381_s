        this seems a strange argument to make considering that canada's
 violent crime rate in general is far lower than that of the u.s.  (our
 non-gun crime rate is greater than their *entire* crime rate).  it
 would seem strange to suggest that it, to, were the result of gun
 control laws.
 
        i think if we looked we'd find very specific (cultural and
 enforcement) reasons why the non-gun rate is low as well, and then
 that reasons could be applied to the with-gun rates as easily.

        aside from the fact that i find the idea of being punished
 because somebody might steal something from me and go and commit a
 crime with it a silly solution, it still doesn't address the
 question of canada.  (which is now, by the way, blaming their rising
 gun-crime rate on the u.s.  strange that the border used to "magically"
 keep the guns out, but now isn't.)

        the other side of the coin, of course, is that far "illegal drugs"
 are purchases legally or stolen from people who purchase them legally. 
 i've still not been convinced that guns, a commodity which criminals
 have shown their perfectly willing to pay for from illegal sources
 (stolen either from police, military, or civilian) we wouldn't simply
 see south american sources from which drugs come start smuggling guns as
 well, since there's a thriving gun manufacturing industry down there.

         and as was not pointed out in the study, but in critiques
 of it, (two seperate articles by james wright and david kopel come
 to mind) it was pointed out that the difference was *also* almost
 entirely minority related.  that is, the gun crime rate skyrocketed
 for poor minorities (blacks and hispanics primarily) while when you
 compared the white majority they were virutally identical.
 
         the problem with the nejm study was they compared minority vs.
 non-minority percentages but failed to take into account the relative
 conditions of those minorities.  that there was an eqaul percentage of
 nomn-whites was about as far as they went.  they failed to take into
 account that the non-whites in either city were not living in the
 same conditions.
 
         if the situation was entirely based on availability of guns,
 then we'd expect that the white rates, the two groups which are
 arguably fairly comparative in the two cities, would have a far
 higher rate in seattle.  yet the majority in seattle is not only
 not significantly higher when the minorities are excluded, but slightly
 lower.

        the point is, of course, that many of the u.s. "inner-city"
 problems are not mirrored in canada.  as such  if there is a condition
 which is significantly different in canada from the u.s., and violent
 crime is highly correlated to that area, suggesting that gun control
 is the source of canada's low rate is highly questionable.  (as one
 canadian pointed out on talk.politics.guns, canada's major gun control
 in 1978 did not result in either a reduction or a slowing of an increase
 in violent crime rates, which have been rising steadily since.  apparently
 they didn't even mirror the u.s.s very large drop of violent crime in
 the early eighties.

        true only to a certain extent.  take washington d.c., where
 gun control was instituted while it had crime problems true, but that
 crime proceeded to explode afterwards.  similarly for new york.
 
        the question is not simply a point in time where crime was high
 or low.  did the gun control significantly and positively impact
 violent crime.  since it's gone up in those areas, often faster than it
 was going up before, you can't simply dismiss the high crime rate by
 saying gun control was caused by it.  yes, gun control may be instituted
 to deal with high crime.  but if the crime is not positively impacted, you
 can't continually say that that crime rate was entirely a cause of
 that gun control, since much of that crime rate increased after gun control
 was implemented, just as happened in canada.
 
 >similar or worse rates exist in cities with poor gun control.
 
        as would be expected if violent crime was generally independent
 of gun control.

        would this be the laws which made manufacturers liable for what
 others did with their guns, and suddenly the police found nobody would
 sell to them?
