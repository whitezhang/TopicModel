 in the case of victimless crimes yes, i think so.
 
 think about it.  if i rob or beat up or rape or kill someone, it's very
 clear to anyone not a sociopath that i've done something immoral.  on the
 other hand, if i smoke grass or have sex with a consenting adult in a
 manner illegal in that state, the morality or immorality of that act is
 merely a lifestyle choice; it doesn;t clearly hurt anyone else.  imo, if
 such an act doesn;t hurt another person it should not be interfered with.

 i think so.  and i don't use drugs, outside of the legal ones (alcohol
 and coffee).
