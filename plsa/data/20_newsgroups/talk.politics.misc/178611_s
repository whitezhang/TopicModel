 the above conveniently ignores the murder of four batf agents by the
 branch davidians in an unprovoked ambush.
 
 any government that allows tinpot dictators to set up shop and declare
 a private state has drifted into anarchy. there are laws to control
 the ownership of guns and the batf had good reason to beleive that
 they were being violated. they set out to obtain a legal warrant and 
 attempted to serve it only to be met with gunfire when they rang
 the doorbell.
 
 the paranoid assertion that the batf fired first in an unprovoked
 assault assumes that the batf were on a death wish. had they
 expected the b-d to be anything other than peacefull citizens who
 would accept a search authorized by a court they would have turned up
 in a tank and broken the door down on day one.
 
 the stupidity was the attempt to serve a warant on the place by
 ludicrously underarmed and unprotected police. 
 
 
 if anyone on the net cares to suggest a sure fire method of bringing
 the murderes of four police officers to justice perhaps we could
 hear it.
