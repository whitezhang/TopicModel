 let me see if i got this right.
 
 group of religious plinter schismatics erect a compound
 and after at least fifty years of peaceful co-existance
 with the outside community (having shoot outs only with
 each other) - this makes them dangerous.  prior history
 would seem to indicate they are only dangerous to themselves.
 
 last i knew there was no national branch davidian party
 blaming the debacle in veitnam on foreign meddlers and
 three-two beer, calling for the rounding up of meat packers,
 growers and slaughter houses.
 
 you want tough political choices - how about letting odd balls
 be odd balls?  (i know, this requires tolerance for 
 those that go into government - but we all know people
 who have no useful skills.)
 
 
 ith the death of the children everybody is getting
 real upset - what about the other 40 plus people?
 i suppose that you consider children to be property
 of the state with the family as custodians. (in the
 states its the other way around - children are parental property.)
 if what you consider a corrupt government demands that
 you send you children into _their_ tender care - i
 suppose that you will obey the state and turn you children
 over to their care.  sorry - i am not as enamoured of the
 womb to tomb cradle that is ingsoc.
 
 gotta go, the beach is calling.
