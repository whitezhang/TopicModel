       the operation going on in somalia is a peacekeeping/peaceenforcement
       operation where force may be used.  it is not a war.  it is also legal
       under international law, which is higher than us law.  the operation
       is occuring under the ageis of the united nations.  can't get a higher
       authority than that on this earth.
