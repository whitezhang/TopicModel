 gosh, tim, you must have seen a different live broadcast than i did. while
 the smoke did emerge from one place initially, it was a considerable
 distance from the tank, and in a very short time, fire appeared at several
 places a good distance apart from there.
 
 then there's that nagging question about why, out of all those people,
 only a few made any attempts to escape or save the children. if it were
 me, with my child, [and i wasn't committing suicide,] i believe i would have
 made some attempt to at least save the child. as it was, at least one of
 the survivors was attempting to go back into the fire when they were
 physically removed. no one lifted a finger to bring out a child, apparently.
 
 how do you explain that? and the two survivors who claimed to have doused
 the place with lantern oil and set the fire (no doubt on david's orders). 
 [at least until the lawyers talked to them.] 
 
 tim> and also, why have they not yet released the search warrant????  
 
 that *is* a good question. maybe because it would be a further
 embarrassment, seeing as how the atf went in there in dirty harry mode
 initially. 
 
 as stupidly as it all was handled, i find it difficult to believe that the
 entire fbi has completely gone corrupt under a new administration less
 than 100 days old. stupidity and bad decisions and plans have always been
 with us. they just had an alignment at waco.
 
 tim> seeeeee ya  turmoil@halcyon.com   fuck the police!!!!
 
 see? freedom of speech abounds.
