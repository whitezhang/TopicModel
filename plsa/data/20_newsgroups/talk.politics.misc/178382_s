        horrors, appealing to popular principles.  can we perhaps as the
 question of whether the constitution might have been written to appeal
 to the principles, rather than, as you appear to believe, it was written
 with something else in mind and "propoganda" put out by its supporters.
 
        but let's be honest about something, here.  when was the last time
 you brought up all the valid points against your own arguments?
 
        or are they simply propogranda?  we can't know what phill *really*
 means because he's obviously using arguments designed to convince.

        if they're true or false, regardles of why they were said, why
 on earth did you make a point of calling them "propogranda?"  that
 would seem to be irrelevent.

        oh, i have no argument with questioning them.  i don't believe
 they no longer apply, but that's because i think most of them were
 good arguments.  i'm not entirely happy about the situation, because
 they were obviously only applied to a minority of the time, but i don't
 think that alone is sufficient to invalidate them.

        since the u.s. constitution is the basis for the u.s. political
 system, most changes in it would require constitutional change.  in this
 particular case, however the fillibuster is a matter of procedure
 and tradition.  it only *should* have been made part of the constitution. :-)

         in principle no?  that they had less power of that they should have
 had less power?

         phill, we're discusing the power of legislative houses.  while
 the prime minister *is* member of parliament, he is more analgous (although
 badly) to the u.s. president.
 
         now, please explain to me how the u.s. house of representatives
 is "in principle" more powerful than the house of lords (or the senate)
 but in practice is less.  are you suggesting that the writers of the
 constitution *really* intended for them to be more powerful, but gosh
 darn the thing was ratified before they realized they'd forgotten to put
 those extra restrictions on the senate in?

       not at all.  as any entry level political science course will tell
 you, people who want laws implemented will always choose the level of
 government to "attack" which presents them with the best chance of
 getting what they want.  with national "interest groups" it is simply
 a very rational thing to do to want the federal government to enact a
 law rather than the states.  less people to persuade, and less 
 "contributions" to make.  
 
       why do those concerned about abortion primarily concentrate at
 the federal level?  simply because if they win that battle all the little
 state battlefields are won by extension.  the same extends to insurance,
 medicine, and most other questions.
 
       local government has not "failed" in that it hasn't done what it
 should, but that it is dominated by local interests.  thus non-local
 interests who want localities to abide by their rules can't get their
 rules past the local government.  thus, since they've got more clout,
 only in the wrong place, they appeal to the next higher level because
 it can impose its will on the lower.
 
       i mean, let's get real here.  do we *really* need the congres
 of the united states deciding that x traffice light should be on thus-
 and such pattern?  or that *carjacking* needs to be a federal as opposed
 to a local crime?
 
       the more people want the more congress will take power to "sell"
 it to them for their votes.  i don't think the rise of "special interests"
 is coincidence with the increased power of congress.

        bingo.  the higher up the governmental ladder the less actual
 need matters, because political power can be concentrated at higher
 levels, while people with less cloud only find themselves reduced to
 in effectiveness.

        then why not simply leave new york's education to new york?  i
 remain unconcinved that there is any state in the union which is not capable
 of educating its own children if that's what they want to do.  and if
 you leave it to them, you only have to worry about the "pork" in that
 state.  and since industries can't concentrate their political power
 and wealth, rather they must divide it among the states to try and get
 what they want, individual voices have more relative impact.
 
        the problem with the fillibuster is not that you must "buy off"
 states, but that the congress has acquired too much power to sell pork.

        but why on earth should we want to redirect it?  you said yourself 
 that you have to sell pork to get things through congress.  if congres
 has less authority to sell pork and retains its authority to enact
 national legislation within its granted jurisdiction, the pork problem
 is significantly reduced.
 
 >the current blocks on power simply absolve congress of any responsibility
 >to come to a decision. 
 
        the current blocks essentially state that inaction is preferable
 to action, thus it the system is weighted against action.  considering
 the government the usually the institution with the sole power to
 enforce its decisions by force, i consider bias against making those
 decisions a good thing.
 
 >pushing the decisions lower in the pyramid won't

        the difference with the lower pyramid is that a) they have
 more legal, legitimate authority in most matters under our constitution
 than the federal government, and b) at those lower levels power is
 harder to concentrate.  and c) you get the benefit of not imposing
 new deicisons on everybody at once.  you get to see them tried out
 without a national decision.  congressional action usually treats the
 entire country as a whole, yet even with similar problems in different
 areas, different solutions may be called for.
 
        and while i often don't agree with the decisions my local
 and state reps make, at least i have a better option of going to
 the city council and shooting my mouth off.  i'd much rather the
 majority of laws be made by accessible people who hang around and end
 up having to put up with them rather than somebody far off in
 washington with half a million or more constituents.
 
        i'm curious what you base your assumption that lower levels
 are more corrupt.

        phill, *you* brought up the federalist papers.  we were
 arguing the fillibuster and whether or not a minority of senators
 should be allowed to hold up a bill.  you claimed the senate was
 suppose to be a far less powerful house, and i contended there was
 nothing in the constitution or other writings which indicated this.
 which was when you brought up that we can't decide what the founders
 wanted based on the federalist papers.  you argued against them,
 i never argued from them.  i have primarily referred to the constitution,
 which places only very small restrictions on the senate than for
 the house.

        the u.s. constitution is a nuts-and-bolts document.  the delcaration
 of independence was the high-brow reasoning.  (there are a couple of other
 examples, though, such as the reasoning for the power to tax, and the
 reasoning for the power to grant permits, both in article i, section 8.)

        to a certain extend i do believe the veto has become something
 it wasn't intended.  however, i also believe it is inevitable considering
 the congress' own abuse of their power to make bills say whatever they
 want them to say.  unlike most people i think we shouldn't be worrying
 about the veto, which is fine, but of the problem in congress which
 almost necessitates its abuse.

        *bush?*  phill, that's absurd.  bush had *37* vetos, one of
 which was over-ridden.  go read up on fdr if you think that's
 anything resembling a record.

        why not?  what is inherently wrong with biasing the system
 against action?  historically governemnt action in the u.s. when
 dealing with issues with a bare minority and a large minority have
 not been successful.  when you're in a position of imposing federal
 power on diverse people, why should the federal government not have to
 got through something more than a bare majority

        now we're switching from a general question of a fillibuster
 to a specific bill.  i don't see how it make a difference.

        sure it's arguable.  theyr'e *arguing* it.  however, requiring
 60% to bring it to a vote ensures that they'll have to have a *good*
 argument.  something that isn't based solely on party lines.

        no, i am completely happy with a system which requires a minority
 for *action*.  since u.s. history is a history of carving up population
 groups and implementing piece-meal on minorities, i feel minorities
 should have sufficent clout to prevent action they feel strongly enough
 about.  and 41% is hardly a tiny minority.  i don't advocate the minority
 being capable of initiating actionm but i see no problem with biasing
 the *federal* system against action.
