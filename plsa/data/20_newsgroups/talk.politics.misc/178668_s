 is anyone out there knowledgeable on drug issues in japan?  i'm interested
 in knowing if japan has or has ever had a problem with drugs, and how they
 dealt with it.  i've heard, undocumented, that japan years ago used heavy
 legal penalties to end a serious heroin problem.  i'd like to know both
 sides of the story.  does anyone recall such a problem?  what were laws
 at the time relating to drug use, drug dealing, and drug trafficking?  what
 are the laws now?  what other anti-drug measures, like education and treatment
 has japan used?  how are drugs regarded by the japanese people?  how effective
 have anti-drug measures been in japan?  thanks for your help.
