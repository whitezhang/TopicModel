 wrong, if a bunch of faggots from the tenderloin decide to go straight
 bashing and they selectively target a heterosexual man and beat the bloody
 fuck out of him, they would get charged as well under all the federal laws
 that exist about violation of civils rights. the focus of their intent is
 his sexual orientation, and so the law applies to them as well. the
 national government retains the right to make any laws necessary to
 sufficiently deter and punish any crime against someone's civil rights
 until that behavior becomes so well punished that nobody even tries it!
 the fact is, that at last count, gays were not beating straights for their
 sexual orientation. thus, the law is getting applied only to the straights
 who indulge themselves. the federal government or judiciary has the right
 to enforce the 14th amendment guarantee of equal protection under law even
 if it takes 1000 possible charges against people who would violate them. go
 read your constitutional law. we broke the back of the kkk's harrassment
 campaign with the same strategy in the early 1900's. so many went to jail
 and for so long that it cut the heart out of the kkk.

 this "mutation" as you call it, protects your little butt too, if you
 happen to be somewhere where you're the wrong "shade" for somebody else's
 taste. if it can be shown that the motive for the assault on you was
 racially motivated, then the full power of these extra laws that bring more
 charges and punishments will come against those who harmed you. the first
 use of such laws was well over a hundred years ago, and constitutional
 scholars of all conviction recognize that this right reserved to the
 federal government is well established and not just some short-lived
 peculiarity, too! go read some constitutional law for awhile. maybe you'll
 get it.
