 who compared quayle to gore?  mark said he had never heard of any incident
 in which the thrower of the ceremonial ball had been booed before.  i mentioned
 another incident.  (and if the media had a liberal bias, i'm sure he would
 have heard of the quayle incident.)
 
 if i was to compare quayle to anyone, it most likely would be elmer fudd.
