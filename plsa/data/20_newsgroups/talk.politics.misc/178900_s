 you have yet to answer any or all of my questions and challenges to your 
 statements.  by this am i to assume that you are unable to do so?  or just
 plain unwilling due to your lack of proof/intelligence?  so what next?  i 
 prove you wrong so you just put me in your killfile?
 
 your lack of reasoned response seems to be a typical clayton response.
