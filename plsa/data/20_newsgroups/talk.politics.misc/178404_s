 i know that when working in alberta, ontario and quebec, i was aware
 that i was paying for health insurance - e.g., in toronto, ohip fees
 were listed seperately on my pay stub.
 
 while i'm not the only canadian who favours lower taxes and cutbacks
 in spending, health insurance isn't on the table.  see our polls ...
 a better one might be the july 1st polls conducted for macleans (our
 major english newsmagazine) by decima research ... decima president
 allen gregg is considered one of the world's top poll researchers,
 and mulroney's conservatives have relied on him to keep in power in
 the face of impossible election situations.  i haven't had a chance
 to see this year's version due to our library, but previous ones
 before the americans started their assault and disinformation had
 shown satisfaction at 97% and switching to an american all-private
 system had support within statistical noise.  the decima polls are
 considered definitive.  even the new reform party, a breakoff of
 traditionalists from the conservatives with a mildly "libertarian"
 faction, hold our public health insurance as an untouchable but that
 just a few people have to be reminded that it's not free (the average
 canadian/european is more fiscally naive than their american
 counterparts on issues like these).
 
 personally, i feel that the universal health insurance approach used
 in canada, france and germany -- paying to private health providers in
 a nominally free market not unlike america's, minus hmo's -- depends a
 lot on values in those societies different from the u.s.  the basic
 health needs for life are not viewed as market, but the insurance does
 allow the market to address that -- basic health care is not viewed on
 the level of ownership of a vcr as americans would see it.  plenty of
 room is left for expenditure of private funds as extra insurance or as

 please explain this one, hopefully in a way that canadian readers
 besides myself can understand and concur ...
