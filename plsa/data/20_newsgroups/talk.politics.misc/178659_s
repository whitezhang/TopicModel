 no cramer it does not.  in this instance you are telling porkies to
 *yourself* as well as everyone else.  haven't you ever been to a
 cafe or restaurant and been absalutely stuffed full of goodies and yet
 when one more item, just a little different, with a new texture and
 a new taste, was presented you *somehow* found the space for it.
 
 maybe you haven't, so what?  it is a widely reported phenomina and
 i reckon the same applies to sex.
