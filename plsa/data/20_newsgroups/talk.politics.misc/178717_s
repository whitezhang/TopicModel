 	what i saw on tv and what you claim are two different things. the
 davidians did not start shooting until after the batf lobbed a couple
 genades in the windows and started shooting themselves.

 	easy! if you see federal agents in body armor with sub machine guns
 going in throught windows, that is a no-knock warrant. also since the 
 videotape shows the batf throwing grenades before the bd's etunred fire, 
 you can safely assume that they didn't ring the doorbell.
