 it's not clear that more than one of the survivors made this claim.  it is
 clear that at least one of the survivors made the contradictory claim that
 bd members had started the fire.

 no reason?  how about these two:
 
 1.  some of the survivors claimed that bd members poured fuel along the
 	corridors and set fire to it.  the speed at which the fire spread
 	is not inconsistent with this claim.
 
 2.  there was certainly a fire which killed most of the people in the compound.
 	there is a very very good possibility that the fbi did not start this
 	fire.  this is a good reason to believe that the bd's did.
 
 3.  even if the bd's were not contemplating suicide, it is very possible that
 	david koresh was convinced (and thus convinced the others) that this
 	was not suicide.  it was the fulfilment of a profecy of some sort.
 
 there are three possibilities other than the bd's self destruction:
 
 a.  they are not dead, but escaped via bunker,etc.  from reports of the
 	inadequacies of the tunnels and the bodies found, i would rate this
 	as highly unlikely.
 
 b.  the fire was started by an fbi accident.  this is possible, but it would be
 	foolish of us to declare this outright until more evidence can back it.
 	sure, it's possible that the armored vehicle knocked down a lantern
 	which started the fire (why was there a lit lantern in the middle of
 	the day near the edge of the complex?).  it's anecdotal evidence that
 	has been contradicted by other escapees.
 
 c.  the fire was started on purpose by the fbi.  this has been suggested by
 	some on the net, and i would rate this possibility as utterly
 	ludicrous.  this is what we in "sci.skeptic" would call an
 	"extraordinary claim" and won't bother refuting unless someone gives
 	any good evidence to back it up.
 
 so we are left with two reasonable possibilities.  that the fire was an fbi
 accident and that the fire was started by the bd.  i find the latter more
 likely based on the evidence i've seen so far.
