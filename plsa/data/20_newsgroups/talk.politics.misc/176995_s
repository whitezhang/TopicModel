 fine.  if you think it's an expose of corruption and fraud, 
 please prevent a jury question.  don't just reassert your 
 opening statement.

 no indication that was what happened until now.  editing down is

 and, as has been noted more times than we care to count, about as 
 likely to stand up in court as the twenty-seven eight by ten 
 color glossy pictures the stockbridge, mass., police, took for 
 use as evidence against arlo guthrie.  (as anyone who knows 
 alice's restaurant is aware, he pleaded guilty to littering, was 
 fined $50, and told to pick up the garbage.)

 how not to write a deed
 
 one case involved the construction of a conveyance to grantees "jointly, as 
 tenants in common, with equal rights and interest in said land, and to the 
 survivor thereof, in fee simple. . . . to have and to hold the same unto the 
 said parties hereto, equally, jointly, as tenants in common, with equal rights 
 and interest for the period or term of their lives, and to the survivor thereof 
 at the death of the other."
 
 the court held that the survivorship provision indicated an intent to create a 
 joint tenancy.  germain v. delaine, 294 ala. 443, 318 so.2d 681 (1975).
