 and how did the "free love advocates of the 1960's" manage to perform
 this demolition--forced breeding programs or something?

 now let me get this straight.  after a nice, long rant about how
 people need to take personal responsibility for their economic and
 social lives, all of a sudden 1960's radicals (such as me, i guess)
 are responsible for poor people's lifestyles?  tell me how that
 works--or do you think that poor people are just too dumb to think
 for themselves?
 
 there are many reasons for the disintegration of the family and
 support systems in general among this nation's poor.  somehow i
 don't think murphy brown--or janis joplin--is at the top of any 
 sane person's list.
 
 you want to go after my generation's vaunted cultural revolution for
 a lasting change for the worse, try so-called "relevant" or "values"
 education.  hey, it seemed like a good idea at the time.  how were
 we to know you needed a real education first--i mean, we took that
 for granted.
