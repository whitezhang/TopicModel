 judging from past experience (the '87 march, a peace and justice march the 
 same year, and 3 different pro-coice marches), the park service will come out
 with an estimate that is approximately 1/2 the estimate that organizers will
 come up with - though the last choice march i went to had a sign-in system, 
 and the numbers ended up closer.  and then you've got the media types in their
 helicopters, rolling dice.
 
 i believe the mow plans and handing out some sort of wristband thingy, and 
 basing their count on those.  i see two problems with this.  one, can they 
 get *everybody* to take one (and only one)?  two, they couldn't possibly have
 been able to choose a color/design that won't clash with *somebody's* outfit!
