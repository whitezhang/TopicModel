 the economic and political ignorance of most americans can be truly scary.
 price controls and government intervention.  the surest route to
 disaster.  it's amazing, people never seem to learn from history (or
 common sense).  price controls do not, and cannot work.  i would have
 thought our last experiment in the 70's would have been enough to 
 dampen the belief that price controls can actually work.  as for
 government intervention, people never seem to get the irony of what
 the are saying.  we are told that entitlements are the biggest portion
 of the budget and they must be 'controlled'.  we are presented with
 horror stories of waste and fraud in almost all government agencies.
 we are shown stories about the miserable treatment our veterans get
 in our government run hospitals.  we are just now seeing stories about
 how social security isn't going to cut it in the future (as if that
 should come as any surprise).  and yet, people choose to ignore all
 of that and believe in the fairy tale of the government coming to
 the rescue.  simply amazing.
