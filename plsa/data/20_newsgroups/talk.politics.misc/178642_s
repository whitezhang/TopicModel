 out alive, rather to fulfill his own interpretations
 of some prophecies.
 
 more interesting was discussions on the news about subterannean
 tunnels under the complex.  wonder if he was planning on hiding
 out a few days, then re-emerging "resurrected"?  sounds a bit
 like the book "passover plot" to me.  hmmmmm...
