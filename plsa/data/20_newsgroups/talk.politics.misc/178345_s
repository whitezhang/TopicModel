 fishing rights are disputed.  between 2 nations, no matter *how* 
 friendly, there is always fishing disputes.
 
 what i was getting at was the 54 40' or fight slogan is old stuff
 dealing with the land dispute.  no one is saying 54 40' or fight 
 about fishing rights.  the territorial dispute about the oregon
 territory (we called it) is long resolved.
 
 fishing rights...small potatoes.
