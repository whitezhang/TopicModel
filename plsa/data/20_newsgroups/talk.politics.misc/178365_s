 there is no need to include the vat from previous levels because
 the vat is a "difference" tax...if the vat is x%, than the amount
 of tax the government receives through all the levels is x% of
 the purchase price of the end consumer.  at the intervening levels,
 only the difference between the vat paid out and the vat received
 is remitted to the government.

 a vat is infinitely preferable to a retail sails tax...
