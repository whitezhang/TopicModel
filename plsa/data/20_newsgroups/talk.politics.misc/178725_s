   true.  today's boston globe interviewed a former unification church
   leader who is now a consultant on cults.  he said the fbi's approach
   was totally wrong.  he said they should have tried to break down the 
   bd's loyalty to koresh through psychological means.   koresh's whole
   theology was based on an approaching confrontation with the forces 
   of evil in the world and a seige mentality based on this.  the feds
   played into his hands **perfectly**.   by surrounding the compound
   with tanks and playing loud rock music and glaring lights at them 
   they strongly reinforced koresh's message that the outside world was
   evil and threatening.    he said instead they should have set up 
   a picnic atmosphere, and acted inviting and friendly.  if they
   broadcast anything over pa systems it should have been loving 
   relatives reflecting on pleasant events from the cult members'
   childhoods.   the idea is to make the outside world and surrender
   seem like a pleasant, desirable alternative.   interesting comments.
