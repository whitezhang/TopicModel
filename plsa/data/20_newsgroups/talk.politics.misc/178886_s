 you mean, in the 1940s, men and women were much more open about
 their homosexuality than today?  want to try that one again?

 you mean, ignore study after study, so that we can continue to 
 accept a study (kinsey's) that is obviously wrong?

 based on what, besides your own warm fuzzy feelings?

 alcoholics share that feeling, until they hit bottom.

 unless, of course, the problem is that homosexuality is a form
 of mental disorder, caused by childhood sexual abuse, as a number of
 recent works suggest.
 
 if homosexuals would stop using the government to impose their
 morality on others (antidiscrimination laws) and leave our children
 alone, i wouldn't care in the least what they did in private.  but
 until they get over the liberal notion that the proper role of 
 government is to tell peaceful people how to live, i have no choice
 but to continue to point out that homosexuality is not an "alternative
 lifestyle," but a sickness.
