 unfortunately, there's not much we can learn from the statistics presented
 here either.  due to rounding, the 1991 est. for lsd could be anywhere
 from .550 to .649 and the 1992 est. could be anywhere from .850 to .949.
 this means that the actual change (if you believe these statistics in the
 first place) was anywhere from 31% to 73%.  similarly the increase in
 cocaine use could be anywhere from 18% to 66% and the increase of
 crack use could be anywhere from 29% to 120%.  this doesn't even
 take into account the margin of error which isn't provided here.
 
 this does not mean that the rest of the argument you present is unfounded,
 but it does mean that usa today has (not surprisingly) provided us
 with virtually no information.
