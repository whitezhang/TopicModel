 this is similar to my saying that clinton's timber summit does little to
 fix the health care problem.  look at the whole picture, not just
 randomly picked libertarian positions.  if government is not allowed to
 use "non-initiated force" to achieve its goals, than no special interest
 can influence the government to use non-initiated force on their behalf.
 
 the means to reaching such a restricted government is another topic
 which i'll address briefly.  it certainly won't happen until
 libertarianism is the dominate philosophy.  what means do we have to
 make libertarianism the dominate philosophy?  statists run the education
 monopoly, so we have to be creative.  the advocates for self-government
 reports 85% of their seminar 1 participants "embrace" libertarianism.
 that's the best means i've seen yet.  we should lobby for compulsory
 seminar 1 attendance. :) [in jest!]

 it's amazing to me that governments around the world will try every
 aspect of government control before, as a final last resort after
 everything else fails, they will try individual liberty.
