 the test isn't whether gm knew--otherwise that would reward gm for its
 stupidity.  the test is whether gm reasonably should have known of their
 existence.  it works both ways--if gm had won the trial, and the plaintiff
 turned up two witnesses who came forward after the first trial who should
 have been located beforehand, too bad, so sad--no new trial.
 
 like tim said, you don't get a new civil trial because you screwed up 
 the first time around.  unlike the criminal justice system, repose is
 much more important in the civil justice system.
