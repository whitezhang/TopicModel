 	having watched most of the televised trial, i can answer that
 when such statements were made by the defense atty, the prosecutor did
 object, and the judge tended to sustain the ones that were obviously
 falling under the "self-incrimination" type of objection.  there was
 quite a bit of meta-discussion during the trial over the use of graphic
 language, with most folks asking the judge if she wanted to hear the
 exact language.  practically every time the defense tried to get the
 plaintiffs to "self-incriminate" by asking them such questions, there
 were objections and sustains.
 
 	at one point the defense managed to get in a quip about
 "solicitation for a felony" and the judge herself said "sustained"
 before the prosecutor could get the objection stated.
