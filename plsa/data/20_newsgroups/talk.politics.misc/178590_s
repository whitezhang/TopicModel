 drive down to cincinnati and take a look.  not pretty, is it?
 things were much better there in 1980.  all that growth went into
 the hands of ron and georgie's pals, and i didn't get a single
 dime of it, dammit.  and, now, i'm gonna be bled to death by tax
 leeches to pay for the damage.  f***ing great.
 
 oh, here's another thing.  seems like a lot of people in 
 columbus drive over to marysville and make japanese cars.  hm.
 i wonder how many american-owned companies employ those in
 central ohio?  other than ohio state university.  :)
