 this country is hardly ruined. in fact, it is booming compared to after the
 1980 election.
 
 this whole "usa has gone to hell and reagan/bush caused it", is not only lame,
 pathetic, and old....... it's wrong.
 
 under reagan/bush the economy grew by 1.1 trillion dollars.  this is more than 
 the entire economy of germany, a "kind, gentle" country, in many peoples' 
 books.  what a joke.
