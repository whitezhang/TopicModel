 : not surprising.  remember, that study includes homosexuals as well.
 
 implying, no so tacitly, that homosexual men are more promiscuous than
 heterosexual men.  interesting, especially in the wake of a news report
 last week about a group of high school seniors (heterosexual, i might
 add) who boasted monthly conquests of up to *67* girls *each*.  it
 seems that promiscuity is not limited to homosexuals.
 
 this is a sad fact of life: no matter what you look for -- whether it 
 be homosexual promiscuity, racial discrimination, or sexual harassment
 -- you *will* find it.  whether or not it actually exists where you're
 looking.
