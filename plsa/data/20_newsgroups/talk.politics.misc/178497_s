 on the other hand, it would be kind of scary if there were *never* a final
 verdict, because a party to litigation could keep saying "oops!  i forgot
 to bring up this evidence," and demand a new trial.  you get one bite at
 the apple.

 it's up to general motors to find those witnesses in the first litigation.
 you'd be up in arms if a plaintiff suing general motors pulled the same
 stunt and made them relitigate an issue that they already lost.  it's not
 as if general motors couldn't file enough discovery motions to delay the
 trial until they found all the witnesses they wanted.

 define "obvious bias."

 did gm move for a new trial on those grounds?  no?  perhaps they had a 
 reason?
