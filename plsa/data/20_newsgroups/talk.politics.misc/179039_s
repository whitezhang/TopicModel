 i wonder where you have been getting your mis-information from. straight
 from the batf itself?
 
 koresh and his followers did not -capture- the compound a few years ago, it
 has always been theirs. a few years ago their was an argument over who should
 lead the group, a gunfight erupted *one* person died. koresh was charged
 with the murder. when the sheriff came to arrest him, the sheriff knocked
 on the dorr and showed koresh the warrant (a tactic that the batf might try
 learning). koresh and the others charged peacibly surrendered to the sherrif.
 a trial ensued, the others were found innocent, and the jury hung on koresh's
 charge.
