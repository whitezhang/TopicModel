 advances in freedom have been made in the past.  the "divine right of
 king" concept was questioned at one time and may have used the same
 argument, that it hadn't come about before.  but our ancestors had the
 courage to throw off the old system that said that one man ruling many
 was necessary to have a decent, wholesome society.  in the 1800s the 
 concept of slavery was questioned.  our ancestors had the courage to
 question a practice that had existed for thousands of years.  was
 the idea that one man owning another necessary to have a decent, 
 wholesome society?  now libertarians question the necessity of
 majoritarianism.  is it necessary that many people rule over many
 others to have a decent, wholesome society?
