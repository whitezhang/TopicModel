 	     q	  mr. president, president havel is here for the 
 holocaust museum opening, and you toured the museum last night.  all 
 this focus on the holocaust, how does that weigh on your decision-
 making process as far as bosnia is concerned?
 	     
 	     the president:  well, i think the holocaust is the most 
 extreme example the world has ever known of ethnic cleansing.  and i 
 think that even in its more limited manifestations, it's an idea that 
 should be opposed.  you couldn't help thinking about that.  that's 
 not to compare the two examples.  they're not identical; everyone 
 knows that.  but i think that the united states should always seek an 
 opportunity to stand up against -- at least to speak out against 
 inhumanity.
 	     
 	     q	  sir, how close are you to a decision on more 
 sanctions on bosnia?
 	     
 	     the president:  well, of course, we've got the u.n. 
 vote.  ambassador albright was instrumental in the u.n. vote to 
 strengthen the sanctions and they are quite tough.  and we now are 
 putting our heads at the business of implementing them and looking at 
 what other options we ought to consider.  and i don't have anything 
 else to say, except to tell you that i spent quite a bit of time on 
 it and will continue to over the next several days.
 	     
 	     q	  following your meeting today, sir, are you any 
 closer to some sort of u.s. military presence there?
 	     
 	     the president:  i have not made any decisions.
 	     
                                  * * *                               
 	     
 	     
 	     q	  president clinton, why have you decided to meet 
 with mr. havel?
 	     
 	     the president:  well, i'm just honored that he would 
 come and see me.  i'm glad he's here in the united states for the 
 dedication of the holocaust museum.  he is a figure widely admired in 
 our country and around the world, and a very important person in 
 europe, and a very important person to the united states.  so i'm 
 hoping that we'll have a chance to talk about the new czech republic 
 and what kinds of things we can do together to support the causes we 
 believe in.
