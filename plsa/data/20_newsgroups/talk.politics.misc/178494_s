       hahahahahah.  oh, christ!  oh, hahahahah.
 
       whew.  mark, what on earth makes you think i give a fuck
       about being a "success", particularly now when i'll just
       the hell taxed out of me?  oh, this is excellent.
 
       holy christ! :)
 
         besides, let's <ahem> examine the record, shall we?
 
     broward:   " clinton's going to taxe the holy fuck out of you! "
     mark:      " no, he's not.  only $17 / month "
 
    ( i still get a laugh out of this one! :) )
 
     broward:  " oh, here comes a national sales tax "
     clinton supporter:  " oh, no, bill never said that "

        yup.  they surely did.
        almost as pathetic as clinton suppoters are looking in
       april of 93. 
 
      well, chumbo, i see my my watch here that my "appointment"
      at the lake is about 2 hours past due! :)
 
      you'll let me know who the "full-time" working thing works
      out, won't you?   i want to enjoy every minute of my free
      time and free health care ( the only reason i would have 
      gone back to working! :)  thanks, bill! :) )
