 that was hardly the point, was it? i was commenting on this all-too-common
 republican attitude that if people disagree with us, they must be idiots, they
 must be sheep being led around by the evil liberal media conspiracy. this is
 a dangerous attitude indeed. because it's not a very big step from "people
 are sheep, they can't think for themselves" to "people are sheep and need
 firm leadership from we, who know better"... this sort of attitude makes
 me worry about what'll happen to the united states if the extremist wing
 of the republican party ever gets back into power again.

 more like:
 
 broward: "clinton's going to raise your income taxes by over $1000!"
 mark:    "no, he's not, only about $204."
 broward: (silence)

 ok, i predict that in 1996 the republicans will still be bitter. yeah, yeah,
 i know, it's not very impressive to predict things that are inevitable...
