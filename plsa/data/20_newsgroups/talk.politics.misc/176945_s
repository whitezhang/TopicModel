 	     q	  mr. president, what do you think of jesse jackson's 
 protest today?
 	     
 	     the president:  i think it's an informational protest.  
 i think it's fine.  the owners put out a statement few days ago, 
 which they say was the first step in, you know, efforts to increase 
 minority ownership and minority increases in management.  i think we 
 should.  i'm encouraged by don baylor's appointment out in colorado.  
 and i think it's time to make a move on that front.  so, i think it's 
 a legitimate issue, and i think it's -- like i said, it's an 
 informational picket and not an attempt to get people not to go to 
 the game.  so, i think it's good.
 	     
 	     q	  do you think they're moving fast enough?
 	     
 	     the president:  well, i think that it was a good first 
 step.  and i think you'll see some movement now.  and i think it's an 
 issue that deserves some attention, and they're obviously going to 
 give it some.  and i think that reverend jackson being out there will 
 highlight the issue.  so i think it's fine.
 	     
 	     q	  mr. president, how about the logjam in the senate 
 on the economic stimulus plan?  do you think they'll be able to break 
 that and get cloture?
 	     
 	     the president:  i don't know, we're working at it.  i 
 mean, it's a classic -- there was an article in the paper today, one 
 of the papers i saw, which pretty well summed it up.  they said, you 
 know, this is a -- it's just a political power play.  in the senate 
 the majority does not rule.  it's not like the country.  it's not 
 like the -- it's not like the house.  if the minority chooses, they 
 can stop majority rule.  and that's what they're doing.  there are a 
 lot of republican senators who have told people that they might vote 
 for the stimulus program but there's enormous partisan political 
 pressure not to do it.  
 	     
 	     and, of course, what it means is that in this time when 
 no new jobs are being created, even though there seems to be an 
 economic recovery, it means that for political purposes they're 
 willing to deny jobs to places like baltimore and dallas and houston 
 and pittsburgh and philadelphia and portland and seattle.  it's very 
 sad.  i mean, the block grant program was designed to create jobs in 
 a hurry based on local priorities, and it's one that the republicans 
 had always championed.  just about the only democrat champions of the 
 program were people like me who were out there at the grassroots 
 level, governors and senators.  i just think it's real sad that they 
 have chosen to exert the minority muscle in a way that will keep 
 americans out of work.  i think it's a mistake.
 	     
 	     the press:  thank you.
