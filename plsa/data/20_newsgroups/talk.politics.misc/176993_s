 ...his account that is.
 
 many important issues, and some not-so important ones, are discussed here
 on the net on a daily basis.  i have just been informed of what i feel is
 one of the most important things that we could ever discuss -- the 
 out-and-out censorship of one of our fellow posters because some people
 don't like what he says or thinks.
 
 we have all seen the postings here by aj teel.  although many of us have
 not agreed with their content, i'm sure most of us have been at least
 somewhat interested in them.  i, for one, am greatful to live (i thought)
 in a country where people like mr. teel are allowed to say what they please.
 if i don't wan't to read it, i can just skip on by, or unsuscribe.  but,
 unfortunately, some people cannot let others live and let live.  they feel
 an overwhelming need to snuff out the little bastards.  now it seems that
 mr. teel will be with us no more, due mainly to our brother, and cheif
 net police, ted frank.
 
 
 please help aj teel regain net (post) access and correct this injustice. 
 
                       are you on ted's hit list?  
                       are your thoughts correct?  
                         is your account safe?
          has your sysadmin been contacted by the thought police?
 
 i thought the nlg and the aclu supported people with diverse opinions. not!
 
  
 please read the following forwarded messages from aj teel so that 
 you may understand this vial act for what it is...

 well, well, well... thanks to eck@panix.com (mark eckenwiler) and
 thf2@kimbark.uchicago.edu (ted frank), my account is to be axed.
 i guess that the information i am presenting is just toooo difficult
 for them to deal with. they (only ted and mark) have complained to my
 sysadmin some unknown number of times to get me off the net. (in his
 defense, mark sent only one message and it was not that bad; it has
 been posted in one of the newsgroups; however, it *was* not directed
 at me as would be common practice and i am very good at responding
 via netmail...)
 
 while i disagree with ted, i would not send mail to his sysadmin
 to get him axed. name-calling was not enough; jumping on every post
 i made was not enough; ignoring specific points when they were not
 what the desired picture was not enough; simply ignoring me if i
 am such a kook was not enough. even now i do not wish to have him
 axed, but i do wish to express my disgust about this. "argumentum
 ad silence-your-opponent-um"?! i would have thought he would have
 wanted me to stay around just to have someone to yell about and
 seem sooo wise... (to himself, i think).
 
 the issue that seems to be: "is the following an advertisement?"
 apparently, ted and mark think so...
 
 1) i posted an article from around one year ago as it was taken 
 	*off the net* from last year. if reposting an article
 	constitutes posting an ad, then i am guilty. this post
 	did have a name and address and, yes, a price. if one
 	had posted the address and subscription price of "newsweek",
 	would that be an ad? i get nothing from showing this stuff.
 2) i posted a list of documents showing examples of the kind of
 	"proof" that was requested by ted frank. he then complains
 	to my sysadmin saying that i am advertising and, lo and
 	behold, "poof", there goes my account. this one had an
 	address in it! oh, no! i guess that means it is an ad!
 
 if you value the alternative view i have been discussing, or value
 its discussion even if you do not agree with it, i ask that you send
 a note saying as much to me to show to the sysadmin. they rarely get
 "ya know, that user on your net was real helpful..." or whatever; they
 only get "i don't like what that user is doing because...".
 please do not send the note to the sysadmin. i need to take it to them
 in a manner that has at least a chance of getting through.
 
 in my files here are hundreds of responses from people saying "thanks for
 the info" or "could you send me such and such?" or "your posts are
 very interesting... keep it up." and only a handfull of "go aways". but,
 i guess the fact that i have decided not to waste my time trying to
 convince ted is a net offense[tm] of such magnitude as to warrant
 a message complaining about me. (knock, knock..."my name is ted and
 and this is mark... we're from the thought police. seems you have
 some pretty dangerous ideas here, and we're here to confiscate them...")
 nwo indeed!
 
 guess i will have to go back to the drawing board and come up with
 a new plan... thanks ted and mike. hope you are happy.
 i will be on for a few more days and then... that's all folks!
 your comments and support are requested. i can no longer post
 to news. i ask what this has accomplished... is there some benefit
 from making alternative views simply vanish? not in my book. 
 seems the easiest way to win an argument is to make the opposing side
 shut up. images of waco.... ah, but alas... and all this when i am in the
 process of typing in a letter to me from the tax collector saying that
 a lien was removed due to a letter that i wrote challenging jurisdiction.
 oh, well... it takes time to come up with the info requested, and i
 was just getting started.
 
 it should be noted that ted frank has been accused publicly over 40
 times of being an nwo supporter and has never made an statements to the
 contrary. further, what are ted frank's motivations for getting me axed?
 we all know that some people are getting paid to collect info on people
 on the net that are of "interest" to the government, and ted sure seems
 to have a *personal* interest in debunking me. hmmm... just who does
 he work for? the university of chicago which he "attends"(?) is well
 known as one of the biggest nwo supporters...
 
 and finally, if anyone would be able to help me find a new account here
 in the boulder/denver area, i would greatly appreciate it. i am in the
 process of installing linux and so will be able to do uucp or maybe
 a tc/ip connection. any help here would be greatly appreciated. since i
 am longer be able to post news and will no longer have email very
 soon, i hope that anyone who wishes to contact me will do so via:
 
 	a. j. teel, sui juris
 	c/o usps box 19043
 	boulder, colorado, u.s.a.
 	postal zone: 80308-9043
 	
 	or leave me voice mail at: c/o (408) 281-0434

 [editor's note: the reason for posting the header lines from the bounced
 messages was to show what the problem was and hopefully correct it.]
 
 [ted frank] it's inexcusable to post 150 lines of bounced mail headers to four
 newsgroups.
     a simple four-line post would have been sufficient.

 [lazlo]
 yes i agree. but our policy is to not watch everypost someone  here  
 makes.
 we generally let the net itself take care of inappropriate postings
 by flaming the user into shape (which i assume this is ment to be).
 we (cs operations) don't like to get involved in this stuff (unless
 its illegal, repetitive posts of 1gig gifs, harassment, or something
 else that offends the community in general). my suggestion is that
 you take it to email and explain what a post for bounces should look  
 like or tell him to rtfm
