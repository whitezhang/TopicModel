 after the seige began:
 
 surround the place with razor wire and then let them sit.  do not
 have daily press conferences, do your best to keep things out of
 the press.
 
 
 as things get more and more miserable inside, one of two things is
 going to happen:
 
 	1. people will start coming out.
 
 	2. they will commit suicide in mass at some point.
 
 
 the thing to remember about (2) is that hysterical situations and "assults"
 play into the hands of a "leader" who has picked this course.   its
 much easier to stampede people into something like suicide if there
 is gas coming in and bullets in the air.  let them be hungry and miserable
 for longer and longer and it will probably be more effective.
 
 	the "possiblity" that they would all kill themselves at some
 point would not bother me in the least or alter tactics.  if people
 are going to take their own lives, the best you can probably do is
 prevent yourself from giving them the opportunity or an excuse to
 do it.
 
 	if the fbi and attorney general vampira really were concerned
 with sanitation and welfare of the children inside, they would not
 have turned the water to the compound off as a "pressure" tactic in
 the first place.
