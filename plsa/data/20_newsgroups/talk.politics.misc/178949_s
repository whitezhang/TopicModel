 actually, what the study shows is that 2 percent of the men surveyed
 *said* they engaged in homosexual sex and 1 percent *said* they 
 considered themselves exclusively homosexual.
 
 the point being that what people say and what they acutally do
 may be different.
 
 it is interesting that this clip from the newspaper did not
 mention that difference.  maybe it is conservative media bias.  :-)
