 no, because i don't like the weather back east. however, it would bother me
 not one bit to live in an equivalent area here. by the way, do you know what
 the extra exposure to radiation from tmi was?

 o.k., in the u.s., tell me about some of these deaths and some of these
 unliveable areas. oh, and if you manage to find some of these unliveable
 areas, tell me what percentage of the total us land area they are.
 (hint - the total waste produced by all nuclear reactors in the us can be
 safely stored in the area of three footbal fields.)

 there are actually people that still believe love canal was some kind of
 environmental disaster. weird, eh?
 
 these opinions are mine, and you can't have 'em! (but i'll rent 'em cheap ...)
