 yeah, we may have to wait till hell freezes over. if they had listening
 devices in place, one would think they would have audiotapes as a result.
 why, when officials are asked about what those devices picked up, do they
 stumble around and never answer the question? if they have them, i think 
 people have a right to hear the tapes.

 i don't contend that koresh wasn't a liar. that's not really the issue.
 the issue is did the federal agents use the most prudent measures available
 in "ending" this fiasco (that in my opinion was bungled from the
 very beginning)?

 i don't know, and neither do you unless you were there, who started the
 fire. i hope we find out, but i have my doubts.

 could you please show us this evidence that you have? right now a lot
 of people on all sides of this issue are making conflicting statements
 right and left. some real live evidence would be most welcome!
 
 you made a serious implication that the fbi was responsible
 >for the fire and the "destruction of the people".  all you have done is
 >put doubt on who started the fire without providing any evidence to back
 >up your claim that the fbi was responsible.
 
 in my opinion, it is possible that the actions of the fbi: a) indirectly,
 b) directly but not intentionally, or c) intentionally (i hope not the
 latter, but we would be naive to discount this possibility entirely) caused
 the fire. it is possible that someone inside the community started
 the fire because they "thought" god told them to or because they simply
 would rather die than surrender. who knows? 
 
 we are left with some compelling questions here, besides the above. why
 haven't the droves of news reporters commented on whether or not they
 heard shots coming from within the compound once the tank (i don't
 remember its technical name) started ramming down the door? it seems
 to me that gunshots would be audible at 2.5 to 3 miles away.
 
 why couldn't the fbi wait until koresh wrote his manuscript, as they
 had promised they would. does the fact that koresh lied justify the
 fbi's lying as well?
 
 will an "internal investigation" really reveal what happened, if in fact
 the batf and fbi are at least partly to blame?
 
 how will we ever know if koresh broke the law as was alleged in the
 now-unsealed (finally!) warrant? certainly we won't find out in a
 court of law.
 
 there's been a lot of talk about why the people didn't run out when
 the fire started, but one survivor said that the tank had collapsed the
 stairway and entryway and that the majority of the people were trapped.
 only those in another part of the house escaped.
 
 people have commented on the unwillingness of the woman who came running
 out of the house with her clothes ablaze to remain outside rather than
 going back in. when was the last time you had your clothes on fire? who 
 the heck knows if you'd know which way you were running and why? i think
 the fbi agent who grabbed her and pulled her to safety acted heroically, 
 btw. i'm certainly not trying to paint a picture of the "evil feds" 
 by any means. i simply question the decisions from start to finish
 that led to the horrible tragedy of yesterday.
