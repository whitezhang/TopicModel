 after the initial gun battle was over, they had 50 days to come out
 peacefully. they had their high priced lawyer, and judging by the
 posts here they had some public support. can anyone come up
 with a rational explanation why the didn't come out (even after
 they negotiated coming out after the radio sermon) that doesn't
 include the davidians wanting to commit suicide/murder/general mayhem?
