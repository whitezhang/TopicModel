 this is why i asked to be 'enlightened'.  you are making claims about what
 'is' or 'is not' part of this program.  but if the "block grants" go to states
 and cities, the mayors list is very relivent.

 the fact is that primetime (tm of abc) has had numberous reposts on such waste
 programs that already exist.  again, if we are truely intrested in eliminating
 the debt, we must remove the deficit, and do away with all pork !!!

 there have been several books written on gov. waste, network news programs 
 from time to time devote segments to this, and there have been bills proposed
 that significantly reduces expenditures without touching external programs by 
 changing the way 'congress does business' (and make it more efficent).
 
 true, blame is easy, but also is spending someone else's money.  
 
 clinton ran on a platform that he would '...not raise taxes on the middle class
 to pay for these (his) programs'.  he has proposed a program that is not 
 specific, that counts on tax hikes to pay for.
