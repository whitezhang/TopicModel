 well, some form of guaranteed health care isn't a bad idea, but,
 yah, i'm a bit worried of a gubnint-run hmo myself.  i'd much
 rather have something like canada has [and i'll *belt* anyone
 who tells me to move to canada :)], but since people will yell
 and scream "no!!! not one like canada has!!!", we're
 probably all screwed.

 impressive.
 
 let the "great chuckmeister" make a couple predictions, if you
 will:
 
 1.  the sun will rise tomorrow.
 2.  rush will bash clinton on his next show.
 3.  i will turn out to be clinton's love child.
 
 chances are, i'll get at least one of those right, if i'm lucky.
 i may even get two.

 can't argue with you there.  once the gubnint has its hands in yer
 pocket, they just can't help but feel around a bit....

 oh, no sh**?!  you mean, our weakened economy will collapse in
 the face of all this gubnint tax-and-spending, and everyone will
 be in the handout line?  you're a genius!!

 no, any first-year polisci major will tell you that the prez
 *never* raises taxes.  congress does it.
 
 all those who voted the clinton ticket get to wear this *new*
 label.....
