 jobs?  what the hell have jobs to do with it?  it's another touchy-feely 
 program from the new, vapid administration.  the fact is, the major claim
 made for "universal" immunization -- that "all children will be immunized" --
 has absolutely no validity.  several states already have u.i. programs, have
 had these programs for _years_. the result: on average, their success rates
 are no better than the national average.  it seems that the gummint hasn't
 yet figured out a way to make parents bring their kids in.  yet another case
 of shameless demagoguery from the "new" democrats, the "agents of change."

 all together now... c'mon, you know the words... "meet the new boss! same as 
 the old boss!"  and the chorus: "we won't get fooled again!"
