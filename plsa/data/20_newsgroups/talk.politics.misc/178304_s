 the bill of rights, as far as i can see, does not once refer to "citizens",
 but it makes several references to "people". for example, article iv:
 "the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers,
 and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be
 violated"; article v: "no person shall be held to answer for a capital,
 or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment by
 a grand jury ...  nor shall any person ... be deprived of life, liberty,
 or property, without due process of law"; article viii: "excessive bail
 shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual
 punishments inflicted".
 
 now i've never heard that constitutional rights apply only to citizens;
 aren't they meant to apply equally to all *persons* living in the u.s.?
 whether slaves were considered "not human" i don't know, but it seems
 that a case could be made that they weren't treated as "people" as defined
 in the bill of rights. and since the nation is nominally based on the
 declaration of independence which states that "all men are created equal,
 that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights,
 that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness",
 it would also seem that slaves would not follow under this definition
 of humanity.
