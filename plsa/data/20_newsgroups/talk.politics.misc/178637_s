 my two cents:
 
 it is a sad, sad day. i *never* thought i'd be defending religious
 people (especially extremists), but i *am* mourning the murders of
 david koresh and his followers. i believe they deserved the right
 to life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness, and the right to worship
 as they saw fit. those rights (and the lives of innocent men, women
 (some pregnant), and children) were sacrificed to save the federal
 government from being embarrassed. had the branch davidians taken
 their case to court, the black eye the batf earned themselves would
 have been multiplied many times over.
 
 i also mourn the deaths of the batf agents although the deceptions
 carried out against them by our government were nothing compared to
 the atrocities against the branch davidians.
 
 attorney general "vampira" claims to have made the best decision she
 could based on the information she was given. this is possible. officials
 in higher positions than hers have been duped. we have no choice so
 we may as well give her another chance. even if she is truly evil,
 it is doubtful that she'll kill more than a few hundred at a time.
 
 i'm considering joining the nra.
 
 finally, i have one question: what happened to the federal agents that
 had supposedly infiltrated the branch davidians' organization (and
 started this whole debacle)?
