 last time i checked, the bullet weighs quite a bit more than the case, and said
 case is a hell of a lot weaker than the chamber of a gun, and the burning rate
 of gunpowder is propotional to the pressure.
 
 translation:  not bloody likely.
 
 ammunition exploding would either explode in bulk, removing large hunks of the
 surrounding landscape, or it would go off singly and spray the area with low
 velocity, lightwieght shrapnel.  if a cop can't tell the difference between
 a wound inflicted by such shrapnel and a wound inflicted by a 55 grain bullet
 doing better than mach 3, he's in the wrong line of business.
