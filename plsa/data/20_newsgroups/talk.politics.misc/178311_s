 you don't read *my* postings very carefully; i'm not surprised.  it
 was pretty shocking, and is part of why my sympathy (though not
 agreement) with the pro-lifers is increasing.

 when they hold high public office, you should worry.

 you mean, i don't come to the conclusions that your emotional
 state requires.
