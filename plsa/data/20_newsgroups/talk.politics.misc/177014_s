 i have the right to live there under the established
 government, right?  exactly.  thus, the palestinian arabs
 should be content to live under israeli rule, but should cease
 clamoring for an independent state.  or, they should get one in
 gaza and, if it can be worked out, part of the west bank.  this
 is what i have proposed all along, nabil.
