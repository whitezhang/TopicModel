 
 	viewing from the net's initial reaction to the self-immolation of the
 branch davidians, it would appear that this human tragedy is too flagrant
 for some folks to keep from using it to push their peevish little ideologies.
 (others could not help but exercise comic relief, but given the tension, i
 think this reaction is understandable.) my rasberry award goes to dave palmer
 who makes the following benediction after spewing out the facts,
 
 	"score another one for the forces of ignorance and superstition"
 
 as if the public deaths of over 80 people were not a clear and definite 
 warning as to what happens to people who follow false prophets.
 
 	from where i set, looks like satan has a three-bagger going.

 	one thing that should be made clear is that neither the fbi nor
 the batf is responsible for what happened yesterday. one can argue about
 the initial raid, but it would be worth mentioning, before the facts get
 lost, that
 
 	1. the branch davidians were tipped off that the batf was coming
 	during the initial raid.
 
 	2. the branch davidians opened fire first.
 
 	it is also worth noting that the branch davidians, according to
 the fbi's statements, opened fire immediately when the fbi issued the warning
 over the phone, and that the vehicle which launched the tear gas grenades
 did so under fire from the compound.

 	clearly, no one in the government wanted a repeat of the initial 
 shootout, that's why they went in with riot control gas. this would have worked
 with minimal casualties (the branch davidians apparently did not have gas
 masks) if koresh had not had a very different reaction in mind.

 	the question is whether yesterday's raid was wired tightly enough.
 reno and sessions both made statements to the press indicating that the
 experts had not indicated that such a reaction was (possible ?) (likely ?).
 they both indicated that they had no idea that a masada-like mass suicide
 could result from the introduction of non-lethal agents into the compound.
 
 	some of these issues are highly technical - the impression i have
 is that the "ranch apocalypse" represented a rubrik's cube for the
 counterterrorist types. the branch davidians were too well armed for 
 for a simple assault (the batf found this out the hard way). the complex
 was probably to big for the kind of "surgical" delta force coup de main
 that the bundesgrenschutz did in the 1970s when one of their airliners
 was highjacked by "black september". the reason this seige had gone on
 as long as it had was that the government really didn't have any good options,
 and to wait it out was the safest and most logical choice.

 	my own theory is that something was supposed to have happened
 on easter. koresh had made some statements building that idea up, and 
 easter came and went with nothing happening. it may be that the authorities
 felt emboldened to move for this reason. it is just a theory.

 	i don't believe this is a valid argument. obviously, hindsight
 is 20/20, but the risks of doing anything to provoke the davidians
 were clear enough to warrant caution and to delay action.

 	i imagine there are a good many people who are having some problems
 processing the reality of this affair now. 
 
 	1. this matter ties in with the infamous "social scientists are not
 	really scientists" brouhaha on sci.skeptic. here is a case where, if
 	one believes the attorney general and the director of the fbi, the
 	predictions of psychological experts were proven false, not under
 	laboratory conditions, but in the cauldron of practical application.
 
 	2. koresh's actions (or the actions of whoever started the fire - 
 	we're not likely to know what went on in there) contrast so violently
 	with the example of christ that i'm sure many christians find it
 	difficult to understand why or how this happened. under such 
 	conditions, the search for scapegoats is only too natural a human
 	reaction, even though that is not a particularly christian response
 	either.
 
 	3. koresh's mother apparently had some false hopes that the cult 
 	members had sought refuge in a bunker somewhere in the complex. her 
 	grief must be monumental at this time, and the search for a way to
 	escape moral responsibility for her family's destruction is likewise
 	real. we may not have seen the end to the self depravation.
 
 	4. the fact, simply stated, is that a good number of innocent children
 	and not-so-innocent adults died horribly for no good reason. it is
 	exceptionally hard for us, as human beings, to accept this fact.
 	we can hope for some ultimate salvation, some panacea to make it
 	better, but even though hope is a wonderful thing, that doesn't
 	make it so. there is no meaning to this thing. it just is.
