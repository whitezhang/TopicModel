 it is significant to remember that these secular positions were held by
 "average" people, and that at the time, almost all americans were pretty
 homogeonously christian.  it was largely the mainstream christian's disgust
 at such practices as polygamy which resulted in their irrational hatred.
 
 the situation is not entirely different today.  many irrational feelings and
 beliefs are justified through religion.  i don't think most of them are started
 because of religion, but religion certainly helps justify and perpetuate
 prejudices and practices by providing a neat justification which discourages
 critical thought.

 do you mean that the "secular authorities" are some continuous group of
 people with the common and uninterrupted goal of harrassing/eradicating the
 mormons?  do you honestly believe that the main reason for using utah for
 nuclear testing etc.. was to "get them thar mormons"?  and what about the
 majority of uthan's who aren't mormons?  you seem to be searching for enemy
 conspiracies.  it is paranoid to believe that everything that affects you badly
 must have been done primarily for that purpose.

 i personally feel that we should try to stop anyone who is a threat to the
 life of even one person.  sure, he did not pose a threat to the security of
 this nation.  but he did pose a threat to the lives of his followers.  that
 much is definite.

 this is like asking who really caused the deaths of the israeli olympic
 team in 1976?  in that case, the police botched the job as well.  but to
 lay a heavier burden on them than the terrorists would be a terrible mistake.
 i think the same sort of reasoning applies in this case.  certainly, if david
 koresh chose any peaceful option, the atf and fbi would have complied.  the
 responsibility is more his than the authorities.
 
 >david koresh, no doubt, will be described as the "evil" guy (by the
 >executioners), while the actions of all those "valiant and brave" officers
 
 characterizing the atf/fbi as executioners is inaccurate and unfair.  in order
 to be an executioner, the least one must have done is have the intent to kill.
