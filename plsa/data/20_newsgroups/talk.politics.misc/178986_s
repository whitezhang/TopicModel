        well, there does have to be a line.  and to be honest, extending
 voter registration to dmvs is hardly analogous to having only one
 place for registration in alaska and opening a new one in atlanta.  more is 
 not always better once you've passed a certain point.

        i thought the motor voter bill passed.
 
        in any case, my experiance with tennessee's voter registration
 system (which you can register with by mail, by the way) is that nobody
 who is interested in voting is being denied access to registration.
 all it requires is just the tiniest bit of interest on the registrant's
 part and thinking about the election once in the eleven months prior to
 it.  (once you register it's good unless you miss for years worth of
 elections of move.)
 
        it's easy to register now.  i simply don't see the value in going
 out and trying to get people registered who don't have enough gumption to
 even write and have the proper forms sent to them.   how can we expect
 responsible decisions out of these people?
