 i totally agree.  really, the only people this is going to benefit, are
 those who live in the cities where the train stops.  who wants to drive
 to the train station from x (lubbock for example)?  it's probably farther
 to drive to the train station than it is to the nearest national airport.
 
 i really can't see spending 5.7 billion on a system that only three cities
 will benefit from.
