 the key word is `spilled'.  if semen was spilled anywhere where there
 was a chance of procreation it was ok.  if it was spilt on the ground or
 in to a man it was a big sin, ditto with animals. the jews said sex=pro-
 creation.
 
 homosexuals didn't breed, there fore they are evil and should be stoned
 to death.

 stoning non-breeding population was fine.  only the breeders were
 considered to be worth much.
