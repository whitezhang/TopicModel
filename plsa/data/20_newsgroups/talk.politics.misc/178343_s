 	i've never seen cnn give out the poll questions on the air.
 if you sent them a letter asking for them, you might get them.  here's
 my guess of how part of a session might look:
 
 question: do you approve of clinton's performance?
 answer: no
 questions: do you disapprove due to the gays in the military issue?
 answer: yes
 
 conclusion: clinton has a low approval rating because he's not moving
 fast enough on gays in the military.
 
 
 	i think any group truly dedicated to reporting the news would
 not use manufactured news like polls.
