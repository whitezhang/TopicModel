 from black's law dictionary, revised 4th ed., page 1473:
 
 residence.  a factual place of abode.  living in a particular
 locality.  reese v. reese, 179 misc. 665, 40 n.y.s.2d 468, 472;
 zimmerman, 175 or. 585, 155 p.2d 293, 295.  it requires only bodily
 presence as an inhabitant of a place.  in re campbell's guardianship,
 216 minn. 113, 11 n.w.2d 786, 789.
 
      as ``domicile'' and ``residence'' are usually in the same place,
 they are frequently used as if they had the same meaning, but they are
 not identical terms, for a person may have two places of residence, as
 in the city and country, but only one domicile.  residence means
 living in a particular locality, but domicile means living in that
 locality with intent to make it a fixed and permanent home.  residence
 simply requires bodily presence as an inhabitant in a given place,
 while domicile requires bodily presence in that place and also an
 intention to make it one's domicile.  in re riley's will, 266 n.y.s.
 209, 148 misc. 588.  ``residence'' demands less intimate local ties
 than ``domicile,'' but ``domicile'' allows absence for indefinite
 period if intent to return remains.  immigration act 1917, sec. 3, 8
 u.s.c.a. sec. 136 (e, p).  transatlantica italiana v. elting,
 c.c.a.n.y., 74 f.2d 732, 733.  but see, ward v. ward, 115, w.va 429,
 176 s.e. 708, 709; southwestern greyhound lines v. craig, 182 okl.
 610, 80 p 2d 221, 224; holding that residence and domicile are
 synonymous terms.  ``residence'' has a meaning dependent on context
 and purpose of statute.  in re jones, 341 pa. 329, 19 a.2d 280, 282.
 words ``residence'' and ``domicile'' may have an identical or variable
 meaning depending on subject-matter and context of statute.  kemp v.
 kemp, 16 n.y.s.2d 26, 34, 172 misc. 738.
 
      legal residence.  see legal.
 
 resident.  one who has his residence in a place.  see residence.
 
      also a tenant, who was obliged to reside on his lord's land, and
 not to depart from the same; called, also, ``homme levant et
 couchant,'' and in normandy, ``resseant du fief.''
