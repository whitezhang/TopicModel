 ar>>to answer your question above, why should people who are
 ar>>responsible pay for the irresponsible acts of others? one
 
 ar>don't understand the concept of insurance, do you anthony?
 
 on the contrary my friend.
 
 ar>what is insurance for?
 
 ar>to spread the cost of illness/accident/etc that does occur in a small
 ar>percentage of cases, over many.  those who do not face the accident/etc
 ar>have peace of mind that they would not be devestated if they did, those
 ar>who do face the accident/etc *are* not devestated (financially anyhow)
 ar>in dealing with it.
 
 insurance is usally taken out buy the people who engage in the action
 for which insurance might be used. would you ask a person who does not
 drive to pay automobile insurance? or a person who doesn't believe that
 medicine is worth the time to by health insurance?
 
 it is a pool of people who share a similer fear.
 
 ar>this 'irresponsible' label in reference to normal but rare life occurances i
 ar>stupid.  bad things happen to good people, too, you know.
 
 adrienne, when you act to endander yourself or
 others, knowing that someone else may be burdened for your action is
 irresponsible.
