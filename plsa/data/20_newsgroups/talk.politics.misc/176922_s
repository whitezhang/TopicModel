 maybe because the claims deserve refute?  the above abstract lists various
 possible links to cannabis use (unfiltered almost guaranteed) and lung
 problems.  someone may get overly excited when they see that article, but 
 without actually digging up the study and seeing how the studies gathered 
 their data it really doesn't tell you shit.  i'm going to track down that
 study hopefully tomarrow.

 what justifies _the_ truth about drugs?  research?  what sort of 
 research?  correlational data can help establish a theory, but it does not
 prove anything.

 heroin _is_ a relatively safe drug.  what makes it unsafe are iv administration
 and shit like adulterants.  there are side effects, like withdrawal, but they
 effect people differently.

 stereotypical statement.  i know people who use heroin and opiates that 
 function just fine in society.

 name some of these drugs so we can debate about them more specifically.

 no, no, no.  (or at least i haven't been arguing this).  there is not enough
 data to form a scientific conclusion.  that _doesn't_ mean that cannabis
 is benign to users' lungs.  we can form all the theories we want, but they
 are only theories.  some theories are supported by more evidence than others,
 and that makes them stronger.

 the hell i can't!  they state *un-justified conclusions* *as fact* as
 a *political* strategy to stop drug use.

 in general, i somewhat see what you're saying.  and people like jack herer
 contribute to this.  this has been quite a big mind-fuck for me recently,
 and i've pretty came to the conclusion that you can't trust _anybody_ by
 word of mouth alone -- my attitude about the general population has
 decreased significantly.  
 
 gotta run to class..
