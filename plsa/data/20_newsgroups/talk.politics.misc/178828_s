   exactly.  what would happen if i barracade myself in my house for a
 while with lots of firearms.  then, when the police come with a search
 warrent, first i slam the door in their face, then shoot at them when
 they try to enter.  after this, i shoot at people who try to get me
 to come out.  this sort of thing happens every now and then, and it
 usually ends up being a shoot-out between the police and the person(s)
 behind the barricade.  why are the branch davidians any different?
