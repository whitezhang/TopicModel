     larry king live was both telling and sickening.  every other word
     out of janet reno's mouth  was "the little children" ,etc.  sounded
     like clinton talking.  she made claims that the children were 
     beaten, etc, despite the pronouncements of social workers that none
     of the children who left the compound were abused.  but the real
     crime:
 
 
       larry king, and his censored show.  not one fucking question
       about reno's possible error.  just two calls about how she
       had made a "good decision".  now, it doesn't take a rocket
       scientist to figure out that some people are going to be upset.
 
       nope.  no real questions at all.
