 "from daybreak on, armenian villagers poured in from miles around.....
  the women plundered happily, chattering like ravens as they picked over
  the carcass of djul. they hauled out every hovel's chattels, the last 
  scrap of food or cloth, and staggered away, packing pots, saddlebags, 
  looms, even spinning-wheels.
 
  'thank you for a lot, dro,' i said to him back in camp. 'but now i must 
  leave.'...we shook hands, the captain said 'a bientot, mon camarade.' and 
  for hours the old molokan scout and i plodded north across parching plains. 
  like lot's wife i looked back once to see smoke bathing all, doubtless in 
  a sack of other moslem villages up to the line of snow that was iran.'"
