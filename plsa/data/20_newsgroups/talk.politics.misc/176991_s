 carlos,
 
    why not check out some of the scientific research that has been
 done in this area and convince yourself.
 
    research around the world indicates that the issue of coercion is
 the critical factor. 
 
 for those interested in research on the topic i can suggest, li et al
 (england), constantine (united states), and sandfort (the netherlands).
 i especially like sandfort's research for he actually quotes what the
 boys who are involved in the relationships have to say.
