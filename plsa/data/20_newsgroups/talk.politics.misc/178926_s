 	they leave foot prints, they may drop some trash on the
 ground, and they may pick up something that looks interesting.

 	it has nothing to do with the country.  you are coming toward
 someone in an area where there has been violent confrontations, and
 one guy spins around quickly with an object that looks like a gun.
 police are not trained to stand there and let someone gun them down.

 	you're making statements that are not supported by facts.
 don't let paranoia get the best of you.  wait to see if the reporters
 don't get their film back or they get it back developed before
 screaming conspiracy.

 	our government is not big enough to give you everything,
 despite the efforts of people like bill clinton.  taking a statement
 like that and thinking `everything done in the name of law enforcement
 is wrong' is simple minded and ignorant of history.  a government is a
 necessary evil, and we must decide what it should be allowed to do
 based on facts, history, and not by baseless claims.
