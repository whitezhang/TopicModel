 	a judge denied gm's new trial motion, even though gm says it has two
 new witnesses that said the occupant of the truck was dead from the impact, not
 from the fire.
 
 	thoughts?
 
 	it's kind of scary when you realize that judges are going to start
 denying new trials even when new evidence that contradicts the facts that led
 to the previous ruling appear.
 
 	or has the judge decided that the new witnesses are not to be believed? 
 shouldn't that be up to a jury?
 
 	and what about members of the previous jury parading through the talk
 shows proclaiming their obvious bias against gm?  shouldn't that be enough for
 a judge to through out the old verdict and call for a new trial?
 
 	whatever happened to jurors having to be objective?
