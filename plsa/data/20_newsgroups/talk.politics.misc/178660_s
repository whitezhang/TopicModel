   well it may not have saved them (but they were xians so they were
   already "saved").  but it did save the taxpayers the expense of a 
   nasty trial (there's a budget deficit on, you know!).  not to mention
   the costs of extending the seige any longer.  and it saved the local
   fire depratment the trouble of having to be on station when the feds
   started their little action.  and it saved the batf/fbi the embarrassment
   of a lot of nasty testimony and accusations by bd's.   and let's not 
   forget how it saves future job-seekers and college-admission-seekers 
   from having to compete with all those kids in the compound who won't
   be growing up to work or go to school.   <sarcasm mode off>
 
   but it doesn't save you guys on the net from having to hear me say,
   "i told you so!"    whether koresh started the fire or the feds did
   the bottom line is the same:  there's a whole lot of dead children 
   who would be alive today if they had been released back when we were
   debating this a few weeks ago.
