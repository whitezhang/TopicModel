 i'm really surprised clinton hasn't already tried to do this.  he seems
 to want to tackle other irrelevant issues first, so why not this one as well.

 wrong.  we need its capability.  sure it has its problems, very few
 airplanes haven't, but getting rid of something we need is not the
 answer.  what do you want to do, start over a rebuild a new airplane
 from scatch?  it'll have its problems as well and there will be calls
 again, for it to be scrapped.  the other option is to try to extend
 the life of the c-5s and c-141s that are getting extremely old.

 it'll cost jobs, but i'm for it.  we especially don't need a b-2. the
 ssn-21, i know litttle about.
