 actually, my interest in gender issues is not limited to international
 boundaries.  indeed, i often exchange information with americans about
 issues which concern us, in both countries.

 yes, thank you, though i am really curious as to why this never came out
 (at least not in what i saw, up here in canada, or on cnn, which is sent
 up here) during the thomas nomination hearings.  surely, one would think
 that her claim to having been sexually harassed, would have a great deal
 less credibility if it could be shown that she had herself been guilty of it.

 ahemmm....  it depends.  :-)
 
 (for instance, if it were the "sworn statements" at the warren commission,
 then yes, i _would_ say that the statements were no better than toilet
 paper, used at that :-), but in most cases, the answer would be "no").
