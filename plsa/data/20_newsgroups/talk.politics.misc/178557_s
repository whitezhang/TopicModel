 growth limits?  how will hsr help with the traffic congestion?  from what
 i understand, the rail will not stop in places like waco, or bryan, or
 lots of intermediate places in between.  even though i live in austin,
 i don't see myself using the train except on rare occasions.  probably
 twice a year.  and at $65 dollars a ticket i could probably drive for 
 cheaper also. (even if the price of gas went up)
