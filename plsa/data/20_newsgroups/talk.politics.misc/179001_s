 
 in a debate about the student government here at our university, a
 question was raised by one student senator:  
 
 "why should i represent people who didn't vote?"
 
 and by implication, this raises a different question:
 
 "why should i represent people who didn't vote for me?"
 
 i feel that there are many good reasons that anyone elected to public
 office (in student government or any other government) should strive
 to represent all the people in their constituency (class of '95 or a
 geographical area, or whatever).  
 
 i would like some help from others in phrasing a reasonable argument
 on this topic.  thanks.
 
 followups are directed to talk.politics.misc, but email is preferred.
