 and as an agnostic who's slightly aware of the mormon wars that casper
 describes, i'd side with him on this. not that i support the koreshians, nor
 do i support the mormons, but in a nasty sense, the major difference is
 this; in 1857, the mormons kicked the u.s. army's ass. in 1993, the
 koreshians died in an inferno. chances are, if things had turned out a
 little differently, we might have koreshians posting to the net a hundred
 years from now talking about some future, analogous event.
