 first, the only drug that could possibly be put in drug stations are marijuana 
 or its derivitives.  every other drug that i can think of can kill you if you 
 take to much.  (by the very nature of these drugs, your decision making skills 
 aren't up to par.  that is how it differs from asprin, flinstone vitamins, etc.
 we don't even allow penicilin to be sold over the counter.)
 
 second, we already have a big enough drunk driving and alchoholic problem in 
 this country.  if marijuana were legal, undoubtedly more people would use it, 
 and that is a problem.  people use it, get stupid, and hurt other people.
