  now which is it?  are you going to comdemn national media, then turn around
  and use it to support some position you present?  seems somewhat contradictory
  doesn't it.

 i believe this true when we speak of physical data, in the
 sense of pure science.  but when we speak of data that revolve
 around social sciences then we have to be careful.

 i quite agree.  but these are cases or 'news events' that contain
 politics, social science information, sociology, etc.  and at
 best are reflections of the group that reports them.
 
 as you have pointed out, it is difficult to report that the
 temperature was 98 degrees when it was 60 degrees and have
 people believe you.

 yes and no.  the survey presented, according to mr. cramer,
 a value called the median- which one used this makes us 
 believe that 1/2 of the males had 7.3 plus sex partners and
 1/2 of the males had 7.3 or less sex partners.  homosexuals
 are purported to make up only 1%.  in this case, the majority
 of people with 7.3 plus sex partners are heterosexual.
 
 it is my feeling that median was not the intended word usage.
 but if it is then we have little evidence to support mr. cramer
 claims about gay promiscuity > hetero promiscuity.

  very good- this is a point that i have tried to bring out,
 and as any network news program will show you, it is true.
 
 the news media is a business and as such becomes skewed because
 of where its loyalties lie.
 
 there is an old statement by a man ( and i cannot remember him
 or his statment exactly) but it warns against the merger of
 business and news reporting, because of the obvious consequences.
 what master is news going to serve in the end... the advertiser
 and the bias of the news group.
