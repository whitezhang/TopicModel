 the eyes of another country.......
 
 b.b.c. world news service, on short-wave, originating out of london,
 reports that a survivor of the waco massacre states that a tank, when
 making a hole in the wall of the building, knocked over a kerosene
 lamp and that is how the fire started.  attempts were made by the
 people inside to put out the fire, but it spread too quickly.
 
 has anyone in u.s. heard anything similar or are u.s. government
 spin-doctors censoring such information?
 
 the b.b.c. news is also reporting that about 20 of those that died
 were british citizens.
