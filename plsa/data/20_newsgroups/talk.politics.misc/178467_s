 i have to agree with you... the police may have carried it a bit too far
 but rodney king was no angel either. and i don't think any guilty
 verdicts should have been returned. i'm sure you know why they handed
 down guilty verdicts on two of the officers. it's quite simple really,
 it was a compromise to avoid rioting in the places where minorities
 think it's right to riot. i hate to say this, but i would have liked to
 see them riot with everyone prepared. it would be open season if your
 skin was even slightly brown.
 
 hey, my motto is, you don't fuck with me or my stuff and you don't get
 killed. it's just that simple.
