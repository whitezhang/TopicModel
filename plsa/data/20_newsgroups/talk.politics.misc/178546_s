 pardon me for interrupting, but why doesn't anyone ever bring up other
 possibilities besides more government, less government, or no government
 and stop there? it seems to me that the problems with society go much
 deeper than government. democracies seem to reflective of the majority
 of society, both the good and the bad. if you take away the government,
 you still have the structural flaws in society, except this time, with
 no restraints. yes? no?
 	why doesn't anybody ever discuss communal society, like a
 kibbutz? i never studied it on depth, but from what i've heard, the kibbutz
 in isreal was very successful. it is also very close to what aristotle
 and socrates believed was the best.
 	sorry to detract from the discussion.

 but what good is change if there is no tracable improvement in the human
 condition? who would ever support the change if you tell them it won't 
 improve their lives? i know that there are, and will be, libertarians 
 who will jump in now and say that it will improve our lives. i can deal
 with that. all i'm saying is that improving the human condition must
 be the primary goal of any organization.
