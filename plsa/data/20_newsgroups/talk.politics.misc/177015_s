 yea, it turned out that gramm-rudman was a sham to fool the voters
 into accepting the borrow-and-spend policies of the last 12 years.

 					^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 anyone can expand the economy by chargeing $3 trillion on their credit
 cards.   big deal.  deficit spending only expands the economy in the short
 term.  in the long term it shrinks the economy for numerous reasons. i would 
 have much preferred that the taxpayers had that $3 trillion instead.

 if reagan had kept his campaign promise to balance the budget by 1983,
 there would have been no need for bush or clinton to raise taxes.  and
 all reagan had to do was balance that puny carter deficit.
 
 chew on that awhile.
