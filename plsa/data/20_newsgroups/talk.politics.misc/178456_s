    geez, where have you been, ryan?  i proposed this theory *months*
 ago.  let's take it one step further, even.  if, as the surveys show,
 up to 33% of all men have *had* a homosexual encounter, then there must
 be an even *larger* percentage of people who have had homosexual erotic
 fantasies.  but if less than 10% of the population is gay, what can we
 say about these people who don't identify as gay but have demonstrated
 gay potential.  obviously, a large chunk of these people *chose* (or,
 more accurately, were forced to choose by force of religion and social
 sanction) to put those feelings aside, to be heterosexual.
 
    obviously, cramer and kaldis fall into this category.
 
    these people are the ones who are so hung up on "choice."
 obviously, since *they chose*, everyone must have, and homosexuals are
 just flaunting their "perversion" by choosing not to go along with what
 society has dictated.
 
    of course, i'm that most awful of perverts.  i chose, i gleefully
 admit that i was heterosexual until i met the right man and *chose* to
 indulge in my homoerotic potential.  take that!
