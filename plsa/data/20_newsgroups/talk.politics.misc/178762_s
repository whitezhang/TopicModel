 yes the govt handled it in the rambo hollywood type style
 with extreeme machismo. perhaps thats not the way to handle
 it. 
 
 it is a completely different thing to start asserting as many
 have done that the government is primarily to blame. the comparisons
 with the nazis in particular are purely gratuitous.
 
 since you have provided a constructive opinion on the issue your
 post desreves to be taken seriously. peter nelson also made some
 very good points about how a low key approach might have been 
 more effective.
 
 the point is though that you learn through mistakes. the govt
 played the wrong card and lost. thats not a big deal. they
 had had four guys murdered at the begining and maybee they 
 just were not prepared for wuite this situation. who could be?
 
 if the same thing were to happen all over again we might perhaps
 be able to castigate the govt if they used the same tactics and failed
 in the same way. as it is i can't say that i would not have made the
 same mistake. maybee i wouldn't because i don't as a rule go in
 for a confrontational situation if i can avoid it. maybee i would
 because with all those press about its very difficult not to try
 the macho stuff.
 
 
 the fbi had information from within the compound we had no access
 to. they may have calculated that the b-d followers resolve was
 cracking based on their listening devices within the compound. they
 knew that koresh had chickened out of one suicide attempt. this
 may have been the reason why they considered that fear might have 
 been a weapon for breaking his resolve. again in panama they had used
 the heavy rock music to great effect during bush's invasion. funny that
 few of the koresh supporters and appologists complain much about the
 death of several thousand pananmanian civilians while the us govt attempted
 to arrest their former ally.

 koresh negated his civil rights the minute his followers fired
 on the police helicopter. no matter whether the warrant was or
 was not technically valid the guys who were carrying it out 
 thought that it was. thus the assault on them was completely
 inexcusable no matter what rationalisation people might wish to
 employ.
 
 of course we have to consider the guns issue. that is the whole
 core of the question. everything else is a diversion.
