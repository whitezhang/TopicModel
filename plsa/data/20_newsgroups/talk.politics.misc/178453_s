 i'm afraid that i've lost the thread here.  i didn't suggest that all 
 government regulations be subject to referenda.  so i don't follow the 
 comments above.

 i mean that an ideology that treats all government regulation as equally
 undesirable and seeks to abolish all regulations is unlikely to draw
 support among more than a miniscule portion of the electorate.
 
 furthermore, i am suggesting that such a plan is not feasible in an
 industrial society because the weight of litigation and/or misery it
 would produce would effectively crush productive effort.

 no, i'm not surprised.  i just think it's interesting that on one hand
 libertarians assume a limited government can be decreed, yet on the other
 posit an entire government made up of people who carry guns.  (i realize
 that many libertarians assume that such a government will be 
 counterbalanced by a fully armed citizenry, but it is worth noting that
 widespread civilian ownership of guns does not necessarily prevent the
 establishment of totalitarian government, e.g. iraq.)

 yup, sure do.  but since i also support the constitutional requirement
 that the government provide for the general welfare (article i section 8),
 i'm willing to justify such programs on that basis.

 well, in the first place, i don't support a "socialized economic system."
 i think within limits that capitalism is a fine idea.  but it is not
 the case that "any third party...is...as likely to be ignorant or corrupt
 as the buyer or seller."  there are multitudes of examples where such a
 statement is demonstrably false.  regulation of stock market transactions
 that provide a reasonable basis for buyers to avoid fraud is only one
 example.
