 i did hear this question asked during a radio news update of the case.  (they
 were talking about the ongoing trial and had some audio clips).  immediately
 after the defense attorney asked the question, there was an "objection!" heard
 in the background.  the clip ended at that point so i don't know if the
 objection was upheld.  i can't imagine nc is *that* bad.

 this i didn't hear as an audio clip but heard it reported a number of times on
 news stories both during and after the trial.  now the "we did it on purpose"
 thing is stretching, i think it was something more like--he had it coming.  if
 somebody else remebers better than i on this second point, feel free to
 clarify.
