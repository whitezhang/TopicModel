 ok.  i stand corrected.  i guess, then, that the comments about payoffs
 (i.e., "pork") to puerto ricans that others have been making still
 stands?
 
 now, everybody, how about some opinion on the following related topic:
 
 should the people who are natives of u.s. territories have
 representation in the u.s. house of rep's or the u.s. congress?
 the u.s. constitution sets up the house of representatives to represent
 each state in proportion to its population, and the senate to represent
 each state equally.  what should be done with u.s. territories like
 puerto rico?  does anyone have knowledge about how this was handled in
 the past, such as with the louisiana territory or the northwest
 territory?
