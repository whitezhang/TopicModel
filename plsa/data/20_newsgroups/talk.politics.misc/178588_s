 some people pay shares that are more "fair" than others, and will continue
 to do so, even with the presence of president clinton.  until the rich 
 elite *hurt* from taxes and shower me with their blood dripping from the
 wound of the tax dagger, i will scream and yell.  because, taxes are 
 killing the poor and middle-class, and i'm tired of the wealthy getting
 a free ride in this country.  sure, they pay a lot of taxes, but i want
 them to share my pain!!
 
 and, not even slick willy is *that* fair, is he, seeing that he and his
 wife qualify as one of those wealthy people i was talking about?  [they're
 on the lower end of "wealthy", but "wealthy" they are.]

 yah, i think the draft for vietnam was a sack of shit.  but, do we get
 to pick and choose which laws we obey, mr. chaudhary?  if so, shall we
 set up a "you follow the laws you like, and i'll follow the laws i 
 like" arrangement?
 
 >6.   hey, i think the beaded curtains add a lovely 60's-esque touch!
 
 i never thought much of beaded curtains.
  
 now beaded seat-covers, on the other hand....
 
 >5.   [health care is a human right--deleted]
 
 i didn't think i was going to respond to this, but i changed my mind.
 
 tell me, why do you think health care is a human right?  
 
 this isn't a flame or anything, i just wonder.  next thing you know, 
 free public transportation will be a human right.  maybe membership
 at prestigious health spas?
 
 [sorry to grease the hill on ya there....]
 
 >4.   make love, not war!
 
 be sure and wrap that wanker when you go spreadin' that free love stuff
 around.  (or, after the fda gets its thumb out of its ass, use that neat
 new "reality" femi-condom.)

 so do i.  amen.  and all that.

 what the hell is an "acadamia" anyway?  is that like a macadamia?

 slick willy's already got his hand in my pocket.  i'm just afraid
 of what he might grab hold of.
