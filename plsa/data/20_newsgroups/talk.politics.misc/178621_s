 you are forced everyday to associate with people that you do not
 wish to, and there isn't even a law that makes you do it.  but 
 you do, becuase you want to go shopping, or go to work, or go to
 a public park, or go to a baseball game, etc.
 
 the process of ending discrimination is based upon the rational
 concept 'that all men (women, people) are created equal', have
 the same equal standing and chances in society.
