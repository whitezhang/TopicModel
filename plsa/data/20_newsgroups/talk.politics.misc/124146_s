 yes, very serious.  i claim that i can substantiate my statement that
 rudman says he doesn't believe perot was investigating him.  you claim
 perot was investigating him.  if you will state that you were in error
 on this point, provided i produce the source, i'll go dig it up.
 
 now give me one reason why i should go to the trouble if you won't
 agree to this?  it is simple enough you know.  but i don't have time
 to waste if you'll just blow it off with more of the tripe you usually
 post.
