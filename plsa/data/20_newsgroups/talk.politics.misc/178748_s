   i heard the other day that rush has gotten together with tammy faye baker.
   they were crawling in bed the other night and rush's feet brushed up against
   tammy's legs.  "god! your feet are cold" she said.  rush looked back at here
   and said, "tammy honey, i told you when we're alone you can just call me
   rush."
