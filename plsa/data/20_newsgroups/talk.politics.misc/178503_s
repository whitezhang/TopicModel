 overriding any concern about morality is the fact that men (dennis
 is a man's name?) don't get abortions.  thus it is unreasonable to 
 suppose that your insurance premiums are being used for the 
 possibility that you will be getting an abortion.
 
 it looks like what you're really objecting to is other people paying
 money for the possibility that they might need to get an abortion.
