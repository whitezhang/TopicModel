 really?  i thought that insurance companies hired all of
 their actuarial staffs to determine the risks correlated
 with all groups of people, and that gays are more likely
 to have aids than are those of other sexual orientations.
 if i am wrong about this correlation, please correct me.
 
 my auto insurance company charges me up the wazoo because
 i am a young male with a very high performance car.  i
 always thought that this was based on nhtsa and other
 statistical data, rather than bigotry and hatred for young
 men with fast cars.  of course, with the proper government
 intervention, we could force the insurance companies to
 pretend that young men with fast cars are just the same
 as everyone else...
