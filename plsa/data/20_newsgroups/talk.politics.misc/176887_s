 
 last night i heard something about bill clinton's sister being
 involved in a marijuana bust, and the news being suppressed. i also
 heard something about her being an "ex-con". this source is not
 reliable, though. (it was a collage/booklet advertising a local band.)
 
 can anyone on the net verify this or provide more details? i'm
 surprised i haven't seen anything about this in this newsgroup.
 
 also, does anyone know what happened to the charges that shalala was a
 regular pot smoker when she was in college? this ghastly accusation
 was reported on cnn streamline news the day she was nominated, then i
 never heard anything about it again.
 
 it's almost enough to make me want to start an act-up type campaign
 to invade the privacy of closet smokers! (if only this type of
 publicity didn't violate people's rights. . . .)
