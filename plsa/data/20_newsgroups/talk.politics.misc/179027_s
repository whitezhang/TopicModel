 what does saturday night live have to do with anything? when they make fun
 of someone they do it with a little bit of creativity and talent. you, on the
 other hand, have a complete lack of creativity, talent, and verbal mechanics.
 and if you think that snl is culture, then it just shows where your intellectual
 level is.

 only in part. let's not forget that nixon personally authorized the
 break-in of ellsberg's psychiatrist.

 tell that to the house. that was the charge. or are you going to challenge
 me on that as well? subverting the constitutional rights of citizens has
 nothing to do with covering-up for watergate. you have been proved wrong,
 again. but i don't expect you to believe this since your arrogance has
 replaced your reason.

 wrong again. you forgot about ellsberg.

 this would be funny, if it weren't so sad that you actually believe this.
 in his "loyalty" he allowed the people who worked for him to take the 
 rap, while he idly sat by and let it happen. if he really was loyal to
 the people who worked for them, he would have pardoned them before he 
 resigned.
