 why all the quote marks, roy?  i can see that they might be appropriate where
 there is a legitimate concern that the words are being distorted by context, 
 or that they have been appropriated newspeak-style, but, reading your comments above,
 one might be excused if they assumed that you were claiming that "child abuse",
 "forced" sexual activity, and "damage" caused by this is non-existant or
 greatly overblown.
 
 "positive experiences", indeed!
