 there is something terribly wrong, however, with a culture which
 condemns, attacks, and all too often kills any of its members who
 attempt to get an education.  my mother is an elementary school
 teacher, and she tells me that she and her african american collegues
 are frustrated to tears by the fact that any african american child who
 attempts to do well in school and get an education is accused by
 his/her peers of "trying to be white", and is beaten, bullied, and
 tormented by them.  it goes beyond each passing grade on a test earning
 a beating.  in my mother's school, one of the most promising young
 students, who happened to be african american, had her throat cut by
 one of these young thugs.
 
 nobody who buys into such a culture has any hope of being anything but
 poor and/or a thug and/or dead, regardless of their color.
 
 what has to be changed is the culture.  if that culture can't be
 changed, then those african-american kids who are willing to separate
 from it *must* be separated from it and the murderous thugs of whatever
 color.  otherwise, future bright young african american girls who
 wanted to be doctors will end up dead on the school bus.
