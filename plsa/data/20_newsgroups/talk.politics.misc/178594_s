 i agree with most of what phill says, except the point about it being in
 our interests to bring down the oil price.  consider that both the u.s.
 and great britain have domestic sources to partly satisfy 
 their energy needs.    pricy opec oil impacts both germany,
 japan and many other "industrial rivals" more than these two.  
 in addition, the proceeds from the sale (especially by saudi arabia, kuwait
 u.a.e. etc) are disproportionately reinvested in the u.s. and g.b., 
 propping up these economies and further providing an incentive 
 to keep prices from falling too low.
