 ahhh, the classic truth by blatant assertion technique.  too bad it's
 so demonstrably false.  take a look at great britain sometime for a 
 nice history on drug criminalization.  the evidence there shows that
 during periods of time when drugs (such as heroin) were illegal, crime
 went up and people did die from bad drugs.  during times when drugs
 were legalized, those trends were reversed.

 now this is a great example of an ironclad proof.  gosh, i'm convinced.
 ( :-} for the humor impaired).  first, assert something for which you
 have no evidence, then dodge requests for proof by claiming to know
 what this group was intended for.  as to research, if you'd done any
 at all, you'd realize that there is plenty of reason to believe that
 legalizing drugs will have many benefits to society.  there are some
 plausible arguments against it, too, but they aren't enough to convince
 me that criminalization of drugs is the answer.  i'm willing to be
 convinced i'm wrong, but i seriously doubt the likes of you can do it.
