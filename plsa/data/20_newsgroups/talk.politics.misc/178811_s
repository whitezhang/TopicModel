 i have evidence that you will not accept that proves to me that god
 exists.  i have my personal experiences that have proven to me time
 and again that god does exist.  my life has not been a bed of roses
 and he has been there for me when no one else was around and pulled
 me through those times.  of course, i know this means nothing to you
 because it didn't happen to you.  i can't prove to you that god
 exists anymore than you can prove that he doesn't.
 
 it ultimately boils down to faith.  whether or not you believe in
 god is a matter strictly between you and him.  i am just the messenger.
 i don't judge and i don't condemn you for not accepting god.  that is
 not my place.  you are not my enemy.  satan is our common enemy.  and
 the only way we can defeat satan is through jesus christ.

 he fulfilled the prophesies told about him.  he performed miracles.
 you know, healing the sick and ressurrecting the dead.  jesus died
 and rose from the dead just as he said he would.  he preached that
 we should love god and love one another as we do ourselves.  jesus
 put into practice that which he preached.  and he rose from the
 dead!  his spirit now lives in me.  he changed the world not through
 the use of a sword that cleaves the flesh but the word of god that
 cleaves us from sin.
 
 compare this to dk who made promises of surrendering and then balked
 when his deluded predictions didn't come to pass.  in the end, he 
 chose to kill himself and everyone with him to hide the shame of 
 being a false messiah.

 jesus allowed himself to be killed in order to fulfill prophecy.  as
 you may recall on the mount of olives, jesus prayed to god that if this
 fate could have been avoided he would have taken it.  but instead,
 out of love for mankind, jesus chose to accept the agonizing sentence
 placed upon him and thus redeem all mankind.  jesus died to save 
 everyone, even those who crucifed him.  he's already gone to hell and
 back for you and for me.  all he asks is your love.
 
 which followers do you refer to?  there have been many who have used
 his name to further their own gains.  they would have done the same
 even if there was no jesus in the first place.  for example, bush 
 claimed that god was on their side when they attacked iraq and saddam
 claimed to have god on his side when he invaded kuwait.  imo, god
 would have nothing to do with either side.  they were fighting over
 oil, plain and simple.
  
 god be with you,
