 if a six year old child does a funny trick and you say well done he will
 do it again and it may be funny. then they may repeat it over and over
 again bu you still have to pretend its funny even though it isn't any
 more. once they are older than six you expect them to realise that doing
 the same thing over and over again isn't funny any more.
 
 basicaly ed fails to be amusing because he is merely crass. he does not
 make jokes that have any political content beyond attempting to ridicule
 their target. calling someone slick willie is not funny even if you put
 on a red nose while you say it, it was a good debating point used on the
 spur of the moment 12 months ago but now its use merely demonstrates that the
 user couldn't think of anything original to say.
 
 
 in the uk there is a tradition of old retired colnels who bore the dinner
 guests rigid with their descriptions of old campagns. ed is clearly one
 of this type of people who fails to see when a joke is spent.
