 in regard to woody's post, i thought i would remind him of something in
 the midst of his tirade against academia:
 as a member of the generation likely to pay for the crap reagan and his cronies started with the deficit according to the brilliant laffer curve (not!) i
 think we need to look with open minds upon any ideas which will allow us
 to directly address the problems of the gigantic federal deficit and debt and
 continue to allow our economy to expand--and i don't remember woody and co.
 complaining about academia while laffer implemented his policy, stockman
 approved it while being fully aware the numbers not adding up, and reagan
 completing the largest con job of the century which my generation and i will now have to pay for.
