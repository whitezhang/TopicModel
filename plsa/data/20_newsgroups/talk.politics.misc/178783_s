     that means that bd's had no plans to commit suecide.
 
                                                         this may not even be an

     are you saying the fbi may have actually received information that bd's were 
     going to burn themselves alive and did not stop the assault?  even if that
     were true, you gotta be kidding if you expect them to release that kind of 
     information to the public.

     that's not what koresh's attorney said on larry king's live. he said
     that koresh was not going to come out before the passover, and that he and
     his leutenant were "working day and night" on some kind of religious
     manuscript (something about the seven seals) and that once they finished
     they would come out.  k.'s attorney also said that the day before the
     assault an armored vehicle delivered typewriter supplies to the compound,
     and that the fbi promised many times there would not be another attack,
     that the matters would be resolved peacefully.
 
 >   and the survivors claim the fire was started from the outside.  outside

     no, they meant that bd's did not set the place on fire.
 
 yes, the fbi reported seeing two people
 >(according to cnn reports) using torches to set the compound on fire.   they
 >were outside.
 
     that was the initial claim, but i do not believe it has been repeated
     since.  anyway, i'd like to see a tape.  the fbi surely videotaped
     the whole operation. all conversations must have been recorded too.
 
     how come the two were not shot by the fbi snipers?

     what evidence?

     that is what the survivors claim.  i'd like to see some evidence
     that people that everyone agrees were not going to commit suecide
     actually did it.
