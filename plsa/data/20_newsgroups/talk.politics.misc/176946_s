 # #you are incorrect.  the most recent survey data i can find shows that
 # #26% of molestation is exclusively homosexuals, 4% is bisexual (victims

 #     so what you are saying is that 74% of the child molestations are

 bisexuals are heterosexuals?  since when?
 
 #   which concludes that by being homosexual, you will molest children or that
 #   by being homosexual you will have the propensity for molesting children.
 
 i haven't said that "homosexual = child molester," simply that is more
 likely.
 
 #   if 26% of the molestations are by homosexuals, why are you so concerned
 #   about creating a relation between the two? if you had evidence that 
 #   95% of the molestations are committed by homosexuals you might find a 
 #   relationship. ok, where is the realtionship you make?        
 
 the one that is shown when nambla marches in gay parades.
 
 #     also, what is the reason people molest? from human sexuality and a 
 #   psych class or too i have taken the overwhelming voice says that people
 #   commit these acts as power trips and to feel in control. this has nothing
 #   to do with sexual orientation. 
 
 you mean that s&m, because it's a power trip, has nothing to do with
 sexual orientation?
