 first, people should be aware that brett's (no last name listed) 
 posts on bit.listserv.politics indicate that he has been  
 hostile toward gm's hiring policies and to the moseley verdict 
 when it came out.  equal opportunity disagreement, i guess.  :-)
 
 my guess, without seeing the judge's opinion, is that gm's motion 
 was denied on due diligence grounds.  otherwise, a party to a 
 case could always keep one or two semi-credible witnesses in 
 reserve to spring if they lose.  not exactly a way to promote 
 repose.
