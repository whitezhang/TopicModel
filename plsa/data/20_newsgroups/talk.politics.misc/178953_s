 
   a alan brock 4/14/93 orange county register editorial titled "a case for
   repealing the income tax" got my attention.
 
   some quotes:
 
    "... a tax on income, because of the flexible definition of that
    concept, invites the government to snoop into every nook and
    cranny of our lives. encouraging people to snoop on one another
    and report transgressions against the almighty state, which most
    americans deplored in nazi or communist regimes..." 
 
    "... although most americans paid no income tax at all 50 years ago
    -- withholding began only during world war ii, as a "temporary"
    exigency, and in 1948 the median family federal income tax was $9..."
 
    "last year the federal government got only 37 percent of its income
     from income taxes... how long ago was it that the federal government
     somehow managed to stagger along on 63 percent of its 1992 revenue?
     ... would you believe five?..."
 
    "... the income tax has converted a free people into a society of
     the fearful and the snitches..."
