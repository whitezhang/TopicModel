      hey, *i* wasn't the one dancing and singing on jan. 20, now
      was i?   i was roundly ridiculed for my "predictions".

       just wait until the see what clinton has planned for 
       their pension funds!  :)  this one doesn't take much thinking
        either.    uncle sam needs money, bad, and pension funds got it.
 
       well, they used to have it.  turns out the states  have been
       plundering state employee funds for the past 2-3 years.  ;)
 
        ah, it's gonna be swell!
