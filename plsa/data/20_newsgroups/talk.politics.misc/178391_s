 pity you didn't say something about the use of statistics to justify
 targeting and persecuting a minority, then.

 what in the tree makes you think we queers can't experience that commitment? 
 what's stopping us from committing to one partner for the rest of our lives? 
 i have every intention of doing so, once i find the right person...and
 whether that person is male or female, i seriously doubt that a church
 ceremony/public vow/licence will make any difference whatsoever in the sort
 of commitment i experience with that person.  you have no conception of the
 difference marriage makes since you have never known any other way.

 you're getting to the right idea here...just be careful of making statements
 like the above, and you'll be part of the solution and not the problem.

 no flames necessary. :)
