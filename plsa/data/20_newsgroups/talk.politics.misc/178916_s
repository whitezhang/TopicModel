 "we're number one in percentage of population without health insurance. 
 ******************************************************************
 
 "the main reason we're number one in  percentage of population without
 health  insurance  is  that we're last  in  percentage  of  population
 covered  by public health insurance. only about one fifth of americans
 qualify for the main types of public health insurance available in the
 united states: medicare, medicaid, and veterans' benefits.(2l)
 
 "of those  who don't  qualify, many  have private  insurance.(22)  but
 almost  one  in  seven  americans  (34  million people--most living in
 families with a working adult) have  no insurance  at  all, and one in
 four (63 million) have been without insurance for a substantial period
 of time during the last two years. many more have inadequate coverage,
 meaning that they could be bankrupted by a major illness.(23) in fact,
 one  health  care  expert  says that because  only 1  percent  of  the
 population  has   private   longterm-care  insurance,  "virtually  any
 american could be  impoverished by a prolonged disabling illness."(24)
 additionally, as many as  40 percent of those  eligible for some forms
 of public aid do not  receive  it. these  gaps in health  care  result
 directly from  the  fact  that  the  united  states is  the only major
 industrialized  nation (other than  south africa) without  a  national
 health insurance  plan providing  universal coverage while controlling
 costs.

     ``america is becoming a land of private greed and public squalor.     
     this book is an indispensable road map through the wreckage. the     
     facts it reveals will startle you. they may depress you. but     
     ideally they'll fire you up to help rebuild this nation.''
