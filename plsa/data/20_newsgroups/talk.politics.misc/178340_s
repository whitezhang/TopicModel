 agreed.

 it is a failure of libertarianism if the ideology does not provide any
 reasonable way to restrain such actions other than utopian dreams.  just
 as marxism "fails" to specify how pure communism is to be achieved and
 the state is to "wither away," libertarians frequently fail to show how
 weakening the power of the state will result in improvement in the human
 condition.

 this is a strawman argument and fails on several grounds.  in this case,
 "limited" and "big" government are not defined.  i would point out that
 lebanon, somalia, and the former yugoslavia are by some definitions nations
 with "limited" government, while the us, canada, and nations in western 
 europe (where "people would rather live") are often pointed out as 
 nations with "big government" from a libertarian point of view.  
 
 the argument is not between those who want "limited" government and those
 who want "unlimited" government.  it is between those who believe
 government regulation in a capitalist economy serves worthwhile ends and
 those who believe such regulation is neither desirable on empirical 
 grounds nor justifiable on ideological grounds.
