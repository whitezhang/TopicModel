 	let me get this straight: your theory is that the fbi 
 accidentally started the fire while the atf was deliberately starting 
 it?  that would certainly explain why they've been lying about the 
 whole thing -- that kind of screw-up really *would* be embarrassing, 
 wouldn't it?  there is of course only one weak spot in this theory -- 
 we only have the fbi's word that the guys setting the fire were 
 wearing black, and you've already demonstrated that the fbi consists 
 of bald-faced liars.  from this we can immediately conclude that 
 they were not in fact wearing black, and that that description was 
 part of the fbi cover-up.  who was it really?  come on, now, think -- 
 who is really out to embarrass the clinton administration?  the 
 answer is so obvious i don't see how you could have missed it.  
 that's right -- it was robert dole and the senate republicans, 
 of course.  and it worked, too: clinton immediately backed down on 
 the stimulus package, didn't he?

 uh huh.

 	now i'm getting confused.  did the tear gas canisters start 
 the fire before or after the lantern, and when was that in relation to 
 when the atf started it?  oh, by the way, the story i've been hearing 
 is that no canisters were used, since they didn't want to start 
 a fire (but we of course only have their word on that).
 
 	as you may be able to tell, i'm not exactly persuaded.
