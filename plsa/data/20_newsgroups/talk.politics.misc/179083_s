 	     the president:  good afternoon.  please be seated.  i 
 want to say, first, how delighted i am to be here with secretary 
 riley and with senator graham.  the three of us served as governors 
 together during the 1980s when we worked constantly on strategies to 
 improve our schools, when we led often difficult and long efforts to 
 upgrade the standards in american education and to improve the 
 quality of instruction our children were receiving.  
 	     
 	     there were no two governors whom i admired more during 
 that period than the two who now stand on this stage with the teacher 
 of the year.  and i think both of them would join me in saying that, 
 after all the testimony has been heard and all the bills have been 
 passed and the funds have been raised and allocated, it all comes 
 down to what happens between the teacher and the students in the 
 classroom.
 	     
 	     that's why today's ceremony honoring the national 
 teacher of the year is so important.  tracey leon bailey is one 
 recognition all across our country for highly advanced and innovative 
 science programs.  he's developed and introduced into florida's 
 classrooms cutting-edge programs in molecular biology and dna 
 fingerprinting -- subjects usually taught only in college and, i 
 might add, probably only dimly understood here in the nation's 
 capital.  (laughter.)
 	     
 	     within three years of being hired by a satellite high 
 school, mr. bailey's institution had one of the strongest science 
 programs in the entire state of florida, and it won numerous national 
 and international awards.  these advanced programs aren't just for a 
 favored few.  tracey bailey has inspired all kinds of students, 
 including those previously known as low-achieving or at-risk to reach 
 for excellence and to attain it.  this is what our students need and 
 what our country needs. 
 	     
 	     today, we know that a good future with high wages and 
 rich opportunities rests on the foundation of quality education for a 
 lifetime.  the basics aren't enough anymore.  all our kids need 
 competence in math and science and advanced problem-solving.  that's 
 why tracey bailey's accomplishments are so important and why i am so 
 pleased and proud to participate in recognizing and honoring these 
 accomplishments. 
 	     
 	     tracey, you represent the best in the united states.  
 i'm glad to recognize you today and to formally present you with this 
 apple award as the teacher of the year for 1993.  (applause.)  
 	     
 	     mr. bailey:  thank you, mr. president.  it is indeed a 
 great honor and a tremendous responsibility to represent the nation's 
 2.5 million teachers.  and we appreciate the support that you have 
 shown for education, and we're looking forward to working with you to 
 help redesign and improve our nation's schools.  
 	     
 	     we know that the quality of our children's education 
 will directly impact the future of our economic and social landscape 
 in the years to come.  and we thank you so much for your continued 
 support and commitment to our children's education.  thank you again.  
 (applause.)
 
 	     the president:  in closing, i would like to also welcome 
 the education leaders in florida who are here, those representing the 
 national education groups who have also come.  i'd like to recognize 
 tracey's congressman, representative jim bacchus in the back, himself 
 a great advocate of education.  and i'd like to remind all of you 
 that the ultimate purpose of the national teacher of the year award 
 is to find a way for the rest of us to express our appreciation to 
 people all across this country who give their lives to our children, 
 all of the teachers of this country who get up every day and do their 
 best to try to advance the cause of learning for all the children of 
 america.  they are, in so many ways, our most important public 
 servants.
 	     
 	     thank you very much.  (applause.)
