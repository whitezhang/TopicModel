 yes, i have!  wasn't there a case of a single lion ruling all the land
 from south africa up to egypt across to the congo?  if my memory serves
 me correctly there was enough game to feed some 100,000 or more lions but he
 wouldn't let the other lions hunt as he wanted it all himself.
 
 he died of a heart attack brought on by being overweight.
 
 good thing too as he had designs on europe, america (north and south),
 and the falkland islands.
