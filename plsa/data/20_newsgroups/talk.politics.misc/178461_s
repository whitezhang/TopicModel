 they don't work because you need a nation-wide confiscation of all guns,
 ralphie. that's why it dosen't work in d.c. they didn't confiscate the guns
 that all ready exist. therefore what ray said still applies.

 however ralphie, the amount of killings would go down. think about it. with
 guns it just takes the pull of a trigger. other forms of murder require much
 more effort on the part of the murderer.

 you should! although maybe you're right. well armed citizens wouldn't have
 to worry about little boys and their threats against women and abortion
 clinics.

 ralphie, ever been to london or any major city in the uk? you know not what
 you speak. and as far as england being in dire straits, have you forgotten
 your lines about civil wars and society erupting in the u.s.

 do you have a point here? except to explain the crap that follows.

 ralphie, only you in your sick mind would think that this is the reason japan
 and germany's gnp are two of the highest. probably had more to do with the
 economic re-building after world war ii. i think you need to study the issue
 a little more. but in ralphie's world, violence is to be worshipped. isn't it
 ralphie (or whichever of your multiple personalities wrote this post)?
