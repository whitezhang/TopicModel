 was a pretty nifty idea.  then president clinton said he wanted families
 who make more than $100,000 to bear 70% of the new tax burden, and many
 were quick to complain that their six-figure income does not make them one
 of the well-to-do.  it's particularly ironic (to me) that it's in those
 traditionally liberal enclaves of the bay area and academia where the
 wealthy are struggling so to fit themselves into the mantle of "just
 regular working-class folk".
 
 nobody will ever admit to being rich; everybody's middle class.  so who
 are the rich?  well, i'll throw out some stats from the 1990 census and
 let you be the judge...

 bay area average household income is in the mid-$40,000 range.  national
 average is $31,889.  the bay area has nearly twice the national average
 of six-figure income households (9.1% vs 4.8%*).  the cost-of-living here
 may be high, but i don't think it's twice the national average...

 a 1,500-square-foot tract house in a bay area working-class neighborhood
 goes for about $250,000.  i doubt that the los angeles market is all that
 different.  it would appear that this definition of "modest" is perhaps a
 bit immoderate...

 } 
 } it depends upon your definition; it's clearly above average.
 
 it is more than what two-thirds of california households make.  seems
 to me that belonging to the upper one-third is not an unreasonable
 definition of "upper-middle-class".  note that if that professor's
 spouse earns $35,000 they become one of clinton's "rich" families.
 
 here's a breakdown of national, california, and bay area household incomes:
 
    <$30k  $30-50k   $50-100k  $100k+
 ------------------------------------
 us  49%     24%        23%      4% * the census bureau did some weird
 ca  41%     26%        26%      7%   rounding here...more like 5%
 ba  34%     25%        31%      9%
 
 and to add a little prespective:
 
 a minimum wage earner working 40 hours/week makes $8,840/year.  the poverty
 line for a family of four is $15,171.  if they make up to twice that, the
 government considers them to be "working poor".  say we decide to call this
 the "lower-middle-class".  then how 'bout:
 
 $30-50k annual income is "middle-class".  $50-100k is "upper-middle-class".
 $100k+ is "rich".  $1,000k+ is "filthy-rich".  and $10,000+ is "bill gates".
 
 make sense? ;^)
