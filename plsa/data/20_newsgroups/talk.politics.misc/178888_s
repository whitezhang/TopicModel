 i was quoting a news story.  i have no idea why they claim this was
 the most "through examination."

 what?  even in san francisco, the dept. of public health estimates
 that only 11% of the male population is gay.  what you are claiming
 is that of the 16 million people in the nyc and la areas, that more
 than 10% are gay.  what is the source of your numbers?  keep in
 mind that attempts by cdc to determine homosexual percentage in
 american cities have given numbers <3%.
 
 # 1% of the american male population is about 1.25 million.
 # 
 # so what this study says is that all gay males live in new york city or
 # los angeles, and about half-a-million people are lying about being gay.
 #

 yes, your 1.75 million number smells funny.
