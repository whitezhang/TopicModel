        non-toxic tear gas?!?  do you know what tear gas is?
 
        i do: once upon a time i happened to be in a room when someone threw 
        a tear-gas grenade in (that was supposed to be a joke:).  the sensation 
        was incredible: i felt my eyes and nostrils were being torn apart.
        i remember us - a bunch of young men in our early 20's - running out
        like a herd of wild animals, knocking down the door and jumping
        out of the windows (thank g-d we were on the first floor).
 
        i can't imagine this kind of stuff being used against children.
 
 for them, the worst effect might not be the physical effects so much
 as the psychological effect of being incapacitated without fully
 understanding the cause.  many years ago, i was accidentally exposed
 to a tiny dose of tear gas.  (it was in athens, on the street leading
 to the american embassy; there'd been a march that had been broken up
 with tear-gas; i must have stumbled into a remaining patch of gas the
 next day.)  aside from the tears, feeling sick to my stomach, etc.,
 the really horrible psychological effect was that of suddenly falling
 to pieces and not knowing why it had happened---i was horrified and
 wondered what disease or other health problem i had.  (i didn't find
 out about the march and the tear-gas till hours later.)  i can imagine
 how horribly disorienting this might be to very young children:
 suddenly crying uncontrollably and feeling sick, weak, and out of
 control of your body---and not knowing the cause.
 
 ``this gives us a chance to try the gas of peace.''  yeah, right.
