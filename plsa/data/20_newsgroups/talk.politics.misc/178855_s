 i do agree with you, in a way.  the war on drugs has failed, but in my opinion,
 that doesn't mean we have to give up.  only change the tactics.
 
 for instance, here are how some penalties should be changed.
 
 dealing coke -- death
 dealing heroin -- death
 dealing pot -- death
 dealing crack -- death
 
 the list goes on and on!!!......
 
 just kidding!!!
 
 however, on a more serious note, i do believe that we should take some money 
 away from the foriegn operations in south america and costly border 
 interdiction efforts.  (don't think i'm going to say, "spend it to educate 
 people", because i know plenty of educated dopers).  actually, spend it on  
 things like drug treatment programs.
 
 i saw an interesting story on 60 minutes about how the british actually 
 prescribe and addict his "recommended" dosage, and try to ween him off from it,
 or cut the amount down to levels where it is "acceptable".  sounds good so far 
 from what i heard with a decrease in cost, lower addiction rates by wiping out 
 the dealer's markets, etc. (but that was the only thing i have heard about it.)
 
 however, legalizing it and just sticking some drugs in gas stations to be 
 bought like cigarettes is just plain silly.  plus, i have never heard of a 
 recommended dosage for drugs like crack, ecstasy, chrystal meth and lsd.
 the 60 minute report said it worked with "cocaine" cigarettes, pot and heroin.
