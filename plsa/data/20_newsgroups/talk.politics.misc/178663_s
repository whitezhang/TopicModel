 i agree with the body of your post, but please reconsider your phrasing
 here.  i think these ideas are selfish and rational, which
 is commendable.
 
 don't give selfishness a bad rap.  if we were all selfless there would
 be no moral reason not to have a draft.  it [the draft] is the ultimate 
 in mindlessly serving your fellow man with no thought to the importance
 of the self.
