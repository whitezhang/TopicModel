 yes, sadly, this is true. the primary reason, and the essence of the
 details that you are seeking, is that the grahm-rudman budget controls
 were working.  in fact, they were working so well that unless the feds
 did something, they were going to have to start cutting pork. so bush
 and the democrats got together in a budget summit and replaced
 grahm-rudman with the now historic grand compromise in which bush
 "consented" to raise taxes in exchange for certain caps on spending
 increases.
 
 as it turned out, the taxes killed the reagan expansion and the caps
 on spending increases were dispelled by clinton in his first act as
 president (so that he could create his own new plan with more tax
 increases).
 
 the result is that clinton now hopes to reduce the deficit to a level 
 above where it was when reagan left office.
 
 chew on that awhile.
