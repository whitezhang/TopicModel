        the republicans are, in general, fighting any tax increase.
 there is also worry that a vat would be far too easy to increase
 incrementally.
 
        (btw, what is different between canada's tax and most of
 europe's that makes it "visible?")

        this would require a constitutional amendment, and congress
 enjoys raising taxes too much to restrict themselves like that.
 (besides, with the 2/3 majority necessary to pull that off you'd 
 have a difficult time "forcing" anything like that.)

        primarily because it's a practical impossibility to "freeze"
 tax rates.
 
        however, this is something that bothers me.  we're always talking
 about "consumer confidence" and "consumer spending" as gauges for the
 economy.  if they really are important, wouldn't shifting taxes to
 consumption provide a disincentive to spend money?
