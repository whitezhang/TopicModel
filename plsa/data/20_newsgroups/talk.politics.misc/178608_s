 good grief!  i do believe that for once you may have an argument which may
 be discussed intelligently!
 
 i guess that you are a person who dislikes contact with people of ethnic
 minority.  however, your argument again falls flat on its face.  you state
 that you, under an anti-discrimination bill, would be forced to associate
 with others [homosexuals, i assume] against your will.  how do you know that
 you do not associate with them now, except they may be closeted?   would you
 like to change your argument to read "forced to associate with truthfully
 homosexual people against my will"?  you have no proof that anyone you
 now know may not be homosexual and this punches a large hole in your
 argument.  is it your belief that a homosexual comes in only one flavour (sic)
 and that is the camp mincing type?  prove it.  you cannot.
 
 i must admit though, that it looks as if you actually thought about your response
 this time instead of just raving.
