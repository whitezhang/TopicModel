 the arrest of noriega did not have any major adverse effect on the
 drug trade going through panama. money laundering continues to be
 panama's main industry. in fact, it is bigger now than before noriega
 was arrested [1]. panama's current administration also has ties with
 the colombian cocaine cartels [2]. and large amounts cocaine still
 flow through panama on a regular basis [3].
 
 oh well...
