 are you any less stunningly ignorant?  have you ever heard of life
 insurance premiums some companies give in which nonsmokers are charged
 much smaller premiums than smokers?
 
 not to mention auto insurance being much cheaper for women under 25 than
 for men under 25, because women on the average drive more carefully
 than most men--in fact, almost as carefully as i did before i was 25.
