 you think that you all have it bad....here at good ol' southwest missouri
 state u., we have 2 parties running for student body president.  there's the
 token sorority/fraternity faces, and then there's the president and vice
 president of norml.  they campaigned by handing out condoms and listing
 their qualifications as,"i listen really well."  it makes me sick to have
 a party established on many of the things that are ruining this country like
 they are.  i think i'll run next year.:(
