 we have three options with respect to the constitution:
 
 1. abide by it.
 2. duly amend it.
 3. abandon those parts of which a majority disapproves.
 
 of course, since the whole point of the constitution is to restrain the
 will of the majority, and since even in unfettered democracy we have 
 nothing to fear from minorities, #3 amounts to abandoning the 
 constitution altogether.
 
 which will it be?
