 	all you bd apologists seem to be conveniently forgetting
 jonestown.  it would have looked much worse if the feds had just
 waited till they all committed suicide.  this was a no win situation,
 although the final raid was a tragic failure - they should have
 been able to get more people out alive.

 p.s.  the title for this thread is ridiculous.  feds couldn't give a hoot
 about their religous ideas - weapons was the problem.  similar situations
 have popped up with those "i'm not gonna pay taxes" freaks in idaho, etc. 
 where religion clearly has no bearing.  religous freedom here, as an issue,
 is a complete smokescreen.
