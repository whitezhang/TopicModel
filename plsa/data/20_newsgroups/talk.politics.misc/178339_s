 don't understand the concept of insurance, do you anthony?
 
 what is insurance for?
 
 to spread the cost of illness/accident/etc that does occur in a small
 percentage of cases, over many.  those who do not face the accident/etc
 have peace of mind that they would not be devestated if they did, those
 who do face the accident/etc *are* not devestated (financially anyhow) 
 in dealing with it.
 
 this 'irresponsible' label in reference to normal but rare life occurances is
 stupid.  bad things happen to good people, too, you know.
