 wait a second, you're ignoring major facts here.
 
 there was no attempt to simply serve a warrant. the batf had a
 no-knock warrant. the initial firefight began when the batf threw
 concussion grenades at the building. (batf admits this!)

 let's be realistic here, shall we?
 
 you're a member of a rather paranoid religious organization. someone
 comes to your building, dressed in black suits, carrying firearms.
 they throw a concussion grenade at the place, and try to break in.
 what, exactly, are you going to do?
 
 i would not allow anyone to enter my home without first identifying
 themselves. if someone attacks my home by firing weapons or throwing
 explosive, i think i'd be entirely justified in defending myself.
 
 regardless of what i think of the bds, and regardless of whether or
 not they were guilty of firearms violations, this is not the way you
 treat people in a supposedly free society.
