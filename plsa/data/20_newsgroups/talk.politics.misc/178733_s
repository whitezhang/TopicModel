 this is not a "studies", but a study.  other studies, including the
 just-published "janus report", give very different figures.  the janus
 report figures are not too different than kinsey: 9% homosexual men,
 and 4% bisexual men.

 don't be stupid.  the kinsey report is one study, so it can't be "all
 over the map" all by itself.  other studies, including the battelle
 one, have also been criticed.  as far as agendas go, this is really
 chutzpah.  *your* agenda is obvious.
