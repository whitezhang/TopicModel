 can you provide some evidence that the slave states regarded slaves as
 not humans?  they were "outside our society" and similar phrases that
 basically meant that they didn't have to recognized as having the same
 rights as a free person, but they were never considered "not human" to
 my knowledge.

 if that were the case, the slave states would not have passed so many
 laws that restricted the freedom of slave owners to do as they wished
 with their property.  examples: laws prohibiting manumission without
 legislative grant; laws prohibiting teaching slaves to read & write.
