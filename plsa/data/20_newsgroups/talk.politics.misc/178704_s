 janet reno killed the waco children.  she is responsible for
 their deaths.  she should resign immediately.  she should have 
 understood that david koresh was a madman who would do anything
 against the children if he became provoked.  all the warning 
 signs were there and she ignored them.  she provoked koresh
 into killing the children.
 
 the situation in waco was similar to a hostage situation with 
 a madman holding a gun against the head of an innocent person.
 in such a situation, a person who provokes the madman and causes 
 him to pull the gun's trigger is responsible for the death of the
 hostage.  janet reno blindly stumbled in there and basically
 threw a tear gas container at the madman hoping that he would
 release the hostage.  it's no surprise that the madman would
 pull the trigger in response to that kind of provocation.
