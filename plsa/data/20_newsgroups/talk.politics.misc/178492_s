 fine.  libertarians and anarchists are not alone in being uncomfortable
 with the use of state sponsored coercion.  the notion that coercion can
 be virtually eliminated in a society (or more properly that once it is
 eliminated on the part of the state it is no longer worth serious 
 consideration) is a view that is peculiar to libertarians and anarchists.  
 
 for example, does "non-initiated force" (coercion) include tax collection?
 does it include the minimal level of regulation of commerce envisioned
 by adam smith?  since coercion can be exercised by actors other than the
 state, how is the state to deal with it?  exclusively through after the
 fact arbitration/legal compulsion?

 well, i must admit that the picture of libertarians as amway participants
 is somewhat more reassuring than the idea of them trying to govern a 
 complex, conflictual, industrial society.  i'd venture to point out, 
 however, that if libertarians couldn't convince at least 85% of a group 
 of "seminar participants" to "embrace" their philosophy, their 
 propaganda skills need to be honed.  
 
 frankly, however, it is no great trick to create a government for a 
 society in which (almost) everyone is assumed to agree about what is a proper
 government policy.  once that is assumed, all sorts of annoying formalities
 can be dispensed with, elections, police, etc.  and as mr. marx said,
 the state will just wither away.  
 
 on the way there, however, would you like to explain how eliminating 
 virtually all policies that restrain private coercion in the 
 current society will help us to live happier lives? or is it like
 socialism; just some short-term pain that we'll have to bear until 
 everyone has had the benefit of "re-education" through regular 
 "seminar" training?
