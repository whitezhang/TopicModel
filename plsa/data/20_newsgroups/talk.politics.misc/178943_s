 what evidence are you aware of. what was reported in the media, or all of
 the evidence that was presented at the trial.
 
 this sounds to me a lot like the first rodney king 5 trial. a bunch of people
 who saw 10 to 15 seconds out of a several minute long video, decided that
 they knew more than people who had sat through a two week trial.
