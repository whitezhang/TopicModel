 i don't understand what you are getting at here.  if the chances of 
 promiscuity are larger, yet the rate of promiscuity is lower in the heterosexual
 community, doesn't that imply that the homo/bi sexual population is then 
 even more promiscuous than the raw statistics imply?  
 (no axe to grind here i'm just a scientist and i hate to see statistics abused.)

 i am a hetero man and have had sex with one woman in my life (my wife).  it is 
 very pleasing to me to be able to say that.  i hope you have the same feeling
 as i do.  i also wish that you could (if you wanted) experience the joys and
 trials of being committed to someone for life (there is something about marriage
 that makes the commitment much greater than one might expect).

 don't forget about the culture.  sadly, we don't (as a society) look upon
 homosexuality as normal (and as we are all too well aware, there are alot
 of people who condemn it).  as a result, the gay population is not encouraged
 to develop "non-promiscuous" relationships.  in fact there are many roadblocks
 put in the way of such committed relationships.  it is as if the heterosexual
 community puts these blocks there so as to perpetuate the claim that gays 
 are immoral.  "my, if we allowed gays to marry, raise children ... we might
 just find out they're as moral as we are, can't have that can we?" 
 
 just some thoughts.  flame away. :)
