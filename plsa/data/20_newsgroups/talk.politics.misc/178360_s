 yes, that is most certainly true. however, the paragrapgh reflects a value-less
 position and infers that what is more important than anything else is to
 have "a positive view" of one's self.
 
 this of course, is foolish.
 
 should a mass murderer, a pedophile, a 10-year old pyromaniac have a "positive
 view" of themselves?
 
 of course not.
 
 a person that engages in behaviour that a large number of people condemn,
 and if you believe in the concept of "society", then your only choice is
 to expect that person to have a negative view of themselves.
