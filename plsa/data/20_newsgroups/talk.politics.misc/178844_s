     the immunization program is just a "useful first step". among other
     things, the money will go to pay for creating and maintaning a
     a computerized "innoculation" database on all u.s. children.
     (code-named big mother... just kidding, the name will be children
     defense database, or something like that.)
 
     once the money is spent and little or no tangible results achieved, 
     the goverment will have to start knocking down doors, in some 
     neigborhoods, and bribe parents in others (probably the ones that 
     are paying kids for attending the school - what a fantastic idea!)
