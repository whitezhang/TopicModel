 oh, no, not in this case. i've noticed that you conveniently edited out your
 stupid comment that the prc stands for cambodia. when we're arguing the
 vietnam war and about cambodia, and you toss in a boner like that (along
 with your other boners), you are an ignorant asshole.
 
 oh, and even the vietnamese agree that they did far more damage to
 cambodia than we ever did.
