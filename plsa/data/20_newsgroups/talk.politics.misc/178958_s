 hello, is there anybody in there?  you think you have to pay for this idiot's
 problem now, who's going to pay for the ballooning number of addicts and 
 all of the associated problems with them.  i don't even want to think about
 it with hillary in the white house and an administration that "feels our
 pain".
 
 no harm but to himself?  what about when he drives his school bus full
 of kids into a train.  when he gets stoned and drives up on a sidewalk
 and kills 5 people.  when he lives off me on welfare for the rest of his
 life.
 
 the problem with the wod is that it has no bite.  sending the slimy 
 bastards to the chair for selling drugs to kids, now there's some bit.
