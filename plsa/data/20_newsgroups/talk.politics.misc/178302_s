 you asked a question, and now you don't want people to answer?  i believe
 a legitimate question was asked.  why shouldn't cost and safety be used
 (at least in part) to determine legality?
 
 i'd like to see you *prove* that drug legalization is an idiotic idea.
 seems to me the evidence from great britain is pretty convincing that 
 drug legalization is a good idea.  even such a noted conservative as
 william f. buckley supports it.

 your examples (except for prostitution) fail miserably to meet both criteria
 (safer and cheaper).  obviously, killing people is not "safe".  as for
 prostitution, why shouldn't it be legal?
