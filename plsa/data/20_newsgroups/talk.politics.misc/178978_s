 as one of the "clintonites" cited above, i'll try to clarify since this
 is not a case of clinton's "dishonesty." (i won't necessarily defend him
 on other issues.)  
 
 there were never any specific projects included in the community
 development block grant portion of the president's proposal.  congressional
 republicans, in an effort to discredit the stimulus package, selected what
 they felt were silly sounding projects from a wish-list of potential 
 projects prepared by the us mayors' conference before the stimulus package
 was ever proposed.  (the document in question was designed to pressure the
 white house to increase the size of the block grant proposal submitted
 to congress.  it didn't work.)
 
 the $2.56(?) billion proposed in the stimulus package came nowhere close
 to covering the total estimated cost of the original wish-list.  if it
 were passed, communities would have to select which projects to fund and
 at what level.
 
 in the case of spokane, wa., tom foley's home district, no one ever
 expected to be able to refurbish a local swimming pool (one of the 
 republicans' examples) from the funds available in the stimulus
 package since the estimated cost of doing so exceeded the total 
 amount of block grant funds the city would receive from the stimulus 
 package for all projects.  
 
 the plan, instead, was to use the money on public housing construction
 and remodeling to cope with a severe housing shortage.  (yup, there are
 places where that is true.)  the swimming pool improvements were near the
 bottom of a long list of priorities prepared by the city.  the $3 million
 or so to be received would cover only a few of the most pressing
 priorities.
 
 if the block grants are cut from the stimulus package, it is these projects
 that will be affected by the lack of funds.  and that is why the clinton
 administration has been publicizing the issue.
 
 a final point.  one may or may not like community block grants.  it is
 worth noting, however, that congressional republicans' opposition to them
 is new.  since the nixon administration, republicans have generally 
 supported such grants as an alternative to targeted federal spending,
 arguing that local governments are far better able to determine spending
 priorities than "washington bureaucrats."  
 
 is it clear now?  or is this all too complicated to understand?
