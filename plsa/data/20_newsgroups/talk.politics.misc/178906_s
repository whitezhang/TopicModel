 i *cannot* *believe* i am posting in this thread, but what
 the hell, he asked for it.
 
 i had sort of the same reaction myself when i was first realizing
 i was bi.  "so what, >90% of everyone else is straight, i'd never
 end up with a guy anyway."  as several people on soc.bi pointed
 out to me, this is true only if you find partners (for relationships
 or just for sex) in primarily straight circles.  nowadays with gay
 culture quite visible in major cities and such, you can easily
 find yourself in an overwhelmingly queer social circle if you so
 choose.  (about half my friends are bi, and that's just from
 hanging out in the science fiction club and going to ucbu once a
 week, it's not as if i have to go out of my way and hang out in
 bars or something.)
 
 so the available pool for dates can be the same size.  unless of
 course you're trying to date a random sample of the us population.
 
 as for promiscuity, i've traded email with clayton on the topic,
 and he still doesn't seem to want to admit that yes, gay males
 are sometimes forced to resort to anonymous sex because they're
 closeted and can't afford to be seen in a permanent relationship.
 or that part of the promiscuity is because of the messed-up gender
 roles in our society, and when males are dating males and they've
 *all* been trained to be the aggressor in sex, there's going to
 be more sex.  or that what's "dysfunctional", what's "screwed up"
 is societal attitudes, not gay sexuality, and that's what 
 encourages deviant behavior in gay males.
 
 (also note that just because someone's had 200 sex partners 
 doesn't mean they're promiscuous.  yes, it sounds ridiculous,
 but it's quite possible for someone to go through a heavily
 closeted phase in which they have lots of anonymous sex with
 strangers, and then come out, start forming real relationships,
 and be monogamous or nearly so...)
