 once again, mark, you don't specify the means through which the government
 is to be prevented from becoming the tool of business interests.  as a 
 left-wing, big government, conventional liberal, i'm just as willing as
 you are to vote against anti-competitive regulations that favor auto
 dealers.  
 
 but what i hear from libertarians is a desire to limit incumbents' terms,
 to weaken government by eliminating its power to enforce antitrust laws,
 and a desire to eliminate legislator's pay.  each strikes me as a 
 particularly ineffective way to insure that auto dealers and other special
 interests cannot influence public policy.  in fact, they seem clearly
 designed to accomplish the opposite.
