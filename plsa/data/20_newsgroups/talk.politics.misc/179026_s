 of course, then there's the other side. an article in yesterday's atlanta
 journal stated that there are many scientists who have misgivings that the 
 data being used to determine whether or not global warming is occuring is
 faulty. the point that the article made is that all long term temperature
 dataa collected has been in urban areas, and that any heat rise can be
 attributed to the growth and urbanization of the area. they called it
 the "asphalt temperature trend". we have no real long term data on remote
 areas, such as the middle of the amazon rain forest, or the top of mt. everest
 or the gobi desert, for that matter. an accompanying article mentioned that
 a group of scientists at nasa had developed a method for using a satellite
 to collect temperature data globally, and that preliminary results showed
 a slight downward trend attributed to the mt pinatubo eruption. it went
 on to say that even with the current downward trend, there appeared to be
 *no* change in global temperatures using trend prediction methods for at
 least the next 50 years.
 
 i can quote the article verbatim if you like..
