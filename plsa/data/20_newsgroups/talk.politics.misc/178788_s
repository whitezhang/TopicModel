       frankly, i'm sick of being lied to.  it was bad before clinton,
       and now it's worse.  here, listen to ricks' ( fbi ) words,
       one-half hour before the fire:
 
        " come out with your hands up.  this matter is now over. "
 
       now, i hear ricks ( and reno ) claiming that this was just 
       "another incremental step in pressure".  more bullshit.
 
       why did they pick 6 am  monday morning?  so nobody would
       notice.  so everyone would be busy at work, starting a new
       week.  more bullshit.
 
       did the fbi hold back fire engines?  here, let me paraphrase
       sessions"
 
        " no, we didn't hold back the engines.  we had them on 
          stand-by, blah, balh, blah...   and so, to protect the
          the fireman, we didn't allow the engines to enter until
          it was safe "
 
      what the fuck is this?   " yes, we have no bananas? "
 
      what the hell kind of double-talk is this?  no, we didn't, so
      blah, balh, we did.    huh?
 
      i watched this.
 
      clinton takes responsibility, "even though" it wasn't his 
      decision.  more bullshit.  does he, or does he not, take
      responsibility?!   no more "even though" bullshit.  yes.
      or no.  
 
      christ.
