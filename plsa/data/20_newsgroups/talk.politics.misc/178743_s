    on the other hand, rush made an interesting point: the democrats ran
    one of their best campaigns in years against a pathetic republican and
    a paranoiac and still only pulled 43% of the vote, lost 10 seats in
    the house, and gained 0 seats in the senate.  1994 might be pretty
    interesting.
 
 clueless of the world, take heart!  57% of the electorate is willing
 to vote for "a pathetic republican and a paranoiac"!!
