   correct.  you'd have to be very unfamiliar with us history to 
   think that we have substantially fewer rights today than in 
   in 1932.  the police could generally get away with a lot more
   in those days, there were few citizens and media "watchdog" 
   organizations, no "miranda" rulings, and women, blacks, gays,
   and other such groups had very few right indeed.  moreover
   censorship of media and similar artistic expression was rampant
   at that time (think about "banned in boston" or the hays
   commission).  
 
   my comments were directed against those who see these sorts
   of incidents as proof that rights as we know them are about to 
   vanish.
