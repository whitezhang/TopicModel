 i would doubt any civil rights case would be in order for the point that you
 mentioned.  even if it were possible, i think it is a bad idea since it smacks
 real strongly of double jeopardy.  a civil case for damages is fine since that
 is a trial that would proceed regardless of the first.  i think a bad precedent
 has already been set in the king trial in l.a. and something like this would
 make it worse.  regardless of how bad anybody feels about this decision, it
 must stand that charges of assault were not not proven against the three
 marines and that's how it should stand.
