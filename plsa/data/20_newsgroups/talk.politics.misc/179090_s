 it was absurd, all right, but no different from the weekly "so then, do you
 believe that the right to keep and bear arms means everybody can own nuclear 
 bombs?" posting in t.p.g.  sorry i missed the crossposting.

 only if you believe that the constitutional protection is limited to
 "sporting" arms.  oddly enough, the supreme court has ruled exactly the
 opposite -- the second protects militia arms, but not necessarily sporting 
 ones.
 
 speaking of absurd, the subsequent argument is usually, "isn't owning
 militia arms a little outdated?  i mean, who really thinks they are 
 going to need these things to take on government troops?"  
 
 but strangely enough, we aren't hearing much of that argument this week.
