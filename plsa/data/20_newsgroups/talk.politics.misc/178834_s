 	going to pay $17 / month?
 
 	when only 1.2% of the population would pay extra taxes?
 
 	remember when a few of us predicted that it wasn't true?  :)
 	remember the inaugural?   dancing and singing!  liberation
 	at last!  
 
 	well, figure *this* out:
 
 	5% vat, estimated to raise $60-100 billion per year ( on cnn )
 	work it out, chum...
 
 	     $60,000,000,000  /  125,000,000 taxpayers = $480 / year
 
         but, you exclaim, " i'll get free health care! "
 	but, i exclaim, " no, you won't! "
 
 	this is only for that poor 37 million who have none.  not for
 	you, chum. :)  that comes later.
 
 	add in the estimates of the energy tax costs - $300-500 / year
 
 	plus, all that extra "corporate and rich" taxes that will 
 	trickle down, and what do you have?
 
 	$1,000 / year, just like i said two months ago.
 
 	and, the best part?   you don't get anything for it.
 
 	deficit is still projected to rise at same rate it's  been
 	rising at, by clinton's own estimates.  and this assumes that
 	his plan will work!
 
 	i mean, come on, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to see
 	that in another 2 or 3 years, we're getting another whopping
 	tax increase, because the deficit will still be growing 
 	faster than the economy.
 
 	all clinton is doing, is moving us to a higher diving board.
 
         face it.  clinton is bush x 2.  in four more years, our
 	country will be completely bankrupt, and your children's
 	future, so oft mentioned by pal bill, will be gone.
 
 	and those of you still deluding yourselves will be faced
 	with the guilt.
 
 	well, <glancing at watch>, gotta go.  i want to be out of
 	here by noon.  got an appointment at the lake.  no tax
 	there, yet.
 
 	:)
