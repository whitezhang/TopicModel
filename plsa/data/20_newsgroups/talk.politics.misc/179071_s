 sorry, but i'd have to differ.  the canadian-bashing wrt to the health 
 insurance system is largely with little evidence or prompting.  having
 kept up with this debate on the net for some months, just about all the
 criticism of the canadian system has misquoted or misinterpreted even
 the anti-canadian propaganda put out by the american insurance industry
 and the ama.  
 
 in a few cases, such as mr. case, the critiques are well-reasoned and
 worthy of response.  most others are misinformed, illogical,
 or just plain dumb.  i don't think the same can be said of the "american
 proponents" of the canadian system, much less of the canadian proponents.
