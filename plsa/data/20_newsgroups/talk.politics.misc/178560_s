 evidence given for her prostitute status, besides the admittedly 
 questionable claim of the man on trial included:
 
 1. prior employment in a number of massage parlors, with women who
 claimed that she worked as a prostitute;
 
 2. walking around a truck stop at 4:00 am wearing a lace miniskirt,
 a halter top, and no underwear of any sort;
 
 3. not having a purse or other i.d. with her.
 
 not enough to convict her, but enough to create reasonable doubt
 whether a rape actually took place, or theft of services.
 
 are you just ignorant, or lying again?

 the accounts on the evening news indicated that they claimed self-
 defense, and the judge agreed that they were so operating.
