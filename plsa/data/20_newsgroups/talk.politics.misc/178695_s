 let me try to drag this discussion back to the original issues.  as
 i've noted before, i'm not necessarily disputing the benefits of 
 eliminating anti-competitive legislation with regard to auto dealers,
 barbers, etc.  one need not, however, swallow the entire libertarian
 agenda to accomplish this end.  just because one grants the benefits of
 allowing anyone who wishes to cut hair to sell his/her services without
 regulation does not mean that the same unregulated barbers should be 
 free to bleed people as a medical service without government intervention.  
 (as some/many libertarians would argue.)  
 
 on a case by case basis, the cost/benefit ratio of government regulation
 is obviously worthwhile.  the libertarian agenda, however, does not call
 for this assessment.  it assumes that the costs of regulation (of any
 kind) always outweigh its benefits.  this approach avoids all sorts of 
 difficult analysis, but it strikes many of the rest of us as dogmatic, 
 to say the least.
 
 i have no objection to an analysis of medical care, education, 
 national defense or local police that suggests a "free market" can provide
 a more effective, efficient means of accomplishing social objectives
 than is provided through "statist" approaches.   with some notable
 exceptions, however, i do not see such nitty-gritty, worthwhile 
 analysis being carried out by self-professed libertarians.
