 tsk. surely you don't wish for the democrats to destroy our beloved country
 just so your party can get some trivial political advantage? that's rather
 a petty way to think. (not that this pettiness doesn't extend all the way
 to the u.s. senate, i've noticed...)
 
 while bush was president, i kept hoping and praying that he'd wise up. i
 couldn't stand the man, but i wish he'd done a decent job; if so, we might
 not be in the mess we are now, and that would be a small price to pay for
 suffering through another term of republican control. similarily, you should
 be hoping and praying that clinton does a good job. even if you're certain
 he won't.
