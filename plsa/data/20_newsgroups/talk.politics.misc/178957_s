 aviation week march 15 1993 p.48
 
 "the cbo estimates that matching the capability of 100 c-17s would
 require 70 c-5s at a total cost of $14.4 billion. this option is still
 more than $10 billion cheaper than completing the c-17 program, which
 the cbo estimates will cost $24.7 billion."
 
 sorry, i was nine billion off. the c-5s would be ten billion cheaper.
