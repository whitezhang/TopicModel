    i don't remember the article that you removed so i can't comment on it.
    what i can comment on though is your response.
 
    do you really believe that what you wrote is sufficient to refute
    the article?  do have any facts in addition to your opinion?
 
 no one has time to chase down every rumor that gets printed
 in the national enquirer or whatever.  the point is to wait
 and see if the assertions of the (rather bizarre) original
 post will be corroborated in any way.  perhaps they will.
 the recent posts of the rather bizarre original poster speak
 for themselves.
