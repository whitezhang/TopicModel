 ok phil, you're right. so far the "evidence" suggests that nixon was a victim
 of overzealous underlings and kennedy was a womanizing disgust-o-blob with
 a dash of megalomania. after crushing the cia and fbi who's to say kennedy 
 wouldn't have created his own version of american friendly fascism?
 
 unfortunately however, we don't have all the evidence. so far this nation's
 citizens have been privy to about 12 hours of the total 4,000 hours of nixon's
 tapes. what's on the rest of those babies? some archivists have alluded that
 there is "evidence" to suggest that nixon and his cronies, including george
 bush, were aware of the plot to murder kennedy before he was shot in dallas.
 
 ask your local d.a. what the charges are for the above crime.
 
 
 and so i must ask you, phil me putz, when all this shit finally comes out
 when you and i are old men, i would appreciate the privilege of sticking a pole
 up your ass and parading you down main street with a sign on your chest:
 
 "i was an apologist for the american fascist regime circa 1944 -- 2010"
 
 (how's that for a lovely brecht-ian image:-)
 
 
 there, that ought to get a reaction. unless i'm in his killfile this week...
