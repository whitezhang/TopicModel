 while i agree with much of this post, one point seems mis-directed...

 and when controlled for usage of oil, gas, etc. energy efficiency in
 all countries turns out to be identical :-)
 
 to take population density as an example, one way to reduce energy
 used in transportation is surely to concentrate the population in
 dense urban areas (though this might, of course, have other
 disadvantages, possibly even relating to energy use).  the fact that
 japan is forced to do this by the nature of the country, while the us
 is not, does not mean that people in the us would be unable to do this
 if given sufficient motive to conserve energy.
