 are!  such arguments are basically worthless, imho.  would it 
 really matter if it were millions of people who are regularly
 denied access to housing, employment, and personal security or
 even only one?  
     as for death threats, i happen to know from personal
 experience that gay people are far more likely to receive
 them based on political veiws or even personal philosophies
 related to the issue of sexual orientation than are heterosex
 uals. not a week goes by that i personally or one of my friends
 is not physically or verbally harrassed for even appearing to
 be gay.  
      everyone is garaunteed certain unalienable rights under
 our current form of government in theory, yet every day 
 gay people are victimized by their local governments, by
 the police force, and by (for the most part) an uninformed
 and ignorant public. is this democracy? i don't think so.
    a society's sense of justice is judged on the basis of
 the treatment of the people who make up that society.
 all of those people. and yes, that includes gays, lesbians,
 and bisexuals whose "crimes" have no victims, and who
 are as varied and diverse as the society of wich they are
 a part.
