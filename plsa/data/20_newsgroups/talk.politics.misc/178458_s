      what kind of brainless clod doesn't understand the difference 
      between a "proposed bill, blocked in congress" and an "executive
      order, issued by clinton, and crammed down our throats".
 
      
   here, let me give a remedial course in thinking:
 
      in order to create the appearance of low interest rates, uncle sam
      has shifted his debt from long-term to short-term securities.
 
      in effect, uncle sam has transformed the federal goverment into
      one giant s&l, waiting to blow.
 
      short-term rates rise --->  interest payments on deficit rise --->
      uncle sammy has to borrow more ---->  causing short-term rates to rise.
 
      uncle sammy gets caught in a positive feedback loop.  his options:
 
        i) raise taxes a truly unimaginable amount
        ii)  make truly unimaginable spending cuts
 
     results of i):  large numbers of pissed-off citizens
     results of ii): large numbers of pissed-off citizens
 
 
     uncle sammy has thoughtfully taken the initiative to pre-empt the use
     of communication newtworks to foster a nation-wide, grassroots
     uprising.
