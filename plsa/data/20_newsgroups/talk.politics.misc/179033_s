 steve i'm glad to see that you abandoned the preamble thing.  what; did
 you do a word search to find welfare somewhere else in the constitution?
 
 [my comments and paraphrases in brackets]
 
 article i section 8:  [in some ways the guts of the constitution]
 
 the congress shall have the power:
 
 1. to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises, 
        to pay the debts [indebtedness as defined in the document]
        and provide for the common defence [defence as precisely defined]
        and general welfare [as defined through the document, mostly in ways
                            [that limit the government.]
          of the united states; [but the above taxes shall be uniform through-
                                [out the u.s.]
 
     [so far the congress has been given the power to collect taxes uniformly]
 
     [ then ... ]
 
 2.  to borrow money [...]
 3.  to regulate commerce with foreign nations, [interstate and indian tribes]
 4.  to [do uniform naturalization and bankruptcies]
 5.  to coin money, regulate the value thereof, and [etc.]
 6.  to [punish counterfeiters]
 7.  to establish post offices and post roads
 8.  to [provide patents and copyrights]
 9.  to constitute tribunals inferior to the supreme court;
 10. to define and punish piracies and [etc.]
 11. to declare war, [and etc.]
 12. to raise and support armies,[but for no longer than two years at a stretch]
 13. to provide and maintain a navy, [notice no time limit on this one]
 14. to [make the rules for the army and navy]
 15. to provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws [etc.]
 16. to provide for [training of the army except for some state stuff]
 17. to exercise exclusive legislation [in d.c]
 18. to make all laws [necessary to execute the foregoing "powers"].
 
 your original instinct was right.  looking to other nations for precedents
 that support an expansive liberal agenda is much easier than looking to the
 slim pickins found in the constitution.
