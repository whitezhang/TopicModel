 the difference in the litigation environment is reflected in the fees.
 
 lack of defensive medicine and near-absence of malpractice is really
 why we spend less using the most expensive approach of pure insurance
 in canada (along with france and germany) without hmo's --- the nyt
 has admitted that malpractice insurance fees are an order of magnitude
 lower in canada but doctors take-home pay is almost equal to american
 doctors; also, minimal bureaucracy 'cos the system is so-o-o simple
 (early march).
 
 part of the deal for using the all-insurance approach like the french
 and germans do (hey, why don't they criticize france and germany?  is
 it because too many people take french and german in college to make
 the accusations stick? (-;) was to preserve the doctors independance.
 since the provincial wings of the cma are the ones that go to bat when
 the fee schedule hikes are presented, the politically-bent doctors
 were just cackling when they realized the cma would grow in strength
 rather than diminish, especially when unopposed unlike in socialized
 medicine approaches like britain's national health service.

 for non-life threatening things, market arguments adequately cover why
 certain procedures are in scarcer demand.  i have md friends who can't
 make a living as specialists back in manitoba not due to the insurance
 rates but because they won't get enough customers -- the cma medical
 monopoly's grip on doctors licencing (as in the us) aside -- so they
 must move to larger places.  however, this does not refute debunking
 of waiting lines for urgent and routine care, as has been done in the
 u.s. by consumers reports, health policy studies cited by prof. dennis
 e. shea on usenet, cnn, nyt, etc.
 
 doug fierro has posted a nyt article from 3 weeks ago about canada's
 health insurance approach, on talk.politics.medicine.  there is one
 small error in the article: not all of our hospitals are private.

 of course, the one thing to note is that in the canada/france/germany
 case, private insurance *offloaded* the basic coverage to the public
 sector.  they realized they were keeping low-risk/high-profit extra
 insurance for things like private/semi-private rooms (vs. ward
 accomodation), dental, glasses, etc. for corporate or personal
 benefits, they'll have nothing to do with you if you want to be
 covered for basic care.
 
 at that point, they wouldn't even consider a "voucher" approach
 to broker the universal coverage and sell policies to make up
 the difference in the federal guidelines and market stuff.

 it is "free" in that there are no deductibles nor copayments (two
 things which i advocate to make the canadian insurance look more like
 real health insurance -- which actually it is).  i know that when
 working in alberta, ontario and quebec, i was aware that i was paying
 for health insurance - e.g., in toronto, ohip fees were listed on my
 pay stub; manitoba did not collect at paycheque time, but only
 annually at income tax time (built into the tax rate).  only fiscal
 naifs will proclaim that it's free, along with the canadian left for
 that is part of their brainwashing agenda.
 
 the french do have copayments, though.  france magazine's summer 
 1992 edition has a fantastic presentation of their basic insurance
 coverage, including a sample chart of copayment percentages.  for 
 1-30 days, you're covered for 80% of the public hospital rate, 100%
 afterward.  with extra private insurance, you can get into a private
 hospital and be covered for any differences beyond the public hospital
 rate.  the public insurance covers 100% beyond 30 days, or the same
 cash amount for a private hospital and the difference is paid
 out-of-pocket or according to your supplementary private insurance.
 over 2/3rds of french have some form of extra private insurance.  so,
 the other 30% of health costs in europe are out of private funds, not
 gleaned from other taxes.  the gdp figures are combined public and
 private expenditures for total outlay using the same methods that
 yield the 13-14% figure for the u.s.

 health insurance does exist in canada and in western europe, its
 just that it doesn't cover basic care.  you can opt out in canada
 and germany, but you'll have to go uninsured as a result because
 there are too few other people that do so --- i.e., no market.
 
 when private insurance realized how much money they'd make without the
 risks involved in basic insurance (e.g., neurosurgery) versus deluxe
 amenities (e.g., having to call granada tv to replace a rental set on
 the fritz in someone's private hospital room), they started to pat
 themselves on the back for their social responsibility.  in quebec
 last spring, a consortium of private insurers publicly warned against
 any thoughts of privatizing routine, low cost parts of that province's
 public health insurance plan.
