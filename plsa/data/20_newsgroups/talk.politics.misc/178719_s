 	i think the problem here is that mrs. reno strikes me
 ( after watching nightline last night ) as a person who is incapable
 of understanding or dealing with a great number of things.
 
      
      fact is that bill and hillary had to clear the decks for their 
      "dream package" of "free stuff" for the american people (..their
      subjects...). they couldn't have a wild card floating around while
      they and robert  "the fifth reich" reich plan the glorious "peoples
      democracy". that wouldn't fit in with their vision of themselves or 
      whatyou should be "progressively" working for... after all, 
      who do you think your'e working for... and if a handful of peasant 
      children have to die for the glorious vision of "the year of the child"
      in america, its a small price to pay. let them eat cake....
