    i am glad that you recognize that people should not engage in denial
 and repression, and should acknowledge such. the united states, with
 its people, have recognized that repression has taken place, with the
 loss and outright abrogation of civil liberties and constitutional
 protections of citizens. this recognition has taken the form of the
 civil rights law (let's just discuss the federal level for now), such
 as 18 usc 241 et. seq., 42 usc 1981 et. seq, et. al.
    with this recognition of repression, at times manifested in the
 form of collective guilt, i want people to recognize denial. 
 though it can be said that white people numerically commit more
 crimes in the united states, because white people are a majority,
 it can also be said that black people commit a disproportionate
 amount of crime in the united states, in their relation to their
 numbers in population.
    my views are out of experiences when i was a police officer
 in a large metropolitan area, and of a citizen. unless people
 account for their behavior, and for the behavior of their immediate
 community, nothing will improve.
