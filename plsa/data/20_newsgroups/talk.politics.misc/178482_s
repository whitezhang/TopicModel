 the mother church of jerusalem disappeared when the romans took the city.
 despite some pious legends, the evidence seems to be that the members of
 the church died fighting the romans during what they believed to be the
 last days. we know that certain apostles had nicknames connecting them to
 jewish terrorist groups. for the average inhabitant of the roman empire
 (especially after centuries of political instability and terror), the
 roman policies in palestine were heartily approved of. when studied with a
 knowledge of cult psychology, acts is eerily familiar, especially today.
