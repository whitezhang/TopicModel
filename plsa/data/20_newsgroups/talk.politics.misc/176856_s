 unless i've got my notes mixed up, 939 f.2d 499 comes close to this.
 regular guy.  blue-collar worker at a regular company.  hauled into
 court.  convicted.  appeals to 7th circuit.  makes all the right
 arguments (his brief is cited by mr. teel as an example of a
 "winning" brief).  shot down, 3-zip by the 7th circuit.  appeals to
 the supreme court.  and...
 
 ...certiorari denied.  defendant goes to jail.  oh well.
