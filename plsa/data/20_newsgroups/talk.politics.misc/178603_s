 hmm...  tell me, did you go to the mickey mouse school of logic?  you have
 just stated that there are not many homosexuals as kinsey reported in his
 survey (and the surveys of the kinsey institute since).  then you say that
 the reason many young people are promiscuous is because homosexuals form
 a large part of that group, or there are some homosexuals whose lives 
 consist of having sex, with no gaps for eating &c.  using *your* logic
 it would seem to suggest that on average gay men have about 2000 partners each
 a week!  try to think through your arguments carefully.  or then again, not,
 because i like to laugh every now and then.

 hence the argument cannot be resolved using this data.  next point, please.

 this depends on the premise that there are only three types of behaviour: gay, bi
 and hetero.  this has yet to be proved.  see an earlier post about the kinsey
 institute of grading.  this, although rough, seems more logical.  also you use
 "this would show", defining a fact and not an assumption.  again, back your 
 statements or shut up.
