 	excuse me? quality? as in grade a co2 and grade b co2? i may not have
 this quite right but i was under the impression that co2 was co2.

 	a) there is no reason to believe this system is inherently stable- 
 the ice ages occured without any help from humans.
 
 	b) the point was that the human contribution of co2 and other 
 greenhouse gasses is insignificant and it won't really make a difference if
 we make more or less.
 
 	c) what overwhelming data? i see lots of 'projections' of the future,
 which is fascinating, considering they can't predict the weather two weeks
 in advance.
