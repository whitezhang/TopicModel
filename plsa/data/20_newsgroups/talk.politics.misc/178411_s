 so if this study is proved wrong then it proves that heterosexuals
 are liars? unlike the propaganda spouted by the far right the ten
 percent figure was backed up by the best study available at the time.
 its hardly certain that this new study is correct since it hasn't
 even been out for enough time for any double checking to happen.

 of course if they had found 10% then it would be invalid because it
 was funded by planned parenthood :)

 even if its "only" one million the point still stands. even getting
 1/6th of a given population in one place would be unprecidented. 
 if even 1 million show up in dc it will raise serious doubts about
 this study, or indicate a resolve unprecidented in human history.

 he isn't the target of the march, nor do presidents often speak at
 civil rights marchs (of course it would have been nice). however
 the republicans and conservative democrats would do well to take
 notice.

 this is quite amusing. obviously you know nothing about the history
 of math.
