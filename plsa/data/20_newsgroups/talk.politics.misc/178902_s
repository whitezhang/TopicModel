 that people are at risk and that some die during a hostage situation might
 be considered an acceptable scenario in storming a compound. 
 
 when everyone dies (save for nine people), including twenty children, the 
 outcome must be considered a failure.
 
 now was the failure due to unforseeable circumstances, incompetence, or
 negligence?  from the double talk and multiple stories i've seen on the news
 coming from the fbi and reno i find "it was an honest mistake" hard to swallow
 
 let's hope they get their stories straight for the second round of questions.
