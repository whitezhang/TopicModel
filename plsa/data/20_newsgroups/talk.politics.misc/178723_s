 good point, brett.  it might merely be proof that basic health care
 markets operate differently, with certain nonmarket phenomenom that
 the private sector can't handle well (like armies vs. warlords). in
 that respect, the effects on american society vs. canadian/european
 society might also be different.

 good point again.  blue cross in the u.s. is quite convoluted compared
 to the canadian and german insurance funds, which have a minimal
 organization to coordinate it.  if anything, bureaucracy now needs to
 be built up in canada to combat fraud, such as americans crossing the
 border individually to use insurance cards borrowed from friends and
 relatives or using phony domestic addresses, or fraud rings stealing
 them in blocks.  our private practices are now recording insurance
 account numbers, both public insurance and private insurance, which
 most have never bothered to do before on assumption of an honour 
 system.
