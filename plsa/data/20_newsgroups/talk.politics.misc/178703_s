 you miss the point.  a lot more negotiation is needed to convince women
 to have sex because there is a big taboo about women being free with 
 their sex.  many of the women i know would do almost anything rather
 than be known as a slag, slut or whore.
 
 with men however there is *status* attached to being able to fuck 
 constantly.  and with gay men, where both partners can prove status
 through their constant verility then you are going to get a situation
 where there is a lot of sex.
 
 the difference is between het sex being rationed as a valuable commodity
 and gay sex being virtually unlimited due to the *appetites* of men.
 
 straights suffer a bottle neck where women are concerned, gay men who
 do not experience this bottle neck go to excess.
