 [lots of good points re mormons in the us]
 
 the founding fathers of the us were hardly great on religious freedoms. at
 least one history i have read formed the opinion that they left for the
 us not to practice religious freedom but to practice religious intolerance.
 
 i don't think that my lot were particularly mainstream in those days either.
 mind you like the budhists i somehow doubt the quakers would ever form a
 militant religious fanatic movement.

 wooa there!!! i have a classic car. if i buy a body pannel for $300 after
 being told that it is genuine bl and discover that it is a non original
 copy value $50 i get real pissed. if i can get the genuine article i will
 pay a lot for it because not only will it cost much less to fit (probably
 meaning that its cheaper overall) but it also means that the car is worth
 a hell of a lot more. even on a twenty year old car there is a big
 difference in a baddly restored car where much of the work needs to be
 redone and a concours classic. i got mine for 600 quid because it was
 in a shitty state from bad repairs. if it had been well repaired it would
 be worth a hell of a lot more.
 
 are you really saying that ford and gm are having companies beat up for
 infringing copyright on parts they don't make? i find that very hard to
 beleive. in the uk they are very sympathetic - ford recently dug out
 the cortina mk i body press so that some company could make a few more.
 bl does amazing stuff, they kept the entire assembly line for the mgs
 and helped set up a company to remanufacture new bodyshells.
 
 there is a hell of a difference between remanufacturing and passing off.
 the former i can't see anyone trying to stop. most car cos see classic
 vehicles as a damn good ad for them. the latter though is fraud. if a
 part is described to me as real gm and money taken under that assurance
 when they know it ain't gm that's fraud.

 it really is odd. i post saying that the us govt does appauling things
 under regan, bush etc. in foreign policy. the right get really pissed. 
 then when i point out that nobody seems to have posted a better suggestion
 as to how to solve the waco affair they come with the govt paranoia
 bit. it's like they reserve their ability to criticise the govt for 
 when they feel their interests are threatened but don't give a cuss about
 anyone else.
 
 you should revers that attitude. when your interests are threatened its
 way too late. you have to challenge the govt when it is attacking
 someone else's interests. 
 
 that does not mean however that you can start calling the govt the 
 equivalent of the nazi party on the basis of an unfortunate outcome
 in a hostage situation.
