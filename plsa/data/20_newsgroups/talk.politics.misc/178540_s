 you seem to be saying that a limited government will provide more
 opportunities for private interests to use it to pursue their own
 agendas, and asking libertarians to prove that this will not happen.
 while i can't offer such a proof, it seems pretty damn plausible that
 if the government does not regulate a particular area, it cannot become
 a tool of private interests to pursue their own agendas in that area.
 i rather suspect that it's the sort of government we have now that is
 more likely to become such a tool, and that it is such a tool in many
 instances.

 i suspect that this is because "improvement in the human condition" as
 you define it is not the primary goal of libertarianism, and would not
 be the primary goal of a libertarian government.  my impression of
 libertarianism is that its primary goal is the elimination of
 government coercion except in a very limited cases.
