 there are two things at work here ... the public insurance is very
 wide in what it will cover, as the amortization is also universal.
 no private plan can boast of a plan that fits a gaussian curve ...
 and as our private sector has discovered, they're better off not
 offering insurance coverage that their customers are going to use.

 the alternative to the system is no system at all (patients opted out,
 doctors opted out, or both).  but that only for insurance ... and you
 can't force a private insurance company to sell you a plan that they
 will not offer.  and remember that the actual health care is delivered
 by private entities who collect from the public insurance voluntarily.
 again, they can't force a private entity to spring to life to pay them.
 
 plus, there is the matter of culture and values ... i'm basically
 anti-tax and anti-government, by canadian standards ... yet i can't
 bring myself to make the same arguments as you do, despite that i
 understand where you're coming from.  up north, you're so much more
 likely to find someone protesting taxes going to defence than health
 insurance premiums to only one fund for basic coverage ...

 yes, primarily in quebec and in alberta.  sorry, i musta lost you in

 in canada and germany, it's not mandatory.  however, it is negative
 option in that you must request the exemption.  that the private
 sector will not provide private basic coverage if offered the option
 (as in the quebec case) tells me something about what they know ...

 yes, but part of the reason is that our most of our markets are
 too small to sustain many specialists, sometimes not even one, so
 you pretty well have to be a gp to get paid.  and if you do get
 the training, the doctors monopoly might block your getting of a
 licence because there is already someone in the business and who
 cannot fill his/her appointment book.  that we have a cma doctors
 monopoly is something that the american ama-oriented medical lobby
 never tells you down here ...

 no, i respect people who do specialties (okay, all of my md friends
 are (-;) but there's the question of our small market dynamics up
 north ... if anything, that our private doctors and hospitals sell
 their services to americans to generate more business will inflate
 their effective population served, and thus make some specialties
 finally viable (i.e., there will be enough customers).  we just do
 not have enough sick canadians in absolute numbers otherwise.

 uh ... germany basically uses our method, with their many sickness
 funds.  the competition is fake if it exists at all, because they're
 all interlinked.  look in der spiegel or stern (my girlfriend is in
 our german department  and her uncle is a private practicioner in
 saarbrucken) ... no ads for health insurance.  while canada organizes
 by province, germany organizes the paperwork around big corporations
 and regional offices.   but remember that we have provinces that have
 the same population as some major german corporations.  germans have
 public health insurance, just that it is brokered by smaller entities
 (actually, brokerage of basic by private firms who'll sell extra
 insurance to fill out their policies, sort of a voucher system,
 was one of the first ideas floated in canada, too).
 
 remember, the germans don't have hmo's ... a telling sign, 'cos
 rochester does and they're also a company town.

 i'll have to let a canadian md jump in to verify that claim, but
 i've come to learn to suspect anything in the american press about
 our "system".  if much or some of it were true, you'd have to take
 us for idiots for tolerating it.  and given that our insurance was
 installed during a period when there were only liberal and tory
 governments federally and provincially, and the socialists are still
 chafing, they would've pressed for real socialized medicine to fix
 things ... think about it.  after all, we are using the u.s. as a
 metric to make comparison ... both for keeping-up-with-the-joneses
 as for confirming that we did something right.
