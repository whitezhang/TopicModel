   do we want to 'create jobs'? or do we want jobs created that are productive
   in our supply/demand economy? if your answer is the former then we can
   just round up all jobless people and pay them to build sandcastles in
   the desert. if you answer the latter then i fail to see how another
   bureaucracy produces anything.
