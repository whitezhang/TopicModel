 ok, i admit i have no hard data on this. why don't you help me with this?
 if you would compile a commented list of all grants, un-repaid loans (if any),
 and direct aid, i'd be very interested to see it. if you could give me
 references from, for example, congressional budget authorization hearings,
 i could look them up here and i'd be happy to post a verification of your
 data.
 
 otherwise, i'll try my hand at this, but unfortunately i won't have sufficient
 time available until the end of this month, so the results would be delayed.
 
 let me know if you're interested in doing this.

               where we could have said -- no. but somehow we missed it.
