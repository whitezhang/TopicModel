 
 yesterday, the fbi was saying that at least three of the bodies had
 gunshot wounds, indicating that they were shot trying to escape the
 fire.  today's paper quotes the medical examiner as saying that there
 is no evidence of gunshot wounds in any of the recovered bodies.
 
 at the beginning of this siege, it was reported that while koresh
 had a class iii (machine gun) license, today's paper quotes the
 government as saying, no, they didn't have a license.
 
 today's paper reports that a number of the bodies were found with
 shoulder weapons next to them, as if they had been using them while
 dying -- which doesn't sound like the sort of action i would expect
 from a suicide.
 
 our government lies, as it tries to cover over its incompetence
 and negligence.  why should i believe the fbi's claims about
 anything else, when we can see that they are lying?
 
 this system of government is beyond reform.
