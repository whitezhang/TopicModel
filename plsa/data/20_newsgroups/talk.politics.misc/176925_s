 blacks have the same (+- 2%) crime report rate, arrest rate, and incarceration
 rate for violent crimes.
 
 so i doubt that for violent crimes, that there is any inherent bias mechanism
 present.
 
 there is a wider discrepancy for all crimes for blacks wrt to 3 categories.
 
 interestingly enough, the discrepancy is the largest in the southern
 united states -- where blacks are incarcerated well below the average in
 the rest of the united states! which points to an anti-bias-against wrt
 blacks.
 
 in any case, for violent crimes and burglary and drug selling, blacks are
 reported 53%, arrested 44%, and are present in jails/prisons 47% (1988).
 
 considering that 12% of the population is black, 6% are black males, and
 some percentage of that is out of the high/low age groups, we do have a
 situation where (if i remember my old calculations right) 4% of the
 population commits almost half of the really nasty crimes.
 
 blacks with similar histories (crime) to whites get the same sentences,
 except in the south, where they receive around 20% less on paper!!

 these opinions are mine, and you can't have 'em! (but i'll rent 'em cheap ...)
