 steve,  you're the one who suggested that a failed government should be an 
 ideal proving ground,  i never felt that way in the first place.  quite the 
 contrary,  i think a better proving ground would be someplace that already
 had a governemnt that would prevent outright acts of agression,  yet had a
 strong spirit of individualism and initiative.  someplace like... texas :-)
