 	if you have something reasoned and intelligent to say then you should
 post. if all you can do is rant and rave- save it.

 	true conservatism is cutting spending and taxes. it's a matter of
 debate just how succesful the last few presidents have been at that.

 	i hear it again and again, and i've noticed far more often from 
 liberals than anyone else- "if you don't agree with me you are close-minded"
 	look who's talking. i suggest you take a look at your post. i see
 nothing but unfair and unsubstantiated generalizations. it suggests that the
 author is anything but open-minded.
 	next time you feel like posting something like this- save it for 
 somebody who cares.
