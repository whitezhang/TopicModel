 hmmm.  human gestation period is something like 39 weeks.  that means
 third trimester abortions are those done after 26 weeks.  in consulting
 a 1989 world almanac, i see that 1% of abortions in 1983 were done at 
 21 weeks or more.  that's about 1268 abortions in 1983 after 21 weeks.
 unless the number of abortions performed has dropped dramatically, or
 a lot of abortions are done between 21 and 26 weeks, i think you are
 wrong.
 
 by the way, roe v. wade allowed states to adopt very, very broad
 prohibitions on third-trimester abortions, but some states, such as
 california, declined to do so.  it was reported* that what finally 
 stopped third trimester elective abortions in the bay area wasn't law, 
 but that the only hospital doing them ran out of nurses, then doctors,
 willing to do them.  not surprisingly, the bay area now chapter was
 terribly upset about this.
 
 i remain pro-choice, but when pro-choicers compare abortion in a
 clinic to a religious ritual in a church, you have to start wondering
 a bit if the pro-life criticism of abortion as modern human sacrifice
 doesn't have a grain of truth to it.
