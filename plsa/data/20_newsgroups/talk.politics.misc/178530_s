 probably, law enforcement people (park service police and d.c. cops),
 who will use aerial photographs and extrapolate based on the
 density of the crowd in small regions.
 
 these sort of techniques derive from army intelligence and cia
 methods of estimating troop strength, and tend to be
 methodologically skewed to always come up with inflated numbers,
 so as to justify bigger budgets.
