 undoubtedly.  in fact, it is the fact that hospitals frequently compete
 for physicians rather than for patients that (in part) complicates and 
 undermines a simplistic free-market analysis of the market for medical care.

 once again, there is no evidence that this is true in regard to kidney
 dialysis.  although price controls have promoted an expansion of services
 to a much greater volume of patients, rd is still a profitable service.
 otherwise, one would expect to see evidence of rationing rather than the
 vast expansion that has occurred.

 can you spell "loss leader?"  i knew you could.  grocery stores do not
 attempt to make up the loss on an individual product by selling more of
 it.  in fact, your argument above is that kidney dialysis is a loss leader 
 for other medical treatments where lost revenue can be regained.  
 
 but the evidence does not support this contention.  rather, it appears that
 price controls have disciplined the market by forcing an expansion of
 service and development of improved lower-cost technology to provide 
 comparable benefits.  providers continue to profit from rd, they simply
 make less on each treatment than they would have if the price had 
 risen at the rate that uncontrolled treatments have.
 
 there is no question that had price controls forced the price of rd 
 substantially below its actual cost that some or all of the doomsday
 predictions of free-market advocates would have been seen -- restriction
 of service, lagging technological development, etc.  likewise, it appears
 that in the va and armed forces medical care systems, where providers 
 are government agencies, some of these negative impacts may occur.  
 (rd patients in the va system in spokane, for example, must travel to
 seattle, 300 miles away, for treatment.)  
 
 the bottom line, however, is that this is an example of government 
 intervention (of a rather extreme sort) that appears to have had beneficial
 results for both providers and consumers.  claims that "government
 bureaucracy" inevitably leads to undesirable outcomes in the marketplace
 should take such such cases into account.
