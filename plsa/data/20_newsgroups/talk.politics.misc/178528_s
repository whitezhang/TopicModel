        there are a couple of ways to look at them.  one is, "we want
 you to support this constitution, so we'll say anything that we think
 will appeal to you," or the more straightforward, "this is why we think
 what we've suggested in this constitution is a good idea."
 
        you clearly consider the former to be the primary situation.

        well, i know hamilton was a dyed in the wool monarchist, and 
 probably the authoritarian extreme to jefferson's democratic impules.
 but what would you suggest as a means of determining their opinions
 on the government if we don't consider what they wrote about the
 government?
 
        and is writing in support of something automatically "propoganda"
 to the point we must assume it is untrue or that they are saying what
 they don't believe?

        if the senate was less powerful than the house of lords, than
 we'd almost have to state that the house of representatives was also.
 (in fact, they both were, because the british government had much
 greater power than did the american system).

        i disagree.  the system is not too slow, it was simply designed to
 handle less than it has demanded that it handle.  as somebody in washington
 put it (whose name i forget), "congress has become everybody's city
 council."
 
        congress is more than capable of quick action, and has more than
 enough power and time on its hands, if it confined itself to what its
 original jurisidiction was and allowed more local autonomy.
 
        it is not a case of the system of government they created failing,
 but that it is operating under a set of conditions they specifically
 wanted to avoid.  namely, a concentration of power.  it would seem
 then that the proper thing to do is not to reduce the power of either
 house in some attempt to grease the wheels.  all you'll get then is
 a system which moves quicker to do stupid things.  it would make more
 sense to make more decisions at a local level.

        please explain to me how bush abused the veto in an "extraordinary"
 manner.

        i fail to see where any restrictions, implied or otherwise, were
 placed on the veto.  it could just as easily have been read as a means
 to put a check on democratically popular but unwise (in the executive's
 opinion) policies.  
 
        there is no limit in the constitution to the president's veto power
 regarding what a bill is for.  previous presidents have used the veto
 for any number of reasons, most usually having something to do with their
 agenda.  i am really curious how you single bush out as *the* president
 who abused vetos.

        why is it not a reasonable restriction?  because 51 senators
 is the magic holy number upon which laws must be based?  if 41 senators
 feel safe enough with their state constituencies to stand up and 
 fillibuster isn't that *enough* to indicate there's a sufficient question
 as to whether a law is a good idea or not to re-evaluate it?
 
        why one earth *should* 51% be sufficient to enact a law which
 covers 250 million people in very, very diverse places and living
 in radically different conditions?  why *shouldn't* a super-majority
 be required?
 
        any system in which the simple majority is given absolute power
 to ignore the minority then the minority *will* be ignored.  i do not
 see this as a positive thing.  and for all that i'm sure the republicans
 are looking for pork as much as the democrats, they've got some legitimate
 objections to the legislation in question.
