 no one is a "rioter" until they participate in a "riot", which is 
 unlikely to happen, now.
 
 most of the *people* in l.a. are likely to have gotten up early to 
 listen to the court announcement.
 
 >i guess we can look forward to a weekend of rioting, eh? 
 
 sorry to disappoint you, but this seems unlikely.

 i don't think he was told.
 however, his statement was still appropriate.

 jury duty is a solemn duty to be taken seriously.  it is not meant 
 to be a source of pride or instant fame.

 well, the many *people* who got up early to go to the court to hear 
 the verdict found that justice was served.  given your dire and 
 cynical predictions, i imagine that it is you who will be surprised.  :-)
