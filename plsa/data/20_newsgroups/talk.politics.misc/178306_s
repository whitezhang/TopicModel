 although i'm an atheist, the events in waco have really sickened me.  it's
 truely a sad day for religious freedom in this country.  the branch
 dividians may have been nutty (my general opinion of all religious people),
 but tax evasion and illegal possesion of firearms are certainly not grounds
 for destroying a people.
 
 the killing of the four batf agents was surey a dispicable act, but that was
 an escalation of the confrontation which the batf started.  war is bad
 precisely because of humanity's tendancy for escalation.  that principle
 applies to all cases of warfare- whether it's between nuclear superpowers,
 feuding families or fledgling religious groups and our federal govt.  why
 was warfare chosen as the course of action when patience and subtlety would
 also have worked?  why is the petty letter of the law more important than
 peoples' lives and religious beliefs?  perhaps the supposed professionals in
 our federal law inforcement agencies are just plain stupid.
 
 it was interesting to watch the 700 club today.  pat robertson said that the
 "branch dividians had met the firey end for worshipping their false god." he
 also said that this was a terrible tragedy and that the fbi really blew it. 
 however, i still feel that he's forgetting that every major religion in the
 world had a similarly humble 'cult-status' beginning- even, and perhaps
 especially, christianity.  it is perhaps worthwhile to consider that the
 branch dividians' apocalyptic prophecies have been fulfilled.  maybe david
 koresh really was jesus christ (sure sounds like a neat opening epic for a
 new major religion to me).
