    ... an amazing illustration of disconnection from reality.
 
 glad to see that you agree that the current government is reticent
 about admitting the sovereignty of the people!  speaking from personal
 experience, i have had judges illegally assume jurisdiction even after
 i demanded that the da prove such jurisdiction on the record, and the
 da stood mute.  i have also had an appellate court uphold such action
 and hide behind california rules of court, rule 106 ("the judges of
 the appellate department shall not be required to write opinions in
 any cases decided by them, but may do so whenever they deem it
 advisable or in the public interest.").  that is reality, i agree.
