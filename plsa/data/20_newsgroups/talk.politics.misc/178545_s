 with yet another tax being floated by the clinton administration to
 pay for new ``free'' social programs, i've really begun to suspect
 that the canadians, long resentful of their place in the american
 shadow, brainwashed an american draft dodger who fled to canada some
 time between 1966 and 1968, tutored him in the ways of canadian
 socialism, awarded him with smokeless marijuana cigarettes when he got
 the correct answers, then returned him to the states (under the
 control of the domineering wife assigned to his case) to attain high
 public office and destroy the evil individualistic and free market
 forces in america, thus shaping america in the canadian image.
