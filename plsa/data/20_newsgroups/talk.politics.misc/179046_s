 
 i don't want to attack anyone's personal opinions and thus have not
 included any articles - but it seems to me incredibly ridiculous
 and pompous for someone to sit back with the benefit of hindsight
 and point fingers at clinton, reno, the fbi, or whomever.
 
 first of all, it is a knee-jerk judgement.  the facts are quite
 muddled at this point and will likely be for quite a while.
 
 secondly, things do not improve by pointing blame and accusatory
 fingers.  pointing fingers is a destructive action.  if everyone
 sat around pointing fingers all the time, nothing would get done
 and nothing would ever get any better.  and despite the tragedy,
 we can learn something from this - if it is approached in a 
 constructive manner.  doesn't it seem that working together is
 more productive than working against one another?
 
 thirdly, it seems incredibly hypocritical to place blame given
 the benefit of hindsight - something that those who made the
 decisions did not have the benefit of.  why not give them the courtesy
 of acknowledging that they did the best they could with the
 data they had - in a very, very difficult situation.  some
 responses have gone so far to suggest that the actions were done
 without regard for the lives of the people in the compound - give
 me a break.
 
 be part of the solution - not the problem.
 
 and that's my opinion -
