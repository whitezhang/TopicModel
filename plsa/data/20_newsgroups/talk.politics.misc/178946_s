 gee, the war on drugs has been going on for all these years and they're
 still getting drugs!  imagine that...
 
 my friends who like grass (i don;t agree but it's pretty harmless) are
 unable to get it, yet i know a number of places where someone stupid
 enough could get crack cocaine within a half hour of leaving my office.
 
 the war on drugs has been completely unsuccessful, yet it's lead to really
 horrible abuses of peoples' constitutional rights.  i don't see how a
 thinking person could justify it.
