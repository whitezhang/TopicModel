 i know it was used several times in the south, to prosecute the murders of
 blacks, after all white juries had cleared the accussed.
 
 |furthermore, what are the specific charges against the four lapd officers? 
 |which civil rights or laws are they accused of violating? 
 
 i believe it is a general charge, that is no specific right is mentioned.

 |this.)
 
 the ss has previously ruled that since the seperate governments were in
 essence seperate sovereigns, then double jeopardy does not apply.
 
 (if this is true, then could defendents also be tried under city and
 county governments?)
 
 this mornings paper said that the aclu has decided to reinstate its
 opposition to this kind of thing. they had earlier suspended their
 opposition while they examined the king case. there might be hope
 for the aclu after all.
