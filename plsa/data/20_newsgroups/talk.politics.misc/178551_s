 excuse me?  who destroyed the bd's?  last i knew, they burned themselves...
 prove to me that the fbi, atf, or the government in general either burned
 the compound themselves, or that the bd's had no choice but to commit
 mass suicide rather than coming out peacefully (a promise that was made
 twice by koresh himself, which he broke both times).
