 if you don't want to be lumped together as a group, stop insisting
 on being treated as a member of a group.

 sexual orientation is not defined by the anti-discrimination law
 that was passed last year.  pedophilia isn't a sexual orientation?

 i wholeheartedly support their right to take this action.  i wouldn't
 do it myself, unless it was something like the nambla t-shirt.

 i support their right to do so (just like i support your right to 
 engage in sodomy with consenting adults), but i think they are doing 
 something wrong.  i wouldn't do business with such a bank.
