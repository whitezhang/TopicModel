     you're being too generous to the communists, i think.  in practice,
 communism has "solved" the problem by killing off anybody who is _too_
 productive, and who therefore raises embarrassing questions about why the
 rest of the group is a bunch of sluggards.  the mass butchery of "kulaks"
 in the ussr is a good instance of this.
     a poor second best is to have a neighboring capitalist country to which
 people of politically incorrect skill and ambition flee.  i often wonder
 just what castro would have done if the cubans presently in miami would
 have been forced to remain in cuba.  would they have revolted and killed
 him off, or been killed?
     best of all is to build a wall locking the citizens of your country in,
 load it up so heavily with attack dogs, barbed wire, and land mines that
 most people fleeing over it die, and then give everyone the choice of
 obedience, prison, or flight.  this would be a bad science-fiction novel,
 if the east germans hadn't actually done it.  the last person to die
 crossing the wall, as i recall, was an unarmed woman who was shot in the
 back.  erich honecker was going to go on trial for that, but he fled to
 socialists in chile.
     it's good to be kind to one's intellectual opponents, but sometimes
 it's a sheer waste of time.
