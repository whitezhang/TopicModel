 the selective service registration should be abolished.  to start with, the
 draft is immoral.  whether you agree with that or not, we don't have one now,
 and military experts agree that the quality of the armed forces is superior
 with a volunteer army than with draftees.  finally, the government has us
 on many lists in many computers (the irs, social security admistration and
 motor vehicle registries to name a few) and it can find us if it needs to.
 maintaining yet another list of people is an utter waste of money and time.
 let's axe this whole department, and reduce the deficit a little bit.
