 maybe we should ask the 83,103 people who were laid off this january whether
 or not we're in a recession. that was a figure that was reported in the
 new york times. there is no official figure, because the bureau of labor
 statistics stopped government tracking of layoffs eight months ago due to
 budget cuts.
