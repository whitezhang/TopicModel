 
 wow, i hadn't realized how venomous this was getting!  be careful here...the
 problem isn't the rich but the values and the systems that make the rich
 rich.  things are designed in such a way that in order to go with the system
 and make money, everything else we care about goes to shit.  i have to
 constantly remind myself that the goal of human society is not to make
 money.  money doesn't make us happy; it just prevents certain things making
 us more unhappy.
 
 therefore, don't shoot the rich.  shoot the conservatives!
