 janet reno, the fbi, et al were nothing but pawns in koresh's game.
 he was a madman who was going to hurt the children, and everyone
 else in the compound no matter what the fbi did.

 such a hostage situation has taken place on numerous occasions
 with the result of the police trying to take the place by
 force and the result being the death of the hostages and the
 gunmen. however, this is the first time i've heard of
 the blame landing squarely on the police.
  
 in this country we have a policy of not negotiating a back down
 from terrorists and hostage takers since that only encourages
 other terrorists and hostage takers.
