 that leaves germany, japan and the uk as examples of a country where the
 right wing government is on the verge of collapse. oh and of course the usa
 which just elected a socialist government :-)

 etc, unfortunately you can't pin this on the left or the right, both are
 to blame. both sides are equally deep into the corruption scandal. the only 
 untained party is the northern league which is a bunch of nationalist
 separatists and the communist party which has collapsed.

 ed should take a look at the budget deficit regan and bush created together
 before he starts to make claims about europe collapsing based on the budget
 deficits here. none of them are serious on the usa scale.
 
 and here in europe we have zero interest in ed-ipser type freed thank you.
 we do not want our countries to be run by a narrow elite of rich lawyers
 for the benefit of the super wealthy. we are quite happy with social 
 democracy and despite the fuss made in time and newsweek there is remarkably
 little being done to reverse the social welfare reforms brought in by
 socialism.
 
 the problem with socialism is that it started with the aims of free education
 and health care and provision of the welfare state. this has been achieved
 across the whole of europe, only the usa is struggling to catch up. the
 problem for socialism is what to do now it has succeeded.

 ed starts to discus la, presumably he thinks that it is in europe. on
 the other hand he most probably hasn't heard of a european city.

 rather the opposite. what is happening in italy is that the communist party
 has collapsed. this has meant that the grand coalition between right and
 left wing parties to keep out the communists has also collapsed. the 
 magistrates have seized this opportunity to crack down hard on fraud and 
 corruption and have arrested half the politicians. the fact that the socialists
 are in charge this week is incidental, the right is into the corruption just
 as baddly.
 
 what looks likely to happen is the fringe parties are going to do much
 better in the next election. most of the parliamentary deputies are going
 to get replaced and the parties are going to be forced to look to people
 who are free of any hint of corruption. look out for a parliament of
 pavarotti's and porn stars.
