 since the actual verdicts were not known by the authorities, it was
 smart not to allow "friday night for fighting" (sorry, elton) and to
 seal them for this morning.  also, it allows for maximum daylight to
 wear down and frustrate any potential troublemakers, as well as give
 more preparation time.

 actually, that was 8 pm 'cos it was shown live on our 11 pm news
 and cut into cnn's 11 o'clock sports (sorry, but i didn't watch
 the devils-islanders game!  no sportschannel ...).

 detail.  but i'll not comment further on that ...

 a net-contact in l.a. tells me that the alert will remain over this
 weekend, as some elements may find excuse over the not-guilty verdicts
 on three of five charges (the aiding-and-abetting).  those acquittals
 seem to balance out the fact that rodney king himself was not any kind
 of angel that night, speeding and fleeing et al.  however ...  another
 consideration is any street celebrations over the two convictions on
 the excessive force charges (koons for incompetance, and powell for
 overreacting --- both guilty as heck even from the view of nypd cops
 interviewed) that might get out of hand. )-;  also, some elements
 may take the acquittals as an excuse to challenge the cops (a dumb
 move, obviously).  and, koreans are still scared and certain people
 are really mad over how they have armed themselves in the last year.
 
 a commander from nassau, long island was questioned about how his
 people would have handled rodney king, and he said "we'd have let
 him roll around in the dirt 'til he got tired, then handcuff him".
