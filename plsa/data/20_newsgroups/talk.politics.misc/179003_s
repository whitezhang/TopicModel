      really now.  why is this the pot calling the kettle black?  i am stating
 that a person who shows a continually biased opinion is close-minded and that
 his opinion should be ignored.  clayton is stating that a group of at least
 two million (1%) american citizens are evil vicious malicious child-molesters.
 
      here's a hypothetical question...  if clayton said something like "all
 those niggers are really stupid."  (please don't be offended, i'm not racist
 but merely using an example of clayton's malign logic).  and then said he
 read a report that a lot of blacks in inner cities dropped out of school, i
 bet he wouldn't have your support.  yet he can claim that all homosexuals are
 dishonest, evil, lying child molesters without *personally* having a single
 homosexual friend or acquaintance and you'll sit there and support him.
 
      god created a place for bigots.  it's called hell and clayton is going
 to burn there for a long time.  i pray for him to find in his heart the
 christian values he espouses so that he can learn to love his gay brothers
 and sisters, because anyone with so much hatred in his soul coulld never
 be righteous.
