 this is getting sad.  all you can do is make this ridiculous statements,
 based upon some old information and a press democrat article that was
 poorly written.
 
 please show the numbers for your use of "much more".  i have not seen
 them.  and i want them to be true and accurate, or at least show a 
 trend within the everyday gay population.
 
 there are all kinds of 'damaged and screwed up' people, and most of
 them are not gay.
 
 keep it up, you just shoot your own position down over and over.
