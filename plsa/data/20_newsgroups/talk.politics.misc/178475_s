 utopia is a myth (although we can do a lot better than what we have today).
 but i think that you must pitch libertarianism as a progressive agenda
 (ie you can do better under our style of system).

 i'm flattered by your invitation, but i'm afraid you have the wrong person.
 although i completely agree with your civil liberties agenda, i'm not 
 in support of your economic agenda. what i do like about the libertarian
 party is that you guys are so good at shaking up the tired ideas of the
 past. i encourage you guys to continue your crusade, but i'm afraid i
 can't ride along.
