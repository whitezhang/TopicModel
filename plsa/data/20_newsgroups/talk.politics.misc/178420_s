 and the religious right worships engines, smokestacks, landfills,
 and hates people.
 
 what does this name-calling have to do with anything you are claiming about
 the truth of environmental disaster?  nothing that i have read in this
 thread, nor heard from anyone i have talked to, would suggest to me that 
 people fit the definition you give of the religious left.  come off it, phil.
 a prime motivation for protecting our environment is so that we, 
 people, can continue to live in it healthily.  we just disagree on what
 is necessary to maintaining a healthy environment for people.

 what!? they have already repaired that old hulk!!!?  wow!!! ;-)
 
 i suppose you *mean* the alaskan shores that were devastated by the
 valdez accident?  i haven't seen the articles.  what do they say exactly?
 has [mostly] all the ocean and shore life returned?  the sands are [mostly]
 as clean as they were before?  the microbial samples are [mostly] back to 
 a normal balance? the fish and fowl populations have [mostly] returned?  what?

 not a problem?  would you move to three mile island?  i would imagine 
 there is some cheap property available!  
 
 the naturally occurring catastrophic events [disasters] that destroy 
 property (ie: hurricanes, tornados, earthquakes) do not usually leave 
 toxic wastes that prevent people from re-building their lives there.  
 the man-made disasters (oil spills, toxic dumping, radioactive waste 
 dispersions) cause death and make an area unliveable far beyond the 
 initial event.
