 a more realistic offer would be:
 
 those who object to paying for abortion can instead pay for the (greater)
 cost of delivery that those who couldn't afford an abortion (and wanted
 one) would be forced to go through, while those of us who do not object to
 public funding of abortions for those who can not afford medical care on
 their own can pay for the (smaller) cost of an abortion for those who
 decide that is what is best for them, but are unable to afford it on their
 own.  funny how those who object to paying *their* money to pay for *other's*
 abortions end up paying *more* money than if they hadn't objected.  people
 need to realize that where *your* individual tax money goes is a meaningless
 concept.  it is probably unlikely that the fraction of your taxes that would
 actually *on average* go towards such abortions would cover the cost of even
 *one* entire abortion.  (consider how many taxpayers there are, how many
 abortions are performed, and how many would likely be paid for by public
 funds, and how much you pay in taxes and how much a typical abortion would
 cost.  i think the factors on the order of 1/1000 involved will swamp the
 rest.)
 
 (it's more realistic because we don't really object to paying for delivery,
 etc for those women who *chose* that, but can't afford it.)
