 yes because it has always had that power. the constitution limits the areas
 in which the government can exercise power. the constitution can be changed
 however and has been frequently. for example during prohibition the 
 government had no power to permit alcohol to be sold although the state had
 the capacity to change the constitution to enable this.
 
 the constitutional provisions are merely a matter of form that dictate
 the manner in which power is exercised. no piece of paper can prevent
 abuse, for example the imprisonment of the socialist presidential candidate
 for opposing world war i - a clear breach of the first ammendment,
 
 the united states clearly has the capacity to bring in meaningful arms
 control measures. if there were large groups of powerful warlords who could
 prevent such a measure by force we would have to admit that the power
 of the federal government to uphold the constitution was limited. this
 is the situation in somalia where the state is unable to govern because
 the people with the guns think that they have the right to decide the
 law.

 the problem is extrapolating from our notions of what a state is which
 date from the treaty of westphalia to the medieval period where countries
 were much more analogous to bodies like the eec or the un - organisations
 where individual members had significant powers in their own right and
 did not derive their power from a central authority.

 but here we are not talking of a time where law was voluntary. the rules
 and regulations settled in this manner were in areas that the state 
 was not involved in. even today a great deal of law is effectively
 made in this manner. for example the city of london stockmarket which is
 a non governmental body that can make and enforce rules. it does so however
 within the framework laid down by the government.
 
 in medieval times this framework existed in preciosely the same manner. if
 you were to set up shop as a trade association and decide to screw the
 monarch you could expect to end up inside the tower in a very short
 time. most of the organisations allowed to make law have explicit royal
 charters, such as the universities for example. fairs and towns all required 
 authority in order to trade. it was customary however for this authority
 to be granted on a permanent basis subject to revocation in the case of
 misbehavior. after magna carta the monarch lost the power to remove
 privillage without recourse to the courts. tony benn recently established
 through a devious route the power of the parliament to revoke favours
 without recourse to the courts - thus establishing the right to abolish
 the house of lords for example.
 
 certainly none of the rules set up by merchants forms any part of the 
 "common law" which has a very specific meaning in the uk. it is law
 made by the judiciary through judgements on cases. nothing else is
 common law.
 
 
 incidentaly the common law is a lot more common than people expect. for
 example a judgment in common law made in england can effect the 
 interpretation of the law in most of the countries that were once in
 the empire, including the us, the reverse is also true. for example a
 lot of the decisions surrounding aids cases in the us are of relevance
 to uk decisions. although the statues are different the reasoning that
 lies behind the interpretation of those statues is common and thus if
 a judge made a reasoned assesment of the interpretation of the law in
 one jurdisdiction it would clearly be perverse if another country with no
 guiding precedent should judge a person to be guilty of a crime which
 they might by the existence of a precedent consider to be legal. the law
 should be as predictable as possible and abhors making decisions without
 precedent. once a decision is made in the uk though that naturally is 
 superior in uk law.
