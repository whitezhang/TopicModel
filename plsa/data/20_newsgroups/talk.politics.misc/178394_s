 	alan, you can start by teaching your children that the perpetrators
 of crimes no more represent the "black community" than racist hateful whites
 represent the majority culture (although there are many ethnic minorities
 who have fallen into the very trap that you are struggling with, and believe
 otherwise). the trap is the easy way out.
 	for yourself, i think it would be a good idea to realize that the
 demographics related to the crimes you speak of have less to do with race,
 and much to do with socioeconomic status and disenfranchisement. you're
 going to find higher crime within *any* community comprised of *any* ethnic
 group or subgroup that has become dysfunctional, whatever the factors
 leading to that dysfunction. with ethnic minorities it is more usually than
 not, as i said, socioeconomic disenfranchisement.
 	if, for example, you lived in an area where there were very few
 blacks, but quite a few poor-for-generations whites, you'd see the crime
 statistics reflecting the dysfunction of those white people. would you then
 worry about whther your children would begin to see whites as undesireable
 or whatever? the trap springs into action when our innate compunction to
 define "us" and "other" raises its little voice. the trap becomes dangerous
 when we stop to listen to that little voice and stop thinking like rational
 humans.
 	it's interesting that blacks are traditionally seen as *the* or the
 *most* criminal element in many of our urban areas. i don't know the racial
 makeup of phoenix, so i can't speak to your situation. however, i live in
 san francisco, a city that loves to tout its "ethnic diversity". here, we
 have black gangs, hispanic gangs, asian (yes, the "model minority") gangs,
 and even a few white gangs. the asian gangs have become a particularly
 troublesome element for law enforcement here, mainly due (i think) to their
 propensity for engaging in organized criminal activities. but ask people on
 the street and they'll, 8-out-of-10 times, tell you that black gangs and
 crime are what they most fear. during the "disturbance" in los angeles last
 year many of the rioters and looters were not black. some were even white! i
 remember being amazed at  television news scenes that showed looting mobs
 where there were maybe one or two blacks at most! my perceptions, gleaned
 from tv news, were further corroborated by numerous friends and relatives
 that live in los angeles. this may have been the country's first truly
 multi-ethnic riot. yet i know from face-to-face and online discussion that
 in the minds of america the popular perception is that it was a *black*
 riot!
 	in closing, i'd like to say that you raise some interesting points
 that really need discussion. our country has spent too long ignoring the
 racism (and its attendant ills) that is very much a part of our culture. as
 a people, we are afraid to face up to some hurtful truths, and the problem
 becomes compounded *daily*. we cannot afford to do it much longer. i truly
 believe that the  well-being of all of us depends on changing our current
 course of denial and repression.
 	i wish you and your children, and all other people, of *all* colors,
 luck in avoiding the "trap". 
 	peace, my brother.
