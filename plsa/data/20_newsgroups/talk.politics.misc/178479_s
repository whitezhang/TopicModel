   i don't think it's too far off of the mark, either.  no one 'deserves' what
 they get.  punishment is for the justice system (flawed as it may be).  this
 whole 'well it served the idiots right' mentality is nothing but a revenge
 mentality, and my opinion is that "revenge is for children and the emotionally
 retarded" (frank herbert, 'dune' series).

   well... every group has a somewhat selective memory of it's past.  even the
 protestants who look to martin luther for starting the whole movement
 conveniently forget his diatribes telling nobles to slaughter the peasants
 who rebelled against unjust conditions.

   they stood up for what they believed in, and the people of the time hated
 them for that, and because they were different.  xenophobia has always been
 one of the strongest reasons for death and destruction.

   anyone who's confident in what they believe should not have a problem
 listening to dissenting points of view...  it's something called 'free speech',
 which radicals usually push aside in favour of doing what's 'right'.

  ahh... i agree with that most strongly.  who cares about 'claims'??  all i
 want to see are actions.  if you act like you hate me, you probably do, all
 pie-in-the-sky religious affiliations to the contrary.

   yes!  most people don't realize that it's not some 'government' sitting
 in a far-away magical land that makes decisions, it's people.  and those
 people make mistakes like any human.  questioning the government in everything
 it says and does should be one of our most fundamental rights.

   until this all settles, i'm not sure anyone can make that sort of blanket
 statement.  sure, they may have been quiet peace-loving people who just
 happened to be armed to the teeth, but who knows what david koresh had planned?

   you don't even have to break laws to get punished, as i'm sure many people
 have found out.  what about the drug laws that permit the police to seize
 any suspect goods?  and some grandmother travels with $30,000 in cash in her
 handbag, (doesn't trust the banks), it falls open, and the police end up
 confiscating it?  this is not an isolated case, either.
 
   or laws to stop companies from making look-alike ford/gm car parts, and
 selling them as the real thing?  the first people that got raided were antique
 companies who made 'real gm' parts for 1930's cars.
 
   all i'm saying is that it should not be assumed that someone is inherently
 evil/etc when the government decides to nail them.
 
   it's the people who blindy believe that the government does the best in
 everything for them who are _really_ dangerous.
