 	or, if the phone comany charges you as if you did, you could always
 
 	a) start your own company
 	b) use a different phone company
 
 	but we're talking about the government.  some want item 1, others item
 2, etc.  there will always be something someone doesn't want to fund.
 
 	you don't like abortion?  work to recriminalize it.  but as long as it
 is legal, you really don't have a chance in getting funding stopped
 (permanently).

 	what scam?  i'll never have a hysterctomy (sp?) but it's a legal
 procedure and my health insurance company will pay for it.  shall i now argue
 that i should be exempt from those fees?
 	great, exept now i'll pay more since it's primarly men who have
 prostate procedures.  not to mention the extra cost of keeping track of who
 wants to pay for what.
 
 	if it bothers you that much, start your own health insurance company
 that doesn't pay for abortion.
 
 	this is a free country, you know.

 	so don't get coverage through that company.  simple.
