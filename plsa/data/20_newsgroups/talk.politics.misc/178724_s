 yes, and the individual is not omitted; i just didn't fully articulate the 
 principles of fractal federalism.  all government powers derive from the
 people; each level can receive a new power from the level below through 
 the amendment process, where a true consensus (say a 3/4 majority) writes 
 that power into the constitution of the level above (in the case of the 
 lowest level, an amendement is passed by a 3/4 majority vote; in the case 
 of higher levels, it must be passed by 3/4 of the legislatures.  we can
 of course haggle about the specifics of "true consensus" when we hold our 
 constitutional convention :-).  once a power has been granted, it may be 
 exercised by the legislature.  powers not in the original constitutions must 
 percolate upward, starting from the individual.  the ratification process 
 for the original constitutions should involve consensus and not simply a 
 plurality or majority.
 
 granting a "right" in a constitution is of course the same as empowering
 the government at that level to restrict the activities of the governments
 at the lower levels, so it operates in the same way as the amendment process 
 (again, that crazy resemblance to the supposed-but-not-actual u.s. government 
 structure).
 
 this government structure is a very frustrating one for those people (read-
 "liberals") who would like to have concentrated power to use the government
 to force people to do "good" (a difficult-to-define word, and one that it 
 is difficult to reach a consensus on).  it is also a frustrating structure 
 for those who want to use the government to dictate personal behavior (read- 
 "big-government conservatives").  i personally would rather see those types
 of people frustrated than the incredible erosion of liberty (both civil and 
 economic) that is going on now.
 
 this is imho a "good" government stucture for those who see the role of
 government as the protection of individual liberties, while still recognizing
 that individuals need to have some influence in the type of community that
 they live in.

 one which maintains peace, liberty, and the opportunity for happiness for its
 people, while working within the realities of human nature.  you do bring
 up the point (intentional or not) that a "lasting" idea is by no means
 necessarily a "successful" idea.  i believe that fractal federalism would
 at least bring many ideas to light, and the people would have the opportunity
 to democratically choose between "good" ideas and "bad" ideas.  if the
 docialists, er, i mean democrats are right and government activism fosters a
 prosperous people, they will have a plethora of local opportunities to  
 check their thesis.  if libertopia is possible, it will arise.  if a balanced
 conservative republic is democratically received as the best level of
 government activity, it will become clear to the people that it is best.

 right, and people would not rescind any freedoms (read- "empower the
 government") except through the amendment process.  that is how the federal 
 government is supposed to work now, but the supreme soviet, er, i mean the 
 supreme court put a stop to that "republican government" nonsense.
 
 in my hypothetical government, if there were a constitutional provision
 empowering the government to regulate churches the government (whatever
 level we are talking about) could indeed ban churches.  the constitutional
 provision would be invalid if a higher level had a constitutional provision
 protecting free exercise of religion.  the uppermost constitution is still
 the supreme law of the land.

 it is a matter of individuals being able to control their own associations
 and environment, not a matter of suppression of ideas.
 
 one dilemma of the human condition is that individuals need liberty, and
 they also need to have some control over their environment.  in my
 "fractal federalism" government, certain "rights" are protected by the 
 constitutions.  other "rights" are protected simply because the government 
 has not been empowered to infringe upon them.  when a consensus is reached
 that the government should have a certain power, then freedom is infringed
 upon.  this cannot be avoided -- murder statutes infringe upon freedom,
 but i think that the consensus of the american people is that murder statutes
 are a good idea.
 
 i am sure that many parents believe that they have a "right" to control
 the environment that their children live in.  people feel that they have
 a "right" to sleep peacefully at night; thus, there are noise ordinances.
 there are zoning laws that keep businesses from overrunning residential
 neighborhoods.  i do not view these as bad things (certainly some individual
 instances are bad, but the concept is not necessarily bad), i view them
 as the people in a community having some control over the type of community
 that they live in.  i see the alternative as near anarchy.
 
 like i said in another post, if you can come up with a scenario where an 
 individual can do something truly autonomously -- with absolutely zero
 effect on anyone else -- then no individual or government has the right
 to restrict that activity.  there are simply not very many behaviors that
 fit into the category of the truly autonomous, so the whole thing becomes
 an issue of one individual or group having power over another individual
 or group.  i think that the "fractal federalism" approach is a sound, if
 not ideal, approach to limiting this restrictive power.  the libertarian 
 scenario degenerates to "might makes right," and the system we have right
 now is one of "lawyers abusing natural rights philosophy to decide what 
 powers the government should have by subverting the democratic process 
 though the supreme court."

 i think i answered this above already, but let me expand a little more
 with an example.  if i stand naked in front of your house and masturbate 
 in front of your children while they play, in your libertarian (small 'l')
 scenario the only recourse you have is to yell at me.  "autonomous" is
 a value judgement 99.99% of the time, it is not a scientific reality with
 a clear definition.  exactly who would you empower to make that value
 judgement?

 lots of people are long on complaints and short on practical solutions.
 although i am pessimistic that my idea will ever bear fruit, i am at least
 trying to be long on solutions also.  i am truly interested if you have
 any improvements to make on my ideas (i call them "my ideas", but they
 all come from an "average guy" reading of the u.s. constitution without
 benefit of the indoctrination of constitutional law academia).

 sorry, the confusion was my fault.  when i said that "fractal federalism" 
 resembles the u.s. constitution, i meant it and thought it was pretty clear.  
 i should have more clearly explained that the ultimate derivation of government
 power is from the consensus of the people (although not the consent of every
 individual; a practical observation, not a moral judgement).  it is certainly 
 better than having all government power derive from nine lawyers, which is the
 situation we have now.  that is why i think the supreme court should be
 a jury court, with a different jury for each case.  
 
 it is certainly not perfect (no philosophy of government is), but do you still 
 find it a repugnant idea?  if so, what is your solution?

 i think that you misunderstood the structure of the form of government i
 advocate, and it was my fault for not being more clear.

 the majority does not make the rules.  the majority (or possibly a 
 plurality) simply elects representatives to exercise limited government 
 powers; those limited government powers derive from a large consensus, 
 not a simple majority.  and the federal government, in my scenario, still
 has the power to protect freedoms.
