    probably because you have yet to respond to the refutation i've posted.
    teel, it's bad enough you post this bs, it's even worse that you don't
    even try to defend it when it gets torn to pieces, but then posting
    that no one's looked at it and gloating when all facts point to the
    contrary point to a severely deluded mind.
 
 what i found interesting about conklin's letter is the 
 6 cases he has won against the irs.  now, assuming that
 these cases really exist and were one by him (anyone checked?)
 they may have nothing to do with his major tax claim.  the irs fought
 one of his deductions.   defending your deductions seems puny when
 you believe that there is no need to file in the first place!
