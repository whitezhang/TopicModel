 i haven't recognized any names from previous discussions, but i do
 notice that there are a few who blame clinton for the actions of the
 batf in waco.  unless you felt the same way about what we did under
 bush's *direct* command in panama, it's just partisan whining.  which is
 what i expect most of it to be.  i can see no way to condemn one and not
 the other.  
 
 but i'm sure some limbot will tell me how killing thousands of
 panamanian civilians to serve an arrest warrant is much better than
 allowing 80 religious fanatics to commit suicide following a botched
 attempt by the batf to serve a search warrant.
