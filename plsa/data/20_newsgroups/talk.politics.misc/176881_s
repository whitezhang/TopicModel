 it's not what they did that matters.  it's what *you* do and
 what *i* do and what *we* do in response that matters.  do we
 lessen ourselves by killing in response to killing?  it's
 vengeance.  that's all.  it's no deterrent.  it serves no
 purpose but to slake somebody's blood lust.

 yeah yeah yeah... and sure would be nice if we didn't apply the
 death penalty disproportionately to minorities.  i'll revisit my
 opinion on the death penalty when there are more whites up for
 it than blacks.  i.e., when hell freezes over.
