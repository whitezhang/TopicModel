   dear mr. speaker:      (dear mr. president:)
   
   as part of my continuing effort to keep the congress fully 
   informed, i am providing this report, consistent with section 4 
   of the war powers resolution, to advise you of actions that i 
   have ordered in support of the united nations efforts in 
   bosnia-herzegovina.
   
   beginning with u.n. security council resolution 713 of 
   september 25, 1991, the united nations has been actively 
   addressing the crisis in the former yugoslavia.  the security 
   council acted in resolution 781 to establish a ban on all 
   unauthorized military flights over bosnia-herzegovina.  there 
   have, however, been blatant violations of the ban, and villages 
   in bosnia have been bombed.
   
   in response to these violations, the security council decided, 
   in resolution 816 of march 31, 1993, to extend the ban to all 
   unauthorized flights over bosnia-herzegovina and to authorize 
   member states, acting nationally or through regional organi-
   zations, to take all necessary measures to ensure compliance.  
   nato's north atlantic council (nac) agreed to provide nato air 
   enforcement for the no-fly zone.  the u.n. secretary general 
   was notified of nato's decision to proceed with operation deny 
   flight, and an activation order was delivered to participating 
   allies.
   
   the united states actively supported these decisions.  at my 
   direction, the joint chiefs of staff sent an execute order to 
   all u.s. forces participating in the nato force, for the conduct 
   of phased air operations to prevent flights not authorized by 
   the united nations over bosnia-herzegovina.  the u.s. forces 
   initially assigned to this operation consist of 13 f-15 and 
   12 f-18a fighter aircraft and supporting tanker aircraft.  
   these aircraft commenced enforcement operations at 8:00 a.m. 
   e.d.t. on april 12, 1993.  the fighter aircraft are equipped for 
   combat to accomplish their mission and for self-defense.
   
   nato has positioned forces and has established combat air 
   patrol (cap) stations within the control of airborne early 
   warning (aew) aircraft.  the u.s. cap aircraft will normally 
   operate from bases in italy and from an aircraft carrier in the 
   adriatic sea.  unauthorized aircraft entering or approaching 
   the no-fly zone will be identified, interrogated, intercepted, 
   escorted/monitored, and turned away (in that order).  if these 
   steps do not result in compliance with the no-fly zone, such 
   aircraft may be engaged on the basis of proper authorization by 
   nato military authorities and in accordance with the approved

   rules of engagement, although we do not expect such action will 
   be necessary.  the commander of unprofor (the united nations 
   protection force currently operating in bosnia-herzegovina) was 
   consulted to ensure that his concerns for his force were fully 
   considered before the rules of engagement were approved.
   
   it is not possible to predict at this time how long such 
   operations will be necessary.  i have directed u.s. armed forces 
   to participate in these operations pursuant to my constitutional 
   authority as commander in chief.  i am grateful for the con-
   tinuing support that the congress has given to this effort, and 
   i look forward to continued cooperation as we move forward 
   toward attainment of our goals in this region.
   
        	    	      	   	sincerely,
