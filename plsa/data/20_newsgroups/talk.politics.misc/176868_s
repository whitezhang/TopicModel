 you have just reminded me of an old tom paxton song...
 
 i"m changing my name to chrysler
 (tom paxton, 1980)
 
 oh the price of gold is rising out of sight
 and the dollar is in sorry shape tonight
 what the dollar used to get us
 now won't buy a head of lettus
 no the economic forecast isn't right
 but amidst the clouds i spot a shining ray
 i caneven glimpse a new and better way
 and i've devised a plan of action
 worked it down to the last fraction
 and i'm going into action here today.
 
 chorus:
 
   i am changing my name to chrysler
   i am going down to washington d.c.
   i will tell some power broker
   what they did for iacoca
   will be perfectly acceptable to me.
   i am changing my name to chrysler
   i am heading for that great receiving line
   so when they hand a million grand out
   i'll be standing with my hand out
   yes sir i'll get mine
 
 when my creditors are screaming for their dough
 i'll be proud to tell them all where they can go
 they won'y have to scream and holler
 they'll all be paid to the last dollar
 where the endless streams of money seam to flow
 i'll be glad to tell them all what they can do
 its just a matter of a simple form or two
 it's not renumeration it's a liberal education
 ain't you kind of glad that i'm in debt to you
 
 chorus
 
 since the first first amphibians crawled out of the slime
 we've been struggling in an unrelenting climb
 we were hardly up and walking before money started talking
 and it's sad failure is an awful crime
 it's been that way for a millennium or two
 but now it seems there's a different point of view
 if you're a corporate titanic and your failure is gigantic
 down in congress there is a safety net for you.
 
 chorus...
 
 
 
 perhaps steven jobs should take paxton's advice and change his name to
 chrysler, or perhaps set himself up as an s&l, maybe neil bush could
 give him a hand?
