 i have indeed heard of pythagoras, but i don't know that he was ever
 disparaged as a "bean eater".  in the american southwest and west
 (e.g., texas, california, colorado), the term "bean eater" is
 sometimes used as a slur against those of hispanic heritage (generally
 mexicans, in those parts) -- much like how the irish in the northeast
 are perceived (by some) as voracious beer guzzlers.
