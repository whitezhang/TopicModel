 my opinion is this:  in a society whose economy is primarily based on 
 capitalism, the role of government should be to provide those goods and 
 services that need providing for the general public's good.  but government 
 should supply those necessary goods and services only when it is impossible 
 for a private enterprise (or individual) to make money from providing them.
 i agree with some of the other posts that this train probably can not make 
 money and will rely heavily on state tax dollars.  
 
 the question, i think, then becomes:  do we, the general public, need the train?
 
 i certainly do not, nor will i ever, need this train in lubbock, texas.  with
 the inexpensive air travel provided between dallas and houston, i don't think
 people in dallas or houston need it either.
