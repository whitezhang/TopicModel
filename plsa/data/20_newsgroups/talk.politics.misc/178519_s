 well yes and no. the federalist papers are propaganda and it is therefore
 difficult to determine precisely what maddison etc were up to from them. they
 certainly emphasised a limited role for the federal government but this
 was not necessarily their true position.

 the senate was less powerful than the house of lords in the period in question.
 the stripping of the powers of the house of lords did not occur until 1914
 and david llloyd george's budget. even despite this the house of lords has
 considerable power even today and is far from a rubber stamping body.

 the system is meant to be slow to react, the problem is that it ended up
 a bit too slow.

 the presiden't veto was meant to be entirely separate. until bush abused it
 in a quite extraordinary manner it was used more in accord with the intent
 of being a check on unreasonable legislation. the veto was clearly regarded 
 as a completely last gasp measure its use was meant to be restricted to
 preventing the legislature interfering with the actions of the executive.
 
 the senate is not meant to be exactly a rubber stamp body, it is meant as
 a check on unrestrained legislation. that is the extra measure built into
 the constitution in favour of the status quo, 60% of the representatives
 of the states is not a reasonable restriction.
