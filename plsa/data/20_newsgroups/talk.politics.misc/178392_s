      i'm curious why you took a beign statement and cross-posted it to several
 different news groups, including something along the lines of alt.discrimination  look rodney king is black and large.  i have several large black male friends,and they are referred to as being large black men ( to their faces, and by
 themselves ).  you know, ted, i have a large number of adjectives for you,
 but i will spare you most of them because i try not to get into personal
 flame wars.  let me just say that i think your action of cross posting this
 was total bs, and you're trying to start some crap.  hopefully, others will
 see through your trite little game and not play along.
