 	actually, that is not quite accurate. avraam's lawyer has been quoted as
 claiming that avraam says the fire was started by a tank knocking over a keroscene
 lamp. avraam himself was quoted today in the washington post as stating that
 he overheard the following words on the second story of the compound before
 jumping out a window to safety -
 
 	"the fire is lit".
