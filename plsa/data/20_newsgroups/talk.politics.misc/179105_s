 	the place has burned to the ground.  the fbi and company
 have the whole area cordoned off and have already arrested 
 reporters for being at the site and taking pictures.
 
 	all your going to get in terms of a story is what the fbi, atf
 and the texas rangers decide to release.

 	when the philadephia cops dropped their bomb on move and
 managed to burn down an entire neighborhood many people said 
 the same thing.  dead men and rubble tell no tales that the
 police dont want them to tell.  
 
 	you can judge the real political mood on this from the
 fact that congressperson pat scroder is a 100% supporter of
 the fbi's actions.  she was on television this week saying that
 the cost of the operation in waco was a valid reason for the
 storming and gassing of the compound.
