     male sex survey: gay activity low
 
     a new natonal study on male sexual behavior, the most thorough
     examination of american men's sexual practices published since
     the kinsey report more than four decades ago, shows about 2
     percent of the men surveyed had engaged in homosexual sex and
     1 percent considered themselves exclusively homosexual.
 
     the figures on homosexuality in the study released wednesday
     by the alan guttmacher institute are significantly lower than
     the 10 percent figure that has been part of the conventional
     wisdom since it was published in the kinsey report.
 
 the article also contains numbers on the number of sexual partners.
 the median number of sexual partners for all men 20-39 was 7.3.
 compared to the table i have already posted from masters, johnson,
 and kolodny showing male homosexual partners, it is apparent that
 homosexual men are dramatically more promiscuous than the general
 male population.  it's a shame that we don't have a breakdown for
 straight men vs. gay/bi men -- that would show even more dramatically
 how much more promiscuous gay/bi men are.
