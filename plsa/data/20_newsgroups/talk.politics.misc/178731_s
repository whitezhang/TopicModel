 how wrong you will be.  i participated in the last national march on  
 washington (mow) for lesgaybi rights (oct 11, 1987) - with a turnout of  
 about 750,000 people - and we didn't have alot pissing us off at the time.   
 the big issue was the aids crisis, but we weren't being slapped around  
 quite as bad as we are now.  this time its aids, and equal rights,  and  
 the military squabble.  and this mow has been in the planning for years  
 whereas the last one was pulled together in a relatively short time.  the  
 last mow was the largest ever on d.c. and you can bet we are going to  
 exceed that by a long shot.  i truly believe we will exceed the 1.0  
 million goal the mow committee has always had set for this event.
