 ok, one last time.  (yeah right)  in order for *you* to "not pay for any
 abortions" through your tax money, *everyone* would have to "not pay for
 any abortions" through tax money.  if this is the case, then women who
 have reasons for "needing" an abortion, but are unable to afford it on
 their own, are just "out of luck".  their *choice* is blocked because of
 econonmic hardship--which is part of why they might "need" the abortion
 in the first place--and because *some* people don't want to "pay for any
 abortions".  on top of that, there is the assumed requirement that the
 governemnt pay the delivery costs for those women who can't afford it,
 which will also include all of those women who could not afford an abortion.
 this involves *more money*.
 
 suppose instead there *is* government funding of abortions for women who
 desire them but can not afford one on their own.  those who do not want
 an abortion will have the costs of their delivery covered (if they can
 not afford it on their own), and those who *do* want an abortion will be
 able to get one and *save the government money* in the process.  how then
 are you "paying for" an abortion?  rather that abortion is "paid for" by
 the cost of *delivery* that it *saves* (and then some), and all because
 we remove the restriction against funding of a perfectly legal procedure.
 (notice that this does not apply to cosmetic surgery, which is often used
 as an example of "elective surgery" that is not generally paid for just
 because it is desired and can not be afforded.)
 
 if you insist on complaining about "paying for" someone's choice to have
 an abortion when they can't afford it, i will complain about "paying for"
 the larger costs of *restricting* that choice when they can not afford it.
 why should you pay for someone else's choice?  why should i pay more to
 *restrict* someone's choice?

 a pro-lifer who does not consider abortion an *extreemly* important issue
 is an oxymoron.  if it's not important enough for you to vote the way you
 feel because of "other issues", then why should anyone take your insistance
 that "abortion is wrong" seriously?

 it would be awfully nice if reputable poll institutions would have a *clear*,
 unbiased poll on the issues of abortion.  in order to be unbiased there would
 have to be allowance made for "shades of grey", rather than lump all of the
 middle with one side by tricky wording--such as on the last poll i heard
 about.  of course, then we would know once and for all how the country
 *really* feels about it, and then what could we argue about?

 did you vote for him in the first place?  (you don't *have* to answer that,
 if you consider it none of our business.)
