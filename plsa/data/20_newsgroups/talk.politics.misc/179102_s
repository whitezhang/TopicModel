 no, this is not true. the cnn pictures show two sites clearly and a third is
 barely distinguished. 
 
 if you have a tape you should note that there are two towers at either end
 of the building, a big one and a little one. what appears to be merely a 
 long shot of the big tower with the tank in front is in fact the little
 tower. you can tell beacuse the flag in the foreground switches sides from the
 right of the picture to the left.
 
 the third site is visible as the flames clearly come from a point obscured by
 the small tower. you need a tape and a good slow motion video to see this.
