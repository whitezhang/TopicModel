 say what?  surrounding the compound with armed men and throwing
 grenades isn't a provocation?

 you're smoking something not legal in the us.  they never rang the
 doorbell.  not even the batf has claimed that they have. this was a
 no-knock search.
 
 as to the good reason the batf has-- the warrant and supporting
 affadavit have not been made public.
