 if we had backed him strongly early on i doubt there would be the
 problem there is now.  many russians became disillusioned with democracy
 and reforms when they felt, rightly imo, that the west didn't care.
 
 yeltsin was virtually promised massive aid (once bush got over his
 gorby-mania.)  this probably kept him from dismantling the congress
 and calling for new elections.  well, the aid didn't come through
 and we didn't make sure it went to the proper places and now the
 anti-reformers are gaining strength where before they were in
 hiding.

 if they don't reform i don't believe in giving them money.  however,
 i think this is too important to take a non-interventionist approach.
 this is what really bugs me about libertarianism -- it sounds like
 'it'll all be the same in a hundred years time.  no need to do
 anything.'

 despite the wishes of libertarians, this society is a far way, and getting
 farther, from being libertarian.  perhaps voluntary gifts would work if
 we had the proper framework but we do not have it.  we have to face the
 problem *now*, not in x years when we have a libertarian dream society.
 
 right now there are huge stumbling blocks to trade, let alone charity.
 there are still limitations to high-tech exports.  nasa can't buy
 proton launch vehicles from them.  sure, the market may be able to
 help a great deal but it can't right now.  there are too many obstacles.
 instead of fighting against the aid you should be fighting to 
 tear down the obstacles the market and charities have to face.

 well, i think limited government is primarily democratic due
 to it being limited.  but the main question is how do you transform
 a state-run economy and monolithic government into something that
 even remotely looks like ours?  (btw, sometimes it seems that our government 
 is trying to go the opposite direction)  it is not going to be
 painless and not going to be easy.  we simply cannot wait to
 help when they *have* the 'proper' government.  they'll never
 get there without the aid.  it may be too late already.

 as i also said above, another problem i have is with *transformation*.
 a libertarian society is not going to happen painlessly or overnight.
 i have seen nothing about how to take our current government and
 society and turn it into a minimal government and a responsible
 self-sufficient populace.

 they didn't have nuclear weapons 100 years ago.  nor instantaneous
 communications nor travel to virtually anyplace on the earth in
 less than a day.

 yes, depend on the rulers of the free market and the businesses.  rulers
 do emerge *somewhere* and they will never represent the opinions of
 every person on the planet.  
 
 there must be checks and balances.  checks on the government when
 it gets out of bounds and checks on industry when it gets out of
 bounds.  putting all your hopes on the benevolence of the market
 is, to me, just like putting all your hopes on the benevolence of
 government.
