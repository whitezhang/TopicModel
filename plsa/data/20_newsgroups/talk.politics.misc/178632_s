 err, earth to clayton, you posted this to show that 2% were
 homosexual. so if we assume every homosexual was promiscious, that
 leads us to conclude that 23 percent of heterosexuals are promiscious.
 and that first assumtion is a bad one.
 
 clayton, it *is* suprising from the claims you are making.
