 first of all, i wouldn't have gone after the davidians for a firearms
 violation which i object to in the first place.  second, i wouldn't
 have executed a search warrant via an armed assault when all the
 davidians were sure to have been there.  third of all, i wouldn't have
 cut off all outside communication to koresh.  and i certainly wouldn't
 have gone in with a tank-- time was on the fbis side.  since they had
 outside resupply, they could wait indefinitely.
