 if you want to see environmental disasters, go to eastern europe or some
 parts of the fsu (former soviet union).  this is because they had no
 environmental protection laws and were trying to increase productivity
 at any expense to justify their political systems.  luckily for us, some
 of our politicians with vision passed some environmental laws.  that
 isn't to say that they shouldn't be modified, but all i ever hear from
 you is that the environmental laws were dreamed up by a bunch of
 left-wing tree-huggers intent on putting us back on horseback.  yes,
 there are some of those, but a lot of us simply want to procede with
 caution.
