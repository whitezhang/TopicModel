 i'm not sure why you don't consider it an option.  no one suggests that
 such analysis should be left to "regulators."  in fact, the "re-inventing
 government" movement provides just such a cost/benefit approach to the
 analysis of public spending.  libertarians would do well to learn more
 about it.

 sorry, but it strikes me that it is the only "feasible" approach.  what is
 not feasible is a wholesale attack on all government regulation and 
 licensing that treats cutting hair and practicing medicine as equivalent
 tasks.

 actually, the only areas of public spending above that strike me as 
 generating substantial support among libertarians are police and defense.
 (it is an interesting aside that as committed as libertarians claim to
 be to a principle of non-coercion, the only areas of public spending
 that they frequently support involve hiring people with guns....hmmm...)

 perhaps you have.  may i suggest that you consider that revolutionaries
 frequently generate support by acting as protectors of "geezers," 
 mothers and children.  governments that ignore such people on the grounds
 that "we don't have much to fear" from them do so at their own peril.
