 to answer your irrelevant question, yes a person of color is human,
 but i still don't know what you mean by human being and you have
 merely begged the question without responding.  by trying to inject
 the notion of race into the discussion, you muddy the waters without
 adding any insight whatever.  the same parallel question could
 be "is a polydactyl person a human being?"  you still have not
 answered what you mean by human being.  please do so.

 you won't answer the question and instead drag in irrelevancies.
 if you want a definition of human being that does not depend on
 the vagaries of law, but holds solid whatever the law may rule,
 provide it for me.

 more irrelevancies.  as larry margolis pointed out, the law
 has made special exceptions in order to include fetuses, but does
 not follow your version of human being.  and as he pointed out,
 brain death is not a means of determining who has the rights
 of the living, but rather who has died.  there is a significant
 difference.
 
 what i am wondering now is, has your argument so failed you that
 you feel it necessary to drag out irrelevancies and leave the
 thread you started?  you got answers to your questions when
 you began baiting me, if you recall, after you had made some
 ridiculous remarks about adrienne regard and, having been corrected,
 changed the subject with your remarks about having a discussion
 of substance.  if you really wanted a discussion of substance,
 why then do you disregard logic and substance in order to toss
 silly accussations, e.g. "it really doesn't matter to you..."
 if it matters to you, then why not define human being and seek
 some substance?  you're not going to convince a logical person
 of the rightness of your position unless you apply some logic
 and show some meaning to your words.

 as others point out, one is sacrificed for the other depending on
 which has the better chance at survival.  again, your analogy
 fails.  not precedence, but possession makes a difference here.
 a woman's womb is indisputably her own.  also, i see you ignore
 my statement that you would grant rights to a fetus that would
 not be granted a born human being.  was that due to its inconvenience?

 is it?  please cite a precedent and the basis of the ruling.

 you simply assert things without any support.  your analogy is
 not accurate and your assertions are unsupported.  try this on
 for size.  it is not murder for one siamese twin to kill
 the other in the womb.  there.  we now have equal arguments.
 but the idea is illogical.  for one siamese twin to kill the
 other in the womb would likely be to kill itself as well.  the
 systems are dependent on each other for life.  i'm still struggling
 to see anything analagous here and failing to do so.

 your argument is from fantasy island.  your comparison is a total
 failure, as i have demonstrated already, and has no basis in
 reality, neither legally nor medically.  and for you to assert
 that it is not a perfect comparison because of the impossible,
 that of coercion or oppression, is ridiculous.  as i said,
 you give the analogy too little credit for failure.  on the one
 hand you start this by saying you want to take a real, rather than
 a hypothetical, situation, then you fly off into siamese twins
 murdering one another in the womb or coercing or oppressing each
 other in the womb when the reality of the situation you describe
 in now way matches your version.  as i said before, decisions
 are made regarding which twin lives and dies in situations where
 they cannot both survive.  and, furthermore, as i have already said,
 there is a difference between an equal claim to organs and a claim
 that is unequal.  you seem to be asserting that a fetus has a
 claim on a woman's womb.  when the fetus is born, what happens to
 its claim?  and by what reason do you assert its claim?

 you haven't answered the question.  the situations are not analagous.

 again you avoid the question.  dependence can be transferred, and
 it is not as slow as you seem to think.

 yes, and i'd hate to have been the one to tell dr gunn's children that
 he was murdered by a religious, "pro-life" fanatic.  please do
 try to stay relevant.

 clever comeback.  i congratulate you on the readiness of your wit.

 what happened to that claim to bodily organs where life is at stake?
 why does this parent now have an indisputable right to his or her
 kidney when previously the parent did not, by your standards?  what
 is different about the two situations?  i see i have to spell this
 out for you since the meaning was too subtle for you.  in the one
 case you do not recognize a difference between a fetus and a born
 child (you ask why a born child cannot be abandoned but a fetus
 can), and in this case you recognize a significant difference
 between the fetus and born child where the lives of the two are at
 stake.  you can't have it both ways.  action and inaction are
 irrelevant to the principle, but you are wrong about the inaction
 anyway.  ask any of the numerous women who post here and have
 borne children how inactive their pregnancy was.  to have a
 healthy, live child, a woman does more than hang out, eat as
 she chooses, plays volleyball like she always did, drinks at
 parties with her friends, etc.  she behaves very differently, and
 the provision of her resources to a fetus may be no more voluntary
 than the beating of her heart, but it is far from inactive.
