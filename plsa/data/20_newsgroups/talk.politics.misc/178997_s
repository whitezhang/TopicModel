 ]    now what in the world does this have to do with anything?
 because the hispanic communities in phoenix are high crime areas.
 likewise, in la, certain hispanic communities (with immigrants from certain 
 countries) had high participation in the looting after the riot. others,
 which comprise hispanics with several generations of residency in the us,
 were peaceful.
 
 ]now, check out my .sig (or are you too stupid to learn spanish?)
 what is this.... a bit of pro-hispanic bigotry? want me to put a .sig
 in morse code and challenge you to learn it?
 
 get a life.... give up on the victimology trip!
