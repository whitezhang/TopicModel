 	you don't know much about the fall of diem's government in vietnam.
 	or the traditional indian practice of suttee. people have been
 	burning themselves to death (or willing to go through such and end)
 	for political and religious reasons since the beginning of time.
 	also, death from smoke inhalation is little better than dying from
 	the flames themselves. think about breatning in searing toxic
 	gasses. it's not pleasant.
