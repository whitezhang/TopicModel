 oh good, then i can stop paying for all the diabetics (i'm not at risk)
 and all those coronary bypass operations (low cholesterol runs in my
 family).  
 
 in case you weren't clear on the concept, insurance works because it
 spreads the risk around.  i pay for someone's dialysis, they pay to set
 my broken bones (i'm active in sports).  that way no one pays too much.
 sounds kind of like socialism, doesn't it?
 
 find a different argument against paying for abortions.  they are out
 there.
