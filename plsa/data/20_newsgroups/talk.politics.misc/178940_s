 	able to find clinton's proposed "wiretapping" initiative
 	for our computer networks and telephone systems.
 
 	this 'initiative" has been up before congress for at least
 	the past 6 months, in the guise of the "fbi wiretapping"
 	bill.
 
 	i strongly urge you to begin considering your future.
 
 	i strongly urge you to get your application for a passport
 	in the mail soon.
 
 	i strongly urge you to consider moving any savings you 
 	have overseas, into protected bank accounts, while 
 	you are still able.
