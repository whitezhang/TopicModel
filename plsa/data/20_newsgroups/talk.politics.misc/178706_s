                   statement of president clinton
 
 
 i am deeply saddened by the loss of life in waco today.  my 
 thoughts and prayers are with the families of david koresh's 
 victims.
 
 the law enforcement agencies involved in the waco siege 
 recommended the course of action pursued today.  the attorney 
 general informed me of their analysis and judgment and 
 recommended that we proceed with today's action given the risks 
 of maintaining the previous policy indefinitely.  i told the 
 attorney general to do what she thought was right, and i stand by 
 that decision.
