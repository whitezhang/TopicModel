 in addition, it is ridiculous for this hicks guy from the fbi saying that
 they were just trying to bring them before the bar to face justice, when
 who should really be on trial is every officer involved in the brainless
 batf assault.  granted, it would be tough to convict when the bodies were
 inside, but if you're going to talk about justice then you have to consider
 the gross incompetence and disregard for human life displayed by the atf.
 charge 'em and try 'em!
