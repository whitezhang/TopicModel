 su>there is no truth, only opinions.
 
 i can now understand where you are coming from. how can you go through
 life with out a constent? without truth or a point of reference one
 wonders aimlessly.
 
 su>i'm not wrong, that's just your opinion.
 
 opinion based in fact?
 
 su>this is not an exact science!
 su>as far as i'm concernd, we can agree to differ, but i can not stand people
 su>who think they are right and everybody else is wrong.
 
 then maybe you had better sit down.
 
 su>guido klemans
 
 guido, before you have a hemmorage, maybe we can lighten up, ok. you
 have opinions as do i. flaming at each other will not get us anywhere in
 the understand of our respective positions. i offer a hand of
 friendship, a truce, if it may, so that maybe we can start this
 conversation like gentelmen (i am sorry if that was a mistake, from your
 name i can't tell gender, you know us stupid americans). since you have
 replied to my wife's post you must have some strong feelings about this
 issue. i would like to hear them, and understand them if i can. in
 return all i ask is for you to listen to me, and try to understand why i
 feel the way i do.
 all the yelling and all the hate about this issue just drives the sides
 farther apart, till they forget why they started the fight in the first
 place. if you and i can forster an understand and mutual respect for
 each others views than maybe, and only then really can we come up with a
 solution that is acceptable to us both.
