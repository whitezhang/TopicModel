 not really.  the percentage of gays was low.  headline writers aren't
 noted for accuracy.
 
 # #    a new natonal study on male sexual behavior, the most thorough
 # #    examination of american men's sexual practices published since
 # #    the kinsey report more than four decades ago, shows about 2
 # #    percent of the men surveyed had engaged in homosexual sex and
 # #    1 percent considered themselves exclusively homosexual.
 # #
 # #the article also contains numbers on the number of sexual partners.
 # #the median number of sexual partners for all men 20-39 was 7.3.
 # 
 # #it's a shame that we don't have a breakdown for
 # #straight men vs. gay/bi men -- that would show even more dramatically
 # #how much more promiscuous gay/bi men are.

 # 
 # now let's take a quick look at what you are saying.
 # 
 # the median of a distribution is that variate-value which divides the
 # distribution halfway, i.e. 1/2 of the distribution (population) have
 # lower and half have higher variate-values.
 # 
 # so for males 20-39 the median=7.3, this means that half of these men
 # are higher than this and half are lower than this.  now if the population
 # sample size is 3300, and 1% of them are gay, 33 males are gay.  if we
 
 actually, 2% were either exclusively homosexual, or bisexual.  you aren't
 readiing very carefully.
 
 # say they are distributed equally then only 16.5 are greater than 7.3
 # sexual partners, of course, this means that 49.5% heterosexual men are
 # greater than 7.3.
 # 
 # interesting results.
