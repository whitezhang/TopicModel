 capital and labor are one and the same in a slave economy.  except that
 capital doesn't reproduce quite as readily as slaves did.
 
 slavery was a dying institution before the cotton gin, yes, but not
 in 1850.

 this assumes that the slave holder dominance over state governments
 would not have caused the passage of laws to keep out capital from the
 north.  since slave holders were prepared to do almost anything else
 to destroy free markets in order to maintain slavery, i do not doubt
 that they would have passed laws to cripple any serious competitive
 threat.  thomas sowell's _market and minorities_ argues that the
 maintenance of slavery, and the costs it imposed on state and local
 governments, discouraged not only capital formation, but also outside
 capital investment in the southern states.
