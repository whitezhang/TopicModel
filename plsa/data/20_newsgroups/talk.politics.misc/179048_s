 mr. kuo: i don't recall seeing your byline around much before (at least
 on t.p.m). let me clue you in on this newsgroup. t.p.m is populated
 largely by people whose hatred for the u.s. government, especially
 the government of mr. clinton, is literally boundless. to these
 people, the suggestion that agents of the u.s. government would carry
 out a spectacular massacre of its own citizens, in full view of tv
 cameras, is not an 'extraordinary claim'. it's just another day in
 the life of these united states.
 
 they don't have to suggest any reason why the fbi would want to
 publicly massacre citizens. have you seen 'the crying game'? 
 
 	"it's in their nature".
