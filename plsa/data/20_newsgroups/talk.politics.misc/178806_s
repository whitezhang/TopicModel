 	huh ??
 
 	this kind of shotgun blast deserves either to be elaborated upon,
 or retracted. even if the readers have the slightest idea as to what the
 writer is referring to, it should be incumbent on mr. erwin to back up what
 he says with at least a concrete example of perhaps even a reference or two.
 (for example, "simon zealotes" = the certain apostle having a nickname
 connected to a jewish terrorist group)
 
 	even josephus fails to make the kind of broad brush reference to
 christians made above - he is quite silent as to the fate of the jewish
 christian church in jerusalem, even though he took the time to
 record the death of st. james (brother of st. john). on the subject of the
 fate of jesus's family, including james (the brother of jesus) we learn
 nothing from josephus.
 
 	likewise, tacitus condemns the jews as being a particularly 
 vicious people, getting many of the facts about jewish history wrong in
 the process. but even though tactitus undoubtedly had the opportunity
 to learn much about the christians during his tour in asia minor under
 domitian, we find little to enlighten ourselves about the christians
 in either the _histories_ or the _annals_
 
 	the writer's interpretation of _acts_ is purely subjective as
 stated, and so one might expect him to elaborate a bit on just what aspects
 of "cult psychology" are to be found there. i can think of a thing or two 
 offhand, but i'd like to give mr. erwin the opportunity to demonstrate his own
 knowledge satisfactorily before throwing out any more hints.
