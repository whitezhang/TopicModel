     james madison, federalist paper 41:
 
     "it has been urged and echoed, that the power ``to lay and
      collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises, to pay the debts,
      and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the
      united states,'' amounts to an unlimited commission to exercise
      every power which may be alleged to be necessary for the common
      defense or general welfare...
 
     "no stronger proof could be given of the distress under which
      these writers labor for objections, than their stooping to such a
      misconstruction.  had no other enumeration or definition of the
      powers of the congress been found in the constitution, than the
      general expressions just cited, the authors of the objection
      might have had some color for it; ...  but what color can the
      objection have, when a specification of the objects alluded to by
      these general terms immediately follows, and is not even
      separated by a longer pause than a semicolon?  ...  nothing is
      more natural nor common than first to use a general phrase, and
      then to explain and qualify it by a recital of particulars.
