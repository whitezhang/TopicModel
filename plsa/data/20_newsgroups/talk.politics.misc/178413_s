 of course, one again faces the question of how one circumscribes government
 power (and keeps it circumscribed) in a complex society when it is in the 
 interest of neither capitalists nor consumers to refrain from using 
 government power for their own ends.  but apart from that little 
 conundrum...
 
 it would seem that a society with a "failed" government would be an ideal
 setting for libertarian ideals to be implemented.  now why do you suppose
 that never seems to occur?...

 i wouldn't call it "vague."  i'd call it elastic.  all "regulation" is 
 not necessarily the same.  by opposing all government regulation, some 
 libertarians treat every system from a command economy to those that
 regulate relatively free markets as identical.  that's one reason
 many of the rest of us find their analysis to be simplistic.
