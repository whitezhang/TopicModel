 hehehe!  dontcha just love these carefully constructed arguements?
 
 clayton, babe, please define the word `molest`.  are you using a legal
 term or a proper dictionary term?  molest, as far as i can remember, means
 `to do damage to person(s)`.  my mate, mike, was lured into a woman's parlour
 when he was 14.  is that molestation?  a number of my friends (straight) lost
 their virginity before that.  were they 'molested'?  they told me that they
 thoroughly enjoyed the experience.  i see no damage.  
 
 please stop pushing your objective morality on others.  if you push, people won't
 fall over and say 'ye gads, you're right!', they'll just push back.
 
 have you signed up for that logic course yet?
