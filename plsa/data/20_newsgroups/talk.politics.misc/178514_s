 not true. i am required to have insurance by law. the method of collection

 well here we have the right hoping for more selfish bastards. pity they
 don't look at what 12 years of the regan/bush "selfish bastard" ecconomy
 has done to the country.
 
 elect a selfish bastard government and they will run the country for themselves,

 ultra rich and paid for them by borrowing against the incomes of the middle
 class.
