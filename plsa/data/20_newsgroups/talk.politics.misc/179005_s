 well they could unseal the original warrent (why was i sealed in the
 first place?), release their video & tapes (from their listening devices
 inside the compound) and quit makeing contradictory statements.
 
 do you believe their statement that the children were killed by
 lethal injection?  they later stated that the childrens bodies
 were burned to the point the would be hard to identify.  so
 how did they come up with the lethal injection theory?
