 then why do we really need national health insurance then? wouldn't it just make
 more sense to find some way to cut down on the cost of malpractice insurance?
 
 and maybe that's not such a good thing. i also read somewhere that it is next to
 impossible in canada to litigate against the health system-class action suits
 are nearly impossible, and you can't sue the provincial health officials at all.

 oh no. don't let the ama know about this. they have enough power as it is. ask
 most americans whether they'd like the doctors' lobby to get more powerful.

 well, yeah, tell us about the national defense medical centre outside ottawa.
 theoretically it's limited to service personnel, but some studies i've heard
 about have suggested that about half the patients there are civilians who not
 only have connections but aren't "urgent" at all.
 
 the problem is, in a system where hospitals' annual budgets are approved by the
 government, how do you keep political considerations out of medical decisions?
 i bet that if you're an mp or mpp, or good friends with one, you're put on any
 hospital's "urgent" care list no matter how minor your problem. which is ok 
 unless you're someone who gets bumped off the list for some bigshot.

 hmm. how much difference would it make in the figure of percentage of gnp spent
 on health care if dentistry and optometry were included in the accounting? 
 maybe canada spends proportionately just as much on health care as we do.

 so what happens if the health care systems financially collapse. bob rae, the
 second least popular man in ontario, warned ontarians a few years ago that if
 they didn't stop cross-border shopping in such huge numbers, "the services they
 expect from the province just won't be there in a few years" (fortunately for
 them (and less fortunately for the retailers here in western new york) the 
 canadian dollar went back to a more realistic value). he didn't say so, but i
 knew he meant the ohip. what would happen if his warning turned out to be the 
 truth? would the private insurers take up the slack? they'd be under no 
 obligation to. of course, they could eventually make money again, but if what
 you say is true, they'd be loathe to do so (and out of practice in handling 
 such basic services, too).

 would that it were free. americans would start another revolution if they had
 to pay taxes at canadian rates.

 again, i doubt americans would like giving the insurance companies that much
 power. i half wonder if the canadian health insurers didn't go along with the
 provinces and the federal government years ago because they knew that there was
 a good chance of the public system going bust in the long run, and then 
 afterwards they could clean up (okay, this sort of contradicts what i said
 higher up. but it's another possibility). they'd have an added bonus when 
 arguing against government involvement in their industry-as they could then 
 point to its failure instead of just citing theoretical principles.
