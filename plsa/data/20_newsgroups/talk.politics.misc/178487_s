 either the government has force available to it, or it doesn't.  the
 libertarian position is that the government can use force only when someone
 else uses force first -- even when that first force is not directed
 against the government, but one of its citizens.  that all being true, 
 what safeguards do we have against the government claiming that some
 initiation of force on its part is really a response?  (like the burning
 of the maine, the tonkin gulf incident, or the assault on waco?)
 
 i ask this not to argue, but to understand.
