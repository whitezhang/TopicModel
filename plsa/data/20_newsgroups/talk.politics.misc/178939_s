 i do read av week and don't remember this.  could you supply the date
 of the magazine?  as for c-17 vs. c-5 , the c-17 can't carry as much
 but has more capability ( read : can land at smaller airfields of which
 there are more of ) than the c-5.  now is the c-17 pork?  it depends
 on whether your job relies on it or not.  :)  in california right now,
 i would say that it is not pork since due to peace dividend so many 
 people are out of work.
