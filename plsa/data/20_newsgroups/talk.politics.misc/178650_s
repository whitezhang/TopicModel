 lightly off track, but still relevant: why all the crying
 over the children?  i know we are hardwired to consider
 the future of the race, and comapssionate people are concerned
 for all children; but so what?
 
 for the branch davidians, the options were to die or
 submit to evil[tm] - and have their children's very
 souls lost due to the brain washing of the ungodly
 state.  (to put this in terms the 'average' netter might
 	grasp: they considered it the equivalent of putting
 	jesse helms in charge of nea _and_ mtv.)

 jim jones had won numerous awards from the state before
 he moved to guiana?  obviously state regulation would have
 stopped that tragedy too.
