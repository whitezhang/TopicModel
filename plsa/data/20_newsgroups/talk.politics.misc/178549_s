      wasington -- joining students from across the united states 
 and around the world for the first ever kids earth summit, vice 
 president al gore will travel to orlando, florida, on saturday 
 (4/17) and participate in a special town hall meeting, hosted by 
 linda ellerbee for broadcast on nickelodeon, to hear the young 
 people's concerns and share ideas about the environment.
 
      the vice president will take part in the "kids world 
 council: plan it for the planet" from 2-5 pm (edt) saturday 
 (4/17) in orlando, florida.  he will tour a display of student 
 environmental projects, then videotape the town hall meeting 
 where he will discuss with student delegates their concerns about 
 the environment and their plans for an environmentally sound 
 future.
 
      the town hall meeting will be moderated by linda ellerbee 
 and taped for a news special, "nickelodeon special edition:  plan 
 it for the planet," which will air on sunday, april 18 at 8 pm 
 (edt).  it is sponsored by nickelodeon and the children's earth 
 fund.
 
      "young people care about the environment because they know 
 it affects our future.  across the country and around the world, 
 young people are speaking out about the environmental challenges 
 we face.  they are identifying problems, thinking about 
 solutions, and they are demanding action from their leaders," the 
 vice president said.
 
      the kids world council delegates are meeting for three days 
 in orlando to discuss how to save energy and switch to renewable 
 energy.  they will be following the format and goals of the earth 
 summit that took place last year in rio de janeiro.  the vice 
 president led the senate delegation to the earth summit.
 
      "i look forward to hearing what young people have to say 
 about the environment and their future.  their insight into the 
 world around us is important," the vice president said.
