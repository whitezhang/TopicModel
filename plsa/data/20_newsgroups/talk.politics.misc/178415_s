 this show is just part of the american propaganda against any
 government run by muslims (iran, sudan, algeria (remember democracy?)
 pakistan, palestine (sorry, occupied territories), and many others.
 we must stop this idea that a government which does not fully
 agree with american policies is not evil and dangerous as the media
 attempts to portray it.
