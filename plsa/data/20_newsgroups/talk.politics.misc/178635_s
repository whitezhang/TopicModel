 [much blathering on the role of military forces in
 enforcing civil law deleted]
 
 the main problem with trying to get the military involved in police work
 is the differences in the missions.
 
 the police take names, try and find out what happened,
 stop suspects (thats the meaning of 'arrest') and
 turn them over to the custody of the judicial branch
 for the adjudication of their case.
 
 the military's mission is to kill the enemy before
 they can escape or surrender.
