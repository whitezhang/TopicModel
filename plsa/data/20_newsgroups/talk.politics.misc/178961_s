 also, note that the vat in canada, called the gst, was always
 there in a hidden form as a manufacturers' wholesale tax.  it
 was reconfigured to be visible, and is not a new tax ... but
 retailers taking a free price hike during the transition did
 make it a new tax *in practice* until some prices finally did
 get rolled back when the private sector quietly realized that 
 they had shot themselves in the foot (at least relieved that
 the tories took the heat, not themselves --- but the writing
 was on the wall).
