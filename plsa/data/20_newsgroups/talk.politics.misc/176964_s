    i would like to go on record as objecting to mr. hentrich calling
 himself an aryan.  the word `aryan' is of sanskrit origin and occurs first
 in the hindu scripture, the rigveda.  it seems to have been a tribal term
 but may have had connotations of good character.  such connotations
 are quite explicit in the sayings of the buddha who called his religion the
 eightfold aryan path.   the word was borrowed by the german scholar
 max mueller who used it as a synonym for `indo-european', but then the
 nazis proceeded to steal it and started pretending that `aryan' is
 synonymous with `nordic' which seems highly unlikely.  the people who
 originally called themselves aryas,  the iranians, noprth indians, the afghans
 and possibly the kurds, are none of them nordic.  so the use of the word
 by westerners, though meant with apparent good humor in this case, is
 nontheless inappropriate.  the only westerners who may have some claim
 to call themselves aryans (by descent) are the celts who seem to have wor-
 shipped a god called aryaman who is mentioned in the rigveda.
 
   if you want to check what i am saying, look at  mallory's book, ``in
 search of the indo-europeans" or, just look at the encyclopedia britannica.
 the reason this usage is offensive is that most of ancient indian literature
 as well as religion is directly or inderectly due to the aryans and
 for westerners to butt in is really not nice, not to mention the horrible
 things done by germans to jews, using a word to which the germans have
 no clear claim.
