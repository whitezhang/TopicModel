 yo--earth to clayton--*my* philosophy?  i have never discussed this with you.
 i know it's a minor point, but, gee, dude, you have no idea what economic
 and political principles i adhere to.  but don't let that stop you--you're on a
 roll.  just ascribe to me whatever you want--i know you'll choose wisely.
 after all, i *do* believe in personal responsibility.

 duh.  what else would you *expect* a socialist to do?

 (a) just when and where have i encouraged people not to be responsible
 for themselves?  be specific--but do make up random dates and heinous
 acts as you see fit.
 
 (b) you and i have encouraged many people to do many things.  how does that
 in any way make our audiences less responsible for their actions?  is there
 a finite amount of responsibility, so (cf. conservation of energy) as
 i become more responsible for an occurrence by encouraging it the actual
 perpetrator becomes correspondingly less so?  at what point does the
 perpetrator become completely innocent altogether?  you know, this lends
 a whole new meaning to the term "the moral high ground".

 i will pass the info on.  out of curiosity, what kind of jobs would these
 be?  what's the demographic mix wrt race, age, culture?

 life's a bitch, ain't it?  man, you've got to get out of fornicalia--have
 you considered someplace perhaps geographically distant but politically
 more friendly to you, like, say, indiana?  or maybe utah?

 i don't doubt it, but unless you can show me statistics to the contrary
 i will persist in my apparently dogmatic socialist belief (hey, if *you* say
 so) that most afdc money really does--for better or worse in the long
 term--feed fdcs.
