 please point out where i have said i even _was_ a member of that group,
 much less asked to be treated as such, much less insisted upon it.

 wait a minute.  you've been claiming for quite a while now that
 pedophilia, according to ca state law, is a sexual orientation.  now
 your position is that the law doesn't specifically exclude it?
 
 you know damn well what's going to happen.  some guy in a nambla
 t-shirt's going to apply at a day-care, they're going to turn him down,
 he's going to take it to court, and the court's going to rule that
 sexual orientation is defined as homosexuality, heterosexuality, or
 bisexuality.
 
 unless and until that court decides that pedophilia is a sexual
 orientation, you have no business saying so.

 despite the fact that all homosexuals are lying bastards?

 ah.
 
 so, for example, you are opposed to the civil rights act of 1964?

 there's no "for purposes of this act, the term 'sexual orientation' will
 be defined as" section?  no definitions anywhere?  did they run this
 through the state congress on an accelerated schedule or something?
