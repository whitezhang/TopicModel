 as a latter-day saint, i found john's statement *not at all* ludicrous...
 
 please allow me to explain myself.  in 1838, the governor of missouri,
 governor boggs, issued his so-called "mormon extermination order."  the
 only crime ("illegal activity") the latter-day saints had committed, was
 their religious affiliation, their anti-slave stance (missouri still
 allowed slave practices), and their growing numbers/influence in missouri.
 
 i guess the mormons "got what they deserved," because they refused to bow
 to the will of (corrupt and evil) secular authorities. this "disobedience"
 brought upon them persecution, murder, and finally forced expulsion from
 their lands and settlements...
 
 in the 1850s, the so-called "utah-war" was forced upon the early mormon
 settlers, and their "illegal activities" consisted no less in living as
 their conscience dictated, and to be sovereign/independant in utah's
 (or "deseret territory" as it was called at the time) constitutional
 daily affairs.  (in order to subdue this clear threat to the survival of
 the united states of america, an entire army under the command of general
 johnson (hence "johnson's army"), invaded the territory to "restore"
 uncle sam's law and order...)
 
 history has the uncanny ability to draw certain parallels between events
 that might appear unrelated, but are very much the same in spirit and
 intent.  that same mob- or persecution-prone attitude is to be found in
 this user-group: when we tried to organize "soc.religion.mormon" and/or
 "talk.religion.mormon," a whole bunch of "charitable" believers effectively
 blocked our intent to create a group to discuss topics related to mormonism
 et al in an appropriate forum.  we really must be a "threat" to various
 establishments...  frustrating our legitimate rights for proper representa-
 tion also belongs in the category of persecution.  it is ironic that those
 who oppose us, point to all kinds of "justifications" to do so, despite
 their claims of adhering to a gospel of love...
 
 in any regard, mormon history alone indicates that secular authorities (and
 i don't even discuss how uthan's were suckered into allowing part of their
 lands in becoming nerve-gas and atomic bomb testing grounds...) is far from
 being trusted or righteous.  have things really changed for the better?  i
 may be a born cynic, but i have no reason whatsoever that such has been the
 case. in the early 1980s, i believe, the late president kimball (lds church
 leader), strongly protested federal attempts to locate the mx-"peace keeper"
 missile maze from being built in utah (yet another "inspired" decision from
 secular authorities).  fortunately, his opposition was influential enough
 for the feds to back off.
 
 lest anyone believe i do not believe in government: i do, but not without
 questioning the wisdom and constitutionality of their decisions and
 resolves.  the government's actions around the mt. carmel compound in waco
 was not wise, neither was it necessary.  david koresh did not pose a great
 threat to the federal authorities or the security of this nation, and with
 john, i too wonder who or what's next...
 
 #|> we used to live in a country where everyone enjoyed the free exercise

 #
 #does that include the right to murder little children?  how about killing
 #atf officers?  i do not know much about the gun laws in texas, but
 #koresh's folks claimed to have grenades, grenade launchers, and rocket
 #launchers.  i am not sure that the nra feels that this falls under
 #"right to bear arms."
 
 who killed who?  what constitutional right did the atf officers have to
 invade upon private land and to force themselves into the compound?
 what really caused the "murder" of the little children?  could it be that
 the atf/fbi presence has any bearing upon the events?  how would you
 interpret the mt. masada events?  --blame the jews?  (what the heck did
 the romans do there anyway?  what business did the atf/fbi has in waco,
 texas???)  the branch davidians never posed any threat to society.
 
 david koresh, no doubt, will be described as the "evil" guy (by the
 executioners), while the actions of all those "valiant and brave" officers
 may have been "regrettable," but alas, "necessary" to serve some dubious
 public/national interest. --i guess they are still figuring it out how to
 sell this one to the nation...

 read-your-history.  it has happened (as explained above in some detail),
 and will undoubtedly happen again. indeed, who is next.  so-called "illegal
 activities" can be twisted and bend to suit anyone's need, including the
 agendas of secular authorities...
