 this statement is just so blatantly disgusting and free of any implicit
 neural activity that i will almost completely ignore it.

 sigh.  it's so amusing to watch bigots point fingers at what they imagine to
 be other bigots.  i do believe this person meant "bean *counting*".  and are
 you trying to suggest that only hispanics eat beans?  or that they even have
 a monopoly on eating beans?  or that this person is seriously promoting what
 is obviously a tongue-in-cheek .sig?
 
 you must have a brain somewhere, if you can cause your fingers to type.  use
 it.
