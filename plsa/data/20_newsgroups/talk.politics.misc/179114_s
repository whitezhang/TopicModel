 i don't expect to be hired based on my sexual orientation.  if someone
 decides he wants a gay-only staff of employees, that's his business.
 i won't force him to hire heterosexuals; please don't force me to
 hire homosexuals.

 no.  i'm saying it's none of the government's business what two
 consenting adults do in private.  you don't believe that, unfortunately.
