 but it is made false by your ridiculous leap of logic from "monogamous
 homosexual male sex is so rare" (which is a load of horseshit--as
 proportionately many queers are monogamous as hets, and the ones who aren't
 use condoms, for the most part) to "for practical purposes, homosexuality
 spreads aids."  no.  unprotected sex with an infected partner spreads aids. 
 these "practical purposes" you speak of are obviously the purposes of
 spreading homophobia, which leads me to an interesting truth: "cramer
 spreads hate."  isn't that nice?

 you mean, "typical homosexual response to clayton e. cramer."  i think any
 human being would react that way to someone as contemptibly hateful as you,
 actually.  i seem to hear the same sort of thing coming from your posts, you
 know....
