 the alt.* hierarchie is created for 2 purposes:
 1. for groups which do not fit under the comp.* or other 'official'
   hierarchies
 2. for the fast creation of hot new newsgroups like alt.gulf.war
 
 because there is no voting process or any other control facilities,
 sites are free to decide not to carry (some of) the alt groups.
 
 therefore, it is (i think) desirable to try to create comp.graphics.
 {raytrace, rendering or whatever} and not an alt-group
