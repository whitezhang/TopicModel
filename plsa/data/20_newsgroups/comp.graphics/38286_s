 on sunsite.unc.edu in pub/multimedia/utilities/unix find 
  mpeg_play-2.0.tar.z.
 
 i find for mono it works best as mpeg_play -dither threshold 
    though you can use            mpeg_play -dither mono
 
 face it, this is not be the best viewing situation.
 
 also someone has made a patch for mpeg_play that gives two more mono
 modes  (mono2 and halftone).
 
 they are by jan@pandonia.canberra.edu.au (jan newmarch).
 and the patch can be found on csc.canberra.edu.au (137.92.1.1) under
 /pub/motif/mpeg2.0.mono.patch.
