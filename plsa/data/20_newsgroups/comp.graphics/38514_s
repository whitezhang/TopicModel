 
 we have a minivas-2 and we want to record to an abekas a66.
 we have most of the functions working but when we go to
 set up a record the minivas hangs. we are sending the
 abekas smpte time code. does anyone have code we can
 compare to what we have done and is there and ftp site
 for minivas and abekas code.
