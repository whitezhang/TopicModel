 if you read the last couple of books in the series closely (well, #3 and #4
 at least), there are at least two points at which the real question is
 implied.  conversations proceed much like:
 
 zaphod: what *is* the ultimate question, i wonder?
 arthur (not paying much attention to zaphod, but needing a random seed for
   the infinite improbability drive): think of a number, any number.
 
 actually, it may be marvin who uses this phrase a few times as well, and
 everytime it's arranged such that "think of a number, any number" could be
 an answer to someone's question about the question.
 
 i kind of like it.  very mystifying.  it's not even "pick a number" or
 "tell me a number", just "think of one".
