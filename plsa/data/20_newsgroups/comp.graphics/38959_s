 there are several crt-to-film writers around. agfa has some, they also might
 be called matrix?, and i am pretty sure other companies sell the same
 equipment. you might want to talk to any company in your area that does
 presentation slides or offers graphics services. they should have those
 machines and they might point you to a local vendor. from there on it's all
 a question of money. they units are essentially high res crts plus a filter
 wheel plus a 35mm camera and a computer hook-up.
