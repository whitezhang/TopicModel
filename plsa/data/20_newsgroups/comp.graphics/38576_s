 
 i am looking for some information of hidden line removal using roberts
 algorithm.  something with code, or pseudo code would be especially
 helpful.
 
 i am required to do this for a class, due monday (we have very little
 time to implement these changes, it is a very fast paced class).  the
 notes given in class leave a lot to be desired, so i would vastly
 appreciate any help.
 
 actually any algorithm would be nice (roberts or no).  the main problem
 is two objects intersecting in x and y dimensions, need to know which
 lines to clip off so that one object will appear in front of another.
 
 if you can give me an ftp address and filename, or even the name of a
 good book, i'd really appreciate it.
 
 thanks,
 brian raynor
