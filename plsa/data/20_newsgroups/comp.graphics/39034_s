 i worked in support for a while at a company and we had problems with several
 toshiba 1600's in a short space of time. they were all around 2 years old.
 some screens went completely (as above), others were just "dodgy".
 
 this happened to about 5 or 6 out of, maybe 100. they were fairly reliable up
 to then and i don't think it was a special problem with tosh's (no link to the
 company). so i would think that 21 months may not be unreasonable - just
 unlucky!
