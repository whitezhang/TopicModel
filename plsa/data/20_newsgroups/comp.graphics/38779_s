 i am looking for a small utility that will convert a microsoft video (avi)
 file to an autodesk animator pro (flc) file. since avis also contain sound,
 it would be nice if this utility also stored the sound track as a wav or voc
 file. currently i'm accomplishing this by saving the avi as multiple dibs
 using video for windows, then converting each dib to a gif, then loading the
 gifs into animator. for the sound, i load the original avi into wavedit and
 save it as a seperate wav file. this requires too many steps to be productive.
 
 any help will be greatly appreciated.
 
           thanks
              don
