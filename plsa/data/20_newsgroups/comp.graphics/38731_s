 
 	i was recently talking to a possible employer ( mine! :-) ) and he made a reference to a
 48-bit graphics computer/image processing system.  i seem to remember it being called image or
 something akin to that.  anyway, he claimed it had 48-bit color + a 12-bit alpha channel.  that's
 60 bits of info--what could that possibly be for?  specifically the 48-bit color?  that's 280
 trillion colors, many more than the human eye can resolve.  is this an anti-aliasing thing?  or
 is this just some magic number to make it work better with a certain processor.
 
 	also, to settle a bet with my roommate, what are sgi's flagship products?  i know of
 iris, indigo, and crimson, but what are the other ones, and which is their top-of-the-line?
 (sadly, i have access to none of them.  just a dec 5000/25.  sigh.)
