 the 68070 _does_ exist. it's number was licensed to philips to make their
 own variant. this chip includes extra featurfes such as more i/o ports, 
 i2c bus... making it more microcontroller like.
 
 because of the confusion with numbering (!), philips other products in the
 [range with the 68??? core have been given differend numbers like pcf...
 or pcd7.. or something.
