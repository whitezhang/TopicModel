 sorry for wasting your time with a probably simple question, but i'm not
 an computer graphic expert. i want to read tiff-files with a pascal-program.
 the problem is, that the files i want to read are in compressed form 
 ( code 1, e.g. huffman ). all books & articles i found describe only the
 plain (uncompressed) format. i don't know where to get the original
 tiff specification, furthermore i haven't any access to a realy complete
 library. can anybody direct me to a good book or (even better) to an 
 specification available via ftp ?
 
 thanks in advance - thomas wolf
 
 ps: direct mail would be prefered
