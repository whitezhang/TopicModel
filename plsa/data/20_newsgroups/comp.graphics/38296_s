 
 i don't have nor imagine nor real 3d, but as old
 amiga user i think you should take a look also to 
 real 3d 2.0 for the amiga. i saw imagine 2.0 on the
 amiga for a long time at my friend's home, and
 i've seen r3d 2.0 in action at bit.movie 93 in riccione,
 italy (an italian computer graphics contest).
 many professionals using 3d studio on pc, softimage
 for silicon graphics and imagine on the amiga were 
 *very impressed* by the power of this programs.
 sorry, i've lost the posting with full description 
 of features of this great program.
 
 for more informations give a look in comp.sys.amiga.graphics.
 
 representative of activa international told me that
 it will be out in 2 weeks for the amiga and that
 pc ms-windows, silicon indigo and unix version are 
 under development.
 
 ciao,
 	sergio
