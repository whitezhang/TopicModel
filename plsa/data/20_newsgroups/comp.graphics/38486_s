 don't get too excited; signetics, not motorola, gave the 68070 its number.
 the 68070, if i understand rightly, uses the 68000 instruction set, and has
 an on-chip serial port and dma.  (it will run at up to 15 mhz--i'm typing
 at a computer using a 68070 running at that rate, so i know that it can
 do so--so i seriously doubt the clock rate that ricardo@rchland.vnet.ibm.com
 claims.)
