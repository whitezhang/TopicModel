 within a few months, i'll be looking for a job in 3d computer graphics
 software.  i'm in need of info on companies that do it.  there's nothing
 in any of the faq's for this group, and nothing at siggraph.org (at least
 i couldn't find anything.)  the last computer graphics career handbook was
 dated 1991, had info on 40 companies, but nothing specific on any of them.
 
 can people please direct me towards more current and detailed sources of
 information?  i'll post a summary of sources if there's interest.
 
 also, could you please e-mail me, our news server is on the fritz. :(
 
 thanks,
 brandon
