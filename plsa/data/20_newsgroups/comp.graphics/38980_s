 i suppose you don't know what about we have discussed.
 we discussed about error(s) in xv 2.21 which shows images only as 8bit,
 and my suggestion above works perfectly with it.
 
 so far i have seen a colormap editing window in xv -- that is, there
 must be a colormap anyway. the problems you present are exist anyway,
 and i didn't tried to solve them at all, because i would not make such
 problems to my programs in the first place.
 
 gamma and color corrections are easily done to 24bit image
 as i presented. there's no need make tricks from 8bit/quantized image
 back to 24 bit image.

 ok, you're writing about situation that user want edit images as 24bit
 and user want edit individual colors -- your questions, by the way,
 jumps off the discussion a bit.
 
 my solution doesn't work, because there's no colormap withing real 24bit
 image -- you see, user see 24bit image; going back to 8bit is silly.
 
 
 about changing individual colors in 8bit/quantized/rasterized image:
 changing individual colors in colormap is useless in most
 cases if the image is quantized and rasterized -- small change may
 make serious errors to anywhere in the image.
 xv allows this feature, but i don't recommend to use it with the
 mentioned type images.
 
 moreover, xv is not a paint program; you can only make those global
 changes. in full 24bit xv, changing individual colors sounds like
 paint program job.
 if person have 8bit screen, there's need for tricks to get the
 original 24bit image modified. because user don't see full 24bit
 image, there's need to make approximations and it is not possible to
 modify individual colors but individual pixels or pixel groups (if
 image is rasterized). to select indiavidual color, there could be 7x7
 cursor window which shows true color image in cursor window area --
 selecting individual color is possible from that.
 
 ok, i don't have thought very much 24bit painting programs, never seen
 such in good view and are not planned to make such. not to mention
 24bit painting program in 8bit screen...
 
 
 >yes again. what *is* (was?) wrong with xv?
 
 it saved 8bit/quantized/rasterized images as 24bit jpegs; jpeg is not
 designed for that.
 also, human expect that 24bit will be saved as 24bit image; say,
 person would like to crop part of the image and save it, then it is
 expected that the image still is the same. so, xv were designed
 without thinking about human interface and how human expect the
 program work -- design error.
 
 i have heard xv were designed first for 8bit images/files, but
 it were not good idea to take full 24bit images without making
 major change to the original design.
 
 so, even all screen images are 8bit, the processed images and saved
 images could have been 24bit very easily, instead of 8bit.
 
 before anybody will make a note: yes, i may as well make a lift where
 'up' means that the lift goes down and 'down' means that the lift goes
 up, and put a note on this design solution to the manuals -- however,
 even the manuals tells the correct situation, it doesn't solve the problem.
 (americans: the lift is just an example :)
 
 
 well, my text may be a bit hard reading, hopefully you suggeeded to
 read it.
