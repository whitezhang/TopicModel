 the april 1993 edition of mix magazine carries a story on 3do which
 includes pictures of the unit, a schematic of what's inside and some
 indication from the people at 3do as to where they intend to go and in
 what stages. (mix is a trade rag aimed at the professional sound
 engineering community.)
 
 the schematic shows a central dma engine connecting and mediating between
 two graphics animation processors (32 bit bus), a 32-bit risc processor
 with math co-processor, video decomp module, a control port, an expansion
 port (where 3do hangs its double-fast cd player), 1mb dram, an optional
 video port (for editing video) and on the outbound side 1mb vram to video
 processor to tv chain parallel with a dsp to sound chain. 
 
 they promise red book cd-quality audio, full 30 fps video and a future
 connection path to your pc via a pc expansion card.
 
 i am not informed enough to have an opinion about the various means and
 methods discussed here. the article, written by philip de lancie, does
 cover the other machines mentioned in this thread.  i come from the pc
 tcp/ip world and see a tremendous potential for bringing connectedness to
 the educated consumer; 3do seems to have the right business partners to
 make this happen. 
 
 hope this helps.
