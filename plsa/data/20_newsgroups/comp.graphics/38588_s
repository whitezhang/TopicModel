 i am interested in a 2d/3d graphics library which will allow our design
 team to write graphics software for unix workstations and be as portable as 
 possible.  eventually this software will have to be moved to microsoft
 windows.  it is my opinion that a good api with hooks to pex underneath
 would prove most portable.
 
 does anyone out there have any experience with figaro+ form tgs or
 hoops from ithaca software?  i would appreciate any comments.
