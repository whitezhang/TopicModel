 	i am unable to run quicktime 1.5 on my iivx running system 7.1, and
 	i don't know why. (if there is a better group to post this to, please
 	let me know.) quicktime 1.0 works fine, but when i try to run a movie
 	in any application that supports it, like simple player, canvas or
 	word, i get the message "sorry a system error occurred '<application>'
 	unimplemented trap <continue> <restart>", i press <continue> and get
 	"the application 'unknown' has unexpectedly quit, because an error of
 	type 12 occurred." substitute simple player or canvas or word for
 	'<application>, and the messages are always the same. if i restart with
 	quicktime 1.0, i have no problems. any suggestions? i am at a loss.
 		thanks in advance. oh yah, please email me as i don't check
 		the newsgroups very often.
