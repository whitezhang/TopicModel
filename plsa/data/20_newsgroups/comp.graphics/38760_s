 they are 3d object files for cad 3d 2.0, a program written by tom hudson
 for the atari st computers.  don't know much more about them except that
 they are stored with the points first, then the surfaces are next, and are
 made by listing 3 point numbers that make up the triangle surface. then
 there's a header that describes coloring, lighting, etc.  don't know much
 more than this, hope this helps.
