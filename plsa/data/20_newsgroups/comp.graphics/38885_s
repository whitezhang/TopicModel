 hi netters,
 
 	i'm doing a project which is about image analysis.  firstly, i
 have to find out any restrictions or limitations on the colour display
 on various kind of workstations, they are decstation, hp, amiga, apollo.
 
 	secondly, i read from some graphic texts that image is displayed
 in 24 bites(please point out to me if i got it wrong).  but, the images
 which i will deal with are displayed in 16 bites by the software they
 are using currently.  so, will there be any problems to display them
 under x-windows in the future? because we are thinking to implement the
 gui by x-windows for our project
 
 
 	is there any person here can help me to solve the problem or
 query above?  or, give me some advice or suggestion where i can find
 them out. 
 
 	please send me an e-mail if there are any.  thanks in advance.
 
 
 
 						yours
