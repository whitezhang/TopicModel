 i usually use "algorithms for graphics and image processing" by
 theodosios pavlidis, but other people here got them same idea and now
 3 of 4 copies in the libraries have been stolen!
 
 another reference is "digital image processing" by gonzalez and
 wintz/wood, which is widely available but a little expensive ($55
 here- i just checked today).
