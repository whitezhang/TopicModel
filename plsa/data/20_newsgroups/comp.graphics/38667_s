 scott,
 	i'm not so sure if this is helpful, but i usually use xv v2.21.  i use sun ipcs and ipxs, and it works fine.  it can display in a good number of ways.(root being one of them)  it's also possible to have xv put up a background automatically at login.  hope this helps.

 btw  xv v2.21 is on anonymous ftp somewhere. (archie fer it!)
