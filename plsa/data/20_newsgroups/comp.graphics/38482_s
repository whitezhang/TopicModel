 i need some help.  we are upgrading our animation/video editing stand. we
 are looking into the different type of setups for a/b roll and a cuts only
 station.  we would like this to be controlled by a computer ( brand doesnt matter but maybe mac, or amiga).  low end to high end system setups would be very
 helpful. if you have a system or use a system that might be of use, could you
 mail me your system requirements, what it is used for, and all the hardware and
 software that will be necessary to set the system up.  if you need more 
 info, you  can mail me at   eylerken@u.washington.edu
 
 thanks in advance.
