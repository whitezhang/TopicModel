 i'm looking for algorithms or articles on virtual sound. what i want to do is
 the following;
 
 from a fast source, eg. a cdrom, several sound sources are read, each having
 it's own defined position and other attributes, eg. direction etc.  given the
 listeners position and direction, the sum of sound played back in each of the
 listeners earphones will be a function of this position and direction.  this
 means that some simulation of the ears coloring of sound relative to it's
 incoming direction have to be done for each sound source.  (i think this is
 possible to do with a lookup table of impulse responses for several angles
 relative to each ear, and interpolate an impulse function from this for a given
 angle.  this impulse function could then be convoluted with the sound from the
 source.  this impulse function must be changed every time some sound source
 changes position or the listener changes orientation.)  additionally some
 reflection, diffusion and absorbtion due to the environment wich is defined
 could be simulated, but this requires some sort of sound propagandation
 simulation, kinda like some radiosity algorithm.  
 
 have someone done this and/or written articles on implementing such a system? 
 
 please post or mail any answers or comments.
