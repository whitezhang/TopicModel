 hi:
 
 i am digitizing a ntsc signal and displaying on a pc video monitor.
 it is known that the display response of tubes is non-linear and is
 sometimes said to follow gamma-law. i am not certain if these
 non-linearities are "gamma-corrected" before encoding ntsc signals
 or if the tv display is supposed to correct this.
  
 also, if  256 grey levels, for example, are coded in a c program do
 these intensity levels appear with linear brightness on a pc
 monitor? in other words does pc monitor display circuitry
 correct for "gamma errrors"?
  
 your response is much appreciated.
  
 amjad.
