 
 hi! everyone,
 
 because no one has touched the problem i posted last week, i guess
 my question was not so clear. now i'd like to describe it in detail:
 
 the offset of an ellipse is the locus of the center of a circle which
 rolls on the ellipse. in other words, the distance between the ellipse
 and its offset is same everywhere.
 
 this problem comes from the geometric measurement when a probe is used.
 the tip of the probe is a ball and the computer just outputs the
 positions of the ball's center. is the offset of an ellipse still
 an ellipse? the answer is no! ironically, dmis - an american indutrial
 standard says it is ellipse. so almost all the software which was
 implemented on the base of dmis was wrong. the software was also sold
 internationaly. imagine, how many people have or will suffer from this bug!!!
 how many qualified parts with ellipse were/will be discarded? and most
 importantly, how many defective parts with ellipse are/will be used?
 
 i was employed as a consultant by a company in los angeles last year
 to specially solve this problem. i spent two months on analysis of this
 problem and six months on programming. now my solution (nonlinear)
 is not ideal because i can only reconstruct an ellipse from its entire
 or half offset. it is very difficult to find the original ellipse from
 a quarter or a segment of its offset because the method i used is not
 analytical. i am now wondering if i didn't touch the base and make things
 complicated. please give me a hint.
 
 i know you may argue this is not a cg problem. you are right, it is not.
 however, so many people involved in the problem "sphere from 4 poits".
 why not an ellipse? and why not its offset?
 
 please post here and let the others share our interests 
 (i got several emails from our netters, they said they need the
 summary of the answers).
