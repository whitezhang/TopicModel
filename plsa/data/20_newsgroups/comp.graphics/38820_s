 [deleted for space; basically complaints that xv is an 8 bit program and that
 making several modifications to the rgb sliders is slow because of screen updates.]
 
 in reverse order:
 
 1) try clicking in the auto-apply box to switch it off. then make your mods. then
 click on apply. there is no problem as stated; it has already been solved if you
 look carefully.
 
 2) yes xv is an 8 bit program. this is not a bug. you can edit individual pallette
 entries or do global colour changes; crop, scale etc. clearly the program must
 save out the *altered* image else all your work would be thrown away. so yes it
 saves out 8 bit images - of course!
 
 xv can import 24 bit images and quantises them down to 8 bits. this is a handy
 facility, not a bug.
 
 how would you suggest doing colour editing on a 24 bit file? how would you group
 'related' colours to edit them together? only global changes could be done
 unless the software were very different and much more complicated.
 
 if you want to do colour editing on a 24 bit image, you need much more powerfull
 software - which is readily available commercially.
 
 and lastly, jpeg is a compression algorithm. it can be applied to any image of
 arbitrary bit depth. again, this is not a bug. it is a way of saving disk space
 ;-)
 
 later,
