 does anyone out there in net-land have any information on the cobra 2.20 
 card?  the sticker on the end of the card reads
         model: cobra 1-b-1
         bios:  cobra v2.20
 
 i havn't been able to find anything about it from anyone!  if you have 
 any information on how to get a hold of the company which produces the 
 card or know where any drivers are for it, please let me know!
 
 as far as i can tell, it's a cga card that is taking up 2 of my 16-bit 
 isa slots but when i enable the test patterns, it displays much more than 
 the usualy 4 cga colors... at least 16 from what i can count.. thanks!
