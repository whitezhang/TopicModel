 i've got the 6.0 spec (obviously since i quoted it in my last posting). 
 my gripe about tiff is that it's far too complicated and nearly
 infinitely easier to write than to read, which i think hurts your
 acceptance by anything that will need to read those images (e.g.,
 paint programs).
 
 in a nutshell, i don't think tiff is salvageable unless the fat is
 trimmed significantly- and then it wouldn't be tiff anymore.  they
 keep trying to cut it back, but it's late now.  maybe they >will< fix it,
 and change that magic number to signify the lack of compatibility. 
 that would probably make me happy.
