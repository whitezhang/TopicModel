 actually i am trying to write something like this but i encounter some
 problems, amongst them:
 
 - drawing a 3d wireframe view of a quadric/quartic requires that you have
 the explicit equation of the quadric/quartic (x, y, z functions of some
 parameters). how to convert the implicit equation used by pov to an
 explicit one? is it mathematically always possible?
 
 i don't have enough math to find out by myself, has anybody heard about
 useful books on the subject?
