 i need information on the display postscript strokeadjust feature.
 this feature adjusts the endpoints of lines so that the displayed line
 looks better on low resolution devices.
 
 the postscript literature explains the process to some extent.  they
 also give an example of how to "emulate" strokeadjust in postscript
 environments where it is absent.
 
 the suggested emulation is to modify the coordinates of the endpoints
 of a line using the following formula for each coordinate:
 
 	new_coord = (round (old_coord - 0.25)) + 0.25
 	
 doing this we end up with all coordinates ending in ".25".  from
 reading i thought that what they might actually do is:
 
 	new_coord = ((trunc (old_coord * 2)) / 2) + 0.25
 	
 this results in all the coordinates ending in either "0.25" or "0.75" 
 whichever is closer.
 
 by doing some actual comparisons with display postscript, i find that
 neither of these is what dps really uses.  since i like how the dps
 result looks better than how my stuff looks, i'd like to know if
 anyone who knows how dps does it is willing/able to tell me.
 
 thanks,
