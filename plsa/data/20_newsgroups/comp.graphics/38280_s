 hi,
 
   i'm looking for an algorithm that would generate a good cross-section of
 rgb colours given a limited colour map size. 
 
 the problem: i'm writing an application for the pc that may have at most 256
 colors. i want to use one colormap (palette) for the application but i'd like
 it to contain an even spread of colours of the visible spectrum. i could use 
 a 6x6x6 rgb cube but the problem is that a lot of those colours are almost
 identical to the human eye. 
 
 does anyone know how i can optimize my choice of colors ?
