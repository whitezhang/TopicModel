 the most ridiculous example of vr-exploitation i've seen so far is the
 "virtual reality clothing company" which recently opened up in vancouver. as
 far as i can tell it's just another "chic" clothes spot. although it would be
 interesting if they were selling "virtual clothing"....
 
 e-mail me if you want me to dig up their phone # and you can probably get
 some promotional lit.
