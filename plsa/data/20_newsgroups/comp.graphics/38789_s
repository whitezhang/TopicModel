 could anyone tell me the format of gif files.  i would like to know how i 
 could determine the size of the picture.  also, are gif files in compressed
 format?  how many bits store pixel color information?  
 
 (this is probally a simple question, but i couldn't find it in the faq.)
 
 email responses would be perferred
