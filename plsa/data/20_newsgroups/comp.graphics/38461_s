 i understand there have been a couple of raves in la billing themselves as
 "virtual reality" parties. what i hear they do is project .gif images around
 on the walls, as well as run animations through a newtek toaster.
 
 seems like we need to adopt the term really virtual reality or something, except
 for the non-immersive stuff which is virtually really virtual reality.
