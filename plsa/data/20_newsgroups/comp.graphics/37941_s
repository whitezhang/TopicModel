 they need a hit software product to encourage software sales of the product,
 i.e. the pong, pacman, visicalc, dbase, or pagemaker of multi-media.
 there are some multi-media and digital television products out there already,
 albeit, not as capable as 3do's.  but are there compelling reasons to buy
 such yet?  perhaps someone in this news group will write that hit software :-)
