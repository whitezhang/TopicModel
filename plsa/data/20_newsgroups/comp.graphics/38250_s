 unfortunately the poster wants to use an internal and an external modem so a
 switch isn't going to help them.  if you aren't using your com ports for
 anything else, just define them on different com ports.  define your internal
 modem to be say, com1, and your external modem to be com3.  you really
 shouldn't have to worry about interrupt conflicts since you won't be using
 both modems at the same time :).
