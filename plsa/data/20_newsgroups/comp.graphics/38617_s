 yes, but... shouldn't size of newsgroup be an issue?  sorry if this
 has been covered before, but comp.grahpics.animation get how much 
 traffic per day?  50 articles?  maybe 70 on an extremely heavy day?
 i've been following this group for about four months now, and i don't
 recall ever seeing such a flood of posts that a split would be warranted.
 
 just my 2 cents,
