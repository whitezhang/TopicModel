 i guess i edited my note on this away from the article i posted to
 many newsgroups.
 
 i wrote something about making color modifications quickly
 with 8bit quantized images and only at the saving the image to file
 process we have to make the modifications to the 24bit image.
 this makes sense, because the main use of xv is only viewing images.
 
 doing many changes to image, we should keep all modifications
 in a buffer; and then before making the operations to 24bit image,
 we should simplify the operation list for unnecessary operations.

 i tried kept sure i don't claim that jpeg is noting else than
 a compression algorithm, because i know what the jpeg is.
 (you propably misunderstood what i wrote as you have done in many
 places so far.)
 
 you also missed what is (were) wrong with xv. however, i did wrote it.
