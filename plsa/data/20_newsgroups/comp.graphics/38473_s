 
 	getting an image from a computer monitor to a videotape
 is harder than it looks.  the standard vga and ega outputs are 
 very different than the ntsc format used by televisions.  while
 there is equipment that will do the conversion, it is hard to
 get your hands on and costs quite a bit.
 
 	if you have access to an amiga computer, that has an
 ntsc output, you can transfer certain types of graphic files by
 modem and tape them from the ntsc output.  unfortunately, this
 would be frame-by-frame and would lead to unbelievably scratchy
 animation unless you had a good amiga animation program.
 
 	otherwise, see if your local public access cable
 station has equipment that you can use.
