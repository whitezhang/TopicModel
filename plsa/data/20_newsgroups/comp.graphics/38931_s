 i am very interested in hearing from all of you who are using or implementing
 3-d interactive applications what types of 3-d widgets you would
 like to have in your applications.  
 
 a 3-d widget is usually located in the same scene as other 3-d objects of the 
 application.  it may let you
 
 - manipulate application data, the camera,
   3-d objects in the scene and so on, or
 - view the status of the application or 3-d objects
   via the widget's shape, color, position, orientation and so on, or
 - do whatever i missed but you think is possible.
 
 for example, a manipulative widget can be virtual trackball (shown as a
 partially transparent sphere) super-imposed on the object to be rotated.
 a feedback widget can be a ruler with ends anchored to 2 objects.  the length
 of the ruler changes as the objects move and a numeric value is shown on the
 ruler indicating the distance.  a widget can provide both manipulation and
 feedback.  for example, the ruler can be used to change the distance between
 the objects along its own axis.
 
 
 please e-mail me or post your opinions on 3-d interaction.  the information
 i gathered will help me design a 3-d ui construction tool.
 your help is very much appreciated.
