 
 hello,
 
 i'm trying out the c++ graphics package interviews. besides the man pages
 on the classes, i haven't got any documentation. is there anything else
 around? furthermore, can anyone send me a (small!) example program
 which shows how to use these classes together ? i would be very gratefull...
