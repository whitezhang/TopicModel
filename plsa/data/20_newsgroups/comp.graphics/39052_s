 the problem is that the process is inherently complicated ! the ijg's code is
 pretty good if you ask me, and i have watched it go through many many cycles of
 revision.
 
 try getting a good book on the subject, that will explain the algorithms.
 
 specifically "jpeg still image compression standard" by pennebaker & mitchell,
 vnr 1993, isbn 0-442-01272-1.
 
 btw. i presume your comment about "good" code wasn't meant to sound as offensive
 as it does.
