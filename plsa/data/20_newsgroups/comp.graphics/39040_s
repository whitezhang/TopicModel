 i can see xv-3.00 agree with my view in cases you don't -- even i say
 my personal opinion (as above), it doesn't mean that it is not most
 obvious thing.
 please, if you use my previous writings as contradicting argument,
 please do read them -- you have not saw them at all; you just
 refered to text from which i wrote 'something' -- and you make
 hard decisions from that, without reading what exactly i have written.
 
 it is really hard read when one writes a reply line by line method
 and don't understand include previously written material with the new
 sentences to give them meaning. you seem to be one such.
 
 you also start replying to my articles, even you don't understand what
 is going on; you ask me repeatedly to decsribe my views what were
 wrong with xv 2.21 even i posted them within the article you did reply
 to. believe me, it is not nice to get flamed specially when i know
 that you have not read my article carefully in the first place.
 
 xv-3.00 and jpeg faq and users i have written to agree me with the
 places you didn't; i'm sure you just didn't undertand what about i
 wrote. we can blame my writing skills (in english?) for that, or?
 
 better stop the discussion and check what new ideas xv-3.00 gives;
 i allready mailed one to bradley...
