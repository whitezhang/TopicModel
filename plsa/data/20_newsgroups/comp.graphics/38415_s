 i am involve in a distant learning project and am in need
 of jpeg and mpeg encode/decode source and object code.
 this is a not-for profit project that once completed i
 hope to release to other educational and institutional
 learning centers.
 this project requires that true photographic images be sent
 over plain telephone lines. in addition if there is a real good
 gui lib with 3d objects and all types of menu classes that can
 be use at both end of the transaction (server and terminal end)
 i would like to hear about it.
  
 we recently posted an rfd announcing the otg (open telematic group)
 that will concern itself with the developement of such application
 and that it would incorporate naplps, jpeg, mpeg, voice, ivr, fax
 sprites, animation(fli, flc, etc...).
 at present only dos and unix environment is being worked on and it
 our hope that we can generate enough interest where all the major
 platform can be accomodated via a plaform independent api/toolkit/sdk
 we are of the mind that it is about time that such project and group
 be form to deal with these issues.
 we want to setup a repository where these files may be access such as
 simte20 and start putting together a otg faq.
 if you have some or any information that in your opinion would be 
 of interest to the otg community and you like to see included in our
 first faq please send it email to the address below.
  
 thanks in advance
