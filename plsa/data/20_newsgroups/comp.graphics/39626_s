 finding a disk array that can do 180mb/sec. will be difficult. the fastest
 ones i know about are from maximum strategy (ibm also sells these). they
 can attach hippi at up to 144 mb/sec. (64 bit). for these kinds of data
 rates you need more than scsi for connections. their latest model, the
 raid 5 model gen 4 only does 90 mb/sec. but i think this may be a
 limitation only of the hippi channel and that customer needs have not
 exceeded that speed since their older model was faster. they are also not
 idle (must be working on newer products that might be faster) and are a
 small company so you might be able to ask about custom interfaces. they
 still marketed the older, faster model as of a few mongths ago.

 you might still want to look into compression as it will be very difficult
 to keep the hippi bus fully working at all times - sustained throughput
 might come close to maximum burst rate.
 
 interesting problem. tell us more if you can?
