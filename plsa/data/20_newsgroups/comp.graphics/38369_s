 i'm interested in simulating reverse (or negative) color video
 mathematically.  what is the transform?  is it a simple
 reversal of the hue value in the hsv color space?  is it
 a manipulation in the yuv color space?  how is it related
 to solarization?
 
 if you want to see something truly wild, turn on the
 reverse video effect on a camcorder so equipped,
 and point it at the monitor.  this creates a chaotic
 dynamical system whose phase space is continuous along
 rotation, zoom, focus, etc.  very very surprising and 
 lovely.  i'd like to write a simulation of this effect
 without analog grunge.  thanks for any info you may have.
 
 please e-mail any info to me.  i'll post a summary.
 
 thanks,
