 i need the file format for cc:mail file formats - it seems to be pcx-based,
 but with a twist: only the first page of a multi-page fax will come out
 readable. the other pages disappear. the format seems to be 'proprietary'.
 
 anybody got any clues? i have to give my email faxes to my secretary in
 order to get 'em unscrambled. i want a filter from cc:mail to .p[nb]m.
 
 come to think of it, p[nb]m to cc:mail would be nice too.
