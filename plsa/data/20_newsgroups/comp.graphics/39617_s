    i was wondering if anyone knows of a graphics package for the pc that
    will do compositing of a series of pictures?
 
    what i mean by "compositing" is, say i have a live video clip
    (digitized) panning around a living room, and a computer-generated
    bird flying around the screen.  i want to combine these two series of
    pictures so that everywhere where the bird frames are black, i want
    the living room picture to show through.  yes, i realize i can do this
    with a genlock, and i do own a genlock, but i want to be able to do
    manual compositing also.  it's ok if i have to composite one frame at
    a time; i assumed i'd have to do that anyway.  but being able to
    composite a series of frames would be even better.
 
    i've looked around and i haven't found a pc package that will perform
    this.  help, please!
 
 if you can get the live animation and the computer-generated animation
 into autodesk animator .fli or .flc format, autodesk animator will do
 this for you.  it can take one animation, make a certain color
 "clear", and overlay it over another animation.  i do not have a way
 right now to convert .avi or .mpg files to animator files.  animator
 will also import a series of .gif files to create an animation, so if
 your video capture stuff can create this is might work.
