 i'm posting this for a friend:
 
   i have an immediate need for a polygon-based hidden-line removal  
   program.  i can deal with any input/output format, but i need to be able  
   to do perspective views in any orientation and range.
 
   is there a public-domain hidden-line program around?  it seems like  
   there should be, but i have not been able to locate one.
 
 email replies and i will summarize.
 thanks
