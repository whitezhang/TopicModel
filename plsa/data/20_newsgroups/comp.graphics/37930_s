 
 	does anybody know if there are any good 2d-graphics packages
 	available for ibm rs/6000 & aix ? i'm looking for something
 	like dec's gks or hewlett-packards starbase, both of which
 	have reasonably good support for different output devices
 	like plotters, terminals, x etc.
 
 	i have tried also xgks from x11 distribution and ibm's implementation
 	of phigs. both of them work but we require more output devices
 	than just x-windows.
 
 	our salesman at ibm was not very familiar with graphics and
 	i am not expecting for any good solutions from there.
