 i have the ati graphics ultra pro eisa version.  i must admit it has 
 received bad press but that was due to the faulty drivers it had.  now the 
 drivers that are available for the eisa version are the same ones as the isa 
 and local bus (v1.5 build 59).  some people complained about problems they 
 had with the build 59 drivers, fortunately i couldn't duplicate them on my 
 machine, but i did have one problem with harvard graphics that nobody else 
 seemed to have.

 i wouldn't recommed the ati for 24bit colour at 800x600, at this resolution 
 the display will be interlaced.  but at 16bit it isn't, i thought it was my 
 monitor but it isn't, its the card (that is the only time you will get 
 interlaced).  if i come up with cards more suited for your needs i'll let 
 you know.
