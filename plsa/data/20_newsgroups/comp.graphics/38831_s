 dear netters:
 
 
 i am looking for c source code to test if a 3d point lies within a
 
 concave polyhadra. i have read a few articles about this and know
 
 that two solutions exist: parity counting and angle sumation. both
 
 
 ideas are pretty simple but coding is not. so i wonder if there exists
 
 public domain source code for this.
 
     another 'rough' solition (don't care special cases) is ray-casting
 
 which is reported to be more or less independent of number of faces
 
 consisting the polyhedra if a special space indexing is used
 (m. tamminen, et. al., 1984. "ray-casting and block model conversion
 using a spatial index". computer-aided-designs. 4, 1984, 60-65).
 but the prerequirement is that all the facets of polyhedra have their
 normal pointing outside of polyhedra. how this could be done in practice ?
 i have a set of trangles consisting the polyhedra. how could i ensure their
 normals pointing outside the polyhedra ? the paper mentioned above assumed
 this is already the case.
 
 
    i have also read some standard computer graphics textbook about hidden
 line removal. it says "if we make the rule that the normal of a facet pointing
 
 toward viewer standing far away from the polyhedra...". again how to make
 sure ?
 
 
    any pointers are welcome ?
