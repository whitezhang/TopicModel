 i have a question about recursive, backward raytracing.
 
 when an incident ray (i) strikes an object at point p, first
 the normal (n) is calculated. light rays are calculated (l1 to ln 
 where n is the number of light sources) - these being the light
 rays that do not intersect with anything. the reflected ray (r) and
 the transmitted ray (t) is calculated from the formulae.
 
 calling the routine recursively on r and t will return the colours 
 along the rays (r and t) as rcol and tcol. each object has its own
 colour ocol and each light source has licol (1 <= i <= n).
 
 the question is: 
   how do you combine rcol, tcol, ocol and all the licol's to get
   the correct resulting colour to return along the i ray?
 
 all colours are defined as strucures (records) having r, g, b components
 between 0 and 1.
 
 if anyone has done this before could you give me a few hints?
