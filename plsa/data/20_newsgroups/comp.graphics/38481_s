 at&t also puts out two new products for windows, model numbers elude me now,
 a 15 bit video board with framegrabber and a 16bit with same. yesterday i
 was looking at a product at a local software etc store. media vision makes
 a 15bit (32,768 color) frame capture board that is stand alone and doesnot
 use the feature connector on your existing video card. it claims upto 30 fps
 live capture as well as single frame from either composite ntsc or s-video
 in and out.
