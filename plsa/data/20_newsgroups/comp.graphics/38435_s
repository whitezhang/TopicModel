 ho boy. there is no way in hell you are going to be able to view gifs or do
 any other graphics in linux without x windows!  i love linux because it is
 so easy to learn..  you want text?  okay.   use linux. you want text and
 graphics?  use linux with x windows.  simple.  painless.  required to have
 x windows if you want graphics!  this includes fancy word processors like
 doc, image viewers like xv, etc.
