 g'day brian,
 
 i'll be blunt about this. the only reasonable explanation of roberts
 algorithm is in
 
 procedural elements for computer graphics
 rogers
 mcgraw-hill book co. 1985
 
 go to the library and look at this.
 
 there is also a somewhat muddled explanation in the first edition
 of newman and sproull.
 
 the algorithm described in pecg runs in near linear time.
 
 luck,
 
 dave rogers
