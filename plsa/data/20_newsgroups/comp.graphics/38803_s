 i posted that document (forgot part 1/6 etc) but it was more than a summary,
 it was a complete technical description of the protocol. it can be ftped
 from simtel or from wuarchive.wustl.edu in mirrors/msdos/naplps

 why not write a naplps decoder for your choice of platform and release the
 code to the net? then other willing souls can help port it to other platforms.
 naplps was designed for this type of online interactive graphics much the
 same as x, but while x is intended for high-bandwidth network connections,
 naplps was optimized for low bandwidth modem connections.

 i'm sure you will receive other suggestions but look at it this way. if you
 wanted to provide a full network connection to linux over a modem would you
 use slip/ppp or would you invent some new way? most people would say that
 slip/ppp exist and are reasonably well designed protocols, so lets just
 implement them. i see it the same way with naplps. it is an existing, well
 thought out, extensible protocol for online graphics, so why not implement
 it.
 
 if you need any advice on implementation, just e-mail me. i am currently
 getting a beta version of my coreldraw to naplps converter working well
 enough to release it by may 15. if you or someone else does not get going
 on a freely available naplps decoder, then i intend to do it after i get
 a my conversion program out of beta, and get a couple of other things done.
