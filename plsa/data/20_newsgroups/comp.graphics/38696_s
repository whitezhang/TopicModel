 hi there
 
 i am very interested in rayshade 4.00. i have managed to make a chessboard
 for rayshade. unfortunately i still have to do the knight (horse). any ideas?
 i am also looking for a surface for the chesspieces. the board is marble.
 unfortunately black won't work very well for the one side. anybody with ideas
 for nice surfaces?
 
 i would also like to use the image command of rayshade and the heightfield
 command. unfortunately the manual is very vague about this, and i don't have
 craig kolb's email address. anybody with ideas, because this is essential
 for my next venture into raytracing.
 
 where should i post the finished chessboard?
 
 is there anybody else using rayshade on non-unix systems?
 
 how fast does unix render?
 
 thanks
 
 rayshade is the best program for people who loves graphics, but have no
 artistic talent.
