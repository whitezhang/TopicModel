 
 	does anyone know the phone number to a place where i can get
 a vga passthrough?
 
 	i want to hook up my vga card to my xga card (whcih you can can).
 all i need is the cable that connects them.  it is the same type of
 cable that you would connect from your vga card to say a video blaster
 or something.
 
 	thanks.
