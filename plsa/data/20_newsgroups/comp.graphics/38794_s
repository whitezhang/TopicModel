 i am looking for some fast polygon routines (shaded or texture
 mapped) in asm (compile with masm) or in turbo pascal (compile with
 tp6). it has to be able to run on a 286, but does not have to look
 super fast on a 286, but must look good on a 386.  
 
 if anyone has any such code could you please mail it to me. or tell
 me where it can be got. 
 
 thanks in advance.
