 does any one know of a decent quality library of routines for
 performing 3d graphics modelling on the pc?
 
 ideally the routines would be embeded in our application program.
 
 requirements (wish list):
 - flat surface modelling (simple phong shading optional)
 - ability to plot hidden-line drawings
 - texture mapping -- both procedural and bit map
 - modeling light sources (local, distant, and spot lights)
 - ray-tracing
 - radiosity (optional)
 
 any comments would be appreciated.
