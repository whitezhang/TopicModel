  i spoke with the author of macwireframe earlier today. the cost is $299, but there
  are no license royalties. his name is eric johnson in sacramento, ca phone
  916/737-1550. he doesn't have email. very nice guy... very knowledgeable about
  graphics. seems like he may have a decent package. it's an object pascal framework
  that supposedly has a fairly complete set of geometry creation classes. 
  i'm going to check it out and see if it's got what i need for my cad package.
 
  i also found another package: 3d graphic tools by micro system options in seattle.
  the number is: 206/868-5418, also no email. the package is strong at ray tracing,
  i'm not too sure about its geometry creation tools. i also need to look into this
  package some more. i also spoke with the author, mark owens, another nice
  guy that seems to know his business. the price is $249, no royalties.
