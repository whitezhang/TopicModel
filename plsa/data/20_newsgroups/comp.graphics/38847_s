 hello,
 
 thanks to the people who helped me with the problem of
 displaying 24 bit images. all the viewers like xli,
 xloadimage and display are converting the 24 bit images
 to 8 bit before display them on the screen.
 
 what i really want is a viewer with make use of the 24 bit
 frame/screen buffer (in our case, the parallax one).
 
 thanks in advance.

 ps:  we are using a sun sparc running x11.
