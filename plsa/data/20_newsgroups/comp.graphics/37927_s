 a 3do marketing rep. recently offered a phillips marketing rep. a $100
 bet that 3do would have boxes on the market on schedule.  the phillips
 rep. declined the bet, probably because he knew that 3do players are
 already in pre-production manufacturing runs, 6 months before the
 commercial release date.
 
 by the time of commercial release, there will be other manufacturers of
 3do players announced and possibly already tooling up production.  chip
 sets will be in full production.  the number of software companies
 designing titles for the box will be over 300.
 
 how do i know this?  i was at a bar down the road from 3do headquarters
 last week.  some folks were bullshitting a little too loudly about
 company business.
