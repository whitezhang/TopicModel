     yes.  there are many methods of rendering, raytracing is one of them.
 you didn't say what you mean by rendering, so i won't guess.  methods of
 rendering include:
 
         o  pencil and graph paper, doing the math by hand
 
         o  wireframe rendering of the 2d projection
 
         o  hidden line rendering
 
         o  scanline rendering using:
             - painter's algorithm.
             - bsp trees.
             - z buffer
             - other
 
         o  raytracing
 
         o  radiosity
 
         o  holographic projection to film
 
         o  combination of any of the above
