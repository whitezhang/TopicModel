 my wife wants to publish a newsletter. she's no artist, so she intends to
 use comercial clipart and customise it a bit by drawing a circle or a box
 around it etc. 
  
 we have mspublisher for manipulating text, but it is not suitable for doing
 much with graphics, so she needs a more specialised tool. right now she's
 looking at corel draw and harvard draw. there seem to be more books in the
 stores on corel than on harvard, so she's inclined to go with corel on the
 basis of popularity. can anyone give us an informed opinion on which 
 package would be more suitable or if there is an even better alternative
 available? if this is a faq, please withhold the flames and just send the
 location of the faq document. thanks.
  
 three ps's:
  
 1) is it ok to use clip art from harvard draw or whatever for commercial
    purposes?
  
 2) we have a 600 dpi laser jet 4 printer. what would be a good scanner for
    reading in paper clipart?
  
 3) how about someone starting up a newsgroup on desktop publishing if one
    doesn't exist?
