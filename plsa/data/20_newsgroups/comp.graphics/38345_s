 i had enough problems with my isa bus ultra plus that i finally returned it,
 but many of the people i spoke to through the net were happy with the eisa
 version of the ultra pro.  i kind of suspect the mach32 chip was designed
 with a 32-bit external bus in mind and the isa version is kind of a hack, but
 that's just a guess.
