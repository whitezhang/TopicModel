 rh>i've noticed that if you only save a model (with all your mapping planes
 rh>positioned carefully) to a .3ds file that when you reload it after restarting
 rh>3ds, they are given a default position and orientation.  but if you save
 rh>to a .prj file their positions/orientation are preserved.  does anyone
 rh>know why this information is not stored in the .3ds file?  nothing is
 
     this is because the prj (project) format saves all of your settings,
     right down to the last render file's name.
 
 rh>i'd like to be able to read the texture rule information, does anyone have
 rh>the format for the .prj file?
 
     sorry... don't have anything on that or the cel format.
