 i am trying to convert an m-motion (ibm) video file format yuv to rgb 
 data...
 
 the y portion is a byte from 0-255
 the v is a byte -127-127
 the color is u and v
 and the intensity is y
 
 does anyone have any ideas for algorhtyms or programs ?
 
 can someone tell me where to get info on the u and v of a television signal ?
 
 if you need more info reply at the e-mail address...
 basically what i am doing is converting a digital ntsc format to rgb (vga)
 for displaying captured video pictures.
 
 thanks.
 
 
 the u is a byte -127-127
