        videoscan vision system for pc/at,wich include software and set of
        controllers.
 
                      software
 
             for support videoscan family program kit was developed. kit
        includes more then 200 different functions for image processing.
             kit works in the interactive regime, and has include help for
        non professional users.
             there are next possibility:
        - input frame by any board of videoscan family;
        - read - white image to - from disk;
        - print image on the printer;
        - makes arithmetic with 2 frames;
        - filter image;
        - work with gistogramme;
        - edit image.
        - include users exe modules.
 
                      controller vs9
 
        the function of vs-9 controller is to load tv-images into  pc/at.
        vs-9 controller allows one to load a fragment of the tv-frame from
        a field of 724x600 pixels.
        the clock rate is 14,7 mhz when loading an image with 512 pixel in
        the line and 7,4 mhz when loading a 256 pixels image. this
        provides the equal pixel size of input image in both horizontal
        and vertical directions.
        the number of gray levels in any input modes is 256.
        video signal capture time - 2.5s.
 
                      controller vs52
 
        the purpose of the controller is to enter the tv images into a ibm
        pc at or any other machine of that type. the controller was
        created on the base of modern elements, including user
        programmable gate arrays.
        the controller allows to digitize a input signal with different
        resolutions. its flexible architecture makes possible to change
        technical parameters. instead of tv signal one can process any
        other analog signal (including signals from slow-speed scanning
        devices).
        the controller has the following technical characteristics:
        - memory volume - from 256 k to 2 mb ;
        - resolution when working with standard video signal - from 64x64
        to 1024x512 pixels ;
        - resolution when working in slow input regime - up to 2048x1024
        pixels;
        - video signal capture time - 40 ms.
        - maximum size of a screen when memory volume is 2mb - 2048x1024
        pixels ;
        - number of gray level - 256 ;
        - clock rate for input - up to 30 mhz ;
        - 4 input video multiplexer ;
        - input/output lookup table (lut);
        - possibility to realize "scroll" and "zoom";
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
        - 8 lines for external synchronization (an input using external
        controlling signal) ;
        - electronic adjustment of black and white reference for analog -
        digital converter;
        - possibility output image to the color rgb monitor.
        one can change all listed above functions and parameters of the
        controller by reprogramming it.
 
 
               image processor vs100
 
 
             image processor vs100 allows to digitize and process tv
        signal in real time. it is possible digitize tv signal with
        512*512*8 resolution and realize arithmetic and logic operation
        with two images.
             processor was created on the base of modern elements
        including user programmable gate arrays and designed as a board
        for pc.
             memory volume allows write to the 256 frames with 512*512*8
        format. it is possible to accumulate until 16 images.
             the processor has the following technical characteristics:
        - memory volume to 64 mb;
        - number of the gray level - 256;
        - 4 input video multiplexer;
        - input/output lookup table;
        - electronic adjustment for black and white adc reference;
        - image size from 256*256 to 8192*8192;
        - possibility color and black / white output;
        - possibility input from slow-scan video sources.
