 greetings,
     i have an epson hi-80 4 pen plotter forsale.  it emulates an hp 7570
 or 7574 - i'm not sure which.  it has an option board on it that does
 the emulation.  it has a serial interface with hardware handshake. i
 also have 340 pens for it as follows:  10 packs of 4 black oil based, 16
 packs of 4 red,green, blue, and black pens, 22 packs of 4 aqueous black,
 7 packs of 4 aqueous r,g,blue,black,  1 pack of 6 aqueous multi color
 pens,  and 114 assorted non-packaged pens mostly colored.
 
     the plotter is used.  i have tested it using the windows drivers for
 hp 7570 and hp 7574 and both worked fine.  it accepts either a or b
 sized paper. (8.5 x 11 or 11x17).
 
     i figure that the plotter is worth about $300 and the pens are worth at
 least another $200 more..  one thing is certain, you won't need to
 purchase any pens for quite a while...  all of the packaged pens were
 sealed so they are all still fresh.  the rest were capped and seem to
 function as well.
 
     i'd be willing to sell the pens seperate if anyone is interested in
 just them.
 
     i'm selling it because i got a hp laserjet and i don't need color.
 
     i'd like $350 or best offer...
