 hello again netters,
 	i finally received the information about imagine for the pc.  they are presently shipping version 2.0 of the software and will release version 3.0 in the first quarter of 1993 (or so they say).  the upgrade from 2.0 to 3.0 is $100.00.  to purchase imagine 2.0, it costs $495.00 or if you are upgrading from another eligible (call them for info) modeler, it is only $200.00 plus shipping & handling.   it requires a pc with 4 megs a math coprocessor, and dos 5.0 or up and a microsoft mouse and svga card.
 	thanks for all your replies about the product.  i have received many contrasting replies, but once i scrounge the money together, i think i will take the plunge.  thanks again.
 	here is the info for impulse if you want to find out more or get the sheet they sent.
