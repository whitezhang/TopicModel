 the problem is not precisely defined above, but if you need to find
 the smallest convex polygon that encloses a given polygon, then
 you are seeking the convex hull of your original polygon.  there
 are two ways to do this:  use a somewhat tricky but by-now well
 examined linear-time algorithm that exploits the polygon boundary,
 or just feed the vertices of the original polygon to a convex hull
 routine and accept o(n log n).  both methods are discussed in
 preparata and shamos, for example.
