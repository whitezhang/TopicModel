 adobe streamline has been out four a couple of years. it does a much better
 job than the autotracing functions which are built into illustration
 programs. of course, a higher resolution bitmap will produce a more
 accurate trace. the problem that i've run into though, is that when it
 creates a detailed trace, it produces way more points than are necessary.
 if i trace something manually, i use many less es points. the problem
 with this is it produces big files which slow everything down, especially
 printing.
