 
       i was skimming through a few gophers and bumped into one at nih
    with a database that included images in .gif format.  while i have
    not yet worked out the kinks of getting the gopher client to call
    an x viewer, i figure that the majority of the users here are not
    in an x11 environment - instead using dos and ms-kermit.
 
       with kermit supporting tek4010 emulation for graphics display,
    does anyone know of a package that would allow a tek to display a
    .gif image?  it would be of more use to the local population to
    plug something of this sort in as the 'picture' command instead of
    xview or xloadimage ...
