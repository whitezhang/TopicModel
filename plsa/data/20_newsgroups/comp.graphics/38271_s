 
  recently i saw the latest computer shopper and in it there was an article
 on nice shareware graphics programs. they looked pretty good and of the 6
 listed in the article, one i had (graphics workshop), one i found via
 archie (draft choice - old version though) and the rest i couldn't find.
 so if there is anyone that knows where i can get the following programs
 via anonymous ftp, please let me know.
 
 adkins graphics :ag1.zip, ag2.zip
 draft choice (latest vga version) : draftc.zip
 envision publisher: envis1.zip, envis2.zip
 neopaint: neopnt.zip
 
 thanx in advance.
