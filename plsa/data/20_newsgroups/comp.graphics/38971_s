 the otis project presents...
 
        synergy: revolt 
 	...the first in a continuing series of collaborative
 	art initiatives designed to exploit the binarity
 	of the infosphere.  this series of diversely 
 	structured art-manipulation projects will attempt
 	to stretch across network boundries encouraging
 	use of electronic mail, fax, video, photography,
 	scanned "conventional" art and even sound to 
 	create multi-artist "still" visuals in gif and 
 	jpg formats.  visualists from all technical levels
 	are welcome.  
 
 	revolt will be structured simply.  there will be 
 	three stages of production.  the first stage will
 	consist of all participants creating one still 
 	work as a "starter" piece that two other partici-
 	pants will, in turn, manipulate.  all first stage
 	"base" images are due by sunday, may 23rd, 1993, 
 	midnight central daylight time. 
 
 	stage two will begin on may 24th.  all images will 
 	be sent to another (arbitrarily chosen) participant
 	for them to do manipulations on in anyway they see 
 	fit.  for purely digital artists, this may consist
 	of filtering the image through their favorite paint
 	program.  for "analog" artists, this may well be
 	printing a hardcopy of the image and adding their
 	own part with pen, pencil or white-out then scan-
 	ning in the image again to be transferred on to 
 	the third-stage artist.  all second-stage works
 	are due by midnight on sunday, may 30th.
 
 	stage three is the finishing stage and will begin
 	on may 31st.  all artists will do what they think 
 	it takes to finish up the image they've been given
 	using whatever technique they see as worthy.  
 	these images will be due on june 6th, midnight.
 
 	all involved will participate in each stage of
 	creation.

 	access to a scanner, but need one, we'll try to help.
 	if you need an image printed out and sent to you, let
 	us know (send an sase if you anticipate this).

 	- suggestions for use of "uncommon" mediums
 	  (such as video stills, electronic imaging and sound)
