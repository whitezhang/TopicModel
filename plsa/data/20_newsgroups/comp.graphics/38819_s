 i'm planning on writing several classes to build a raytracing/radiosity library
 on top of, and i'm wondering if anythink like this is freely available on the
 net before i go to it. what i need is classes like rays, vectors, colors,
 shaders, surfaces, media, primitives, worlds (containing primitives) and
 views/images.
 
 please post or mail.
