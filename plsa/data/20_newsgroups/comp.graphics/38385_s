 i need to get the specs, or at least a very verbose interpretation of the
 specs, for quicktime.  technical articles from magazines and references to
 books would be nice too.
 
 i also need the specs in a format usable on a unix or ms-dos system.  i can't
 do much with the quicktime stuff they have on ftp.apple.com in its present
 format.
 
 thanks in advance.
