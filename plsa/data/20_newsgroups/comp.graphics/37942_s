 hi!  i am in immediate need for details of various graphics compression
 techniques.  so if you know where i could obtain descriptions of algo-
 rithms or public-domain source codes for such formats as jpeg, gif, and
 fractals, i would be immensely grateful if you could share the info with
 me.  this is for a project i am contemplating of doing.
 
 thanks in advance.  please reply via e-mail if possible.
