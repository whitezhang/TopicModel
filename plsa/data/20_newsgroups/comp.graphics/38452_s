 first off: thanks to all who have filled me in on the existence of the
 68070. i assumed rashly that the particular number would be reserved for
 further enhancements to the motorola line, rather than meted out to
 another company. ah, well, i guess that's what i get when i assume the
 computer industry will operate in a logical manner! ;-)

 version 1.5 of quicktime is, as has been stated, the current version of
 the software. the older version is 1.0, and 1.6 is on the horizon in the
 not too distant future.

 quicktime does a much better job of playing back movies at size than it
 does playing back resized movies. apparently the process of expanding
 each frame's image and dithering the resultant bitmap to the appropriate
 bit depth is pretty processor-intensive. there are optimizers that work
 pretty well for showing movies at double size, but if you drop to 1.9x
 size or increase to 2.1x size, performance suffers dramatically.

 he lied. :-) quicktime is very cpu dependent. he was probably confused by
 the fact that qt is locked to an internal timecode, and will play in the
 same amount of time on any machine. however, an lc will drop frames in
 order to keep the sound and video synced up.
 
 the centris and quadras have similar cpus and will thus boast similar
 performance, though the quadras will be a bit faster due to marginally
 faster clock speeds and somewhat different architecture.

 i expect that the version of the quicktime software you saw was 1.0 -- i
 was using was 1.5. one of the new codecs in v1.5 allows video at nearly
 twice the size and the same frame rate as what version 1.0 could handle.
 the centris 650 i saw was a plain-vanilla, with the exception of the nice
 speakers that were playing the sound, and the software was movie player,
 the qt player apple includes with the software.

 no problem -- it still surprises me that quicktime is able to do the
 things it does as well as it can.
