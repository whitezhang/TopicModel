 
 i am looking for a means to add fli and flc animation creation
 to a windows application.  i was hoping for something along the lines
 of aawin or aaplay by autodesk but for the creation of these delta 
 compressed animations.  i have flilib but this seems to be coded for 
 the large memory model of dos with turbo c. ideally i would
 like a dll or medium model object library, but would settle
 for anything, really.  i've seen other windows apps with
 fli/flc creation, did they hack the flilib code into submission?
 
 any pointers would be appreciated, please send mail directly
 to me and i will summarize the results if there is interest.
