 	ahh no.  possibly you punched in the wrong numbers on your
 calculator.  256 color modes take a byte per pixel so 640 time 480 is
 307,200 which is 300k to be exact.  640x400x256 only takes 250k but i
 don't think it is a bios mode.  i wouldn't bet that all vga cards can do
 that either.  if a vga card has 512k i bet it can do both 640x400 and
 640x480.  that by definition is svga, though not very high svga.
