 by '8 grey level images' you mean 8 items of 1bit images?
 it does work(!), but it doesn't work if you have more than 1bit
 in your screen and if the screen intensity is non-linear.
 
 with 2 bit per pixel; there could be 1*c_1 + 4*c_2 timing,
 this gives 16 levels, but they are linear if screen intensity is
 linear.
 with 1*c_1 + 2*c_2 it works, but we have to find the best
 compinations -- there's 10 levels, but 16 choises; best 10 must be
 chosen. different compinations for the same level, varies a bit, but
 the levels keeps their order.
 
 readers should verify what i wrote... :-)
