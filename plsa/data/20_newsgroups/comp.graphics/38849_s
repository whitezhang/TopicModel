 	subject: analysis on text reading utils needed (ibm pc)
 	distribution: msk
 	
 	hi!
 	does anybody know any reliable utils to read english texts with scanner?
 	i want some analysis on quality of recognition, because i want to read
 	texts which i get by fax ( you know -- quality on faxes is rather bad ).
 	the scanner i have is b&w and 300dpi. but if there exist any good software
 	that needs other specifications, that will be ok.
 	
 	please, send messages to my e-mail or on conference server, i'll summarize
 	them and consider your recomendations.
 	
 	thank you!!!
