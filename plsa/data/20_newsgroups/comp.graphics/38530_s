 i downloaded an image of the earth re-constructed from elevation data taken
 at 1/2 degree increments. the author (not me) wrote some c-code (included)
 that read in the data file and generated b&w and pseudo color images. they
 work very well and are not incumbered by copyright. they are at an aminet
 site near you called earth.lha in the amiga/pix/misc area...
 
 i refer you to the included docs for the details on how the author (sorry, i
 forget his name) created these images. the raw data is not included.
