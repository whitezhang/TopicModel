 
 you'll probably have to set the palette up before you try drawing
 in the new colours.
 
 use the bios interrupt calls to set the r g & b values (in the range
 from 0-63 for most cards) for a particular palette colour (in the
 range from 0-255 for 256 colour modes).
 
 then you should be able to draw pixels in those palette values and
 the result should be ok.
 
 you might have to do a bit of colourmap compressing if you have
 more than 256 unique rgb triplets, for a 256 colour mode.
