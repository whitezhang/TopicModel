 
 	i have a very large (3x5 feet) file in macintosh canvas v2.something
 which i need to import into autocad 12 in the least disk-space intensive
 way possible.  (i.e. eps is a big problem, since it took 1.3 meg to encode
 one page of the document)  the file is entirely lines and words.  i have
 access to networked macs & pc's, and ftp.  can anyone suggest how this might
 be accomplished?  email replies, if you would, i don't read this group much.
 thanks in advance.
