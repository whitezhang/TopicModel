 hi,
 
 i'm hoping someone out there will be able to help our computer science
 project group. we are doing computer science honours, and our project
 is to do a 'graphical simulator for a finite state automata'.
 
 basically, the program must draw a diagram of a fsa from a textual grammar,
 showing circles for states, and labeled arc's in-between.
 
 the problem is working out the best way to layout the states, and draw the
 arc's in-between so that as few arc's as possible cross each other.
 
 if anyone has any suggestions/algorithms/bug-free ready to compile c code :) 
 that might help us, it would be much appreciated.
 
 thanks in advance,
 
 gregory
