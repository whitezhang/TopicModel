 i'm interested in find out what is involved in processing pairs of 
 stereo photographs.  i have black-and-white photos and would like 
 to obtain surface contours.
 
 i'd prefer to do the processing on an sgi, but would be interested
 in hearing what software/hardware is used for this type of
 image processing.
 
 please email and/or post to comp.sys.sgi.graphics your responses.
 
 thanks,
