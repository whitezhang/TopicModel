 i used the information provided in the recent resource listings and
 tried to ftp to:
 
 ccu1.aukland.ac.nz [130.216.1.5]:  ftp/mac/architec - *vision-3d facet
 
 and received an 'unknown host' message.
 
 mail to paul d. bourke (pdbourke@ccu1.aukland.ac.nz) bounces with basically
 the same problem.
 
 where'd he go????
