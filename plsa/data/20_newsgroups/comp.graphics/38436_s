 in all fairness, how many people do you know personally who read images
 from floppy drives?  i haven't tried it with jpegs, but i do realize how
 agonizingly slow it is with gif files.  
 
 nevertheless, it is an important bug that needs to be squashed.  i am
 merely pointing out that it was probably overlooked.  while it is serious,
 one must keep in mind that it will probably affect at most 5% of the
 targeted users of cview.
