 hello everybody !
 
 if you are using pixar's renderman 3d scene description language for creating 3d worlds, please, help me. 
 
 i'm using renderman library on my next but there is no documentation about nextstep version of renderman available. i can create very complicated scenes and render them using surface shaders, 
 but i can not bring them to life by applying shadows and reflections.
 
 as far as i understand i have to define environmental and shadows maps to produce reflections and shadows, but i do not know how to use them.
 
 any advises or simple rib or c examples will be appreciated.
 thanks in advance...
