 help!  i'm trying to program my vga!  i've got it working
 with in pascal with the following routines for mode $13h
 (320*200*256).  i've got a vesa compatable trident 8900c w/1meg
 and need to program in 1024*768 mode.  i don't care how many colors.
  
 could someone take this code and help me write 2 new procedures to
 replace them so that it'll work in 1024*768*16 or 1024*768*256?
  
 that'd be great!  thanks...
  
 here is the code i currently have for 320*200*256 mode:
  
   procedure graphmode;
  
     begin { videomode }
       asm
         mov  ah,00
         mov  al,13h
         int  10h
       end;
     end;  { videomode }
  
   procedure plotpoint (x, y, c : integer);
  
     begin
       mem[$a000:x+y*320]:=c;
     end;
