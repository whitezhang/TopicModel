 acorn replay running on a 25mhz arm 3 processor (the arm 3 is about 20% slower
 than the arm 6) does this in software (off a standard cd-rom). 16 bit colour at
 about the same resolution (so what if the computer only has 8 bit colour
 support, real-time dithering too...). the 3d0/o is supposed to have a couple of
 dsps - the arm being used for housekeeping.

 a 25mhz arm 6xx should clock around 20 arm mips, say 18 flat out. depends
 really on the surrounding system and whether you are talking arm6x or arm6xx
 (the latter has a cache, and so is essential to run at this kind of speed with
 slower memory).
 
 i'll stop saying things there 'cos i'll hopefully be working for arm after
 graduation...

 ps don't pay heed to what reps from philips say; if the 3d0/o doesn't beat the
    pants off 3di then i'll eat this postscript.
