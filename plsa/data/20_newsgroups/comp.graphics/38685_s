 for some reason i never saw the original post on this thread, but if you are
 looking for fast polygon routines on vga on a pc, you really can't go past
 the mode x stuff from dr dobbs. this code is all p.domain (as far as i know),
 and in the original articles, the routines were all presented as dumb vga
 routines, and then optimised to modex with some interesting discussion along
 the way.
 if you are interested, i could find out more details of the issues in question,
 (i have them at home).
