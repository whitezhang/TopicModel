 hello,
 
     i have been searching for a quality image enhancement and
     manipulation package for unix/x/motif platforms that is comparable
     to adobe photo shop for the mac.
 
     i have not been able to find any, and would appreciate any
     information about such products you could provide.
 
     i would be particularly interested in software that runs on hp or
     sun workstations, and does not require special add-in hardware, but
     would also be interested in other solutions.
 
 
 thank you.
 wayne
