 wouldn't this require a hyper-sphere.  in 3-space, 4 points over specifies
 a sphere as far as i can see.  unless that is you can prove that a point
 exists in 3-space that is equi-distant from the 4 points, and this may not
 necessarily happen.
 
 correct me if i'm wrong (which i quite possibly am!)
