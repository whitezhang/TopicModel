 garbo.uwasa.fi (or one of its many mirrors) has a file
 called "svgabg40" in the programming subdirectory.
 these are svga bgi drivers for a variety of cards.
 
 [from the readme]:
 "card types supported: (supervga drivers)
   ahead, ati, chips & tech, everex, genoa, paradise, oak, trident (both 8800 
   and 8900, 9000), tseng (both 3000 and 4000 chipsets) and video7.
   these drivers will also work on video cards with vesa capability.
   the tweaked drivers will work on any register-compatible vga card."
 
 enjoy,
