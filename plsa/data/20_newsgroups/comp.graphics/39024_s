         some time ago (about 1 month) there was a bit of discussion
         about a universal vesa driver for > 8bit cards.  it was in
         the file uvesa32.zip.  well i can't find it, does anyone know
         where it is (gorilla.something.something.au), and what sort
         of cards it works for ?
 
         also would it be pushing my luck to ask for someone to post
         it to some appropriate group.
