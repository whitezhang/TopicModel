 
 does anybody have an algorithm for "flattening" out a globe, or any other
 parametric surface, that is definied parametrically. 
 that is, i would like to take a sheet of paper and a knife and to be
 able to calculate how i must cut in the paper so i can fold it to a
 globe (or any other object).
