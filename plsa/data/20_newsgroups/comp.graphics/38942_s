 
 we need terrain data for a visualization research currently taking place
 in tel-aviv university. we have two databases that we are currently working
 on, but we would like to work on more databases, possibly more complicated 
 and ones that will give prettier images.
 
 before i describe what kind of data we need, let me mention that we are 
 going to present a paper titled "photo-realistic imaging of digital terrains"
 which describes the research and the results, in the eurographics'93 
 conference in barcelona, this september. we are going to show a video-tape 
 with some of our results, so any good data that we will receive will be 
 presented in the tape, with a mention of the donator.
 
 we are working on databases consisting of aerial or satelite photographs, 
 and terrain elevation maps (dtm). 
 each database consists of a 2d array of height values (any data format can
 be used for each value), and a corresponding 2d array of color values (can
 be gray-level, 256-color value or full 24-bit r/g/b values. other format can
 also be used). we work on 512x512 and 1024x1024 resolution databases.
 
 if anybody has access to this kind of data, or knows where we can get such
 data files, please respond in this news group, or - better - email us
 directly :
 
 amit@math.tau.ac.il    (amit shaked), or
 danny@indigo.bgu.ac.il (daniel cohen)
 
 of course, the names of the people who will help us get the data will be
 cited in our paper, and in further publications.
