 perhaps all of us hackers have become (ick) professionals?  i have noticed
 my and my associates progression from hackers to computer professionals.
 it is rather distasteful.  it occurs when a series of things happen:
 
    1) one's ego outgrows one's talent/knowledge
    2) one's financial situation takes precedence
    3) a change in priorities (esp. family) possibly leading to 2)
    4) the hacker's attitude makes the shift from "fun" to "work"
    5) one's vocation burns away the creativity needed for "the hobby"
 
 or the biggest killer (imo)
 
    6) one's dreams are (sadly) shattered on the hard rocks of society's
       version of reality.  without the dream the motivation dies, without
       the motivation the effort seems useless.
 
 another set of problems stems from our children.  while most of us remember
 when there were several completely different computer systems, our children
 are growing up with just a few choices (msdos/mac/amiga) and do not enjoy
 the diversity we did.  i remember the great computer fallout of the early
 eighties vividly as i was forced to stop using skills developed for systems
 that were now dead.  the diversity of systems before then allowed for widely
 divergent paradigms.  that period forced hackers to continually learn new
 systems in the attempt to keep up.  not to mention that if a program was
 needed we were forced (in most situations) to write it ourselves as a
 commercial offering was just not available.  now our children are being
 taught the "user" mentality.  as the number of us "old-timers" dwindle we are
 not being replaced by the next generation.
