    i need help in creating my 4x4 perspective matrix.  i'd like to use this for
    transforming x, y, z, w in some texture mapping code i got from graphics gems
    i.  i have many books which talk about this, but none of them in simple plain
    english.  if you have graphics gems i, i'm talking about page 678.
 
    i'd like to have a perspective matrix that handles different field-of-views
    and aspect of course.  thank's for your help.
 
 ca2 = cos(alpha / 2) horizontal
 sa2 = sin(alpha / 2)
 cb2 = cos(beta / 2) vertical
 sb2 = sin(beta 7 2)
 zf = far clipping value
 zn = near clipping value
 
 matrix:
 [[ca2/sa2 0 0 0]
 [0 cb2/sb2 0 0]
 [0 0 zf/(zf-zn) 1]
 [0 0 -zn*zf/(zf-zn) 0]]
