 it should have been made fairly clear that the *most* crimson would
 ever get was a 150 (75 old style) mhz cpu upgrade.  certainly this
 was mentioned on comp.sys.sgi on more than one occasion as being
 likely.  if our sales folks were saying otherwise, they were either
 confused, or less than honest/ethical, or somebody further up the
 chain inside sgi was misleading them.

 there were 4 versions (20, 25, 30, 35), although admittedly the 30 came
 out at the same time as the 35, over a period of 2 1/2 years.  the
 chassis simply couldn't be pushed any further.  i'd say 4 years was
 a pretty good lifespan, myself, for a system design in this day and
 age.  getting the 35 to work caused a lot of gray hairs in both the
 hardware and product design groups; we would have been out of our
 minds to push it further, and i *know* that was made clear, almost
 from the day the 35 started shipping.  we had one last kicker in
 the form of the elan graphics, which made 3 graphics versions over
 its lifespan, which i also think is pretty good.

 please, by all means send a complaint letter through sgi support
 or sales on your concerns.  there should be no reason for sales folks
 to misrepresent future upgrades to customers (sure, sometimes there
 will be confusion for a while, over whether an upgrade will be available,
 but that shouldn't last too long, and doesn't seem to be what you
 are referring to).
 
 yes, the sales folks *do* get bonus's at the end of some (all?) quarters,
 but that is pretty common industry wide, and sometimes that can result
 in good deals for customers (sometimes it probably pushes folks into
 systems that aren't what they need, i'm sure, but nobody is *forcing*
 you to buy at end of quarter, after all...)

 they don't get all that long a lead time either; although certainly
 they get presentations on possible new products, and their opinions
 may well influence the end product, but that also is life in the
 industry.  we can't design systems that meet just their needs, or we
 won't sell too many systems, after all (which is not to say that we
 don't have some niche products, like reality engine).

 but surely you don't expect a system you buy now for a five year
 period to be constantly upgradable over that entire five year
 period?  that's a rather unreasonable expectation, in my experience
 (with workstations/microcomputers).  supported, and parts available,
 yes, but certainly not upgradable to the latest and greatest!

 i missed your first posting, but as i say, by all means share your
 frustation with somebody at a level inside sgi where it might
 have an effect (not immediate, i'm sure, but complaints aren't
 going to be ignored, and *may* affect future plans, if we 
 hear similar things from more than one person/site).
 
 all of the above is, as usual, my personal opinion, not sgi's.
