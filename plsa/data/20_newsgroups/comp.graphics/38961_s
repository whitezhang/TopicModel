 does anyone know of any c or c++ libraries for preparing
 and displaying quickly pages of mixed text, mathematical equations,
 and graphics (circles,ellipses,etc) on the vdu? the maths wouldnt
 need to be up to tex quality, but it would be useful to be scaleable.
 the main thing would be to be able to generate the display quickly
 from a minimum set of formatting code.
 thanks,
