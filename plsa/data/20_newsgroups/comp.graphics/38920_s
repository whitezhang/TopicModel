 i'm working on a system which uses a given set of 3d key frame
 positions (x,y,z) to control an imaginary camera movement.  i'm
 using kochanek-bartels splines (as described in the siggraph '84
 proceedings) to create a variable number of inbetweens between
 the key frames.  i want the inbetweens to be given in the form
 (x,y,z,dx,dy,dz) where the last three argumentsa are the x, y and
 z component of the viewing direction vector of the camera when
 positioned at (x,y,z).
 
 the method presented by kochanek and bartels only deals with the
 positions of the inbetween view points to be generated.  i've
 tried to set the viewing direction at a view point equal to the
 chord between the two adjacent view points (which in general are
 not key frames), but this causes a sligt discontinuity of the
 viewing direction vector at the key frame positions (although
 the spatial movement seems to work fine; and i'm quite certain
 - i think :) - that i've not simply made an implementation
 error...)
 
 now i wonder if anyone out there has used this spline form for
 similar purposes and how they decided the viewing vectors.
 i'd appreciate replies to be emailed to me at
   iharkest@lise.unit.no
 anyone else interested in the answer will be sent a summary of
 the replies if they contact me.
