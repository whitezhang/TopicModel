 on my svr4 amiga unix box, i've got -lform, -lmenu, and -lpanel for
 use with the curses library.  guess what they provide? :-)
 
 unix press, ie. prentice-hall, has a programmer's guide for these
 tools, referred to as the fmli (forms mgmt language interface) and
 eti (extended terminal interface), now in it's 2nd edition.  it is
 isbn 0-13-020637-7.
 
 paraphrased from the outside back cover:
 
     fmli is a high-level programming tool for creating menus, forms,
     and text frames.  eti is a set of screen management library
     subroutines that promote fast development of application programs
     for window, panel, menu, and form manipulation.
 
 the fmli is a shell package which reads ascii text files and produces
 screen displays for data entry and presentation.  it consists of a
 "shell-like" environment of the "fmli" program and it's database
 files.  it is section 1f in the unix press manual.
 
 the eti are subroutines, part of the 3x manual section, provide
 support for a multi-window capability on an ordinary ascii terminal
 with controls built on top of the curses library.
