     i do not know if i am hitting the right news groups or not, any help in
 the right direction is more than welcome.  i need help finding a company
 that will take photographic images scanned in and modified by adobe photoshop
 and turn them into thermal prints or negatives.  i am looking for a place
 as close to north carolina as possible.  the images will be created on
 a macintosh quadra 800 running adobe photoshop and will then be stored in
 whatever format the vendor requires, perhaps 88m cartridges?
 
     the images will be black and white photographs scanned in with a 1200 dpi
 scanner then modified/corrected by adobe photoshop.  if anyone could help me
 or even give me phone numbers to people who could i would be very grateful.
 
     also if anyone else is doing what i am planning i would be happy to hear
 from you with any advice you might provide as to the computer system you
 use and/or any peripherals or software.  it seemed the quadra 800 would be
 my best bet to modify photographic images.  i am planning on buying a quadra
 800 with 32megs of ram, a 510meg hard drive, a 1200 dpi scanner, 17" sony 
 monitor and a 88meg cartridge drive and perhaps a cd rom.  i am new to
 computers and any advice would be great.
