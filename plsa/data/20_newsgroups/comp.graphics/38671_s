 i have a routine that changes the color (rgb) attributes on my
 vga adapter, but it doesn't work in the mode that i need.  
 specifically 68 hex.  an obscure mode, of course, but i need to
 change the zillions of colors to 64 shade greyscale, but i do
 not have the correct memory address for the pointer i need.
 
 please, someone, i need the starting address, or maybe somewhere 
 i can find it.  thank you.
