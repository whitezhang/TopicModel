 hi !
 
 if you want to have soft-scrolling on your vga, you have to change some 
 intern registers of the crtc. but it is a little bit difficult to explain, 
 so i would suggest, you take a look at "the programming of the 
 ega/vga-adapter" by addison-wesley. you will find all useful descriptions 
 for every available vga-register.
