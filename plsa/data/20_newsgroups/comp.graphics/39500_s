 can anyone around here point me to information regarding stereoscopic images?
 i believe i saw some at a show room in texas (lone star illusions)  and 
 they were amazing.  i've now heard that they were created with a simple 
 graphic program.  does anyone have any of these images digitized??  
 i really want to find a out as much as i can..
