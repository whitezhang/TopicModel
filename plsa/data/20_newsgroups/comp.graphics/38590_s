 
 
 i've got an old demo disk that i need to view. it was made using rix softworks.  
 the files on the two diskette set end with: .scf
 
 the demo was vga resolution (256 colors), but i don't know the spatial  
 resolution.
 
 first problem: when i try to run the demo, the screen has two black bars that  
 cut across (horizontally) the screen, in the top third and bottom third of the  
 screen. the bars are about 1-inch wide. other than this, the demo (the  
 animation part) seems to be running fine.
 
 second problem: i can't find any graphics program that will open and display  
 these files. i have a couple of image conversion programs, none mention .scf  
 files.
 
 the system i am using: 486clone, diamond speedstar 24, sony monitor.
 
 any suggestions?
 
 thank you,
