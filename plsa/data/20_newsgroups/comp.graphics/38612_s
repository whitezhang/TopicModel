   i've talked with mark and he faxed some literature, though it wasn't very helpful-
   just a list of routine names: _bsplinesurface, _drawstring3d... 241 names.
   there was a product info sheet that explained some of the package capabilities.
   i also found a review in april/may '92 mactutor.
 
   it does look like a good package. the current price is $295 us.
