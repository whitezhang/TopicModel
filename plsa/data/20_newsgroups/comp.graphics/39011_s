 sorry, i'm not a rayshade user - but hey, it looks like this group could
 use some traffic.  my guess is that "metallic" isn't a color, in the rgb
 sense.  rather, it's a matter of how the surface reflects light.  i'm not
 sure what property metallic materials have, that makes them recognizable
 as such, but i'm pretty sure any color material can look metallic.
