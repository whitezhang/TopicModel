 hello netters
 
 sorry, i don't know if this is the right way of doing this kind of thing,
 probably should be a cfv, but since i don't have tha ability to create a 
 news group myself, i just want to start the discussion. 
 
 i enjoy reading c.g very much, but i often find it difficult to sort out what
 i'm interested in. everything from screen-drivers, graphics cards, graphics
 programming and graphics programs are discused here. what i'd like is a 
 comp.graphics.programmer news group.
 what do you other think.

 often disregarded. seldom you hear them beeing prized, as seldom as you hear 
 a seeing man prizeing what he sees." per lagerkvist, the fist
