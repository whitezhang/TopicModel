 i was wondering if anyone has ever seen/heard of a utility that converts
 any type of image format (gif,tiff,pcx,bmp,jpeg,etc.) to an ascii
 representation.  i have seen some very sophiticated art in ascii format, but
 never was i able to find the author or any program that may have converted
 the data from a picture format.
 
 any help or leads would be great. thanks in advance.
