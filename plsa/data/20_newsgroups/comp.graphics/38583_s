 
 hi net!
 due to further investigation i would like to study the following article:
 	peterson, "ray tracing general b-splines",
 	proc. acm mountain regional conference, april 1986
 unfortunately i didn't find it in any library's register.
 if there is anyone having access to this paper or knowing about a
 library containing those proceedings (preferrably in germany), please 
 let me know! any help would be appreciated! 
 
 thanks a lot, 
 joerg haber
