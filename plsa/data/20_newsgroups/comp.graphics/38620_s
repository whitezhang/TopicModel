 i have heard some impressive things about hijakk (for windows).
 currently, i use a shareware program called graphics workshop.
 what kinds of things will hijaak do that these shareware programs
 will not do?
 
 what has been your experience with hijaak? are there other programs
 that are better? please email me, if you can help:
