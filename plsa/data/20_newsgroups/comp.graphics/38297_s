 a book that i can somewhat recommend is :
                      
                      pratical image processing in c
                      by craig a. lindley
                      published by wiley
 
 it addresses reading/writing to/from pcx/tiff files; image acquisition, 
 manipulation and storage; and has source code in the book. the source is 
 primarily written in turbo c and naturally has conversion possibilities. i 
 have converted some of it to quick c. naturally, the code has some problems 
 in the book - as usuall. typos, syntax, etc. are problems. it can be a good 
 learning experience for someone who is studying c. there is also a companion 
 disk with source available for order and $50.00. overall, the book is not 
 bad. i acquired the book at waldensoftware.
