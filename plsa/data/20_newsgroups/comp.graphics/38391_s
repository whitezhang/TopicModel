 
 howdy all,
 
 	i was wondering if people could e-mail me their opinions on
 the various graphics viewers available for ms-windows 3.x...  i'm
 working on a project to set up our scanner and write documentation on
 how to use it and it would be nice to have a snazzy image viewer 
 to look at (and maybe even edit?) the image you just scanned.
 
 the file formats i'm looking for:
 
 gif
 jpeg
 tiff
 pcx
 whatever other 'major' file formats there are.
 
 thanks a lot for your help
