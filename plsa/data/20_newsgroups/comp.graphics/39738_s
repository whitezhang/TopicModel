 well, i am placing a file at my ftp today that contains several
 polygonal descriptions of a head, face, skull, vase, etc. the format
 of the files is a list of vertices, normals, and triangles. there are
 various resolutions and the name of the data file includes the number
 of polygons, eg. phred.1.3k.vbl contains 1300 polygons.
 
 
 in order to get the data via ftp do the following:
 
 	1) ftp taurus.cs.nps.navy.mil
 	2) login as anonymous, guest as the password
 	3) cd pub/dabro
 	4) binary
 	5) get cyber.tar.z
 
 once you get the data onto your workstation:
 
 	1) uncompress data.tar.z
 	2) tar xvof data.tar
 
 if you have any questions, please let me know.
