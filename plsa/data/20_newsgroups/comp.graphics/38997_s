 yes, i have both arts & letters and coreldraw.  i personally like
 arts & letters better but there are things i like about arts & letters
 that coreldraw doesn't do an vice-versa.  i haven't found the perfect
 graphics program that does everything yet.  
 
 my favorite feature from coreldraw is that it imports alot of different
 formats.  arts & letters does not.  i like the thousands of clipart
 available with arts & letters.  however, i do find looking them up
 in a book and referencing them by number to be annoying.
 
 one of my major problems is that there isn't any programs available on
 the market for the artistically deprived :-).
