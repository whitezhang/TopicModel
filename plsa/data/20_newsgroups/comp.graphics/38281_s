 	i just got my advance program and the "card in the back" is for the
 	exhibits plus program -- the exhibits plus admission to a number of
 	conference venues, including a special general session, "behind the
 	scenes: computer graphics in film."  admission is not free, but is a
 	nominal $30 (exhibits are open august 3 -- 5).
 
 	to get a copy of the advance program, you can call 312-321-6830; the
 	advance program itself is a good indication of the excitement of the
 	conference!
