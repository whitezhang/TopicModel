 
 hi all,
 	i am working on a project in which i need to brake an image
 into sub-bands and then work with them.  since i have never done
 anything like this, don't even understand the concept of sub-bands, i
 was wondering if there is some software out there that would allow me
 to do this.  any hints?
 thanks,
