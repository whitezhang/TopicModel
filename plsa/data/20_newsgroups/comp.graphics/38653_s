 i have a small program to extract a 640x480 image from a vga 16 color screen,
 and store that image in a tiff file.  i need to insert the image into a
 sales brochure, which i then need printed in 4 color.  on a mac, i would
 use photoshop to separate the image into 5 eps files, and then pull it into
 quark express, then get it printed to film on a lintronix at a service bureau.
 
 however, i don't have a mac, but i do have windows.  what would i need to 
 do this type of operation in the windows 3.1 environment?  are there any
 separation programs available on the net?  is there a good page layout program
 that i should look into?
 
 thanks in advance.
