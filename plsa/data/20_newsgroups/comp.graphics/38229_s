 abstract:
 
 imagicians artware, inc. is entering into early beta site testing on silicon 
 graphics workstations of a new 2d abstract artwork and animation package called 
 chance's art.  the package will be described and demonstrated, and some of the 
 technical issues will be discussed.  marketing plans will be outlined.  the 
 talk will also present some of the technical and business problems increasingly 
 confronting small startup software companies today, and some of the 
 opportunities this situation presents.
 
 time after the event will be allocated for hands-on demonstrations to 
 interested parties.  silicon graphics is graciously providing an indigo for 
 this event.  myck kupka will also be demonstrating his computerized interactive 
 reflective stereoscope, which is installed upstairs in the mcluhan centre, so 
 feel free to drop by for a demonstration before or after the event. btw, be 
 sure to sing "happy birthday, myck"...
 
 the names of nominees for our siggraph executive offices will be announced at 
 this meeting.  nominations will still be open until the election at our 
 may 18th event; call myck kupka at 465-0943 or fax to 465-0729.
