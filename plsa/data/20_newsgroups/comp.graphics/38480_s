 there was a very useful article in one of the 1989 issues of
 transactions on graphics. i believe maureen stone was one of
 the authors. sorry not to be more specific. i don't have the
 reference here with me.
 
 the article actually was more general than this, giving a way to decide
 whether a given (cubic) bezier curve contains cusps, intersection points
 or whatever wierdness. the same treatment is also available in siggraph 89
 course notes for the course called "math for siggraph" or something like
 that.
