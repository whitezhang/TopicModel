 hi i'm new to imaging, and my advisor and i would like to 
 do some 3d reconstructions.
 
 we take slides (biological), and image them on a 486.  then
 the software allows us to trace the outline of the objects 
 we want to save.  the outlines are stored as a tiff file.
 
 we would like to convert a group of these outlines into a 
 3d image.  we are unsure as to where to begin.  someone mentioned
 that if we could convert the tiff into a vector format then 
 we could view them in autocad.
 
 any help would be greatly appreciated.
