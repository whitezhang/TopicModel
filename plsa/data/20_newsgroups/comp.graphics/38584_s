  our shop uses a package called cadcore - very good - to scan and
 subsequently vectorize original maps into digital maps. the problem is that
 once the raster file is loaded into the cadcore package, a header is added
 to the .hrf file which makes it unreadable by the supplied converter. we
 would like to be able to ship some of the already-altered raster images for
 further use on our workstations. so, here are my questions:
 
  (1) what is the hitachi format? - i need this format so i can recognize
 precisely what to strip out. i strongly suspect that it's a compressed
 format - if so, then t might not be possible for me to strip out the
 offending header.
 
  (2) are there any unix packages that read and recognize hrf? it would be
 really nice to find some sort of "hrftopbm" converter out there. ;)
 
  i've already searched some of the more well-known ftp sites which contain
 graphics formats documentation, with no luck. so, if you know, or knwo
 someone who knows - please email! thanks.
