         continuing education and summer sessions
  
                   course description
  
  within the past ten years, the  simulation and  modeling of
 followup-to: fyi
 lines: 197
 
 molecules has evolved from an esoteric academic subject into
 a  international  industry. computer  graphics has played  a
 decisive role in this transformation by allowing chemists to
 build, visualize and interact with complex geometrical objects.
  
 while computer scientists are conversant in the language of their
 own discipline, they are often unfamiliar with the terminology,
 simulation techniques and practical needs of research chemists.
 similarly, chemists are often unfamiliar with the latest paradigms
 and technological advances in graphical computing.
  
 this interdisciplinary course is intended to bridge the gap
 between computer science and chemistry and to equip chemistry
 researchers who wish to be more than just casual users of
 prepackaged graphics software. although this is not intended to
 be a course in computational chemistry or drug design, data sets
 from chemical research problems will be used in lab and students
 will be encouraged to bring data sets of their own. lab exercises
 and projects will be carried out using data-flow programming
 (ibm visualization data explorer software) and students will have
 access to cornell theory center computing resources, including video
 recording equipment.
  
 audience:  researchers and students in the chemical and biological
            sciences interested in integrating state-of-the-art
            computer graphics into their research; computer scientists
            wishing to gain familiarity with a major application of
            scientific visualization.
  
            the class size will be limited to 25 participants on a
            first-come first-served basis.
  
 level:     graduate/advanced undergraduate, 1 or 2 credits. may be taken
            without credit as a workshop. calculus, linear algebra
            and introductory chemistry required. familiarity with unix,
            x-windows and c is useful but not required.
  
 date:   june 14-25, 1993  (2 credits)
         june 14-18, 1993  (1 or 0 credits)
  
 time:   mon-fri 9:00 am to 12:00 pm and 1:00 pm to 4:00 pm
  
 cost:   0 or 1 credit       $410
         2 credits           $820
  
 format
  
 the course will be held in the theory center training facility
 where computer workstations will be available.  daily lectures will be
 interspersed with laboratory exercises and ample time will be provided
 for project enablement and familiarization with the new computing
 environment. students enrolled for one credit will be graded on the basis
 of their laboratory exercises and short final project. those enrolled
 for a second credit will receive more advanced lectures, be given
 more time for project development and meet daily to share experience
 and discuss problems encountered.
