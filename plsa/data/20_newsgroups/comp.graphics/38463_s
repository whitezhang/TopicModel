 
 	about a year ago i started work on a problem that appeared to
 be very simple and turned out to be quite difficult.  i am wondering if
 anyone on the net has seen this problem and (hopefully) some published 
 solutions to it.
 
 	the problem is to draw an outline of a surface defined by two
 roughly parallel cubic splines.  for inputs the problem essentially
 starts with two sets of points where each set of points is on the 
 edge of an object which we treat as two dimensional, i.e. only extant
 between the edges, but which exists in three dimensional space.  to draw 
 the object we 
 
 1) fit a cubic spline through the points.  each spline is effectively
 	computed as a sequence of line segments approximating the
         curve.  each spline has an equal number of segments.  we assume
 	that the nth segment along each spline is roughly, but not
 	exactly, the same distance along each spline by any reasonable
 	measure.
 2) take each segment (n) along each spline and match it to the nth segment
 	of the opposing spline.  use the pair of segments to form two
 	triangles which will be filled in to color the surface.
 3) depth sort the triangles
 4) take each triangle in sorted order, project onto a 2d pixmap, draw
 	and color the triangle.  take the edge of the triangle that is
 	along the edge of the surface and draw a line along that edge
 	colored with a special "edge color"
 
 	it is the edge coloring in step 4 that is at the heart of the
 problem.  the idea is to effectively outline the edge of the surface.
 the net result however generally has lots of breaks and gaps in
 the edge of the surface.  the reasons for this are fairly complicated.
 they involve both rasterization problems and problems resulting
 from the projecting the splines.  if anything about this problem
 sounds familiar we would appreciate knowing about other work in this
 area.
