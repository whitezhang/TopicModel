 stop! stop! stop! stop! this argument is getting silly! xv-3.00 now handles
 24-bit images without quantizing them. all these arguments are moot, null, 
 and void. please stop quibbling about a now obsolete version of the program.
 
 besides, you can now generate tons of verbiage about the new shareware
 licensing it uses instead ...
