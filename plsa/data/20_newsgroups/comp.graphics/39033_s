 "only"?!?  that's a long time! (echoing above posting)  the way the market
 is going nowadays, your machine's obsolete two weeks before you buy it. 
 sounds like you'll have to sink *some* money into it for repair, but
 that's sometimes necessary for equipment.

 i think 21 months with nothing wrong until now is quite reasonable.  if
 you had bought a compaq or toshiba, you might have reasonably expected the
 machine to last longer before something went wrong; but that's a moot
 point, perhaps.
