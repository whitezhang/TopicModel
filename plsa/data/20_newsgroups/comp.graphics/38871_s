 greetings this is a general call for information regarding image
 processing. i am looking for any material related to the field, and am
 also trying to get my hands on some easy to use packages related to the
 field. in particular source code for general use packages.
 
 i already have several texts on the subject, but would appreciate more
 input from people more knowledgable in the field than myself. i'm not
 mathematically literate (ie. i don't have a degree in mathematics), so
 any material that is suggested i would prefer that it was not
 mathematically intensive.
 
 the best book i have found on the subject at the moment is:
 
 "practical digital image processing"
 by rhys lewis
 isbn: 0-13-683525-2
 published by ellis horwood (c)1990.
 
 likewise i am trying to get a fair sample of programs that demonstrate
 image processing techniques. so far i have 'xv', and 'khoros' for unix.
 'dcview 2.1' for the ibm pc, and various related smatterings of c code
 to help describe topics like, contrasting, dithering, image enhancement
 via convolution etc.
 
 if anyone could kindly supply me with some public domain software
 pertinent to this area, or better still if they could tell me where i am
 most likely to find it on the aarnet (internet). if i can i would prefer
 source code in c or turbo pascal that includes some image processing
 code/algorithms, that i can readily alter/manipulate for the purposes of
 demonstration it would be most helpful.
 
 all the above information will contribute to my post-graduate studies,
 and will be liberally used in my paper, and seminar on the subject.
