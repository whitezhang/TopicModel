 i'm not sure if this is the correct place to ask this question.  if not,
 please forgive me and point me in the right direction.
 
 does anybody know of a program that converts .gif files to .bmp files
 and if so, where can i ftp it from?  any help would be greatly 
 appreciated.
 
 please respond via e-mail as i do not read this group very often.
 
 thanks...scott
