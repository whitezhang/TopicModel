 i'm sure it is, and i am not amused.  every time i read that part of the
 tiff spec, it infuriates me- and i'm none too happy about the
 complexity of the spec anyway- because i think their "arbitrary but
 carefully chosen number" is neither.  additionally, i find their
 choice of 4 bytes to begin a file with meaningless of themselves- why
 not just use the letters "tiff"?
 
 (and no, i don't think they should have bothered to support both word
 orders either- and i've found that many tiff readers actually
 don't.)
