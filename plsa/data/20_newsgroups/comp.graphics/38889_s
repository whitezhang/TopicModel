 well, i dived in feet first and reverse engineered the .prj file as much
 as i needed to - extracted the mapping icon information - which is
 when it dawned on me that 3d studio is useless for my needs. i need
 a mapping icon per applied texture.  i want to use a special purpose
 graphics computer for rendering the 3ds models and it requires a texture
 rule/plane to be specified in 3space, i.e. position/orientation of the
 mapping rule.  since only one mapping icon is used in 3ds to apply
 textures to all objects/faces, it renders (no pun intended) 3ds totally
 unsuitable for my needs.
 
 anyone got a contact for alias upfront or any other good modeller for a
 pc?  i must be able to specify texture rules (one per texture) and this
 must be saved in a file which i can read.  i haven't found any info on alias
 in the copy of the faq that i have.
