 i'm making a customized paint program in dos and need an algorithm
 for reading bitmap files like gif, pcx, or bmp.  does anyone have
 such an algorithm?  i've tried copying one out of a book for reading
 .pcx format but it doesn't work.  i will take an algorithm for any
 format that can be created from windows paint.  
 thanks!
