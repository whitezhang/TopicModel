 good i had a bad feeling about this problem because of a special case
 with no solution that worried me.
 
 four coplanar points in the shape of a square have no unique sphere 
 that they are on the surface of.
 similarly 4 colinear point have no finite sized sphere that they are on the
 surface of.
 
 these algorithms being geometrical designed rather than algebraically design
 meet these problems neatly.
 
 when determining which plane the 3 points are on if they are colinear
 the algorithm should afil or return infinite r.
 when intersecting the two lines there are 2 possibilities
 they are the same line  (the 4 points were on a planar circle)
 they are different lines but parallel. there is a sphere of in radius.
 
 this last case can be achieved with 3 colinier points and any 4th point
 by taking the 4th point and pairs of the first 3 parallel lines will be produced
 
 it can also be achieved by
 
 if all 4 points are coplanar but are not on one circle. 
 
 it seems to me that the algorithm only fails when the 4 points are coplanar.
 the algorithm always fails when the points are coplanar.
 (4 points being colinear => coplanar)
 
 testing if the 4th point is coplanar when the plane of the first 3 points
 has been found is trivial.
