 there are some tricks to installing atm to windows... install them first
 to dos, then run the atm control panel to get them into windows.
 
 the best reason for atm is that adobe is the standard.  truetype is a
 failed ms venture to undercut adobe when adobe was being nasty about
 keeping their formats proprietary.  just about any service bureau or print
 shop will smirk and send you on your way if you bring a truetype document
 to them for high resolution printing or ripping.
 
 although there are lots of pretty tt fonts floating around, they are really
 for dot matrix or your own lazer printer.
 however, you can convert your tt fonts with fontmonger or some similar program
 to atm fonts for high end stuff.
 
 if you are using dot matrix for all your printing, you may have wasted
 your money!
