 	does anyone know of a fractal terrain generator for mac, something
 	i could hopefully import into a 3d program like swivel or stratavision?
 	i know infini-d has built in capabilities, but i don't have access to
 	infini-d. i downloaded two programs from umich, in graphics/fractals,
 	but both were from 1990-91 and crashed under system 7. i think they
 	were black and white anyway. please, email me if you know of anything,
 	as i don't check the newsgroups very often.
 		thanks in advance.
