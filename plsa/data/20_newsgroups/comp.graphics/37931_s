 #i use xwd/xpr (from the x11r5 dist.) and various programs of the
 #ppm-tools to print hardcopies of colored x windows. my problem is,
 
 i don't like xpr. it gives (at least, the x11r4 version does) louzy
 output: the hardcopy looks very grainy to me.
 instead, i use pnmtops. this takes full advantage postscript, and
 lets the printer do the dirty job of dithering a (graylevel)
 image to black and white dots.
 
 so: if you have a postscript printer, try:
 	xwdtopnm <xwdfile> |	# convert to ppm
 	[ppmtopgm |]		# .. to graylevel for smaller file to print
 	pnmtops -noturn |	# .. to postscript
 	lpr			# print
 
 pnmtops has several neat options, but use them with care:
 if you want your image to be 4" wide, use:
 	pnmtops -noturn -scale 100 -width 4
 -noturn prevents the image from being rotated (if it is wider than it
 	is high)
 -width 4 specifies the paper width (not the image width - see below)
 -scale 100 is used because if the image is small, it may fit within a
 	width less than 4", and will thus be printed smaller than 4" wide.
 	if you first scale it up a lot, it will certainly not fit in 4", and
 	will be scaled down by pnmtops automatically to fit the specified
 	paper width. 
 	in short: pnmtops will scale an image down to fit the paper size,
 	but it will not blow it up automatically.
 
 hope this helps.
