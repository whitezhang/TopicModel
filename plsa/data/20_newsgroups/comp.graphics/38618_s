 rix's files with the extension  .sci and .scf are just a raw file with
 a 256 color palette.
 the first 10 bytes is a kind of header, with the name rix among 7bytes unknown stuff. the you have 768 bytes of palette info (3*256 for the colors rgb)
 and then you have the picture in raw format.
 if you dont know how to make a viewer of of this description you can get vpic
 it is able to read the files!
