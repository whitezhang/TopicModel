 i've been playing with a program called piclab to modify some .gif files. the
 problem is it keeps displaying only 50% of the image. starting from the top, it
 displays20%, leaves 20% blank, then down another 20% etc. anyone know what i'm
 doing wrong, or is there another piece of software i should use instead?
 
 thanks for your tolerance!
