 i don't know about that...i've used photoshop 2.5 on both a 486dx-50 and a quadra
 950...i'd say they are roughly equal.  if anything the 486 was faster.
 
 both systems were running in 24 bit color and had the same amount of ram (16 megs)
 i also believe the quadra had one of those photoshop accelerators.
