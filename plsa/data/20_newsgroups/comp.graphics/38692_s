 	sphinx is a user-friendly, state-of-the-art image processing
 and analysis package that runs across a spectrum of high performance 
 computer platforms operating unix and the x-window system.
 
 	it was created to meet to the daily research needs of scientists 
 conducting climate investigations using satellite data and remote
 sensing techniques. 
 
 		   intuitive graphic interface
 
 	sphinx features an interactive interface with pop-up menus and 
 point-and-click dialog boxes which makes image processing and
 analysis simple and fast.
 	this accessible menuing enables you to build attractive image 
 layouts quickly while also providing you the flexibility of returning
 to the main menu to conduct other image analysis and processing operations.
 
 		    image format compatibility
 
 	using smart read/write functions, sphinx allows you to easily open
 and save image files in a variety of formats using bit, integer or real
 data values.  sphinx also reads and writes the common tiff and gif formats
 as well as compresses and decompresses image formats to save disk space.
 
 		    image analysis & processing
 
 	for image and pixel analysis, the sphinx package includes an
 assortment of processing tools that perform useful statistical and 
 mathematical filtering operations, such as fourier transforms, convolution 
 product or principal component analyses.
 an interactive interpreter for both algebraic equations and images allows
 the user to manipulate and combine individual data channels interactively.
 standard fortran notation is used for formula entry and for trig
 onometric and transcendental functions.
 
 		    satellite spectra & orbit analysis
 
 	sphinx possesses functions to simulate satellite signal sensitivity
 for various meteorological satellites (e.g., goes, meteosat, noaa, spot etc.).
 the simulations are conducted for a selection of standard atmospheric and
 surface conditions and instrument spectral bands.
 a geometry model computes the solar zenith angles, warping, orbit simulation,
 and 3-d image projection.
 
 		    easy external program interfacing
 
 	sphinx allows users the flexibility to integrate externally
 developed software algorithms for processing and converting satellite
 observations.  sphinx exports and imports image files and image parameters
 to external programs using special interface functions.
 
 		    quick quality presentation
 
 	sphinx rapidly displays, manipulates, and enhances high-resolution
 multispectral images and color tables.  using six 8-bit 1024x1024 image
 planes and one graphics plane, the package conveniently combines color images,
 graphics and text to generate sharp digital images for articles and reports.
 sphinx's 2-d and 3-d graphics editor provides complete flexibility for modifying
 and integrating vector graphics and analysis plots with images, such as 
 histograms and radial graphs.  the package supplies color and gray scale
 output for standard inkjet and laser printers.
 	other capabilities sphinx also performs image animation, external 
 graphics importing, mosaic fitting... what else?
 
 		    software support & development
 
 	 sphinx was developed at the laboratoire d'optique atmospherique (loa)
  of the universite de lille, france.
 the package has received critical feedback and support from scientists at
 the french national laboratory, centre national de recherche scientifique (cnrs),
 and the french space agency, centre national d'etudes spatiales (cnes).
 at loa, sphinx undergoes continued refinement and development to meet changing
 research needs and advances in computer technology.  the package, which features
 on-line help, is supported by an internet address
 
  sphinx@loasil.citilille.fr through which questions can be answered and
  version updates provided without delay.
 
 		    performance tested
 
  	cnes has selected sphinx to analyze and process the satellite data 
 collected during the upcoming adeos/polder satellite mission.  today,
 the sphinx package is in use at the nasa - goddard space flight center
 and is widely used in many french laboratories, including
 the centre de recherche en physique de l'environnement, ecole normale superieure ,
 laboratoire d' etudes et de recherches en teledetection spatiale,  laboratoire 
 de meteorologie dynamique.
 
 
    a test version of sphinx is available at loasil.citilille.fr
    (134.206.50.4) anonymous (bin : cd sphinx : get all_sphinx.tar.z)
 
    in the test version the output files are disable. however the
    visualisation and graphic functions are available. this is
    sufficient to work with.

    and you will receive news about the package evolution.
 
    the software is changing with user suggestions we will
    appreciate your comments.
