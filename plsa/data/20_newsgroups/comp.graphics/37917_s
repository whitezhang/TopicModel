     while i don't mean to damn henrik's attempt to be helpful here,
 he's using a common misconception that should be corrected.
 
     mach banding will occur for any image.  it is not the color
 quantization you see when you don't have enough bits.  it is the
 human eye's response to transitions or edges between intensities.
 the result is that colors near the transistion look brighter on
 the brighter side and darker on the darker side.
