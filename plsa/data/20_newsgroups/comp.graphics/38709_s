 i'd be happy to us (international) snail mail technical information on
 imaging databases to anyone who needs it, if you can provide me with your
 address for hard copy (not email).  we're focusing mostly on open pace,
 oracle, ingres, adabas, sybase, and gupta, regarding our imaging
 databases installed.  (we have over 1,000 installed and in production now;
 most of the new ones going in are on novell lans, the rs/6000, and now hp
 unix workstations.)  we work with visual basic too.
