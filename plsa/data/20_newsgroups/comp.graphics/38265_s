 this past week i've been playing with some of the r-d (reaction-
 diffusion, not to be confused with rds or r&d) techniques
 from siggraph '91.
 
 i was wondering what material is available to explain the control
 mechanism a little more.  it seems to me very much like a matter of
 picking random magic numbers and sitting back and waiting.  although
 both of the papers (turk and witkin & kass) were very well organized
 and extremely helpful, i guess what i need is a more basic description
 of the technique, especially wrt the control mechanisms.  the tests
 that i did had a tendency to either turn into blurry mud or become
 unstable.
 
 is there any info available online?  source code would be great but
 not necessary.
 
 thanks!
