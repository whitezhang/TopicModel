 
 hello,
   i've been trying to bump map a gif onto a sphere for a while and i
 can't seem to get it to work.  image mapping works, but not bump
 mapping.  here's a simple file i was working with, could some kind
 soul tell me whats wrong with this.....
 
 #include "colors.inc"
 #include "shapes.inc"
 #include "textures.inc"
  
 camera {
   location  <0 1 -3>
   direction <0 0 1.5>
   up        <0 1 0>
   right     <1.33 0 0>
   look_at   <0 1 2>
 }
  
 object { light_source { <2 4 -3> color white }
        }
  
 object {
   sphere { <0 1 2> 1 }
    texture {
      bump_map { 1 <0 1 2> gif "surf.gif"}
    }
 }
 
 note: surf.gif is a plasma fractal from fractint that is using the
 landscape palette map.
 
   
 	thanks in advance
