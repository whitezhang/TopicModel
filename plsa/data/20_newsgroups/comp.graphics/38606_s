 i have an ati graph. ultra pro vlb w/2 megs, and have a small question
 about graphics workshop for windows.  when i exit from it it says my
 current driver can handle on 32768 colors when i am actually in 
 1024x768x65000 color mode.  is this a driver problem, a gws error, or
 what?  i am using the 1.5(59) driver under win 3.1.  it correctly
 states that i can display 16m colors when i switch to 800x600x24bit,
 though.
 another question- anybody know of any viewers that support this card
 other than windows viewers?
 any help would be appreciated.
