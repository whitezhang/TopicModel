 	intro to access.bus (re: the access.bus software creator's 
 	contest announcement)
 
 what is access.bus?
 
 access.bus is a new open industry standard for computer 
 peripheral connectivity.  access.bus is a serial protocol that 
 uses simple, low-cost i2c technology to link multiple devices to 
 a single pc port.  peripheral devices such as keyboards or 
 keypads, locators (mice, trackballs, joysticks), printers, vr 
 gloves, digitizers, sensors, actuators or data transmitters and 
 others can be easily daisy chained to the host pc.  applications 
 such as cad/cam, data acquisition, simulation, virtual reality, 
 multiple-player/single pc games, education and many, many more 
 can now take advantage of access.bus, the technology that puts 
 plug and play on every pc.
 
 the access.bus offers advantages to end-users and developers of 
 systems and peripherals.  multiple devices connect to the host 
 computer with only one port.  common communication methods for a 
 number of device types lead to simplified hardware and software 
 development.  as an open standard, access.bus enables cross-
 platform use of the same device.
 
 access.bus technological description:
 =====================================
 
 access.bus technology is an open specification, enabling anyone 
 to implement it on host systems or in peripheral devices without 
 fee or royalty.
 access.bus has a bus topology architecture.  that is, a single 
 host can accommodate up to 125 peripheral devices.  access.bus 
 data rate is 100 kbits/sec.
 
 access.bus physical layer
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 access.bus is a serial bus architecture, based on i2c hardware 
 protocol, with one data line and one clock line.
 standard low-cost i2c microcontrollers handle bit-level 
 handshaking, including automatic arbitration and clock 
 synchronization.  
 
 access.bus software protocols
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 the access.bus communication protocol is composed of three 
 levels: i2c protocol, base protocol, and application protocol.
 
 i2c protocol: this simple and efficient protocol defines 
 arbitration among contending masters without losing data.  i2c 
 provides for cooperative synchronization of bus partners with 
 different clock rates.  bus transactions include addressing, 
 framing of bits into bytes, and byte acknowledgment by the 
 receiver.  
 
 base protocol: establishes the asymmetrical interconnect between 
 a host computer and multiple peripherals.  the host becomes the 
 access.bus manager.  the base protocol defines the format of an 
 access.bus message envelope, which is an i2c bus transaction with 
 additional semantics, including checksum.
 unique features of the base protocol are auto-addressing and hot 
 plugging.  auto-addressing assigns devices with unique bus 
 addresses, without the need for setting jumpers or switches.  hot 
 plugging is the ability to attach and detach devices while the 
 system is running, without rebooting.
 
 application protocol: this is the highest level of the access.bus 
 protocol which defines message semantics specific to particular 
 types of devices.  each type requires a different application 
 protocol.  three broad device types have been identified: 
 keyboards, locators, and text devices.
 
 access.bus support on the pc
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 all three levels of the access.bus protocol are supported on the 
 pc.  an add-on card implements the physical layer and uses the 
 base protocol to communicate with physical access.bus devices.  
 an access.bus manager - tsr under dos and a dll under windows 3.1 
 - controls the operation of the physical layer and interacts with 
 the access.bus device drivers.  drivers are available for 
 multiple access.bus keyboards, locators and printers for dos and 
 windows 3.1.  also available are c language source code examples 
 of the interface from applications to the device drivers.
