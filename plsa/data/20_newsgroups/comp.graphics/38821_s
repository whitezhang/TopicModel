 rome reborn:  the vatican library and renaissance culture
 presents some 200 of the vatican library's most precious
 manuscripts, books, and maps--many of which played a key role in
 the humanist recovery of the classical heritage of greece and
 rome.  the exhibition presents the untold story of the vatican
 library as the intellectual driving force behind the emergence of
 rome as a political and scholarly superpower during the
 renaissance.  the exhibit will be on display in the jefferson
 building of the library of congress from january 8, 1993 through
 april 30, 1993.  the online exhibit will be available by
 anonymous ftp indefinitely.
 
      the exhibit is divided into nine (9) sections:  the vatican
 library, archaeology, humanism, mathematics, music, medicine &
 biology, nature described, a wider world i: how the orient came
 to rome, and a wider world ii: how rome went to china.  each
 section consists of its own sub-directory within the /exhibit
 directory and contains the exhibit text for that section and
 separate jpeg image files for each object.  this online exhibit
 includes not only objects from the library of congress exhibit,
 but also the alternate objects (brought from rome to be used if
 there were a problem with one of the primary objects) and items
 omitted later in the planning process.
 
      this exhibit will be of interest to medieval and renaissance
 scholars in particular, but also to art historians, historians of
 science or medicine, early music scholars, students of the
 humanist movement, students of printing and the printed word,
 theologians, scholars of both far and near eastern studies, and
 to librarians and information professionals.  please get the
 readme file for details on what files this exhibit contains.  if
 you have questions about how to use ftp, speak to your local
 computer support person.  if you have questions or comments about
 the content of the exhibit, please write to vatican@kell.loc.gov
 while if you have any questions or comments on the system please
 contact me.
