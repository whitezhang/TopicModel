 there might be an ipas routine that does that,but i can'r be sure.  another
 way to do it is to render the scene without the glass object and save the
 image.  then assign that image to your glass object as a reflection.  it will
 take a lot of adjusting for position and size of the reflection, but that's
 the only thing i can think of.
