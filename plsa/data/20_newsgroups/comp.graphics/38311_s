 i don't think speed has been determined, since it has never run on intel chips.
 but on the amiga's motorola chips, it was one of the fastest true 'ray tracers'
 
 i don't think impulse would port it over and not take speed into consideration.
 
 in terms of features, and learning curve... all that you stated for 3ds is also
 true for imagine, and lots more... but i'll have to admit that after 3 years of
 use on the amiga, the learning curve is very steep. this is due only to the
 manual. it is realy bad. however, there is a lot of after market support for
 this product, including regular 'tips' articles in many magazines such as "avid
 and a great book by steve worley called "understanding imagine 2.0" this book i
 is not just recommened, it is a must!
 
 i think an important consideration should be price......
 $3000 for 3ds (not including "tool" packages)
 under $500 for imagine complete.
