 does anyone know how to decode the color information of a ntsc signal ?
 
 i need to convert this data to rgb for a video capture utility i am 
 writing for use with an ibm m-motion video adapter card...
 
 i need to know the how the v and u signals work in the color process.
 
 thanks in advance for any information or algorythms etc.
