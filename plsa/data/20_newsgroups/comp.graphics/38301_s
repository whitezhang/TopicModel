 wow! a 68070! i'd be very interested to get my hands on one of these,
 especially considering the fact that motorola has not yet released the
 68060, which is supposedly the next in the 680x0 lineup. 8-d
 
 ricardo, the animation playback to which lawrence was referring in an
 earlier post is plain old quicktime 1.5 with the compact video codec.
 i've seen digitized video (some of apple's early commercials, to be
 precise) running on a centris 650 at about 30fps very nicely (16-bit
 color depth). i would expect that using the same algorithm, a risc
 processor should be able to approach full-screen full-motion animation,
 though as you've implied, the processor will be taxed more with highly
 dynamic material.
