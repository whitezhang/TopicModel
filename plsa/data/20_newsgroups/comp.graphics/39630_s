 i'm having a slight problem with the pov raytracer.  i'm not sure if
 this is the correct group to post to or not.  i create .tga files on
 a unix machine using pov.  then when i download them to display on my pc,
 they're listed as bad files.  but when i create the file on my pc, it displays
 fine.  are unix .tga's incompatible with the pc?  an easy solution to this
 problem would be a unix targa->gif converter.  anyone know where i could
 find one?  any help on this subject is appreciated.
