 sorry i missed you raymond, i was just out in dahlgren last month...
 
 i'm the virtual reality market manager for silicon graphics, so perhaps i
 can help a little.

 unfortunately, while sgi systems were used to create the special effects
 for both terminator 2 and lawnmower man, those are film-quality computer
 graphics, rendered in software and written to film a frame at a time.  each
 frame of computer animation for those films took hours to render on
 high-end parallel processing computer systems. thus, that level of graphics
 would be difficult, if not impossible, to acheive in real time (30 frames
 per second).

 it depends upon how serious you are and how advanced your application is.
 true immersive visualization (vr), requires the rendering of complex visual
 databases at anywhere from 20 to 60 newly rendered frames per second.  this
 is a similar requirement to that of traditional flight simulators for pilot
 training. if the frame rate is too low, the user notices the stepping of
 the frames as they move their head rapidly around the scene, so the motion
 of the graphics is not smooth and contiguous.  thus the graphics system
 must be powerful enough to sustain high frame rates while rendering complex
 data representations.
 
 additionally, the frame rate must be constant.  if the system renders 15
 frames per second at one point, then 60 frames per second the next (perhaps
 due to the scene in the new viewing direction being simpler than what was
 visible before), the user can get heavily distracted by the medium (the
 graphics computer) rather than focusing on the data. to maintain a constant
 frame rate, the system must be able to run in real-time.  unix in general
 does not support real-time operation, but silicon graphics has modified the
 unix kernel for its multi-processor systems to be able to support real-time
 operation, bypassing the usual unix process priority-management schemes. 
 uniprocessor systems running unix cannot fundamentally support real-time
 operation (not sun sparc10, not hp 700 series systems, not ibm rs-6000, not
 even sgi's uniprocessor systems like indigo or crimson). only our
 multiprocessor onyx and challenge systems support real-time operation due
 to their symmetric multi-processing (smp) shared-memory architecture.
 
 from a graphics perspective, rendering complex virtual environments
 requires advanced rendering techniques like texture mapping and real-time
 multi-sample anti-aliasing.  of all of the general purpose graphics systems
 on the market today, only crimson realityengine and onyx realityengine2
 systems fully support these capabilities. the anti-aliasing is particularly
 important, as the crawling jagged edges of aliased polygons is an
 unfortunate distraction when immersed in a virtual environment.

 you can use the general purpose graphics libraries listed above to develop
 vr applications, but that is starting at a pretty low level. there are
 off-the- shelf software packages available to get you going much faster,
 being targeted directly at the vr application developer. some of the most
 popular are (in no particular order):
 
 	- division inc.		    (redwood city, ca) - dvs
 	- sens8 inc.		    (sausalito, ca)    - worldtoolkit
 	- naval postgraduate school (monterey, ca)     - npsnet (free!)
 	- gemini technology corp    (irvine, ca)       - gvs simation series
 	- paradigm simulation inc.  (dallas, tx)       - visionworks, audioworks
 	- silicon graphics inc.	    (mountain view,ca) - iris performer
 
 there are some others, but not off the top of my head...

 there are too many to list here, but here is a smattering:
 
 	- fake space labs	    (menlo park,ca)    - boom
 	- virtual technologies inc. (stanford, ca)     - cyberglove
 	- digital image design	    (new york, ny)     - the cricket (3d input)
 	- kaiser electro optics	    (carlsbad, ca)     - sim eye helmet displays
 	- virtual research	    (sunnyvale, ca)    - flight helmet display
 	- virtual reality inc.	    (pleasantville,ny) - head mtd displays, s/w
 	- software systems	    (san jose, ca)     - 3d modeling software
 	- etc., etc., etc.

 read some of the vr books on the market:
 
 	- virtual reality - ken pimental and ken texiera (sp?)
 	- virtual mirage
 	- artificial reality - myron kreuger
 	- etc.
 
 or check out the newsgroup sci.virtual_worlds
 
 feel free to contact me for more info.
