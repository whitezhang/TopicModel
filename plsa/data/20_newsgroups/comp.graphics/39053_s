 i know this has been asked a million time, but..
 
 what was the ftp site carrying 30-40 .zips of full pov "source" files,
 including jack.zip and kettle.zip? i've once been there but
 unfortunately lost the address.
 i'm in a little hurry with it, so please e-mail me at
 jtheinon@kruuna.helsinki.fi. thanks..
