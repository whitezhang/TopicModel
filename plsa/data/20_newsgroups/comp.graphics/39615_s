 
 i was wondering if anyone knows of a graphics package for the pc that
 will do compositing of a series of pictures?
 
 what i mean by "compositing" is, say i have a live video clip
 (digitized) panning around a living room, and a computer-generated
 bird flying around the screen.  i want to combine these two series of
 pictures so that everywhere where the bird frames are black, i want
 the living room picture to show through.  yes, i realize i can do this
 with a genlock, and i do own a genlock, but i want to be able to do
 manual compositing also.  it's ok if i have to composite one frame at
 a time; i assumed i'd have to do that anyway.  but being able to
 composite a series of frames would be even better.
 
 i've looked around and i haven't found a pc package that will perform
 this.  help, please!
