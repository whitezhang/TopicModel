 don't mind if i do.
 as someone who would _love_ to see xv go to 24 bit, this
 would be plenty for me.
 
     a) xv can load a 24 bit image, and display it in all it's
 24 bit glory on 24 bit x displays.
     b) all other operations (crop, dither, smooth, etc.) are not
 supported on 24 bit images.
 
 how hard would this be?
