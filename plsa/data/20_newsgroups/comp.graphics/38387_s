 ok, i don't use cview anymore, but i saw that no one had explaind this
 "bug" in the thread, so here goes:
 
 it is not the fault of cview.  it is dos!  if you leave a file open on a
 floppy drive, then change the disk and do something which updates or closes
 that file, you have a good chance of getting part of the directory and fat
 from the other disk written to the new disk.  this has always been true,
 and has destroyed data under other programs, not just cview.
 
 the only thing cview can do to improve the situation is to try not to leave
 files open unless it's actively using them (ie, reading and decoding).
