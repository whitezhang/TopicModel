 having thought about this, why don't you project the 2 lines onto the 2d
 plane formed by the lines.  do an intersection calculation in the plane in
 2d, where you're guaranteed a unique solution (unless they're parallel which
 won't happen in this case), and then use parametric distance along the lines
 from the circle centres to determine the exact point of interest.  this
 bypasses the messy error propogation required to do the calculation in 3d.
 
 hope i haven't put my foot in it again!
