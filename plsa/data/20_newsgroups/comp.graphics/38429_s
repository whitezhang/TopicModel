 i've borrowed the 1992-93 version of this book from a friend...holy
 moley!  what a wealth of contacts.  five-hundred pages of information
 about electronic artists and organizations around the globe (many have
 email addresses).  an up to the minute database of this information is
 also available on minitel (the book's based in france...are there any
 internet=>minitel gates?).  the book is printed in french and english.
  
 to have you or your organization listed in idea, just send your
 information to:
  
 annick bureaud
 idea
 57, rue falguiere
 75015 paris
 france
  
 it's free to be listed in it, i'm not sure how widely distributed the
 book is or how much it costs.  i'm not affiliated with them in any way,
 i was just impressed by their collection of organizations and artists.
 i highly encourage all involved in electronic media (video, music,
 graphics, animation, etc.) to send in your entry and encourage them to
 make their database available on internet.
