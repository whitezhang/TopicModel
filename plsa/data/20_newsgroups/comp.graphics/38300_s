 i am looking for a program that is capable of displaying a graph
 with nodes and links and with the possibility to edit interactively
 the graph : add one node, change one link etc...
 
 actually, a very _simple_ x11 program would be ok; all i need is to
 put some "boxes" (i.e. the nodes ) on a pane and be able to
 manipulate them with the mouse (move, add or delete boxes).
 
 does anyone know if such program is available ?
 thanks for any help !!
