 
 does anyone know if the source is available to create fli
 or flc animations? i would ideally like dll's for windows
 but would settle for c source.  i've heard they might be 
 available on amiga forums somewhere.  the libraries
 currently distributed by autodesk, aawin, aaplay, do not
 have fli creation capability, only playback.
 
 any pointers would be appreciated, thanks!
