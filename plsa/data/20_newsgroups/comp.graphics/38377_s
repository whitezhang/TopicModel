 computer graphics resource listing : weekly posting [ part 1/3 ]
 ===================================================
 last change : 17 april 1993
 
 many faqs, including this listing, are available on the archive site
 pit-manager.mit.edu (alias rtfm.mit.edu) [18.172.1.27] in the directory
 pub/usenet/news.answers.  the name under which a faq is archived appears
 in the archive-name line at the top of the article.
 this faq is archived as graphics/resources-list/part[1-3]
 
 there's a mail server on that machine. you send a e-mail message to
 mail-server@pit-manager.mit.edu  containing the keyword "help" (without
 quotes!) in the message body.
 
 you can see in many other places for this listing. see the item:
 
 0. places to find the resource listing
 
 for more information.
 
 items changed:
 --------------
 
 re-arranged the subjects, in order to fir better in the 63k/article limit.
 i plan on changing headers soon, so be careful! only the "resource listing"
 keys are sure to remain in the subject: line!
 
 0. places to find the resource listing
 6.  3d graphics editors
    a. public domain, free and shareware systems
 9. plotting packages
 18. molecular visualization stuff
 
 [ i'm thinking of making this post bi-weekly. what do you think??? ]
 
 --------------
 
 lines which got changed, have the `#' character in front of them.
 added lines are prepended with a `+'
 removed lines are just removed. use 'diff' to locate these changes.

 ========================================================================
 
 this is mainly a guide for computer graphics software.
 i would suggest reading the comp. graphics faq for image analysis stuff.
 
 it's entitled:

 #this file is crossposted to comp.graphics, comp.answers and news.answers,
 so if you can't locate it in comp.graphics, you're advised to search in
 #comp.answers or news.answers
 (the latter groups usually are archived in your site. contact your sysadmin
 for more info).
 
 these 3 articles are posted to comp.graphics 3-4 times a month and are kept in
 many places (see below)
 
 --
 
 many faqs, including this one, are available on the archive site
 pit-manager.mit.edu (alias rtfm.mit.edu) [18.172.1.27] in the directory
 pub/usenet/news.answers.  the name under which a faq is archived appears
 in the archive-name line at the top of the article.
 this faq is archived as graphics/resources-list/part[1-3]
 
 there's a mail server on that machine. you send a e-mail message to
 mail-server@pit-manager.mit.edu  containing: help in the subject: field
 
 --
 
 the inria-graphlib mail server mirrors this posting (see under the
 subject 4: mail servers )
 
 --
 
 the resource listing is accesible through wais in the machine
 enuxva.eas.asu.edu (port 8000) under the name graphics-resources-list.
 it's got a digest-type line before every numbered item for purposes of
 indexing.

 yet another place to search for faqs in general is the switch
 (swiss academic and research network) system in switzerland:
 
 interactive:
   telnet nic.switch.ch [130.59.1.40], login as "info". move to the
   info_service/usenet/periodic-postings directory. search in the
   00index file by typing "/" and the word to look for.
   you may then just read the faq in the "faqs" directory, or decide
   to fetch it by one of the following methods.
 
 ftp:
   login to nic.switch.ch [130.59.1.40] as user anonymous and
   enter your internet-style address after being prompted for a
   password.

 enter 'help' in the bodypart to receive instructions. no information
 is required in the subject header line.
 
 
 1. archie
 =========
 
 the archie is a service system to locate ftp places for
 requested files. it's appreciated that you will use archie
 before asking help in the newsgroups.
 
 archie servers:
   archie.au or 139.130.4.6             (aussie/nz)
   archie.funet.fi or 128.214.6.100  (finland/eur.)
   archie.th-darmstadt.de or 130.83.128.111  (ger.)
   cs.huji.ac.il or 132.65.6.5             (israel)
   archie.kuis.kyoto-u.ac.jp or 130.54.20.1 (japan)
   archie.sogang.ac.kr or 163.239.1.11      (korea)
   archie.ncu.edu.tw or telnet 140.115.19.24  (twn)
   archie.doc.ic.ac.uk or 146.169.3.7  (uk/ireland)
   archie.sura.net or 128.167.254.179    (usa [md])
   archie.unl.edu (password: archie1)    (usa [ne])
   archie.ans.net or 147.225.1.2         (usa [ny])
   archie.rutgers.edu or 128.6.18.15     (usa [nj])
   archie.nz or 130.195.9.4           (new zealand)
 
 connect to archie server with telnet and type "archie" as username.
 to get help type 'help'.
 you can get 'xarchie' or 'archie', which are clients that call archie
 without the burden of a telnet session.
 'xarchie' is on the x11.r5 contrib tape, and 'archie' on comp.sources.misc,
 vol. 27.
 
 to get information on how to use archie via e-mail, send mail with
 subject "help" to "archie" account at any of above sites.
 
 (note to janet/pss users -- the united kingdom archie site is
 accessible on the janet host doc.ic.ac.uk [000005102000].
 connect to it and specify "archie" as the host name and "archie" as
 the username.)
 
 ==========================================================================
 
 2. notes
 ========
 (excerpted from the faq article)
 
 please do *not* post or mail messages saying "i can't ftp, could
 someone mail this to me?"  there are a number of automated mail servers
 that will send you things like this in response to a message.
 
 there are a number of sites that archive the usenet sources newsgroups
 and make them available via an email query system.  you send a message
 to an automated server saying something like "send comp.sources.unix/fbm",
 and a few hours or days later you get the file in the mail.

 4. mail servers and graphics-oriented bbses
 ===========================================
 
 please check first with the ftp places above, with archie's help.
 don't overuse mail servers.
 
 there are some troubles with wrong return addresses. many of these
 mail servers have a command like
    path a_valid_return_e-mail_address
 to get a hint for sending back to you stuff.
 
 dec's ftpmail
 -------------
   send a one-line message to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com without a subject: field,
   and having a line containing the word 'help'.
   you should get back a message detailing the relevant procedures you
   must follow in order to get the files you want.
 
   note that the "reply" or "answer" command in your mailer will not work
   for this message or any other mail you receive from ftpmail.  to send
   requests to ftpmail, send an original mail message, not a reply.
   complaints should be sent to the ftpmail-request@uucp-gw-2.pa.dec.com
   address rather than to postmaster, since decwrl's postmaster is not
   responsible for fixing ftpmail problems.
 
 bitftp
 ------
   for bitnet sites only, there's bitftp@pucc.
   send a one-line 'help' message to this address for more info.
 
 lightwave 3d mail based file-server
 -----------------------------------
   a mail based file server for 3d objects, 24bit jpeg images, gif images
   and image maps is now online for all those with internet mail access.
   the server is the official archive site for the lightwave 3d mail-list
   and contains many pd and shareware graphics utilities for
   several computer platforms including amiga, atari, ibm and macintosh.
 
   the server resides on a bbs called "the graphics bbs".  the bbs is
   operational 24 hours a day 7 days a week at the phone number of +1
   908/469-0049.  it has upgraded its modem to a hayes ultra 144
   v.32bis/v.42bis, which has speeds from 300bps up to 38,400bps.
 
   if you would like to submit objects, scenes or images to the server,
   please pack, uuencode and then mail the files to the address:
   server@bobsbox.rent.com.
 
   for information on obtaining files from the server send a mail message
   to the address file-server@graphics.rent.com with the following in
   the body of the message:
     help
     /dir
   and a help file describing how to use the server and a complete
   directory listing will be sent to you via mail.
 
 [ now it includes the cyberware head and shouders in ttddd format! check it
  out, only if you can't use ftp! -- nfotis ]
 
 inria-graphlib
 --------------
   pierre jancene and sabine coquillart launched the inria-graphlib mail
   server a few months ago.
 
     echo help | mail inria-graphlib@inria.fr
 
   will give you a quick summary of what inria-graphlib contains and 
   how to browse among its files.
 
     echo send contents | mail inria-graphlib@inria.fr
 
   will return the extended summary.
 
   as an other example :
 
     echo send cgrl from misc | mail inria-graphlib@inria.fr
 
   will return the computer graphics resource listing mirrored from
   comp.graphics.
 
 bbses
 -----
   there are many bbses that store datafiles, etc.etc., but a guide to these
   is beyond the scope of this listing (and the resources of the author!)
   if you can point to me internet- or mail- accessible bbses that carry
   interesting stuff, send me info!

   the bbs, aside from carrying typical bbs services like message bases
   ( all topic specific ) and files ( cad and graphics related -- hundreds
   of megabytes ), also offers material texture files that are full color,
   seamlessly tiling, photo-realistic images.  there are samples available
   to first time callers.  the bbs is a subscription system although callers
   have 2 hours before they must subscribe, and there are several subscription
   rates available.   people interested in materials can subscribe to the
   library in addition to a basic subscription rate, and can use their
   purchased time to download whichever materials they wish.

 7. scene description languages
 ==============================
 
 nff
 ---
   neutral file format , by eric haines. very simple, there are some
   procedural database generators in the spd package, and many objects
   floating in various ftp sites. there's also a previewer written in
   hp starbase from e.haines. also there's one written in vogle, so you can
   use any of the devices vogle can output on.
   (check in sites carrying vogle, like gondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au)
 
 off
 ---
   object file format, from dec's randy rost (rost@kpc.com).
 [ the object archive server seems to be mothballed. in a future version,
  i'll remove the ref. to it -- nfotis ]
 
   available also through their mail server. to obtain help about using this
   service, send a message with a "subject:" line containing only the word
   "help" and a null message body to: object-archive-server@decwrl.dec.com.
   [for ftp places to get it, see in the relevant place]. there's an off
   previewer for sgi 4d machines, called off-preview in
   godzilla.cgl.rmit.oz.au . there are previewers for xview and sunview,
   also on gondwana.
 
 tddd
 ----
 it's a library of 3d objects with translators to/from off, nff,
 rayshade, imagine or vort objects.
 edited copy of the announcement follows (from raytracing news, v4,#3):
 
   new library of 3d objects available via ftp, by steve worley
   (worley@cup.portal.com)
 
   i have assembled a set of over 150 3d objects in a binary format
   called tddd. these objects range from human figures to airplanes,
   from semi-trucks to lampposts.  these objects are all freely
   distributable, and most have readmes that describe them.
 
   in order to convert these objects to a human-readable format, a file
   with the specification of tddd is included in the directory with the
   objects. there is also a shareware system called ttdddlib (officially
   on hubcap.clemson.edu) that will convert (ala pbm+) to/from various
   object formats : imagine ttddd (extension of tddd?), off, nff,
   rayshade 4.0, or vort. source included for amiga/unix as executables
   for the amiga. also outputs framemaker mif files and isometric views
   in postscript.
 
 p3d
 ---
   from pittsburgh supercomputing center. the p3d uses lisp with slight
   extensions to store three-dimensional models. a simple lisp
   interpreter is included with the p3d release, so there is no need to
   have access to any vendor's lisp to run this software.
 
   the mouse-driven user interfaces for motif, open look, and silicon
   graphics gl, and the drawp3d subroutine library for generating p3d
   without ever looking at the underlying lisp.
 
   the p3d software currently supports nine renderers.  they are:
   painter - painter's algorithm, dore, silicon graphics inc. gl language,
   generic phigs, sun phigs+, dec phigs+, rayshade, art ray tracer (from
   vort package) and pixar renderman.
 
   the code is available via anonymous ftp from the machines
   ftp.psc.edu, directory pub/p3d, and nic.funet.fi, directory
   pub/graphics/programs/p3d.
 
 renderman
 ---------
   pixar's renderman is not free - call pixar for details.

 8. solids description formats
 =============================
 
 a. eec's esprit project 322 cad*i (cad interfaces) has developed a
   neutral file format for transfer of cad data (curves, surfaces, and
   solid models between cad systems and from cad to caa (computer aided
   analysis) an cam (computer aided manufacturing)
 
 b. iges [v. 5.1 now] tries to define a standard to tranfer solid
   models - brep and csg. the current standard number is ansi y14.26m-1987
   for documentation, you might want to contact nancy flower at
   ncga technical services and standards, 1-800-225-6242 ext. 325
   and the cost is $100.
   this standard is not available in electronic format.
 
 c. pdes/step : this slowly emerging standard tries to encompass not only
   the geometrical information, but also for things like fem, etc.
   the main bodies besides this standard are nist and darpa. you can get
   more information about pdes by sending mail to nptserver@cme.nist.gov
   and putting the line
 	send index
   in the body (not the subject:) area of the message.
 
   the people at rutherford appleton lab.  are also working
   on step tools: they have an express compiler and an exchange file parser,
   both available in source form (and for free) for research purposes.
   soon they will also have an express-based database system.
 
   for the tools contact mike mead, phone: +44 (0235) 44 6710 (fax: x 5893),
   e-mail: mm@inf.rl.ac.uk or {...!}mcsun!uknet!rlinf!mm or
