 amen.. i too have learned by example, specifically yours. :)

 .. but dorsai leads the way.. unlike other services that are commercial
 in nature, dorsai is a community based service. while others charge
 monthly fees for access, dorsai accepts donations from those who can
 afford to contribute.
 
    while other systems don't respond to user input, dorsai thrives on it.
 other systems sell hardware for a profit, dorsai donates hardware to
 community service groups, and to individuals who couldn't afford to
 normally.
 
    dorsai lives due to the "hacker" ethic of charles, jack, skip, cara,
 ira, mark, david etc etc etc..  sleepless nights and days working on
 equipment thats been assembled at the embassy, ( and modifying what
 ever else available to work the first time..) in order to keep the
 slip line up...
 
    heres to you bud... i'm one of the few that decided to
 stay, and am damn glad that i did..... :)
