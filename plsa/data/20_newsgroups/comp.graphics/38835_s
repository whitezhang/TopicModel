 
 	anyone who thinks that tiff is too complex hasn't dealt with
 	cgm, asn.1, cda, dca, sgml, or any one of a number of other
 	very successful file format.  people seem perfectly capable
 	dealing with these others.  dealing with the format of tiff
 	is frankly less difficult than dealing with the dct, lzw, and
 	fax encoding of the image data.  the majority of the libraries
 	which deal with tiff are dedicated to these other issues rather
 	than with simply decoding the tags and parameters.
 
 	perhaps people are overwhelmed in comparison with some rather
 	simpleminded formats such as gif, pcx, and bmp, but to suggest
 	that tiff is so complex as to be doomed to failure is ludicrous.
 
 	that doesn't mean that gif isn't fine, but don't even thing about
 	using it in many instances.  gif is very nice for use in low-end
 	photos applications and for screen grabs and such, but it would
 	never do for high-volume or high-resolution systems.  fax is nice,
 	but it doesn't do color (and gif doesn't do b&w all that well).
 	jpeg is nice for high-resolution color, but is slow for low-end.
 
 	the advantage tiff brings to the table is its ability to handle
 	all these situations (and then some).  naturally it's more complex.
 	but i'ld rather propose tiff imaging solutions over imaging
 	systems based on having to deal with 3-4 file formats anyday.
 
 	you may find that tiff is too complicated for your personal tastes
 	but please don't wrail against it's complexity.  the complexity
 	it contains is required to provide the functionality it does and
 	doesn't come close to the complexity found in most commercially
 	viable file formats.
 
 
 	if we're in philosophical arguments against complexity, let's all
 	go program in scheme and forth and do imaging with run length
 	encoding.
