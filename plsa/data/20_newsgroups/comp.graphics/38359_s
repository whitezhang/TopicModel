 what are the main advantages of this method?  i have seen it described, and
 the algiorithm seems a  little bit long.  i developed my own method, which
 requires that the points be in a counter-clockwise order, and returns
 whether you are looking at the back or the front, similar to the plane eqn
 method.  it uses few calculations however, basically it is several
 comparisons.  the only disadvantage i see is that it must be done after the
 transformation from view coordinates to coordinates to display on the
 screen, which means that a little more calculation isneeded beforehand.  my
 method basically figures out whether the points that will appear on the
 screen are clockwise or counterclockwise.  when looking at the back of
 something, the points occur in an opposite direction from the front, so
 merely by figuring out which way the points go, you can tell whether you are
 looking at the back or front of a 2d polygon.  has anyone heard of this
 method before?  it is so simple, i doubt i am the first to think of it.
