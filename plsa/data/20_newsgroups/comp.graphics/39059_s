 this is a heavily edited/modified version of the gopher faq intended to
 give people just starting with gopher enough information to get a
 client and jump into gopher-space - a complete version can be obtained
 as described below.  once you have a gopher client point it at 
 merlot.welch.jhu.edu and welcome to gopher-space!

 common questions and answers about the internet gopher, a
 client/server protocol for making a world wide information service,
 with many implementations.  posted to comp.infosystems.gopher, 
 comp.answers, and news.answers every two weeks.
 
 the most recent version of this faq can be gotten through gopher, or
 via anonymous ftp:
 
 rtfm.mit.edu:/pub/usenet/news.answers/gopher-faq
 
 those without ftp access should send e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu
 with "send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources" in the body to find out
 how to do ftp by e-mail.
 
 ------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 list of questions in the gopher faq:
 
 q0:  what is gopher?
 q1:  where can i get gopher software?
 q2:  what do i need to access gopher?
 q3:  where are there publicly available logins for gopher?

 q7: what is veronica?
 q8: what is available for biology?
 -------------------------------------------------------------------
 q0:  what is gopher?
 
 a0:  the internet gopher client/server provides a distributed
      information delivery system around which a world/campus-wide
      information system (cwis) can readily be constructed.   while
      providing a delivery vehicle for local information,  gopher
      facilitates access to other gopher and information servers
      throughout the world. 
 
 -------------------------------------------------------------------
 q1:  where can i get gopher software?
 
 a1:  via anonymous ftp to boombox.micro.umn.edu.  look in the directory
      /pub/gopher
 
 --------------------------------------------------------------------
 q2:  what do i need to access gopher?
 
 a2:  you will need a gopher "client" program that runs on your local pc
      or workstation
 
      there are clients for the following systems.  the directory
      following the name is the location of the client on the anonymous
      ftp site boombox.micro.umn.edu (134.84.132.2) in the directory
      /pub/gopher.
 
       unix curses & emacs   :  /pub/gopher/unix/gopher1.12.tar.z
       xwindows (athena)     :  /pub/gopher/unix/xgopher1.2.tar.z
       xwindows (motif)      :  /pub/gopher/unix/moog
       xwindows (xview)      :  /pub/gopher/unix/xvgopher
       macintosh hypercard   :  /pub/gopher/macintosh-turbogopher/old-versions *
       macintosh application :  /pub/gopher/macintosh-turbogopher *
       dos w/clarkson driver :  /pub/gopher/pc_client/
       nextstep              :  /pub/gopher/next/
       vm/cms                :  /pub/gopher/rice_cms/ or /pub/gopher/viegopher/
       vms                   :  /pub/gopher/vms/
       os/2 2.0	            :  /pub/gopher/os2/
       mvs/xa                :  /pub/gopher/mvs/
 
      many other clients and servers have been developed by others, the
      following is an attempt at a comprehensive list.  
 
       a microsoft windows winsock client "the gopher book"
         sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/micro/pc-stuff/ms-windows/winsock/goph_tbk.zip
 
       a macintosh application, "macgopher".
         ftp.cc.utah.edu:/pub/gopher/macintosh *
 
       another macintosh application, "gopherapp".
         ftp.bio.indiana.edu:/util/gopher/gopherapp *
 
       a port of the unix curses client for dos with pc/tcp
         oac.hsc.uth.tmc.edu:/public/dos/misc/dosgopher.exe
 
       a port of the unix curses client for pc-nfs
      	 bcm.tmc.edu:/nfs/gopher.exe
 
       a beta version of the pc gopher client for novell's lan workplace
       for dos
          lennon.itn.med.umich.edu:/dos/gopher
 
       a vms decwindows client for use with wollongong or ucx
          job.acs.ohio-state.edu:xgopher_client.share
 
 
      * note: these macintosh clients require mactcp.
 
      most of the above clients can also be fetched via a gopher client
      itself.  put the following on a gopher server:
 
        type=1
        host=boombox.micro.umn.edu
        port=70
        path=
        name=gopher software distribution.
 
  
      or point your gopher client at boombox.micro.umn.edu, port 70 and
      look in the gopher directory.
 
 
      there are also a number of public telnet login sites available.
      the university of minnesota operates one on the machine
      "consultant.micro.umn.edu" (134.84.132.4) see q3 for more
      information about this.  it is recommended that you run the client
      software instead of logging into the public telnet login sites.  a
      client uses the custom features of the local machine (mouse,
      scroll bars, etc.)  a local client is also faster.
 
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 q3:  where are there publicly available logins (ie places to telnet to
      in order to get a taste of gopher) for gopher?
 
 a3:  here is a short list, use the site closest to you to minimize
      network lag.
 
      telnet public logins:
 
      hostname                  ip#              login   area
      ------------------------- ---------------  ------  -------------
      consultant.micro.umn.edu  134.84.132.4	gopher  north america
      gopher.uiuc.edu           128.174.33.160   gopher  north america
      panda.uiowa.edu           128.255.40.201	panda   north america
      gopher.sunet.se           192.36.125.2     gopher  europe
      info.anu.edu.au           150.203.84.20    info    australia
      gopher.chalmers.se        129.16.221.40    gopher  sweden
      tolten.puc.cl             146.155.1.16     gopher  south america
      ecnet.ec		           157.100.45.2     gopher  ecuador
      gan.ncc.go.jp             160.190.10.1     gopher  japan
 
 
      it is recommended that you run the client software instead of
      logging into the public login sites.  a client uses the
      custom features of the local machine (mouse, scroll bars, etc.)
      and gives faster response.  furthermore many of the basic features
      of clients - saving a file to your hard drive, printing a file
      to a local printer, viewing images, retrieving files from ftp
      sites etc.... are not available by the telnet logins.
 
 
 
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 q4:  who develops gopher software?
 
 a4:  gopher was originally developed in april 1991 by the university
      of minnesota microcomputer, workstation, networks center to help
      our campus find answers to their computer questions.  
 
      it has since grown into a full-fledged world wide information
      system used by a large number of sites in the world.
 
      many people have contributed to the project, too numerous to
      count. 
 
      the people behind the much of the gopher software can be reached
      via e-mail at gopher@boombox.micro.umn.edu, or via paper mail:
    
       internet gopher developers
       100 union st. se #190
       minneapolis, mn 55455  usa
 
      or via fax at:
  
       +1 (612) 625-6817
 
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 q5: what is the relationship between gopher and (wais, www, ftp)?
 
 a5: gopher is intimately intertwined with these two other systems.
      as shipped the unix gopher server has the capability to: 
      
        - search local wais indices.
        - query remote wais servers and funnel the results to gopher
          clients.
        - query remote ftp sites and funnel the results to gopher
          clients.
        - be queried by www (world wide web) clients (either using
          built in gopher querying or using native http querying.
 
 -------------------------------------------------------------------
 q6: are papers or articles describing gopher available?
 
 a6: gopher has a whole chapter devoted to it in :
 
      _the_whole_internet_, ed kroll, o'reilly, 1992 (editors note:

 -------------------------------------------------------------------
 q7: what is veronica?
 
 a7: veronica:  very easy rodent-oriented net-wide index to 
      computerized archives.
 
      veronica offers a keyword search of most gopher-server menu titles
      in the entire gopher web.  as archie is to ftp archives, veronica 
      is to gopherspace.  a veronica search produces a menu of gopher
      items, each of which is a direct pointer to a gopher data source.
      because veronica is accessed through a gopher client, it is easy
      to use, and gives access to all types of data supported by the
      gopher protocol.
 
      to try veronica, select it from the "other gophers" menu on 
      minnesota's gopher server, or point your gopher at:
 
      name=veronica (search menu items in most of gopherspace) 
      type=1 
      port=70 
      path=1/veronica 
      host=futique.scs.unr.edu
 
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
