 it's really not that hard to do.  there are books out there which explain
 everything, and the basic 3d functions, translation, rotation, shading, and
 hidden line removal are pretty easy.  i wrote a program in a few weeks witht
 he help of a book, and would be happy to give you my source.
 	also, quickdraw has a lot of 3d functions built in, and think pascal
 can access them, and i would expect that think c could as well.  if you can
 find out how to use the quickdraw graphics library, it would be an excellent
 choice, since it has a lot of stuff, and is built into the mac, so should be
 fast.
