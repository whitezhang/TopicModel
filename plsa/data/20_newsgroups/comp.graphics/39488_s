 i need help in creating my 4x4 perspective matrix.  i'd like to use this for
 transforming x, y, z, w in some texture mapping code i got from graphics gems
 i.  i have many books which talk about this, but none of them in simple plain
 english.  if you have graphics gems i, i'm talking about page 678.
 
 i'd like to have a perspective matrix that handles different field-of-views
 and aspect of course.  thank's for your help.

 yes, of course everything i say is my personal opinion!
