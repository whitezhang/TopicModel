 this seems to be a simple problem but i just cannot solve it.
 i wrote a c program to draw some polygons on the screen, and i want to 
 print it on my printer. so, i press "print-screen" on the keyboard.
 the problem is the printer just print out some ascii characters.
 is there any other way to print the screen without using "print-screen"????
 please help!
