 i agree with you about the upgrade path; but i think i was fair.
 
 the original posting complained (1) about sgi coming out with newer (and
 better) architectures and not having an upgrade path from the older ones,
 and (2) that dec did.
 
 on statement (1), i merely attempted to point out that all computer
 companies are constantly attempting to improve their product (& market
 position/share).  in so doing, they eventually come to a point where they
 have a new architecture, and the only upgrade path is to replace the
 system.  and the particular system he was complaining about was (in
 computer lifetimes) relatively old.
 
 on statement (2), i felt dec's history of providing upgrades was not far
 superior than the industry "average", and that, in my opinion, sgi's
 history is better than dec's.
 
 (and what is dec doing with it's mips based decstation line?  are they
 going to "abandon" it for their alpha based line, or provide an upgrade
 path to r4400's and tfp's and r5's?)
