 first, thanks to all who replied to my original question.
 
 i've implemented the ideas from the article above and i'm very satisfied
 with the results. i needed it for my bezier curve approximation routine.
 in some cases (generating offset curves) loops can occur. i now have a
 fast method of detecting the generation of a curve with a loop. although
 i did not follow the article above strictly. the check if the fourth control
 point lies in the the loop area, which is bounded by two parabolas and
 one ellips is too complicated. instead i enlarged the loop-area and
 surrounded it by for straight lines. the check is now simple and fast and
 my approximation routine never ever outputs self-intersecting bezier curves
 again!
