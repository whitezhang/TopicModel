 has anyone seen hallusions?  you can buy a poster of them and it looks like a simple dot pattern
 when you first look at it but if you focus behind it you see a 3d picture.  i'm looking for
 a program that generates these pictures.  there's a company in texas that makes them but i 
 doubt if they're giving the program away.  any help would be appreciated.
