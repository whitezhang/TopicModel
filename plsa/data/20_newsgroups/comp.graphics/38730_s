 i can't fiqure this out.  i have properly compiled pov on a unix machine
 running sunos 4.1.3  the problem is that when i run the sample .pov files and
 use the exact same parameters when compiling different .tga outputs.  some
 of the .tga's are okay, and other's are unrecognizable by any software.
 
 help!
