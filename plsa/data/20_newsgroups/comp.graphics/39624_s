 
   in an attempt to do animation with pov i have created two little
 programs. one is a c program that will perform a "morph" between
 any two points given the amount of frames for the morph. and then
 it will write the points, and the function (translate, rotate, etc.) out
 to a file. then i have a perl script that will read the list of functions
 and insert them into a .pov file at a given line. i had hoped this would
 let me do simple animation. however, i have discovered that simply
 performing incremental rotations on an object will not spin a stationary
 object but will actually rotate the object about the axis. now i know
 an easy way around this would be to first translate the object to the
 origin perform the rotation and then move it back but i know there 
 must be another way around this. i had thought perhaps it was because
 i had created objects at the origin and then translated them to a new
 point and then done the rotation, which could cause this behavior. however
 this occurs on objects that are not translated at all. any help is 
 appreciated.
