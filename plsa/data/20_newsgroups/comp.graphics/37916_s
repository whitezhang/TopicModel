         i recently got a file describing a library of rendering routines 
 called sipp (simple polygon processor).  could anyone tell me where i can 
 ftp the source code and which is the newest version around?
         also, i've never used renderman so i was wondering if renderman 
 is like sipp?  ie. a library of rendering routines which one uses to make 
 a program that creates the image...
 
                                         thanks,  joe tham
