 why would it have to be much faster (it probably is) ? assuming an arm
 is about as efficient as a mips r3000 for integer calculations, doing
 a compact-video-like digital video codec is an easy task. for software
 motion pictures (which is a lot like compact video, though it predates
 it), we get 48 frames/sec. at 320x240 on a decstation 5000/200. that
 machine has a 25 mhz mips r3000.
