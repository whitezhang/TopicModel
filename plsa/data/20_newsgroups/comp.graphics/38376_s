   for all 50 states. price is about $28, call to or visit in offices
   in menlo park, in reston, virginia (800-usa-maps).
 
   the data user services division of the bureau of the census also has
   data on cd-rom (tso standard format) that is derived from usgs
   1:100,000 map data. call (301) 763-4100 for more info or they have
   a bbs at (301) 763-1568.
 
 [ from dr.dobbs #198 march 1993: ]
 
       "the u.s. defense mapping agency, in cooperation with their counterpart
 agencies in canada, the u.k., and australia, have released the digital chart
 of the world (dcw). this chart consists of over 1.5 gigabytes of reasonable
 quality vector data distributed on four cd-roms. .... includes coastlines,
 rivers, roads, railrays, airports,cities, towns, spot elevations, and depths,
 and over 100,000 place names."
 
 it is iso9660 compatible and only $200.00 available from:

 fractal landscape generators
 ----------------------------
 
 public domain:
 
   many people have written fractal landscape generators. for example
   for the mac some of these generators were written by
   pdbourke@ccu1.aukuni.ac.nz (paul d. bourke).
   many of the programs are available from the ftp sites and mail
   archive servers. check with archie.
 
 commercial:
 
   vista pro 3.0 for the amiga from virtual reality labs -- list price
   is about $100. their address is:
 	vrl
 	2341 ganador court
 	san luis obispo,
 	ca 93401
 	telephone or fax (805) 545-8515
 
   scenery animator (also for the amiga) is of the same caliber with vista pro 2.
   check with:
 	natural graphics
 	p.o. box 1963
 	raklin, ca 95677
 	phone (916) 624-1436
 
   don't forget to ask about companion programs and data disks/tapes.
 
   vista pro 3 has been ported to the pcs.
 
 
 cia world map ii
 ----------------
 [  note: this database is quite out of date, and not topologically structured.
   if you need a standard for world cartographic data, wait for the
   digital chart of the world. this 1:1m database has been produced from
   the defense mapping agency's oncs and will be available, together with
   searching and viewing software, on a number of cd-roms later this summer. ]
 
   check into hanauma.stanford.edu and ucsd.edu (see ftp list above)
   the cia database consists of coastlines, rivers and political boundaries
   in the form of line strokes. also on hanauma.stanford.edu is a 720x360
   array of elevation data, containing one ieee floating point number for
   every half degree longitude and latitude.
  
   a program for decoding the database, mfil, can be found on the machine
   pi1.arc.umn.edu (137.66.130.11).
   there's another program, which reads a compressed cia data bank file and
   builds a phigs hierachical structure. it uses a phigs extension known as
   polyline sets for performance, but you can use regular polylines. ask
   joe stewart <joes@lpi.liant.com>.
   the raw data at stanford require the vplot package to be able to view it.
   (was posted in comp.sources.unix). to be more exact, you'll have to
   compile just the libvplot routines, not the whole package.
 
 ncar data
 ---------
   ncar (national center for atmospheric research) has many types of
   terrain  data, ranging from elevation datasets at
   various resolutions, to information about soil types, vegetation, etc.
   this data is not free -- they charge from $40 to $90 or more, depending
   on the data volume and media (exabyte tape, 3480 cartridge, 9-track tape,
   ibm pc floppy, and ftp transfer are all available).  their data archive
   is mostly research oriented, not hobbyist oriented.  for more information,
   email to ilana@ncar.ucar.edu.
 
 unc data tapes with voxel data
 --------------
   there are 2 "public domain" tapes with data for the comparison and
   testing of various volume rendering algorithms (mainly mri and ct
   scans). these tapes are distributed by the softlab of unc @ chapel hill.
   (softlab@cs.unc.edu)
 
   the data sets (volume i and ii) are also available via anonymous ftp from
   omicron.cs.unc.edu [128.109.136.159] in pub/softlab/chvrtd
 
 nasa
 ----
   many us agencies such as nasa publish cd-roms with many altimetry data
   from various space missions, eg. viking for mars, magellan for venus,
   etc. especially for nasa, i would suggest to call the following
   address for more info:
 
      national space science date center
      goddard space flight center
      greenbelt, maryland 20771
      telephone: (301) 286-6695
      email address:  request@nssdca.gsfc.nasa.gov
 
   the data catalog (*not* the data itself) is available online.
   internet users can telnet to nssdca.gsfc.nasa.gov (128.183.10.4) and log
   in as 'nodis' (no password).
 
   you can also dial in at (301)-286-9000 (300, 1200, or 2400 baud, 8 bits,
   no parity, one stop). at the "enter number:" prompt, enter md and
   carriage return. when the system responds "call complete," enter a few
   more carriage returns to get the "username:" and log in as 'nodis' (no
   password).
 
   nssdca is also an anonymous ftp site, but no comprehensive list of
   what's there is available at present.
 
 earth sciences data
 -------------------
 
   there's a listing of anonymous ftp sites for earth science data, including
   imagery. this listing is called "earth sciences resources on internet",
   and you can get it via anonymous ftp from csn.org [128.138.213.21]
   in the directory cogs under the name "internet.resources.earth.sci"
 
   some sites include:
   aurelie.soest.hawaii.edu [128.171.151.121]: pub/avhrr/images - avhrr images
   ames.arc.nasa.gov [128.102.18.3]: pub/space/cdrom  - images from
         magellan and viking missions etc.
         pub/space/index contains a listing of files available in the whole
         archive (the index is about 200k by itself). there's also an
         e-mail server for the people without internet access: send a letter
         to archive-server@ames.arc.nasa.gov (or ames!archive-server). in the
         subject of your letter (or in the body), use commands like:
 
         send space index
         send space shuttle/ss01.23.91
 
         (capitalization is important! only text files are handled by the
         email server at present)
 
   vab02.larc.nasa.gov [128.155.23.47]: pub/gifs/misc/landsat -
 	landsat photos in gif and jpeg format
 [ it was shut down - nfotis; anyone has a copy of this archive?? ]

 12. 3d scanners - digitized 3d data
 ===================================
 
 a. cyberware labs, monterey, ca, manufactures a 3d color laser digitizer
   which can be used to model parts of, or a complete, human body.
   they run a service bureau also, so they can digitize models for you.
 
   address:
     cyberware labs, inc

     monterey, ca 93940
   phone: (408)373-1441, fax: (408)373-3582
 
 b. polhemus makes a 6d input device (actually a couple of models)
   that senses position (3d) and *orientation* (+3d) based on electromagnetic
   field interference.  this equipment is also incorporated in the
   vpl dataglove.
   this hardware is also called isotrack, from keiser aerospace.
 
 ascension technology makes a similar 3d input device.
 there is a company, applied sciences(?), that makes a 3d input
 device (position only) based on speed of sound triangulation.
 
 c. a company that specializes in digitizing is viewpoint. you can ask
    for viewpoint's _free_ 100 page catalog full of ready to 
    ship datasets from categories such as cars, anatomy, aircraft,sports,
    boats, trains, animals and others. though these objects are
    quite expensive, the cataloge is nevertheless of interest for it
    has pictures of all the available objects in wireframe , polygon mesh.

 13. background imagery/textures/datafiles
 =========================================
 
  first, check in the ftp places that are mentioned in the faq or in the ftp
 list above.
 
 24-bit scanning:
 ----------------
   get a good 24-bit scanner, like epson's. suggested is an scsi port for
   speed. eric haines had a suggestion in rt news, volume 4, #3 :
   scan textures for wallpapers and floor coverings, etc. from doll
   house supplies.
   so you have a rather cheap way to scan patterns that don't have
   scaling troubles associated with real materials and scanning area.
 
 books with textures:
 --------------------
   find some houses/books/magazines that carry photographic material.
   educorp, 1-619-536-9999, sells cd-roms with various imagery - also
   a wide variety of stock art is available.
   stock art from big-name stock art houses, such as comstock,
   uniphoto, and metro image base, is available.
 
   in italy, there's a company called belvedere that makes such books
   for the purpose of clipping their pages for inclusion in your
   graphics work. their address is:
 	edition belvedere co. ltd.,
 	00196 rome italy,
 	piazzale flaminio, 19
 	tel. (06) 360-44-88, fax (06)  360-29-60
 
 texture libraries:
 ------------------
 a. mannikin sceptre graphics announced textiles, a set of 256x256 24-bit
    textures. initial shipments in 24-bit iff (for amigas), soon in 24-bit
    tiff format. algorithmically built for tiled surfaces. srp is $40 / volume
    (each volume = 40 images @ 10 disks). demo disks for $5 are available.
 
    contact:
    mannikin sceptre graphics
    1600 indiana ave.
    winter park, fl 32789
    phone: (407) 384-9484
    fax: (407) 647-7242
 
 b. essence is a library of 65 (sixty-five) new algoritmic textures for imagine
    by impulse, inc. these textures are fully compatible with the floating point
    versions of imagine 2.0, imagine 1.1, and even turbo silver.
    written by steve worley.

 [ what about texture city ?? ]
 
 ==========================================================================
 
 14. introduction to rendering algorithms
 ========================================
 
 a. ray-tracing:
 ---------------
 
   i assume you have a general understanding of computer graphics. no? then read
   some of the books that the faq contains. for ray-tracing, i would
   suggest:
    an introduction to ray tracing, andrew glassner (ed.), academic press
      1989, isbn 0-12-286160-4
   note that i have not read the book, but i feel that you can't be wrong
   using his book. an errata list was posted in comp.graphics by eric haines
   (erich@eye.com)
 
 there's a more concise reference also:
 
   roman kuchkuda , unc @ chapel hill: "an introduction to ray tracing", in
   "theoretical foundations for computer graphics and cad", ed. r.a.e.earnshaw,
   nato as, vol. f-40., pp. 1039-1060. printed by springer-verlag, 1988.
 
 it contains code for a small, but fundamentally complete ray-tracer.
 
 b. z-buffer (depth-buffer)
 --------------------------
 
 a good reference is:
 
         _procedural elements for computer graphics_, david f. rogers,
         mcgraw-hill, new york, 1985, pages 265-272 and 280-284.
 
 c. others:
 ----------
 ???
 [ more info is needed -- nfotis ]
 
 ========================================================================
 
 15. where can i find the geometric data for the:
 ================================================
 
 a. teapot ?
 -----------
 
 "displays on display" column of ieee cg&a jan '87 has the whole
 story about origin of the martin newell's teapot. the article also has
 the bezier patch model and a pascal program to display the wireframe
 model of the teapot.
 
 ieee cg&a sep '87 in jim blinn's column "jim blinn's corner" describes
 an another way to model the teapot; bezier curves with rotations for
 example are used.
 
 the off and spd packages have these objects, so you're advised to get
 them to avoid typing the data yourself.  the off data is triangles at
 a specific resolution (around 8x8[x4 triangles] meshing per patch).
 the spd package provides the spline patch descriptions and performs a
 tessellation at any specified resolution.
 
 b. space shuttle ?
 ------------------
 
 tolis lerios <tolis@nova.stanford.edu> has built a list of space shuttle
 datafiles. here's a summary (from his sci.space list):
 
 model1:
 a modified version of the newsgroup model (model2)
 
 406 vertices (296 useful, i.e. referred to in the polygon descriptions.)
 389 polygons (233 3-vertex, 146 4-vertex, 7 5-vertex, 3 6-vertex).
 payload doors non-existent.
 units: unknown.
 
 simon marshall (s.marshall@sequent.cc.hull.ac.uk) has a copy. he
 said there is no proprietary information associated with it.
 
 model2:
 the newsgroup model, in off format. you can find it in
 
 gondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au , file pub/off/objects/shuttle.geo
 hanauma.stanford.edu ,  /pub/graphics/comp.graphics/objects/shuttle.data
 
 model3:
 the triangles' model.
 
 this model is stored in several files, each defining portions of the model.
 
 greg henderson (henders@infonode.ingr.com) has a copy.  he did
 not mention any restriction on the model's distribution.
 
 model4:
 the nasa model.
 
 the file starts off with a header line containing three real numbers,
 defining the offsets used by lockheed in their simulations:
 
 <x offset> <y offset> <z offset>
 
 from then on, the file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions
 
 3473 vertices.
 2748 polygons (407 3-vertex, 2268 4-vertex, 33 5-vertex, 14 6-vertex,
  10 7-vertex, 8 8-vertex, 8 12-vertex, 2 13-vertex, 2 15-vertex,
  17 16-vertex, 2 17-vertex, 2 18-vertex, 3 19-vertex, 8 24-vertex).
 payload doors closed.
 units: inches.
 
 jon berndt (jon@l14h11.jsc.nasa.gov) seems to be responsible for the model
 proprietary info: unknown
 
 model5:
 the old shuttle model.
 
 the file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions.
 
 104 vertices.
 452 polygons (11 3-vertex, 41 4-vertex).
 payload doors open.
 units: meters.
 
 we have been using this model at star labs, stanford university, for
 some years now. contact me (tolis@nova.stanford.edu) or my supervisor
 scott williams (scott@star5.stanford.edu) if you want a copy.
 
 ========================================================================
 
 16. image annotation software
 =============================
 
 a. touchup runs in sunview and is pretty good.  it reads in
   rasterfiles, but even if your image isn't normally stored
   in rasterfile format you could use screendump to make it a
   rasterfile.
 
 b. idraw (part of stanford's interviews distribution) can handle some
   image formats in addition to being a macdraw like tool.  i'm not
   sure exactly what they are.
   you can ftp the idraw's binary from interviews.stanford.edu.
 
 c. tgif is another macdraw like tool that can handle x11 bitmap (xbm)
   and x11 pixmap (xpm) formats.  if the image you have is in formats
   other than xbm or xpm, you can get the pbmplus toolkit to convert
   things like gif or even some macintosh formats to xpm.
   tgif's sources are available in the pub directory on cs.ucla.edu
   (version 2.12 of tgif at patchlevel 7 plus patch8 and patch9)
 
 d. use the editimage facility of khoros (see below).
   this is just one utility in the overall system- you can essentially do all
   your image processing and macdraw-type graphics using this package.
 
 e. you might be able to get by with pbmplus.  pbmtext gives you text output
   bitmaps which can be overlaid on top of your image.
 
 f. 'ice' requires sun hardware running openwindows 3.it's a postscript-based
   graphical editor,and it's available for anonymous ftp from internet host
   eo.soest.hawaii.edu (128.171.151.12). requires sun c++ 2.0 and
   two other locally developed packages, the lxt library (an xlib-based
   toolkit) and a small c++ class library. all files (pub/ice.tar.z,
   pub/lxt.tar.z and pub/ldgoc++.tar.z) are available in compressed
   tar format. pub/ice.tar.z contains a readme that gives installation
   instructions, as well as an extensive man page (ice.1).
   a statically-linked compressed executable pub/ice-sun4.z for
   sparc systems is also available for ftp.
 
   all software is the property of columbia university and may not
   be redistributed without permission.
 
   ice means image composition environment and it's an imaging tool that
   allows raster images to be combined with a wide variety of
   postscript annotations in wysiwyg fashion via x11 imaging
   routines and news postscript rasterizing.
 
 g. use imagemagick to annotate an image from your x server.  pick the 
   position of your text with the cursor and choose your font and pen 
   color from a pull-down menu.  imagemagick can read and write many
   of the more popular image formats.  imagemagick is available as
   export.lcs.mit.edu: contrib/imagemagick.tar.z or at your nearest
   x11 archive.

 iris explorer
 -------------
   it's an application creation system developed by silicon
   graphics that provides visualisation and analysis functionality for
   computational scientists, engineers and other scientists. the explorer
   gui allows users to build custom applications without having to write
   any, or a minimal amount of, traditonal code. also, existing code can
   be easily integrated into the explorer environment. explorer currently
   is available now on sgi and cray machines, but will become available on
   other platforms in time. [ bundled with every new sgi machine, as far as
   i know]
 
   see comp.graphics.explorer or comp.sys.sgi for discussion of the package.
 
   there are also two ftp servers for related stuff, modules etc.:

 wit
 ---
   in a nutshell it's a package of the same genre as avs,explorer,etc.
   it seems more a image processing system than a generic scivi system (imho)
   major elements are:
 
   - a visual programming language, which automatically exploits the inherent
         parallelism
   - a code generator which converts the graph to a standalone program
 
   iconified libraries present a rich set of point, filter, io, transform,
   morphological, segmentation, and measurement operations.
   a flow library allows graphs to employ broadcast, merge,
   synchronization, conditional, and sequencing control strategies.
 
   wit delivers an object-oriented, distributed, visual programming
   environment which allows users to rapidly design solutions to their
   imaging problems. users can consolidate both software and hardware
   developments within a complete cad-like workspace by adding their
   own operators (c functions), objects (data structures), and servers
   (specialized hardware). wit runs on sun, hp9000/7xx, sgi and supports
   datacube mv-20/200 hardware allowing you to run your graphs in real-time.

 idl/sips
 --------
   "a lot of people are using idl with a package called sips. this was
   developed at the university of colorado (boulder) by some people working
   for alex goetz.  you might try contacting them if you already have idl
   or would be willing to buy it.  it's a few thousand dollars (american) i
   expect for idl and the other should be free.  those are the general
   purpose packages i've heard of, besides what terramar has.
   sips _was_ written for aviris imagery.  i'm not sure how general purpose
   it is.  you would have to contact goetz or one of his people and ask.  i
   have another piece of software (pcw) that does pc and walsh
   transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image
   modification (you can compute an image using selected components).  i've
   used it on 70 megabyte aviris images without problems, but for the best
   speed you need an external dsp card.  it will work without it, but large
   images take quite a while (50-70 times as long) to process.  that's a
   freebie if you want it"
 
   "my  favorite is idl (interactive data language) from research systems,
   inc.  idl is in my opinion, much better and infinitely easier. its
   programming language is very strong and easy -- very pascal-like. it
   handles the number-crunching very well, also. personally, i like doing
   the number-crunching with idl on the vax (or mathematica, igor, or even
   excel on the mac if it's not too hairy), then bringing it over to nih
   image for the imaging part. i have yet to encounter any situation which
   that combination couldn't handle, and the speed and ease of use
   (compared to iraf) was incredible. by the way, it's mostly astronomical
   image processing which i've been doing. this means image enhancement,
   cleaning up bad lines/pixels, and some other traditional image
   processing routines. then, for example, taking a graph of intensity
   versus position along a line i choose with the mouse, then doing a curve
   fit to that line (which i might do like in kaleidagraph.) "
 
 [ for idl call research systems , for pv-wave call precision visuals and
  for sips call university of colorado @ boulder . from what i can
  understand, you can get packaged programs from research systems, though

 scry
 ----
 [ from the readme : ]
 
       scry is a distributed image handling system  that  pro-
  vides image transport and compression on local and wide area
  networks, image viewing on workstations, recording on  video
  equipment,  and  storage on disk.  the system can be distri-
  buted among workstations, between supercomputers and  works-
  tations,  and between supercomputers, workstations and video
  animation controllers.  the system is most commonly used  to
  produce  video based movie displays of images resulting from
  visualization of time dependent data, complex 3d data  sets,
  and  image  processing  operations.   both  the  clients and
  servers run on a variety of systems that provide unix-like c
  run-time environments, and 4bsd sockets.

 svlib / fvs
 -----------
   svlib is an x-windows widget set based on the osf (open software 
   foundation) motif widget set. svlib widgets are macro-widgets 
   comprising lower level motif widgets such as buttons, scrollbars, 
   menus, and drawing areas. it is designed to address the reusability 
   of 2d visualization routines and each widget in the library is an 
   encapsulation of a specific visualization technique such as colormap 
   manipulation, image display, and contour plotting. it is targetted
   to run on unix workstations supporting osf/motif. currently, only 
   color monitors are supported. since svlib is a collection of widgets 
   developed in the same spirit as the osf/motif user interface widget 
   set, it integrates seamlessly with the motif widgets. programmers 
   using svlib widgets see the same interface and design as other 
   motif widgets.
 
   fvs is a visualization software for computational fluid dynamics (cfd) 
   simulations.  fvs is designed to accept data generated from these
   simulations and apply various visualization techniques to present these
   data graphically. 
   fvs accepts three-dimensional multi-block data recorded in ncsa hdf format.

 gvlware distribution:
         bob  - an interactive volume renderer for the sgi
         raz  - a disk based movie player for the sgi
         icol - motif color editor
 ---------------------------------------------------------
 
 the army high performance computing research center (ahpcrc) has been
 developing a set of tools to work with large time dependent 2d and 3d
 data sets.  in the graphics and visualization lab (gvl) we are using
 these tools along side standard packages, such as sgi explorer and the
 utah raster toolkit, to render 3d volumes and create digital movies.
 a couple of the more general purpose programs have been bundled into a
 package called "gvlware".
 
 gvlware, currently consisting of bob, raz and icol, is now available
 via ftp.  the most interesting program is probably bob, an interactive
 volume renderer for the sgi.  raz streams raster images from disk to
 an sgi screen, enabling movies larger than memory to be played.  icol
 is a color map editor that works with bob and raz.  source and
 pre-built binaries for irix 4.0.5 are included.
 
 to acquire gvlware, anonymous ftp to:
         machine - ftp.arc.umn.edu
         file    - /pub/gvl.tar.z
 
 to use gvlware:
         mkdir gvl ; cd gvl
         zcat gvl.tar.z | tar xvf -
         more readme
 
 some bob features:
         motif interface, sgi gl rendering
         renders 64 cubed data set in 0.1 to 1.0 seconds on a vgx
         alpha compositing and maximum value rendering, in perspective
             (only maximum value rendering on personal iris)
         data must be a "brick of bytes", on a regularly spaced grid
         animation, subvolumes, subsampling, stereo
 
 some raz features:
         motif interface, sgi gl rendering
         loads files to a raw disk partition, then streams to screen
             (requires an empty disk partition to be set aside)
         script interface available for movie sequences
         can stream from memory, like ncsa ximage
         
 some icol features:
         motif interface
         easy to create interpolated color maps between key points
         rgb, hsv and yuv color spaces, multiple file formats
         communicates changes automatically to bob and raz
         has been tested on sgi, sun, dec and cray systems
 
 btw:    bob  == brick of bytes
         icol == interpolated color
         raz  == ? (just a name)
 
 please send any comments to

   (a specific format, easy to alter for the subroutine) on pc's.  my
   program has hooks into gks.  if your friend has access to phigs for x
   (pex) and fortran bindings, i would be happy to share my evolving code
   (free of charge).  right now it can display supercells of up to 65
   atoms (easy to change), and up to 100 time steps, drawing nearest
   neighbor bonds between 2 defining nn radii.  it works acceptably fast
   on a 10mhz 286.

 ===================================================
 
 grass
 -----
   (geographic resource analysis support system) of the us army
   construction engineering research lab (cerl). it is a popular geographic and
   remote sensing image processing package. many may think of grass as a
   geographic information system rather than an image processing package,
   although it is reported to have significant image processing
   capabilities.
 
   feature descriptions
 
   i use grass  because it's public domain and can be obtained through the
   internet for free.  grass runs in unix and is written in c.  the source
   code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the office of grass
   integration.  you then compile the source code for your machine, using
   scripts provided with grass.  i would recommend grass for someone who
   already has a workstation and is on a limited budget. grass is not very
   user-friendly, compared to macintosh software." a first review  of
   overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel
   resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose
   image enhancement routines (fft). kelly maurice at vexcel corp. in
   boulder, co is a primary user of grass .  this gentleman has used the
   grass software and developed multi-spectral (238 bands ??) volumetric
   rendering, full color, on suns and stardents. it was a really effective
   interface.  vexcel corp. currently has a contract to map part of venus
   and convert the magellan radar data into contour maps. you can call them
   at (303) 444-0094 or email care of greg@vexcel.com 192.92.90.68
 
   host configuration requirements
 
   if you are willing to run a/ux you could install grass   on a macintosh
   which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for
   satellite data. grass  is public-domain, and can run on a high-end pc
   under unix. it is raster-based, has some image-processing capability,
   and can display vector data (but analysis must be done in the raster
   environment). i have used grass v.3 on a sun workstation and found it
   easy to use. it is best, of course, for data that are well represented
   in raster (grid-cell) form.
 
   availability
 
   cerl's office of grass integration (ogi)  maintains an ftp server:
   moon.cecer.army.mil (129.229.20.254).
 
   mail regarding this site should be addressed to
   grass-ftp-admin@moon.cecer.army.mil.
 
   this location will be the new "canonical" source for grass software, as
   well as bug fixes, contributed sources, documentation, and other files.
   this ftp server also supports dynamic compression and uncompression and
   "tar" archiving of files.  a feature attraction of the server is john
   parks' grass tutorial.  because the manual is still in beta-test stage,
   john requests that people only acquire it if they are willing to review
   it and mail him comments/corrections. the ogi is not currently
   maintaining this document, so all correspondence about it should be
   directed to grassx@tang.uark.edu
 
   support
 
   listserv mailing lists:
 
   grassu-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for grass users; application-level
   questions, support concerns, miscellaneous questions, etc) send
   subscribe commands to grassu-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.
 
   grassp-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for grass programmers; system-level
   questions and tips, tricks, and techniques of design and implementation
   of grass applications) send subscribe commands to
   grassp-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.
 
   both lists are maintained by the office of grass integration (subset of
   the army corps of engineers construction engineering research lab in
   champaign, il). the ogi is providing the lists as a service to the
   community; while ogi and cerl employees will participate in the lists,
   we can make no claim as to content or veracity of messages that pass
   through the list.  if you have questions, problems, or comments, send
   e-mail to lists-owner@amber.cecer.army.mil and a human will respond.
 
 microstation imager
 -------------------
   intergraph (based in huntsville alabama) sells a wide range of gis
   software/hardware. microstation is a base  graphics package that imager
   sits on top of. imager is basically an  image processing package with a
   heavy gis/remote sensing flavor.
 
   feature description
 
   basic geometry manipulations: flip, mirror, rotate, generalized affine.
   rectification: affine, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th order models as well as a
   projective model (warp an image to a vector map or to another image).
   rgb to ihs and ihs to rgb conversion.  principal component analysis.
   classification: k-means and isodata.  fourier xforms: forward, filtering
   and reverse.  filters: high pass, low pass, edge enhancing, median,
   generic.  complex histogram/contrast control.  layer controller: manages
   up to 64 images at a time -- user can extract single bands from a 3 band
   image or create color images by combining various individual bands, etc.
 
   the package is designed for a remote sensing application (it can handle
   very large images) and there is all kinds of other software available
   for gis applications.
   host configuration requirements
 
   it runs on intergraph workstations (a unix machine similar to a sun)
   though there  were rumors (there are always rumors) that the software
   would be  ported to pc and possibly a sun environment.
 
 pci
 ---
   a company called pci, inc., out of richmond hill, ontario, canada, makes
   an array of software utilities for processing, manipulation, and use of
   remote sensing data in eight or ten different "industry standard"
   formats: lgsowg, bsq, landsat, and a couple of others whose titles i
   forget.  the software is available in versions for ms-dos, unix
   workstations (among them hp, sun, and ibm), and vms, and quite possibly
   other platforms by now.  i use the vms version.
 
   the "pci software" consists of several classes/groups/packages of
   utilities, grouped by function but all operating on a common "pci
   database" disk file.  the "tape i/o" package is a set of utility
   programs which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape
   formats into, or write those formats out from, the "pci database" file;
   this is the only package i use or know much about.  other packages can
   display data from the pci database to one or another of several
   pci-supported third-party color displays, output numeric or bitmap
   representation of image data to an attached printer, e.g. an epson-type
   dot-matrix graphics printer.  you might be more spe- cifically
   interested in the mathematical operations package: histo- gram and
   fourier analysis, equalization, user-specified operations (e.g.
   "multiply channel 1 by 3, add channel 2, and store as channel 5"), and
   god only knows what all else -- there's a lot.  i don't have and don't
   use these, so can't say much about them; you only buy the packages your
   particular application/interest calls for.
 
   each utility is controlled by from one to eight "parameters," read from
   a common "parameter file" which must be (in vms anyway) in your "default
   directory."  some utilities will share parameters and use the same
   parameter for a different purpose, so it can get a bit confusing setting
   up a series of operations.  the standard pci environment contains a
   scripting language very similar to ibm-pc basic, but which allows you to
   automate the process of setting up parameters for a common, complicated,
   lengthy or difficult series of utility executions.  (in vms i can also
   invoke utilities independently from a dcl command procedure.)  there's
   also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled
   language programs which can interface with (read from/write to) the pci
   data structures (database file, parameter file).
 
   the pci software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images, but
   requires such a level of operator expertise that, once you reach the
   level where you can handle r-s images, you can figure out ways to handle
   a few other things as well.  for instance, the tape i/o package offers a
   utility for reading headerless multi-band (what adobe photoshop on the
   macintosh calls "raw") data from tape, in a number of different
   "interleave" orders. this turns out to be ideal for manipulating the
   graphic-arts industry's "ct2t" format, would probably (i haven't tried)
   handle targa, and so on. above all, however, you have to know what
   you're doing or you can screw up to the nth degree and have to start
   over.  it's worth noting that the pci "database" file is designed to
   contain not only "raster" (image) data, but vectors (for overlaying map
   information entered via digitizing table), land-use, and all manner of
   other information (i observe that a remote-sensing image tape often
   contains all manner of information about the spectral bands, latitude,
   longitude, time, date, etc. of the original satellite pass; all of this
   can go into the pci "database").
 
   i _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used.  on vax
   systems other than workstations pci supports only a couple of specific
   third-party display systems (the name gould/deanza seems to come to
   mind).  one of my personal workarounds was a display program which would
   display directly from a pci "database" file to a peritek vct-q (q-bus
   24-bit directcolor) display subsystem.  pci software could be "overkill"
   in your case; it seems designed for the very "high end"
   applications/users, i.e. those for whom a mac/pc largely doesn't suffice
   (although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time).  it's
   probably no coincidence that pci is located in canada, a country which
   does a lot of its land/resource management via remote sensing; i believe
   the canadian government uses pci software for some of its work in these
   areas.
 
 spam (spectral analysis manager)
 --------------------------------
   back in 1985 jpl developed something called spam (spectral analysis
   manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time.  that was designed
   for airborne imaging spectrometer imagery (byte data, <= 256 pixels
   across by <= 512 lines by <= 256 bands); a modified version has since
   been developed for aviris (airborne visual and infrared imaging
   spectrometer) which uses much larger images.
 
   spam does none of these things (rectification, classification, pc and
   ihs transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, overlays).
   actually, it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement
   (stretching).  spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering.
 
   the original spam uses x or sunview to display.  the aviris version may
   require vicar, an executive based on tae, and may also require a frame
   buffer.  i can refer you to people if you're interested.  pcw requires x
   for display.

   among the mac gis systems, map ii is distributed by john wiley.
 
 clrview
 -------
   clrview is a 3-dimensional visualization program designed to exploit
   the real-time capabilities of silicon graphics iris computers.
 
   this program is designed to provide a core set of tools to aid in the
   visualization of information from cad and gis sources.  it supports
   the integration of many common but disperate data sources such as dxf,
   tin, dem, lattices, and arc/info coverages among others.
 
   clrview can be obtained from explorer.dgp.utoronto.ca (128.100.1.129) 
   in the directory pub/sgi/clrview.
