 i am looking into methods i can use to turn my linux based bbs into a full color
 graphical bbs that supports pc, mac, linux, and amiga callers. 
 originally i was inspired by the naplps graphics standard (a summary of 
 which hit this group about 2 weeks ago). 
 following up on software availability of naplps supporting software i find
 that most terminal programs are commercial the only resonable shareware one being
 pp3 which runs soley on msdos machines leaving mac and amiga users to buy full
 commercial software if they want to try out the bbs (i know i wouldn't)
 
 next most interesting possibility is to port mgr to pc, mac, amiga. i know there
 is an old version of a mac port on bellcore.com that doesn't work under system 7
 but i can't seem to find the source anywhere to see if i can patch it.
 
 is there a color version of mgr for linux? 
 i know there was an alpha version of the libs out last year but i misplaced it.
 
 does anyone on this group know if mgr as been ported to pc or amiga ?
 i can't seem to send a message to the mgr channel without it bouncing.
 
 does anyone have any other suggestions for a linux based gui bbs ?
 
 thanks in advan
