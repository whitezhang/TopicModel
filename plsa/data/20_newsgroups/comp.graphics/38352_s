 there is a vast literature on delaunay triangulations, literally
 hundreds of papers.  a program is even provided with every copy of 
 mathematica nowadays.  you might look at this if you are interested in 
 using it for creating 3d objects:
 
 @article{boissonnat5,
   author = "j.d. boissonnat",
   title = "geometric structures for three-dimensional shape representation",
   journal = "acm transactions on graphics",
   month = "october",
   year = {1984},
   volume = {3},
   number = {4},
   pages = {266-286}
 }
