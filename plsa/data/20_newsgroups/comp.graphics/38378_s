 
 hi! everyone,
 
 since some people quickly solved the problem of determining a sphere from
 4 points, i suddenly recalled a problem which is how to find the ellipse
 from its offset. for example, given 5 points on the offset, can you find
 the original ellipse analytically?
 
 i spent two months solving this problem by using analytical method last year,
 but i failed. under the pressure, i had to use other method - nonlinear
 programming technique to deal with this problem approximately.
 
 any ideas will be greatly appreciated. please post here, let the others
 share our interests.
 
 yeh
