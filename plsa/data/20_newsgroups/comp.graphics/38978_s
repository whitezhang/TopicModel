 hi there,
         i'm using pov-ray on my ibm compatible at home, but i would like to 
 run some things at work on our vax computer. i believe there is a version 
 of the source code for pov-ray that is vax specific, but i'm not sure where 
 to find it (i've looked at the several sites where the ibmpc version of it 
 can be found). can anyone help me?
 
 thanks in advance,
