 'illumination and color in computer generated imagery' by roy hall contains c
 source for several famous illumination models, including bouknight, phong,
 blinn, whitted, and hall illumination models. if you want an introduction to
 shading you might look through the book 'writing a raytracer' edited by
 glassner. also, the book 'procedural elements for computer graphics' by rogers
 is a good reference. source for code in these book are available on the net i 
 believe, you might check out nic.funet.fi or some site closer to you carrying 
 graphics related stuff. 
 
 hope this is what you were asking for.
