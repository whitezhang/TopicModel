        i'm looking for code that will generate a minimum-volume oriented
 bounding box for an arbitrary polyhedron.  anyone know of such code?
 
        why?  i'm converting objects from
 one modelling system into another, and the destination system is object
 oriented.  so i want to represent each object in its own coordinate system,
 that of its bounding box, with the objects then translated and rotated
 appropriately, this being the representation used in the destination
 system.
