 actuallay i don't, but on the other hand i don't support the idea of having
 one newsgroup for every aspect of graphics programming as proposed by brian,
 in his reply to my original posting.
 i would suggest a looser structure more like a comp.graphics.programmer,
 comp.graphics.hw_and_sw
 the reason for making as few groups as possible is for the same reason you
 say we shouldn't spilt up, not to get to few postings every day.
 i takes to much time to browse through all postings just to find two or 
 three i'm interested in.
 
 i understand and agree when you say you want all aspects of graphics in one
 meeting. i agree to some extension. i see news as a forum to exchange ideas,
 help others or to be helped. i think this is difficult to achive if there
 are so many different things in one meeting.
 
 good evening netters|-)
