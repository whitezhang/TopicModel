 tommy frandsen's vgalib (which is probably what you're talking about)
 will do the standard vga modes, some tweaked modes and then the tseng
 et4000 super vga modes. i have an et4000 and i'm viewing gif's at
 640x480/256 (i have a lousy/small monitor) with dpg-view on linux. i
 think i had to change some constants in the dpg-view sources to make it
 use the et4k modes.
 
 vgalib's sources seem to be designed for easy addition of new super vga
 support; each mode is an array of register values and there's a program
 that dumps an array declaration of this kind describing the current
 mode. haven't tried it though...
 
 (btw, my version of vgalib is 1.2.)
