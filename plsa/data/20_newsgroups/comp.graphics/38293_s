 the following is extracted from sumex-aim.stanford.edu.  it should also be on
 the mirrors.  i think there is source for some applications that may have some
 bearing on your project.  poke around the source directory.  i've never used
 this package, nor do i know anyone who did, but the price is right :-)
 
 hope this helps.

 subject: 3d grafsys 1.21 in incoming directory
 a 3d grafsys short description follows:
 
 programmers 3d grafsys vers 1.21 now available. 
 
 version 1.21 is mainly a bugfix for think c users. this version
 now runs with think c, i promise! the docs now contain a chapter for
 c programmers on how to use the grafsys. if you have problems, feel free 
 to contact me.
 the other change is that i removed the fastperftrig calls from
 the fpu version to make it run faster.
 
 those of you who don't know what all this is about, read on.

 programmers 3d grafsys -- what it is:
 -------------------------------------
 
 didn't you always have this great game in mind where you needed some way of 
 drawing three-dimensional scenes? 
 
 didn't you always want to write this program that visualized the structure 
 of three-dimensional molecules?
 
 and didn't the task of writing your 3d conversions routines keep you from 
 actually doing it?
 
 well if the answer to any of the above questions is 'yes, but what has it to 
 do with this package???' , read on.
 
 grafsys is a think pascal/c library that provides you with simple routines 
 for building, saving, loading (as resources), and manipulating 
 (independent rotating around arbitrary achses, translating and scaling) 
 three dimensional objects. objects, not just simple single-line drawings.
 
 grafsys supports full 3d clipping, animation and some (primitive) hidden-
 line/hidden-surface drawing with simple commands from within your program.
 
 grafsys also supports full eye control with both perspective and parallel
 projections (if you can't understand a word, don't worry, this is just showing
 off for those who know about it. the docs that come with it will try to explain
 what it all means later on). 
 
 grafsys provides a powerful interface to supply your own drawing routines with
 data so you can use grafsys to do the 3d transformations and your own routines
 to do the actual drawing. (note that grafsys also provides drawing routines so
 you don't have to worry about that if you don't want to)
 
 grafsys 1.11 comes in two versions. one for the 881 and 020 or above 
 processors. the other version uses fixed-point arithmetic and runs on any mac.
 both versions are *100% source compatibel*. 
 
 grafsys comes with an extensive manual that teaches you the fundamentals of 3d
 graphics and how to use the package.
 
 if demand is big enough i will convert the grafsys to an object-class library. 
 however, i feelt that the way it is implemented now makes it easier to use for
 a lot more people than the select 'oop-guild'.
 
 grafsys is free for any non-commercial usage. read the documentation enclosed.
 
 
 enjoy,
 christian franz
