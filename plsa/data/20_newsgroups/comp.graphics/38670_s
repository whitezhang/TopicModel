 hi, this is my first msg to the net (actually the 3rd copy of it, dam*ed vi!!).
 
   look for the new vpic6.0, it comes with updated vesa 1.2 drivers for almost every known card. the vesa level is 1.2, and my tseng4000 24-bit has a nice affair with the driver. 
 
   hope it is useful!!
 
 
 							bye
