 hi everyone--
 
   it's spend-the-money-before-it-goes-away time here at u.florida
 and we need to find some pc-based software that will do contour
 plotting with irregular boundaries,i.e., a 2-d profile of a soil
                                     system with a pond superimposed
                 /-----------------  on it.  we've given surfer a
     pond      /                  |  trial run but it interpolates
             /                    |  contours out into the pond and/or
 ----------/                      |  creates artifacts at the borders.
 |              soil              |  if anyone out there knows of a
 |                                |  product, i'ld appreciate hearing
 |________________________________|  about it.  if there is enough of
 a response, i'll post a summary.  thanks -- (and now back to lurking).
