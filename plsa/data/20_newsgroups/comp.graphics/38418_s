 
 i finally got a 24 bit viewer for my povray generated .tga files.
 
 it was written in c by sean malloy and he kindly sent me a copy.  he
 wrote it for the same purpose, to view .tga files using his speedstar 24.
 
 it only works with the speedstar 24 and i cannot send copies since it is
 not my program.  i believe the author may release a version at a future
 time when the program is more developed.   he may or may not comment on
 this, as he pleases.
 
 thanks to all who were helpful.
 
 regards,
 
 jim nobles
