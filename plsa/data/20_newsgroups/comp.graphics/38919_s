 hello,
  
 i've been on the dkbtrace/povray mailing list out of trearn.bitnet
 for some time now, but when i tried to post the other day the
 listserv told me that the list doesn't exist!  so i got a global
 list of groups from the listserv and - - nothing!  i grepped every
 string i could think of.  if frank, ville saari, andre beck, or anyone
 else who's a regular on dkb-l can tell me what is going on, please do!
  
 regards,
