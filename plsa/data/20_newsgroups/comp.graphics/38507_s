 i must agree.  there is a dizzying number of c.s.amiga.* newsgroups
 already.  in addition, there are very few issues which fall cleanly
 into one of these categories.
 
 also, it is readily observable that the current spectrum of amiga
 groups is already plagued with mega-crossposting; thus the group-split
 would not, in all likelihood, bring about a more structured
 environment.
