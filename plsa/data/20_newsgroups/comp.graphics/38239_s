 up until last week, i have been running povray v1.0 on my 486/33 under dos5
 without any major problems.  over easter i increased the memory from 4meg to
 8meg, and found that povray reboots the system every time under dos5.  i had
 a go at running povray in a dos window when running win3.1 on the same system
 and it now works fine, even if a lot slower.  i would like to go back to 
 using povray directly under dos, anyone any ideas???
