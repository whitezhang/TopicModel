 
 
 i recently got a document describing the jpeg fif (jfif) file
 format. i was looking thru it, but i didn't get the idea how
 to determine the size of a pic in pixel without decoding the
 whole image.
 
 how do you get the height and width of a jpeg in a jfif?
 
 how do you determine wether it is a color or a greyscale
 picture?
 
 i wrote a small tool (lsgif) for gif that returns the
 filesize, picture size and color resolution by analizing
 the header chunks. the output looks like this:
 
   157605  bla.gif                                  640x 480  248c24
 
 i use this lsgif to create index files of my archive and since
 jpeg are getting more and more popular i would like to have a
 similar tool for jfif, with an output like this:
 
    57605  bla.jpg                                  640x 480     c24
 
 please respond by email, because i don't read this news
 group very often. i'll post a summary if it is useful.
 
 thanx in advance,
