 i am writing some utilies to convert regis and tektonic esacpe sequences  
 into some useful formats. i would rather not have to goto a bitmap format.  
 i can convert them to window meta files easily enough, but i would rather  
 convert them to corel draw, .cdr, or ms power point, .ppt, files.  
 microsoft would not give me the format. i was wondering if anybody out  
 there knows the formats for these two applications.
