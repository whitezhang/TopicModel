 	what's sort of interesting about this whole thread is just how much
 it has in common with similar threads in groups dealing with other vendor's
 hardware.  i currently deal basically with hardware from 3 vendors - apple,
 dec, and sgi - and thus tend to monitor the groups about those vendor's
 hardware.  currently, it seems like sgi customers are pissed at sgi about
 dropping support for the personal iris, dec customers are pissed at dec for
 dropping mips support in favor of the new alpha boxes, and apple customers
 seem to get pissed every time a new mac is introduced that's faster and
 cheaper than the one they just bought.  when i used to be a sun customer
 years ago, i remember people being pissed at sun for leaving their 386
 and 680x0 customers out in the cold when sparc came along.
 
 	what's really interesting is that from what i can tell, the mis
 folks in the basement with their es/9000 don't seem to be pissed at ibm.
 why?  i have no idea.  either ibm really does take care of their customers
 better, or they just have their customers brainwashed better than the
 smaller vendors do.
