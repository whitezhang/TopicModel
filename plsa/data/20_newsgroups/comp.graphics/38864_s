 i've discovered a bug in the libraries/parser/parser.c loadcolour function where it was generating a segmentation fault.  it appears the colourlist[] is geting corrupted somehow.  i had it return random colours instead and everything worked great (except for a few colour problems) so i know its the only thing wrong.
 
 the colour table somehow gets a couple of nulls placed in it so when the "name" of the colours are compared it crashes.  i haven't found the problem yet maybe someone else can.
