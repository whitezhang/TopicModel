 i also would like code or algorithms to do this.
 
 in fact, i am interested in sources for code and/or algorithms that
 convert 2d graphical objects into other 2d graphical objects that
 will render into the same image. i.e. bezier curves to b splines,
 or splines to circular arc segments, or b splines to polgons, etc...
