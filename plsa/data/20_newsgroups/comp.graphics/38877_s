 i've done a bit of looking, and havn't been able to 
 come up with a mailing list or newsgroup for users
 of adobe photoshop.  assuming i've just not missed
 it, i'll go ahead and see if there is enough interest
 to start a mailing list (and/or alt. newsgroup).
 
 drop me a note if  you might be interested in subscribing.
 
 thanks!
