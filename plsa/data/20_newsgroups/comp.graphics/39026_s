 i heard a friend who just return from nab from las vegas confirm
 that realsoft will be releasing a windows version of real-3d 2.0
 this summer.  he was told that the rendering speed on the dx50 isn't
 as fast as a4000.  however, he was also told that they are switching
 from microsoft c++ to watcom to gain more speed.  for people who is
 looking for a powerful 3d animation software for pc.  the wait
 shouldn't be too long.  real 3d 2.0 is absolutely the most powerful and
 flexible 3d package out there that sells for less than $1000.
 
 p.s. i heard a indigo version is also under development.
