 	actually, for digital hdtv systems that's far higher bandwidth than
 you need, unless there's some reason you must work in fully-uncompressed
 hdtv.  also, my calculations is that each frame should be well under 6mb,
 even using 24 bits/pixel (which is more bits than you actually need - 15 or
 18 should be enough for a moving picture).  1600x1100x16bits is 3.5mb (i'm
 guessing at hdtv resolution - it may be a bit wider than 1600, i'm fairly
 sure of the 1100 number for most of the digital proposals).
 
 	i hope you have a very fast memory system as well - 180mb/s while
 displaying will require a heavily interleaved vram system.
 
 	unless you have a _very_ compelling reason, i'd advise trying to use
 at least somewhat compressed data.  you don't have to go to full compression
 to get to a level where the data io requirements are much cheaper and easier
 to deal with.
