 our group recently bought a mitsubishi p78u video printer and i could use some
 help with it.  we bought this thing because it (1) has a parallel data input in
 addition to the usual video signal inputs and (2) claimed to print 256 gray
 level images.  however, the manual that came with it only describes how to
 format the parallel data to print 1 and 4 bit/pixel images.  after some initial
 problems with the parallel interface i now have this thing running from a
 parallel port of an hewlett-packard workstation and i can print 1 and 4
 bit/pixel images just fine.  i called the mitsubishi people and asked about the
 256 level claim and they said that was only available when used with the video
 signal inputs.  this was not mentioned in the sales literature.  however they
 did say the p78u can do 6 bit/pixel (64 level) images in parallel mode, but
 they didn't have any information about how to program it to do so, and they
 would call japan, etc.
 
 frankly, i find it hard to believe that if this thing can do 8 bit/pixel images
 from the video source, it can't store 8 bits/pixel in the memory.  it's not
 like memory is that expensive any more.  if anybody has any information on
 getting 6 bit/pixel (or even 8 bit/pixel) images out of this thing, i would
 greatly appreciate your sending it to me.
 
 thanks.
