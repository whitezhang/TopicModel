 and neuron functions.  especially interesting would be volumetric data from
 brain scans, electromicographs, and so forth.  please email me and let me know
 if you know of such.

 the humbio project is a cd-rom-based curriculum tool for sixth-, seventh-, and
 eigth-graders, studying the function of the human brain and the effects of
 neurotransmitters, alcohol, and drugs.  the will be a special focus in depicting
 the effects of neurotransmitters on behavior.
         volotta interactive video is producing this project for stanford univers
 ity.
 we are currently in a pre-production phase and we are looking for data sets and
 visualizations depicting brain function on the whole brain, neuron and molecular
 levels.  we intend to use state-of-the-art visualization tools to render
 instructive visualizations from two-, three-, and four-dimensional data sets as
 well as using already-completed visualizations to their best effect.
