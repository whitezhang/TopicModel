 i've tried compiling it on several sparcstations with gcc 2.22.  after
 fixing up a few bugs (3 missing constant definitions plus a couple of
 other things) i got it to compile & link, but after starting client
 & server i just get a black window; sometimes the client core dumps,
 sometimes the server, sometimes i get a broken pipe, sometimes it
 just sits there doing nothing although i occassionally get the
 cursor to become a cross-hair in dog-fight, but that's it.  i've
 sent word to the author plus what i did to fix it last week, but
 no reply as yet.
