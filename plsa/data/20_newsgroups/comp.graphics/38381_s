 
 
 i am working on a project where we are going to be including
 both still and moving grapics within a database.  of course
 jpeg and mpeg come to mind as the formats of choice for the
 various files.  however, from what i read on the net, it seems
 as if there are several different forms of each of these.
 
 what i want to do, is settle on a file format which i can count
 on as being a standard format 10 years from now.  i know apple is going
 to support quicktime on the new power pc's and, so this
 may be the format of choice.
 
 what format does apple's quicktime use for their products?  i guess
 it is some kind of mpeg for their motion picture. is it any different
 than standard mpeg files?
 
 thanx for any info!
