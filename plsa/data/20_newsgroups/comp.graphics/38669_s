 funny thing, the internet: i have no idea what xv221 might be - except that it
 might be something to do with x-windows on pcs (? if you know, and have used
 it, and think that it is good, email me. [ryanph@mrl.dsto.gov.au]).
 
 dv/x is a common abbreviation for quarterdeck corporation's desqview/x
 software.
 
 i have not used dv/x yet, but reading the blurbs that quarterdeck sent me, it
 sounds pretty great:
 	* allows multiple dos machines - the way that os/2 does, but without
 requiring 10 mb of ram to get os/2 going
 	* pre-emptive multi-tasking
 	* network computing - a proper x-windows client/server application -
 this means that dos program can be used on other x-windows computers on your
 network, and that x-windows programs can be used on your dv/x computer
 	* although it is not a version of unix, it effectively has many of
 unix's features, and mostly you will be able to compile unix-type programs
 using the djgpp or gnu c compilers
 
 they advertise regularly in all of the major computing and programming
 magazines. they also have internet support online (support@qdeck.com).
