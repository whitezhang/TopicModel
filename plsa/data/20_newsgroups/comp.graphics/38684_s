 
 i've got a 386 20hz computer which is under warranty and my trident
 8900c video card is starting to play-up (surprise, surprise). therefore
 i'm going to try to exchange it for a better card.
 
 the big question is:
 
 which video card is high quality and with an
 acceptable price tag (on student budget) ???
 
 	thank you in advance.
