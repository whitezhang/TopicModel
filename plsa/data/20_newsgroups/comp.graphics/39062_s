 or perhaps you write a freely available, gpled unix for commonly
 available computer platforms (i386/i486 machines) and become a catalyst
 for a major netwide project which produces a better unix-like os than
 many commercial counterparts (see comp.os.linux for details).  or maybe
 you found a legue for programming freedom to fight restrictive litigation
 and software patenting practices, thereby protecting the creative freedom
 so vital to continuing progress in our field.  or maybe you start up
 a gnu project, and produce by far and away the best c/c++ compiler
 for unix there is, not to mention other valuable utilities.
 
 some hackers make significant contributions without selling out their
 ideals.  as for bill gates, after pawning of grossly inferior software
 onto the pc market for ten years, if he ever was a hacker, he deserves
 to have his name eradicated from the annals of computer hackery.
 
 as for me, i like running linux+x+countless other packages, without
 paying a dime.  on the other hand, i have no problem purchasing motif
 or other good software, as long as microsoft hasn't fouled it with their
 inept input.
 
 my 2 cents worth, flames will be patiently ignored. :-)
 
 jean.
