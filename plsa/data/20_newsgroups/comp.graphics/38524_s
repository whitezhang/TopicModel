 
 	has anybody gotten cview to work in 32k or 64k color mode on a trident
 8900c hi-color card? at best the colors come out screwed up, and at worst the 
 program hangs. i loaded the vesa driver, and the same thing happens on 2 
 different machines.
 
 	if it doesn't work on the trident, does anybody know of a viewer that 
 does?
 
 thanx!
