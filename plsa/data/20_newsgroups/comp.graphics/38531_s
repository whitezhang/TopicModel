 	it depends on what kind of the polygons. 
 	convex - simple, concave - trouble, concave with loop(s)
 	inside - big trouble.
 
 	of cause, you can use the box test to avoid checking
 	each edges. according to my experience, there is not
 	a simple way to go. the headache stuff is to deal with
 	the special cases, for example, the overlapped lines.
