 speaking of psygnosis, they have licensed games to philips interative
 media international for cd-i.
 
 the following was recently posted in a message in the cd-i section of
 the multimedia forum.
 
 "seventh guest has been licensed by virgin games to philips interactive
 media international for worldwide cd-i rights. were also licensed to
 p.i.m.i. litil divil from gremlin graphics (uk) and microcosm from
 psygnosis (uk). those three titles will be adapted on cd-i using the full
 potential of the fmv cartridge, meaning, using the additional memory as
 well as the motion video capabilities. those titles have been negociated
 in europe but will be available worldwide.
 
 also, lemmings 1 & 2 have been licensed from psygnosis, as well as striker
 soccer from rage (uk)."
 
 i don't know when these titles will be available or when work on them even
 started (so don't expect your cd-i retailer to have them yet).
 
 there was also some mention of future nintendo cd-i games in an issue of the
 uk magazine ert - mario hotel was mentioned as having 75 levels.
