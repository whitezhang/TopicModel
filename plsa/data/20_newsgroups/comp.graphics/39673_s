 unfortunately, the general public has a very narrow view of the deep, dark
 recesses of the art of computing.  what little they do see is from the view
 given to them by the media.  from what i have seen from the media, 'hacker'
 is not a proper way by which to refer to a respected person.
 
 i, on the other hand, know what 'hacker' means from those who consider
 themselves such.  following is the definition from "jargon file 2.9.10".
 (this is also known as the "hackers dictionary".)  the definitions are
 arranged in order of decreasing frequency of usage:
 
    :hacker: [originally, someone who makes furniture with an axe] n.
      1. a person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable
      systems and how to stretch their capabilities, as opposed to most
      users, who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary.  2. one who
      programs enthusiastically (even obsessively) or who enjoys
      programming rather than just theorizing about programming.  3. a
      person capable of appreciating {hack value}.  4. a person who is
      good at programming quickly.  5. an expert at a particular program,
      or one who frequently does work using it or on it; as in 'a unix
      hacker'.  (definitions 1 through 5 are correlated, and people who
      fit them congregate.)  6. an expert or enthusiast of any kind.  one
      might be an astronomy hacker, for example.  7. one who enjoys the
      intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming or circumventing
      limitations.  8. [deprecated] a malicious meddler who tries to
      discover sensitive information by poking around.  hence 'password
      hacker', 'network hacker'.  see {cracker}.
 
      the term 'hacker' also tends to connote membership in the global
      community defined by the net (see {network, the} and
      {internet address}).  it also implies that the person described
      is seen to subscribe to some version of the hacker ehic (see
      {hacker ethic, the}).
 
      it is better to be described as a hacker by others than to describe
      oneself that way.  hackers consider themselves something of an
      elite (a meritocracy based on ability), though one to which new
      members are gladly welcome.  there is thus a certain ego
      satisfaction to be had in identifying yourself as a hacker (but if
      you claim to be one and are not, you'll quickly be labeled
      {bogus}).  see also {wannabee}.
 
    :hacker ethic, the: n.  1. the belief that information-sharing
      is a powerful positive good, and that it is an ethical duty of
      hackers to share their expertise by writing free software and
      facilitating access to information and to computing resources
      wherever possible.  2. the belief that system-cracking for fun
      and exploration is ethically ok as long as the cracker commits
      no theft, vandalism, or breach of confidentiality.
 
      both of these normative ethical principles are widely, but by no
      means universally) accepted among hackers. most hackers subscribe
      to the hacker ethic in sense 1, and many act on it by writing and
      giving away free software.  a few go further and assert that
      *all* information should be free and *any* proprietary
      control of it is bad; this is the philosophy behind the {gnu}
      project.
 
      sense 2 is more controversial: some people consider the act of
      cracking itself to be unethical, like breaking and entering.
      but this principle at least moderates the behavior of people who
      see themselves as `benign' crackers (see also {samurai}).  on
      this view, it is one of the highest forms of hackerly courtesy
      to (a) break into a system, and then (b) explain to the sysop,
      preferably by email from a {superuser} account, exactly how it
      was done and how the hole can be plugged --- acting as an
      unpaid (an unsolicited) {tiger team}.
 
      the most reliable manifestation of either version of the hacker
      ethic is that almost all hackers are actively willing to share
      technical tricks, software, and (where possible) computing
      resources with other hackers.  huge cooperative networks such as
      {usenet}, {fidonet} and internet (see {internet address})
      can function without central control because of this trait; they
      both rely on and reinforce a sense of community that may be
      hackerdom's most valuable intangible asset.
 
 :  finally, a true hacker does not name himself/herself one, for this is
 :  a title that is bestowed by the befuddled sysadmins and users at large.
 : to me, a sign of a truly great hacker is to be introduced to someone who
 : says "nahh, i just know a thing or two, people always exagerate..." :-)
 
 note that the above definition does not preclude a hacker from describing
 limself (meaning: himself/herself) one, but simply says that it is better
 not to do so.  there are many who do not know the meaning of 'hacker'.  so,
 in order to defend the true meaning of the word, it is sometimes necessary
 to borrow on the reputation of a known (respected) hacker around the
 workplace.  (this means that 'hacker' is defined in terms of some well-known
 and respected person.)  sometimes, there may only be one such person.
 
 : >no matter what mr. dumpty says, language doesn't work that way.
 :  actually it does, you just have to get adequate press coverage... :-)
 
 language works anyway that we want it to work.  the purpose of language is
 to communicate.  to oversimplify: as long as communication is taking place,
 then language is working.
