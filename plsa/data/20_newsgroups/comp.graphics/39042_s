       hi.  i'm  looking for information on how to directly manipulate
  video memory.  i have an application that i would like to use this for,
  because it is much faster than going through the bios.  i know that
  video memory ispart of the system area above the first 640k, so i guess
  i am looking to find out exactly what section of memory it is, and how it
  is layed out.     thanks.
 
            regards,       gordon rogers
