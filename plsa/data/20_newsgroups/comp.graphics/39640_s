 i'm looking for documentation/books on parametric drafting.
 
 does anyone know of such material, electronic on a gopher/ftp-site
 or books/authors.
 
 im not looking for commercial software rather info on implementation 
 and theory of the subject. im planning to make a parametric
 generator for autocad and i would need some referance.
