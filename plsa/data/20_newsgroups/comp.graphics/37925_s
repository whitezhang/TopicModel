 
 i am currently looking for a 3d graphics library that runs on ms
 windows 3.1.  are there any such libraries out there other than
 visuallib?  (it must run on vga and should not require any other
 add-on graphics cards).
 
 for visuallib, will it run with metaware high c compiler v3.0?  any
 email contact for the author of visuallib?
 
 any help would be much appreciated.  thanks.
