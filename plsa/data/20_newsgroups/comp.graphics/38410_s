 
 hi again,
 
 many thanks to all the people who responded to my request for a ms-
 windows screen grabber.  it proves to me again that the net is a 
 wonderful thing.  :-)
 
 so, in summary:
 
 there are two choices:
 
 1)	various screen grabber packages (corel draw has one, there are
 a couple on simtel and cica).
 
 2)	use the built-in printscreen and alt-printscreen functionality
 to paste the screen (or window) to the clipboard.  then paste the 
 clipboard to your application.  cool!
 
 again, thanks for the info...
