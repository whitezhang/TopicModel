 i've used that reference, and found that i needed to go to their
 original tech report:
 
 	maureen stone and tony derose,
 	"characterizing cubic bezier curves"
 	xerox  edl-88-8, december 1988
 
 this report can be obtained for free from:
 xerox corporation
 palo alto research center
 3333 coyote hill road
 palo alto, california 94303
 +1-415-494-4440
 
 the tog paper was good, but this tech report had more interesting details ;-)
