 yes but a key issue is _speed_ how fast is imagine? and is it as easy to
 use
 as 3d studio? can it just do a render as fast as 3ds if you don't want
 things like ior etc.. 3ds can do fine shadows, animated reflection maps,
 animated bump maps, animated anything maps, and with the ipas routines 
 (not that i've ever seen them) it can do explosions, top quality
 morphing, fire, rain, lens flares etc..
 i'm not knocking imagine, i just want to know how it compares with 3ds
