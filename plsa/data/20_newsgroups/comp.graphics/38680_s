 i've been trying to figure out a way to get adobe illustrator
 to auto-trace >exactly< what i see on my screen. but it misses
 the edges of templates by as many as 6 pixels or more - resulting in images
 that are useless  - i need exact tracing, not approximate.
 
 i've tried adjusting the freehand tolerances as well as autotrace
 tolerances but it doesn't help. any suggestions?
