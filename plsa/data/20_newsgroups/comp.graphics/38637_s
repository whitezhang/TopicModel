 there is another useful method based on least sqyares estimation of the sphere equation parameters.
 
 the points (x,y,z) on a spherical surface with radius r and center (a,b,c) can be written as 
 
    (x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 + (z-c)^2 = r^2
 
 this equation can be rewritten into the following form:  
 
    2ax + 2by + 2cz + r^2 - a^2 - b^2 -c^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2
 
 approximate the left hand part by   f(x,y,z) = p1.x + p2.x + p3.z + p4.1
 
 for all datapoints, i.c. 4, determine the 4 parameters p1..p4 which minimise the average error |f(x,y,z) - x^2 - y^2 - z^2|^2.
 
 in 'numerical recipes in c' can be found algorithms to solve these parameters.
 
 the best fitting sphere will have 
 - center (a,b,c) = (p1/2, p2/2, p3/2)
 - radius r = sqrt(p4 + a.a + b.b + c.c).
 
 so, at last, will this solve you sphere estination problem, at least for the most situations i think ?.
