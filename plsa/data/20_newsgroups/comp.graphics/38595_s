 
 yes i am aware coreldraw exports in scodal.
 version 2 did it quite well, apart from a
 few hassles with radial fills. version 3 revb
 is better but if you try to export in scodal
 with a bitmap image included in the drawing
 it will say something like "cannot export
 scodal with bitmap"- at least it does on my
 version.
  if anyone out there knows a way around this
 i am all ears.
  temporal images make a product called filmpak
 which converts autocad plots to scodal, postscript
 to scodal and now gif to scodal but it costs $650
 and i was just wondering if there was anything out
 there that just did the bitmap to scodal part a tad
 cheaper.
