 i hope someone can help me with the following problem - i'm sure there
 must be a known solution.
 
 given a rectangle defined by
 
 -x <= x <= x  and -y <= y <= y  where x and y are constant
 
 and a parallelogram defined by
 
 -c1 <= a*x + b*y <= c1  and -c2 <= c*x + d*y <= c2
 
 where c1, c2, a, b, c, d are constants and b/a != d/c (i.e. not
 parallel lines)                                ^^
                                           not equal to
 
 what is the area of their intersection?
 
    what i'm after is some general algorithm suitable for all rectangles
 and parallelograms that can be described by the above equations.  at the 
 moment it looks like i'm going to have to look at all possible cases 
 and examine each seperately e.g.
 
 1) rectangle encloses parallelogram. 
 
 2) parallelogram encloses rectangle.
 
 3) two corners of parallelogram inside rectangle

 4) two corners of parallelogram outside rectangle
 
    i hope someone can help.
 
 many thanks in advance,
