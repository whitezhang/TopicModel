  i have a copy of 'the earth-from space' on my wall that i purchased
 from space shots, inc. (la, ca  (800) 272-2779).  as printed on the
 poster, the image was created by tom van sant and the geosphere project.
 the image is copyrighted, so i doubt that you'll find it legally in
 the public domain.  part of the proceeds from the sale of the image go to the 
 geosphere project (an environmental education thing), and the cost is
 nominal, so crack a 20 and buy one!  also, i don't think it's always
 safe to assume that just because the government 'funded' a project, any
 products will be provided for free.  many government agencies (nasa, noaa)
 and some private groups (national geographic) provided assistance to the
 geosphere project.  this collaboration seems to be mostly oriented to
 educating the public, rather than pure research.
