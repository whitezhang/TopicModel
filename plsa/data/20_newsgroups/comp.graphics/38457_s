 ummm, i beg to differ. a kind soul sent me a program called dpg-view that
 will do exactly what i want, view gif images under linux without x-windows.
 and, it does support all the way up to 1024x768. the biggest complaint i
 have is it is painfully slow. it takes about 1 minute to display an image.
 i am use to cshow under dos which takes a split second. any idea why it
 is so slow under linux? anybody have anything better? plus, anybody have
 the docs to dpg-view? thanks!
