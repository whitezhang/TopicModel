 is so you can use double buffering (for animating scenes) - i.e. you have
 2 * 24-bit planes. you write to the one in the background, and then flip! 
 -- the entire screen updates to the second image-plane. the screen updates 
 in one refresh and you don't see different objects appearing in the order 
 that they're drawn (as in the cad/macdraw effect). now your ready to update 
 the image that used to be in the foreground.

 about the sg product line: who can even keep track nowadays? every co. seems
 to (as their ads / press releases claim) redefine computing (etc. etc.) as
 we know it with each new product. progress and competition are great, but who
 wants to invest in a system that's obsolete by the time it reaches your desk?
