 	hello:
 	can anybody help me to find a program that converts a format named
 	"raw" (also known as "img") to the "gif" format or "jpeg" one.
 	it's desirable to be for a unix machine than for a pc.
 
 	(
 	"raw" format of a n*n image is a file that contain a tail of 
 	n*n characters, each one referencing to the k*n+j pixel of the 
 	monocrome image, where k and j lies between 0 and n-1.
 	).
