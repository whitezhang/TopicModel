 so far i looked at the ati gup vlb as my favorite graphics-card. but 
 recently i heard something about a new card from  miro. it was the miro
 crystal 24s with 3 mb and true color support up to 1024x768. it costs just a
 little more than the ati. so, can't decide which one matches better my needs.
 any technical references and performance comparisons (especially from the
 miro card) would be greatly appreciated.
