 i am not sure that i am supposed to post this mail here. however
 during the last year, while i was involved in developing graphical user
 interface (gui) applications, i have enjoyed being personally part of this
 news group wherin i got some interesting information which helped me in my
 work. i am posting my resuming hoping that people working in my area would
 make time to look at it.

 dear prospective employer:
 
 i am seeking employment as a software engineer with interests in software
 design and development, in which i can utilize my experience in hardware, 
 c & c++ programming, graphical user interface (gui), operating systems and
 computer networking.
 
 i received my bachelors of engineering (be) degree in electronics
 engineering in 1990 and a m.s. degree in electrical engineering in dec 1992 
 from iowa state university. currently i am enrolled in a m.s. in computer
 engineering at iowa state university.
 
 during my masters program, as a research assistant since jan 1991, i have
 published three papers including one in the ieee transactions on magnetics.
 these papers are a reflection of the quality of my research and my ability
 to learn new concepts quickly.
 
 i have been involved in many projects involving software developments and
 have extensive experience programming in c, c++, fortran and assembly level. 
 i am also familiar with operating systems like unix, ultrix and ms-dos.
 i am familiar with motif/x programming and currently, as a research assistant,
 am involved in graphical user interface (gui) design using the multiplatform 
 gui toolkit xvt++. my experiences also include areas such as operating systems
 and computer networks, through course work and projects. i was involved in the
 study of the design and development of the internals of the xinu operating
 system. i have also been involved in many tcp/ip programming projects in
 computer networking.
 
 while in college i learnt the importance of clear and concise communication.
 i have also learned a lot about time management. in my m.s. program i
 have maintained a 3.70 grade average, worked 20 hours per week and
 have enjoyed being involved in many other extra curricular activities.
 
 my software experiences along with my hardware background (electronics
 engineering) would be very helpful in my career goals as a software engineer.
 i request that my qualifications may kindly be reviewed. i would like to
 have an interview to discuss your employment needs and my career goals. 
 i am eager to hear from you soon.
 
 
 sincerely
