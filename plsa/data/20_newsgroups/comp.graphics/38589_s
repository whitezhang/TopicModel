 can anyone explain the polygon fill rules for x? i know about the even-odd
 rule but what is the nonzero winding number rule? what happens when the 
 left and right boundary lines have many pixels on a given scanline? what 
 are the rules concerning abutting polygons?(are they the same as the 
 join-style in the gc?) 
 
 i've read the x pixelization rule but how does the x server determine the 
 center point of a pixel? is there any support for shading?(color interpolation)
 
 can someone point me to a definitive book that discusses these issues?
 
 			thanks in advance to the gurus for there responses
