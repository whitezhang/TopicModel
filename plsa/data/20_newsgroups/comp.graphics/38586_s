      are we talking about colorview for dos here?  
      i have version 2.0 and it writes the temp files to its own
      current directory.
      what later versions do, i admit that i don't know.
      assuming your "expert" referenced above is talking about
      the version that i have, then i'd say he is correct.
      is the colorview for unix what is being discussed?
      just mixed up, confused, befuddled, but genuinely and
      entirely curious....
