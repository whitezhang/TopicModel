 my package is based on several articles about non-standard radiosity and
 some unpublished methods.
 
 the main articles are:
 
 -  cohen, chen, wallace, greenberg : 
     a progressive refinement approach to fast radiosity image generation
      computer graphics (siggraph), v. 22(no. 4), pp 75-84, august 1988
 
 -  silion, puech
     a general two-pass method integrating specular and diffuse reflection
     computer graphics (siggraph), v23(no. 3), pp335-344, july 1989
