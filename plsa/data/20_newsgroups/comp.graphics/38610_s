    Concerning the proposed newsgroup split, I personally am not in favor of
    doing this.  I learn an awful lot about all aspects of graphics by reading
    this group, from code to hardware to algorithms.  I just think making 5
    different groups out of this is a wate, and will only result in a few posts
    a week per group.  I kind of like the convenience of having one big forum
    for discussing all aspects of graphics.  Anyone else feel this way?
    Just curious.
 
 I disagree.  You could learn the same amount by reading all the
 split groups, and it would make things easier for those of us
 who are less omnivorous.  There is no "waste" in creating news
 groups -- its just a bit of shuffling about.  I have no problem
 with only a few posts per week per group - I spend too much time
 on this as it is.
