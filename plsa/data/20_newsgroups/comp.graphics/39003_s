 look be consistent. first you post something that seems to suggest that you see
 xv being an 8 bit program as some sort of error. 
 so i post and asy it is not a bug, it is meant to be like that. 
 so you post and say it is not a bug, you never said it was, i have misunderstood
 etc.
 now you are saying:
 
 >we discussed about error(s) in xv 2.21 which shows images only as 8bit,
 
 if you would make up your mind what you are claiming it would make the
 discussion a *lot* easier.

 eh? sorry, i don't understand what you are saying here. i am aware that english is
 not your native language and have tried hard to fathom your meaning, but this
 paragraph defeats me.

 yes *as i originally said*, global changes are easily possible.
 
 but this statement contradicts what you said earlier:

 >>>process we have to make the modifications to the 24bit image.

 no i don't think so actually. 
 
 you were talking about loading a 24 bit image into xv (by quantising),
 manipulating the colours in the colour editor, then somewhow applying these
 changes to the 24 bit file when you exit xv. xv lets you edit individual
 colours. where is this sudden jumping off the topic?

 yes i am aware there is no colourmap in a 24 bit file!!

 i do not understand what this statement is supposed to mean.

 ???
 what are you saying
 ???

 ah! now we see thew problem! first you want to extend xv to allow editing of 8
 bit previews of 24 bit images. then i point out problems with this. now you are
 saying there is no problem because you, personally, happen not to use those
 parts of the program that cause the problem!!

 not sure what you are saying here. certainly one can make local changes.

 yes that is one possible approach. i would find a program that took such an
 approach clumsy, however.

 well here we agree - you have not thought it through very much. you don't seem
 to have a consistent point to make and contradict yourself from one post to the
 next. ok, we all have off days - perhaps you should step back and think this one
 through.
 
 >>yes again. what *is* (was?) wrong with xv?

 as i said in the last post, jpeg is a compression algorithm. it is a way of
 saving disk space by trading off quality against compression. i fail to see what
 the problem is. you have not proposed any workable alternatives.
 
 >also, human expect that 24bit will be saved as 24bit image; 
 
 speak for yourself. you are the *only* person i have met or spoken to who,
 having quantised a 24 bit image down to 8 bits, expects this process to somehow
 reverse when the file is saved; keeping all modificvations that heve been made
 to the 8 bit image palette.
 
 perhaps that is why you yused the singular?
 
 >say,
 >person would like to crop part of the image and save it, then it is
 >expected that the image still is the same. 
 
 look, next time you import a 24 bit image into xv look carefully at the main
 control panel - it tells you how many colours have been allocated to the 8 bit
 image. xv makes it abundantly clear that you are not editing the original 24 bit
 file. you are the *only* person who claims this is confusing.
 
 >so, xv were designed

 is a design error the same as a bug? ;-)
 
 read my lips. xv is a program for viewing and modifying 8 bit images. it lets
 you import other images. it shows, i would say, a good deal of thought about the
 human interface. and everyone else seems to use it happily for the purpose it
 was designed for. it makes no false claims.
 
 >i have heard xv were designed first for 8bit images/files, but
 >it were not good idea to take full 24bit images without making
 >major change to the original design.
 
 if you would come up with a solid, logical, well argued and lucid description of
 precisely how these proposed extensions would work, feel free to post them. so 
 far, you have not done so.
 
 >so, even all screen images are 8bit, the processed images and saved
 >images could have been 24bit very easily, instead of 8bit.
 
 argh!! after all this, a comment like that. `very easily'. ok, go ahead and code it
 if it is so easy.
 
 or alternatively, look up the terms `import' and 'non-reversible transformation'.

 i think this is a bit of an exageration.
 
 what you are actually saying is, you got into a lift (elevator, if you are in
 the states ;-) ) and mistakenly pressed the down button to go up. everyone else
 had no problem. now you are trying to sue the manufacturer...

 mostly. leaving aside the language issue however, it betrays some very wooly
 thinking (as you yourself admit) which is the same in any language. go think
 some more.
