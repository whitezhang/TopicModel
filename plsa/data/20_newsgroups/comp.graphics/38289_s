 i'm looking for a database called "micro world data bank ii", a database
 with digital map information containing 178,068 latitude, longitude points.
 it is said to be in the public domain. if anyone knows a place where i can
 get it (preferably ftp/gopher/mailserver etc.; otherwise snail mail) please
 let me know. i you have it yourself and are willing to send me the file,
 drop me a line.
 
 i'll be using it with a program called versamap by charles h. culberson.
 if anyone knows of another detailed database that can be used with this
 program (preferably pd), i would be very interested.
 
 replies by e-mail please, directly to me, i don't read this group regularly.
 if there's interest i'll post a summary, of course.
