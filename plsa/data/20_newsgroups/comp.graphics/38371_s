 i think he wanted to avoid reinventing the wheel.
 i would suggest that you take your code, and submit it to
 comp.sys.mac.binaries to be distributed (including to the ftp sites). 
 many folks, myself included, would enjoy the extra code.

 just to clarify, the 3d routines that are mentioned in various places
 on the mac are in a libray, not the rom of the mac.  a few years ago before
 i knew anything about implementing graphics, i came across a demo of the
 apple grafsys3d library and it actually did a lot.  however, it is quite
 limited in the sense that it's a low-level 3d library; your code still has
 to plot individual points, draw each line, etc ad nauseum.  it has nothing
 on gl, for example, where you can handle objects.
 
 other things to consider when talking about apple's old 3d grafsys library:
 
 * unsupported;  never was and no plans exist to do so in the future
 
 * undocumented; unless you call header files documentation...
 
 if one knows something about graphics, you could probably figure it out,
 but i'd assume there's better software available that gives better
 output and is, at the same time, programmatically nicer (i.e. easier to
 program).
 
 just my 2% tax
