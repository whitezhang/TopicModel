 finding the circumcenter of a tetrahedron is discussed on page 33 in
 
 contouring: a guide to the analysis and display of spatial data,
 by dave watson, pergamon press,  1992, isbn 0 08 040286 0, 321p.
 
 each pair of tetrahedral vertices define a plane which is a 
 perpendicular bisector of the line between that pair.  express each
 plane in the form ax + by + cz = d
 and solve the set of simultaneous equations from any three of those
 planes that have a vertex in common (all vertices are used).  
 the solution is the circumcenter.
