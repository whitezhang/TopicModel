 
 	i got the univesa driver available over the net. i thought that finally
 my 1-meg oak board would be able to show 680x1024 256 colors. unfortunately a
 program still says that i can't do this. is it the fault of the program (fractint)
 or is there something wrong with my card.
 	univesa- a free driver available over the net that makes many boards
 vesa compatible.
