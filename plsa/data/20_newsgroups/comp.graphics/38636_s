 [ read on and there's a special prize at the bottom.  amaze your friends
 and gain respect from your peers that you can carry on so long about the
 number 42. ]
 
 the original question was "what is the meaning of life, the universe, and
 and everything."  the answer generated by deep thought (the 2nd largest
 computer ever created) was 42.  deep thought realized that to understand
 the answer, one must really know what the question is.  unfortunately, he
 didn't.  but he was able to help build the largest computer (named earth)
 which could figure out the real question.  (i know this is background
 knowledge for everyone here... just bear with me a sec... :)
 
 when arthur pulled the scrabble tiles out of the bag, he spelled out
 "what is nine times six?" (or the like).  however, it is not clear that
 the monkey-man had the right question in his brain, especially since it
 was that lady in the diner (which was vaporized moments later) that came
 up with the answer to how everyone could get along.  on the other hand,
 marvin said he saw the answer in dent's brain, so lets presume it's 
 correct.
 
 well, nine times six ***is*** forty-two!!!  ...in base 13.
 
 chew on that for awhile... :)
