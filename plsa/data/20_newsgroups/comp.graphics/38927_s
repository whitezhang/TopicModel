                       genoa presents high performance 
                         video graphics accelerator
 
         san jose, calif usa -- genoa systems corporation announces 
 windowsvga 24,  a true color 24-bit graphics accelerator card that 
 delivers up to 16.8 million colors at speeds faster than the 
 competition.  plus it offers a full range of resolutions, high 
 refresh rates as well as unique proprietary performance features.  
 the card is available in both 16-bit isa bus and 32-bit vesa local 
 bus versions (models 8500 and 8500vl).
         with 1mb dram on board, the windowsvga 24 card offers 
 maximum resolution up to 1,280 x 1,024 and supports a refresh rate 
 of 72hz at 800 x 600 and resolution up to 1,024 x 768 
 non-interlaced. both models provide performance many times greater 
 than standard svga boards, yet conform to all current video 
 standards.
         windowsvga 24 features genoa's flickerfree(tm) technology, 
 which eliminates screen flash and flicker to make viewing much more 
 comfortable.  the cards also come with safescan(tm), a utility 
 developed by genoa to eliminate the black border around the screen 
 and thereby provide 100-percent screen use for overscanning monitors.
         windowsvga model 8500vl takes full advantage of the speed 
 offered by the new vesa local bus technology.  most vl bus cards 
 will only handle data transfers up to 33mhz, but the 8500vl will 
 transfer data at the full speed of the cpu, up to 50mhz.  genoa is 
 also offering this card in the "turbobahn" combination packaged 
 with their turboexpress 486vl motherboard.
         built around the cirrus logic gd-5426 gui accelerator, 
 windowsvga 24 offers the user an exceptional price/performance 
 value.  genoa's advanced proprietary drivers act to "turbocharge" 
 the chip, thereby providing an affordable accelerator card with 
 power and performance that surpass many of the more highly priced 
 chip cards.  the genoa user will enjoy optimal speed and 
 reliability for such programs as windows, autocad, autoshade, 3d 
 studio, os/2, orcad and more.  driver updates and product bulletins 
 are available on genoa's bbs at (408) 943-1231.
         genoa systems manufactures and markets an extensive line of 
 graphics adapters, motherboards, audio and multimedia cards for 
 ibm-compatible personal computers.  all products come with a two 
 year limited warranty on parts and labor.  genoa products are 
 currently distributed worldwide through authorized distributors, 
 resellers, vars and systems integrators.
