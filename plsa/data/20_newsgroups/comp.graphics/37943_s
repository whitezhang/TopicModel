 some rendering programs require that all surface normals point in the same
 direction.  (ie: on a closed cube, all normals point outwards).  you can use
 the points on the faces to determine the direction of the normal, by making
 sure that all points are either in clockwise or counter-clockwise order.
 
 how do you go about orienting all normals in the same direction, given a 
 set of points, edges and faces?   say that you had a cube with all faces that 
 have their normals facing outwards, except for one face.  what's the
 best way to realize that face is "flipped", and should have it's points
 re-ordered?   i thought i had a good way of telling this, but then realized
 that the algorithm i had would only tell you if you had points in clockwise
 order for a 2d polygon.  i'd like something for 3d data.
 
 any hints, tips, references would be appreciated.
