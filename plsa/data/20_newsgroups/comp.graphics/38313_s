 boy, this will be embarassing if it is trivial or an faq:
 
 given 4 points (non coplanar), how does one find the sphere, that is,
 center and radius, exactly fitting those points?  i know how to do it
 for a circle (from 3 points), but do not immediately see a 
 straightforward way to do it in 3-d.  i have checked some
 geometry books, graphics gems, and farin, but am still at a loss?
 please have mercy on me and provide the solution?  
 
 thanks,
 ed
