 	yes, that's known as "bresenhams run length slice algorithm for
 incremental lines". see fundamental algorithms for computer graphics,
 springer-verlag, berlin heidelberg 1985.

 	hmm. i don't think i can help you with this, but you might
 take a look at the following:
 
 	"double-step incremental generation of lines and circles",
 x. wu and j. g. rokne, computer graphics and image processing,
 vol 37, no. 4, mar. 1987, pp. 331-334
 
 	"double-step generation of ellipses", x. wu and j. g. rokne,
 ieee computer graphics & applications, may 1989, pp. 56-69
