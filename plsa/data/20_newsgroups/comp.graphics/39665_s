 i currently have some grayscale image files that are not in any
 standard format.  they simply contain the 8-bit pixel values.  i would
 like to display these images on a pc.  the conversion to a gif format
 would be helpful.  this conversion can take place either on a pc
 or on a unix system and i could then download it to the pc.
 can anyone suggest where i can find software to do this?  alternatively, i
 may have to write my own conversion program.  in this case, could someone
 tell me where i can find the gif format specification?
 
 please e-mail me directly at: shayla@shannon.jpl.nasa.gov
 
 thanks.
