 it is used to create a tin (triangulated irregular network), which is
 basically a bunch of triangles which form a surface over a group of
 points.  what is special about it is that the triangles formed are the 
 most equalateral possible.  check out "proceedings of autocarto n" where
 n is 8..10.  sorry, i don't have a specific reference describing the
 process.
