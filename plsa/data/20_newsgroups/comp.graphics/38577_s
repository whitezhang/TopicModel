 what is otis?
 
 otis is here for the purpose of distributing original artwork
 and photographs over the network for public perusal, scrutiny,    
 and distribution.  digital immortality.
 
 the basic idea behind "digital immortality" is that computer networks   
 are here to stay and that anything interesting you deposit on them
 will be around near-forever.  the gifs and jpgs of today will be the
 artifacts of a digital future.  perhaps they'll be put in different
 formats, perhaps only surviving on backup tapes....but they'll be
 there...and someone will dig them up.  
  
 if that doesn't interest you... otis also offers a forum for critique
 and exhibition of your works....a virtual art gallery that never closes
 and exists in an information dimension where your submissions will hang
 as wallpaper on thousands of glowing monitors.  suddenly, life is 
 breathed into your work...and by merit of it's stimulus, it will 
 travel the globe on pulses of light and electrons.
  
 spectators are welcome also, feel free to browse the gallery and 
 let the artists know what you think of their efforts.  keep your own
 copies of the images to look at when you've got the gumption...
 that's what they're here for.

 where?             
 
 otis currently (as of 4/21/93) has two ftp sites.  
  
  	141.214.4.135 (projects/otis), the uwi site
 		
 	sunsite.unc.edu (/pub/multimedia/pictures/otis), the sunsite 
 	(you can also gopher to this site for otis as well)
 
 merely "anonymous ftp" to either site on internet and change to the
 appropriate directory.  don't forget to get busy and use the "bin"
 command to make sure you're in binary.
 
 otis has also been spreading to some dial-up bbs systems around north
 america....the following systems have a substancial supply of
 otistuff...
 	underground cafe (omaha) (402.339.0179) 2 lines
 	cyberden (sanfran?) (415.472.5527)  usenet waffle-iron
 
 --------------------------------------------------------------
  
 how do you contribute?
               
 what happens is...you draw a pretty picture or take a lovely   
 photo, get it scanned into an image file, then either ftp-put
 it in the contrib/incoming directory or use uuencode to send it to me
 (email addresses at eof) in email.  after the image is received,
 it will be put into the correct directory.  computer originated works
 are also welcome.
 
 otis' directories house two types of image files, gif and jpg.  
 gif and jpg files require, oddly enough, a gif or jpg viewer to 
 see.  these viewers are available for all types of computers at 
 most large ftp sites around internet.  jpg viewers are a bit
 tougher to find.  if you can't find one, but do have a gif viewer,  
 you can obtain a jpg-to-gif conversion program which will change    
 jpg files to a standard gif format. 
 
 otis also accepts animation files.      
 
 when you submit image files, please send me email at the same time
 stating information about what you uploaded and whether it is to be
 used (in publications or other projects) or if it is merely for people
 to view.  also, include some biographical information on yourself, we'll
 be having info-files on each contributing artist and their works.  you 
 can also just upload a text-file of info about yourself (instead of 
 emailing).
 
 if you have pictures, but no scanner, there is hope.  merely send
 copies to:
 
 the otis project
 c/o ed stastny
 po bx 241113
 omaha, ne 68124-1113
 
 i will either scan them myself or get them to someone who will  
 scan them.  include an ample sase if you want your stuff back.  
 also include information on each image, preferably a 1-3 line 
 description of the image that we can include in the infofile in the
 directory where it's finally put.  if you have preferences as to what
 the images are to be named, include those as well.  
  
 conversely, if you have a scanner and would like to help out, please
 contact me and we'll arrange things.
 
 if you want to submit your works by disk, peachy.  merely send a 3.5"
 disk to the above address (omaha) and a sase if you want your disk back.
 this is good for people who don't have direct access to encoders or ftp,
 but do have access to a scanner.  we accept disks in either mac or ibm
 compatible format.  if possible, please submit image files as gif or
 jpg.  if you can't...we can convert from most formats...we'd just rather
 not have to.
 
 at senders request, we can also fill disks with as much otis as they
 can stand.  even if you don't have stuff to contribute, you can send
 a blank disk and an sase (or $2.50 for disk, postage and packing) to 
 get a slab-o-otis.
 
 as of 04/21/93, we're at about 18 megabytes of files, and growing.  
 email me for current archive size and directory.
 
 --------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 distribution?
 
 the images distributed by the otis project may be distributed freely   
 on the condition that the original filename is kept and that it is
 not altered in any way (save to convert from one image format to
 another).  in fact, we encourage files to be distributed to local 
 bulletin boards and such.  if you could, please transport the
 appropriate text files along with the images.  
  
 it would also be nice if you'd send me a note when you did post images
 from otis to your local bbs.  i just want to keep track of them so
 participants can have some idea how widespread their stuff is.
 
 it's the purpose of otis to get these images spread out as much as
 possible.  if you have the time, please upload a few to your favorite
 bbs system....or even just post this "info-file" there.  it would be
 keen of you.
 
 --------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 use?
 
 if you want to use any of the works you find on the otis directory,
 you'll have to check to see if permission has been granted and the 
 stipulations of the permission (such as free copy of publication, or
 full address credit).  you will either find this in the ".rm" file for    
 the image or series of images...or in the "artists" directory under the 
 artists name.  if permission isn't explicitly given, then you'll have 
 to contact the artist to ask for it.  if no info is available, email
 me (ed@cwis.unomaha.edu), and i'll get in contact with the artist for 
 you, or give you their contact information.
  
 when you do use permitted work, it's always courteous to let the artist
 know about it, perhaps even send them a free copy or some such
 compensation for their files.
 
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 naming images?
 
 please keep the names of your files in "dos" format.  that means, keep
 the filename (before .jpg or .gif) to eight characters or less.  the way
 i usually do it is to use the initials of the artist, plus a three or
 four digit "code" for the series of images, plus the series number.
 thus, leonardo devinci's fifth mechanical drawing would be something
 like:
  
 	ldmek5.gif     or    ldmek5.jpg    or    ldmech5.gif   etc
 
 keeping the names under 8 characters assures that the filename will
 remain intact on all systems.  
 
 
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
 creating image files?
 
 when creating image files, be sure to at least include your name
 somewhere on or below the picture.  this gives people a reference in
 case they'd like to contact you.  you may also want to include a title,
 address or other information you'd like people to know.
 
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 hmmm?!
 
 that's about it for now.  more "guidelines" will be added as needed.
 your input is expected.

 disclaimer:  the otis project has no connection to the church of otis  
  	     (a sumerian deity) or it's followers, be they pope, priest,
 	     or ezine administrator.  we do take sacrifices and donations
 	     however.
 
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 disclaimer:  the otis project is here for the distribution of original 
  	     image files.  the files will go to the public at large.  
 	     it's possible, as with any form of mass-media, that someone
 	     could unscrupulously use your images for financial gain.  
     	     unless you've given permission for that, it's illegal.  otis
 	     takes no responsibility for this.  in simple terms, all rights
 	     revert to the author/artist.  to leave an image on otis is to 
 	     give permission for it to be viewed, copied and distributed 
 	     electronically.  if you don't want your images distributed     
 	     all-over, don't upload them.  to leave an image on otis is
 	     not giving permission to have it used in any publication or
 	     broadcast that incurs profit (this includes, but is not 
 	     limited to, magazines, newsletters, clip-art software,        
 	     screen-printed clothing, etc).  you must give specific
 	     permission for this sort of usage.  
 
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 remember, the operative term is "stimulate".  if you know of people
 that'd be interested in this sort of thing...get them involved...kick'm
 in the booty....offer them free food...whatever...
