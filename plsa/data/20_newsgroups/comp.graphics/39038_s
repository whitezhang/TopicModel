 "advanced visual systems will present this technical seminar on
 avs, the world's leading visualization software package.  avs is
 a point and click, module driven, easy-to-use product that
 produces full color, two or three dimensional rendered scenes for
 interactive observation.  it is supported on all current unix
 risc platforms from sun, sgi, ibm, h-p, dg, and dec.  it also
 runs under dec vms.
 
 "avs is in its fourth year on the street and is very mature.  all
 fields of science, engineering, medicine, and even business
 applications now use avs.  this seminar will focus on its many
 features in technical detail during a half hour slide
 presentation.  following a question period there will be a live
 demonstration using a sun sparcstation.  in addition, a new avs
 program called campus will be introduced at this meeting.
 
 "also discussed will be the international avs center, which
 provides an on-line repository of over 1000 graphics modules at
 the north carolina supercomputer center in raliegh, nc.  avs has
 imbedded tools to write one's own customized modules should these
 not be available with avs or from avs international."
