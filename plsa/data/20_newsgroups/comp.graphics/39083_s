 i think the main reason is that in the good old hacker days of the young(er)
 gates' and jobs' of the world, the computer was not as widespread a
 phenomenom as it is now.  with the increased popularity of the pc
 come a plethora of mundane business uses which required more practical
 minded and narrower-focused programmers.
 
 why be a hacker when you can get a good job programming databases or
 programs for accountants?  basically, the yuppies caught up and
 disciplined the hackers, and molded them in their own image.
