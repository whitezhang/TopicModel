 hi,
 it might be nice to know, what's possible on different hard ware platforms.
 but usually the hard ware is fixed ( in my case either unix or dos- pc ).
 so i'm not much interested in amiga news. 
 
 in the case of software, i won't get any comercial software mentioned in this
 newgroup to run on a unix- platform, so i'm not interested in this information.
 
 i would suggest to split the group. i don't see the problem of cross-posting.
 then you need to read just 2 newgroups with half the size. 
 
 but what would be more important is to have a faq. this would reduce the
 traffic a lot.
 
 sincerely, gerhard
