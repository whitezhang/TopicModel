 that's a typical claim, though they say they've improved
 compression speed considerably.  did you find out anything else
 about the book?  i'd be interested in looking at it if you could give me
 any pointers.
 
 reportedly, early fractal compression times of 24-100 hours used
 that marvelous piece of hardware called "grad students" to do the
 work.  supposedly it's been automated since about 1988, but i'm still
 waiting to be impressed.
