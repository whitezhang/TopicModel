 yeah, corel draw and wordperfect presentations pretty limited here, too.
 	since there's no (not really) such thing as a decent raster to
 vector conversion program, this "tracing" technique is about it.  simple
 stuff, like b&w logos, etc. do pretty well, while more complicated stuff
 goes haywire.  i suspect (even though i don't write code) that a good
 bitmapped to vector conversion program would probably be as big as most
 of these application softwares we're using -- but even so, how come one
 hasn't been written? (to my knowledge).  i mean, even hijaak, one of the
 commercial industry standards of file conversion, hasn't attempted it yet.
