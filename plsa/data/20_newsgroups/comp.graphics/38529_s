 (1) no explicit (c) is necessary.  if it the image is attributed to the
 geosphere company, then there is a likelihood permission is has been
 given to reprint.
 
 (2) unlikely that the owner can or will go after individuals.
 however, "interesting" images do make their way into ads and
 computer demos. that is when a pirate might get some flak.
 this image is considered so "interesting" that many people would
 like to use it whenever some global map is needed, so there
 is lots of temptation.
 
 (3) one mail person said since the source data- satellite imagery-
 is not copyrighted, then the derived image can't be.  not true.
 a new, distinctive, creative expression of the data can be protected.
 this image is certainly fits such, since no one else has taken the
 tremendous effort to re-create it themselves.  precedent is a recent
 telephone book court case.  ma bell tried to copyright the data in
 their books and prevent competitors from copying it (there are
 trick entries in the book).  but the court only permitted copyright
 of the expression of the data, and not the data themselves. (you cant
 xerox and sell the telephone book.)
 
 (4) there will be more attention to digital copyrights in the future
 and computer becomes a mass product and moguls such as bill gates
 are currently hoarding the digital copyrights.
 
 (5) i'd prefer that geosphere put this data in the public domain because
 it is very interesting to me and others, but that's the way things are.
