    at this moment the king, who had been for some time busily writing in
 his note-book, called out "silence!" and read out from his book
 "rule forty-two. all persons more than a mile high to leave the court."
    everybody looked at alice.
    "i'm not a mile high," said alice.
    "you are," said the king.
    "nearly two miles high," added the queen.
    "well, i sha'n't go, at any rate," said alice; "besides, that's not
 a regular rule: you invented it just now."
    "it's the oldest rule in the book," said the king.
    "then it ought to be number one," said alice.
