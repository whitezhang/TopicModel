 a word of warning for those of you registering for siggraph '93.
 i just received my registration form back in the mail with the
 envelope marked "return to sender. moved - left no address.
 closed po box". the address i used to register for siggraph '93
 is the one printed on the registration form:
 
      acm siggraph '93
      po box 95316,
      chicago, il 60694-5316
 
 i printed the envelope in my best printing, honest but evidently
 siggraph '93 has skipped town or moved?
 
 i ended up faxing my registration to: 312-321-6876. i hope that
 number is real!
