 i am a mac-user when it comes to graphics (that's what i own software and hardware for) and
 i've recently come across a large number of tttddd format modeling databases.  is there any
 software, mac or unix, for translating those to something i could use, like dxf?  please
 reply via email.
 
 thanx.
