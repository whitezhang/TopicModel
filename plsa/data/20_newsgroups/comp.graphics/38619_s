 hello,
 
 can anybody help me with the conversion of pic format files
 to hpgl files. the question is as follows:
 
 is it possible to convert files that have been generated in the
 pic preprocessor format into hpgl format, suitable for sending
 to a plotter. the hardware involved is ibm risc/6000 running aix
 3.2.3. how should this be done and what software is involved,
 where is it available, what does it cost, what are the problems?
 
 regards,
 
 dani
