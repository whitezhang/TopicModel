 i am looking for a shareware graphics package called neopaint v1.1.  i 
 saw it in a shareware catalog and was hoping that i could ftp it from 
 the net but have been unable to locate it.  i have tried archie and i 
 have gone through the entire comp.graphics newsgroup looking for some 
 reference to it and have found none.  i have  also looked through the 
 faq and also no reference.  the program is called neopaint v1.1 and if 
 anyone has heard of it or knows where i can get it i would appreciate 
 it.
 
 suggestions for other pc based shareware paint programs would also be 
 appreciated. email me your responses.
 
 much thanks,
 sean
