     the gl2p1.lzh stuff under gfx/show on the aminet sites includes a
     utility called pic2hl, that is a filter for hamlab that can handle
     the most commonly used kinds of .pic and .clp files.
 
     the biggest problem is that the .clp files don't usually contain a
     palette, so you need to convert a .pic with the right palette
     first (which creates a "ram:picpal" file), and then convert the
     .clp files.
