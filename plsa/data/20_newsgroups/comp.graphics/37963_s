 hello, i realize that this might be a faq but i have to ask since i don't get a
 change to read this newsgroup very often.  anyways for my senior project i need
 to convert an autocad file to a tiff file.  please i don't need anyone telling
 me that the autocad file is a vector file and the tiff is a bit map since i
 have heard that about 100 times already i would just like to know if anyone
 knows how to do this or at least point me to the right direction.
 
 any help greatly appreciated,
 matt georgy
