 i am looking for a package which takes as inputs a set
 of geometric objects defined by unions of convex polytopes
 specified in some manner, say by inequalities and equalities,
 and determines in some reasonable form things like
 intersections, unions, etc. etc..
 
 does anyone know where i can find such a thing?
