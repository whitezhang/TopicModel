 
 okay, i got enough replies about the kubota kenai/denali systems that i
 will post a summary of their capabilities.  i haven't actually used one
 or seen one, so take the specs with a grain of salt.  i'd like to see
 an independent review of one against, say, an sgi indigo extreme or
 something.
 
 basically, the kenai workstations are dec alpha axp based workstations that
 run osf/1 ( dec's ) and will likely run windows nt in the future.  they are
 binary compatible with digital's osf/1 alpha axp implementation.  denali
 is their graphics subsystem, which is upgradable in the field by
 simply adding "transformation engines".
 
 the two main kenai machines are the 3400 imaging and 3d graphics workstation
 and the 3500 imaging and 3d graphics workstation.

 both have libraries for xlib, motif, mit pexlib, dec-pexlib dec-phigs, and gl
 
 okay, now the real stuff.  the kenai stations work with a graphics architecture
 known as denali.  the denali comes in three models, the e, p, and v.  they
 use a decchip 21064 superscalar risc processor at 150mhz.  their
 capabilities are as follows:
 
 			e		p		v

 as you can see, these are pretty powerful workstations, and the best part
 is the pricing.  i would recommend that you call kubota for more information.
 their number is 408-727-8100.  i'm sure they'll send you an information you
 may want.  oh, some prices:
 
 low-end
 
 kenai 3400, e series w/ 1 tem and 5 fbm --- 27,795 dollars u.s.
 kenai 3500, e series w/ 1 tem and 5 fbm --- 45,345 dollars u.s.
 
 high-end
 
 kenai 3400, v series w/ 6 tem and 20 fbm -- 61,795 dollars u.s.
 kenai 3500, v series w/ 6 tem and 20 fbm -- 79,345 dollars u.s.
 
 if someone could post a relative comparision with an indigo extreme or
 something i would appreciate it.
 
 hope this helps someone out there,
 
 brian
 
 ps i am not affiliated with kubota in any way.  hell, i thought they made
 tractors or something. :-)
