 hi,
 
 well i have opened up a ftp site for getting the latest software drivers
 for genoa graphics cards.
 
 here is how to access it:
 
 ftp 192.109.42.11
 login:ftp
 password:ftp
 cd pub/genoa
 ls -l
 binary
 prompt
 hash
 
 (now if you wanna have the latest drivers for the 7900 board)
 
 cd 7000series
 mget *
 
 quit
 
 this is the sequence to get the drivers.
 
 if you have any further question, please email me.
 
 best regards, stefan hartmann
