 ok, never heard of cross filters, but roberts, prewitt and sobel filters
 are standard spatial masks for edge detection.  highpass filtering does a
 good job of detecting edges, too.  a good reference for all sorts of general
 digital image processing is the book _digital image processing_ by
 rafael c. gonzalez and richard e. woods.  addison-wesley publishing co. 1992.

 i've used this source to do the above filters and many other things as a
 grad project.  not too dificult to do.  the worst part is loading in the
 images from tiff/gif/iff-ilbm/whatever!  :)
