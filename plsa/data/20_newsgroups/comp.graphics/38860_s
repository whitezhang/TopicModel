 well for starters, why use rle files?  you might have a specific program that
 needs them, ok, but i tend to convert straight to jpeg format, thus a 2.4meg
 24bit targa file becomes a ~80k or less 24bit jpeg.
 
 the latest versions of xv (2.2.1 ?) and xloadimage (3.03) both handle jpeg files.
 and the best way to convert to jpeg is with the c/djpeg suit.  even at 90%
 quality (you can't see the difference) the jpeg is way smaller than anything
 else even an 8bit gif!
