 i think you are too optimistic! postscript is a very big language and
 so the fig format can not be able to be an interpreter of any arbitrary
 ps code. the only program i know to manipulate postscript files is
 islanddraw.
 i for myself use xfig and include the postscript files (converted to
 epsi format). small changes then are possible (erasing some letters,
 adding text and so on).
