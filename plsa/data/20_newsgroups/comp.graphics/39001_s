 no, mis folks have infinite budgets of death, and they also get parts
 of their budget allocated "upgrades", "maintenance", and "new purchases",
 and a lot of ibm mainframe purchases are actually "leases" and so
 is the software.
 
 basically, the engineers who have tight budgets, i.e. the coders and
 designers of a company, bitch and moan when they drop 15,000 on a 
 sparc 1 only to see a faster machine appear a year later.  mis types
 upgrade once every 5-10 years, and their costs are amortized and
 depreciated over a longer period, and the budget office justifies
 the expense because they actually use the machines for accounting,
 payroll, etc.
 
 now, if the budget office was dependant on the engineers for some
 reason like payroll and accounts, you'd sure as hell see every
 engineer with a new cray on his desktop every year. :-)
