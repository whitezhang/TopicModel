 i am setting up a video-aid for a computer room for the teacher to share his
 display with the class.
 
 i have seen people using video projector, tv sets and large monitor to do
 presentations before. i am told that there are three ways to connect video
 projector: composite, y/c & rgb.
 
 can anyone explain to me the difference and their likely costs?
 
 please reply to my inetnet e-mail account as well as posting in bulletin:

 i also like to know if there are telnet or kermit for windows.
