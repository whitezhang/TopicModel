 point your gopher client at merlot.welch.jhu.edu
 
 and select the following directories:
 
  -->  13. search and retrieve software/
 
    -->  8.  search and retrieve graphics software and data/
 
 
 and you'll see -
 
 
 
 
  -->  1.  graphics online bibliography (acm siggraph)/
       2.  graphics software and data archives (ftp sites)/
       3.  search all graphics information <?>
       4.  search comp.graphics faq <?>
       5.  search graphics resources (software and data) <?>
       6.  search pictures utilities faq <?>
 
 
           1.  graphics online bibliography (acm siggraph)/
 
               searches and archives of bibliographic database that covers
               graphics literature for over a hundred years (served
               by a gopher hole in austria).
 
 
           2.  graphics software and data archives (ftp sites)/ 
 
               has links to over 70 sites around the world which
               have software and/or data for computer graphics.
               this can be used on its own or as a companion to the
               searches found in this directory which will point you
               toward software and data at various places.  
               
 
           3.  search all graphics information <?>
           4.  search comp.graphics faq <?>
           5.  search graphics resources (software and data) <?>
           6.  search pictures utilities faq <?>
            
 
               these searches contain a wealth of information about
               computer graphics, data, software, techniques etc...
 
               3.  search all graphics information <?> 
 
                   will simply search all of the information contained
                   in searches 4, 5, and 6.
 
               4.  search comp.graphics faq <?>
 
                   lets you search the faq (frequently asked questions)
                   from the comp.graphics newsgroup compiled by john
                   grieggs at the jpl.
 
               5.  search graphics resources (software and data) <?>
 
                   lets you search the grpahics resource listing of
                   software and data provided by nick fotis at the
                   national technical univ. of athens.
 
               6.  search pictures utilities faq <?>
 
                   lets you search the faq (frequently asked questions)
                   from the alt.binaries.pixutils newsgroup compiled by
                   jim howard at cadence.
 
 
 select:
 
  -->  3.  search all graphics information <?>
 
 and search for:
 
 usgs
 
 
 and you'll find out some information about usgs data availability.
 
 now select:
 
    -->  2.  graphics software and data archives (ftp sites)/
 
 and you might find the following interesting:
 
    -->  12. cartographic data - usgs data (xerox)/
 
    -->  42. mapgen/plotgen and more (usgs)/
 
    -->  68. usgs weekly seismicity reports (including maps - gif)/
 
    -->  68. usgs earth science data directory/
              (this actually is a database of available data - search
               it for terrain - could prove quite useful.)
 
 one other place to look is only available by anonymous ftp at
 the moment - 
 
 us geological survey maps  -  isdres.er.usgs.gov (130.11.48.2).
 
 
 if you've never heard of gopher don't worry it's free and on the net,
 write me a note if you'd like information on how to get started.
 
 
 best of luck,
