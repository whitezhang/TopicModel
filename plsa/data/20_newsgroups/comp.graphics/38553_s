 
 i am working on a program to display 3d wireframe models with the user
 being able to arbitrarily change any of the viewing parameters.  also,
 the wireframe objects are also going to have dynamic attributes so
 that they can move around while the user is "exploring" the wireframe
 world.
 
 to do this, i am thinking of using the srgp package described in the
 van dam, foley and feiner book, but i was wondering if there was
 another pd graphics package out there which was faster.  i would like
 to make the program as fast as possible so that it provides
 satisfactory real time performance on a sun ipx.
 
 ideally, i'm looking for a pd graphics package which will allow me to
 open a new window under x, and allow me to draw lines within the
 window.  also, it would also need to have some sort of event driven
 interaction handling since the user is going to move around the
 wireframe models using the keyboard.
 
 if you know or wrote such a package, i would be grateful if you could
 direct me to a ftp site which contains the package.
 
 thank you.
