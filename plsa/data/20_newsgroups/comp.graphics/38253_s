 -> my cross - platform upgrade (amiga to ibm). they have told me every
 -> week for 3 months, "it will be ready next week". still waiting.......
 
  they've been saying that for two years now, you'd think by now people
 wouldn't go on about it being 'soon' and only believe it when they can
 buy it. i wish amiga users wouldn't be so gullible (gasp, how dare he
 say that!).
