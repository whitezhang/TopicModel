 
 i have posted disp140.zip to alt.binaries.pictures.utilities.
 i will upload this package to simtel20 later.
 
 ******   you may distribute this program freely for non-commercial use
          if no fee is gained.
 ******   there is no warranty. the author is not responsible for any
          damage caused by this program.
 
 important changes since version 1.35:
   added support for iris.
   support mix/concat. two images.
   added support for 'batch conversion'.
   added support for 'load/save palette table'.
   added support for 'edge enhance'.
   added support for 'crop one line'.
   added support for 'negate image'.
   new color quantization option.
   fix some minor bugs.
 
 (1) introduction:
   this program can let you read, write and display images with different
   formats. it also let you do some special effects(rotation, dithering ....)
   on image. its main purpose is to let you convert image among different
   formts.
   include simple file management system.
   support 'slide show'.
 + support 'batch conversion'.
   there is no limit on image size.
   currently this program supports 8, 15, 16, 24 bits display.
   if you want to use hicolor or truecolor, you must have vesa driver.
   if you want to modify video driver, please read section (8).
 
 
 (2) hardware requirement:
   pc 386 or better. msdos 3.3 or higher.
   min amount of ram is 4m bytes(maybe less memory will also work).
   (i recommend min 8m bytes for better performance).
   hard disk for swapping(virtual memory).
 
   the following description is borrowed from djgpp.
 
   supported wares:
 
   * up to 128m of extended memory (expanded under vcpi)
   * up to 128m of disk space used for swapping
   * supervga 256-color mode up to 1024x768
   * 80387
   * xms & vdisk memory allocation strategies
   * vcpi programs, such as qemm, desqview, and 386max
 
   unsupported:
 
   * dpmi
   * microsoft windows
 
   features: 80387 emulator, 32-bit unix-ish environment, flat memory
   model, svga graphics.
 
 
 (3) installation:
   video drivers, emu387 and go32.exe are borrowed from djgpp.
   (if you use western digital vga chips, read readme.wd)
   (this go32.exe is a modified version for vesa and is completely compatible
    with original version)
   *** but some people report that this go32.exe is not compatible with
       other djgpp programs in their system. if you encounter this problem,
       don't put go32.exe within search path.
 
   *** please read runme.bat for how to run this program.
 
   if you choose xxxxx.grn as video driver, add 'nc 256' to environment
     go32.
 
   for example, go32=driver x:/xxxxx/xxxxx.grn nc 256
 
   if you don't have 80x87, add 'emu x:/xxxxx/emu387' to environment go32.
 
   for example, go32=driver x:/xxxxx/xxxxx.grd emu x:/xxxxx/emu387
 
   **** notes: 1. i only test tr8900.grn, et4000.grn and vesa.grn.
                  other drivers are not tested.
               2. i have modified et4000.grn to support 8, 15, 16, 24 bits
                  display. you don't need to use vesa driver.
                  if et4000.grn doesn't work, please try vesa.grn.
               3. for those who want to use hicolor or truecolor display,
                  please use vesa.grn(except et4000 users).
                  you can find vesa bios driver from :
                    wuarchive.wustl.edu: /mirrors/msdos/graphics
                    godzilla.cgl.rmit.oz.au: /kjb/mgl

 (7) detail:
 
    initialization:
       set default display type to highest display type.
       find allowable screen resolution(for .grn video driver only).
 
    1. when you run this program, you will enter 'read' menu. whthin this
       menu you can press any function key. if you move or copy
       files, you will enter 'write' menu. the 'write' menu is much like
       'read' menu, but only allow you to change directory.
       the header line in 'read' menu includes "(d:xx,f:xx,t:xx)".
         d : display type. f: number of files. t: number of tagged files.
       pressing space in 'read' menu will let you select which format to use
         for reading current file.
       pressing return in 'read' menu will let you reading current file. this
         program will automatically determine which format this file is.
         the procedure is: first, check magic number. if fail, check
         standard extension. still fail, report error.
       pressing s or s in 'read' menu will do 'slide show'.
         if delay time is 0, program will wait until you hit a key
           (except escape).
         if any error occurs, program will make a beep.
 +       'w' or 'w' to pause, any key to continue.
         escape to terminate.
       pressing ins in 'read' menu will change display type.
       pressing alt-x in 'read' menu will quit program without prompting.
 +     pressing f5 will turn on 'effect' menu.
 
    2. once image file is successfully read, you will enter 'screen' menu.
       you can do special effect on image.
       pressing return: show image.
         in graphic mode, press return, space or escape to return to text
         mode.
       pressing tab: change processing target. this program allows you to do
         special effects on 8-bit or 24-bit image.
       pressing left,right arrow: change display type. 8, 15, 16, 24 bits.
       pressing space: save current image to file.
         b/w dither: save as black/white image(1 bit).
         grey scale: save as grey image(8 bits).
         full color: save as color image(8 bits).
         true color: save as 24-bit image.
 
         this program will ask you some questions if you want to write image
         to file. some questions are format-dependent. finally this program
         will prompt you a filename. if you want to save file under another
         directory other than current directory, please press space. after
         pressing space, you will enter 'write2' menu. you can change
         directory to what you want. then,
 
         pressing space: this program will prompt you 'original' filename.
         pressing return: this program will prompt you 'selected' filename
                       (filename under bar).
 
 
   3. this program supports 8, 15, 16, 24 bits display.
 
   4. this program is memory greedy. if you don't have enough memory,
      the performance is poor.
 
   5. if you want to save 8 bits image :
        try gif then tiff(lzw) then targa then sun raster then bmp then ...
 
      if you want to save 24 bits image (lossless):
        try tiff(lzw) or targa or ilbm or sun raster
        (no one is better for true 24bits image)
 
   6. i recommend jpeg for storing 24 bits images, even 8 bits images.
 
   7. not all subroutines are fully tested
 
   8. this document is not well written. if you have any problem, suggestion,
      comment about this program,
      please send to u7711501@bicmos.ee.nctu.edu.tw (140.113.11.13).
      i need your suggestion to improve this program.
      (there is no anonymous ftp on this site)
 
 
 (8) tech. information:
   program (user interface and some subroutines) written by jih-shin ho.
   some subroutines are borrowed from xv(2.21) and pbmplus(dec 91).
   tiff(v3.2) and jpeg(v4) reading/writing are through public domain
     libraries.
   compiled with djgpp.
   you can get whole djgpp package from simtel20 or mirror sites.
     for example, wuarchive.wustl.edu: /mirrors/msdos/djgpp
 
 
 (9) for thoese who want to modify video driver:
    1. get grx source code from simtel20 or mirror sites.
    2. for hicolor and truecolor:
         15 bits : # of colors is set to 32768.
         16 bits : # of colors is set to 0xc010.
         24 bits : # of colors is set to 0xc018.
 
 
 acknowledgment:
   i would like to thank the authors of xv and pbmplus for their permission
     to let me use their subroutines.
   also i will thank the authors who write tiff and jpeg libraries.
   thank dj. without djgpp i can't do any thing on pc.
