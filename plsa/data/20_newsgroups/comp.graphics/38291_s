 when using photoshop is there anyway to get an elliptical dot for the
 halftone screen rather than a round dot ? my printer would prefer an
 elliptical dot, but i'm not sure how to set it up. i'm sending from a mac
 iici to a linotronic l300 imagesetter and i am using photoshop 2.0.1 to
 make my separations.
 
 any help would be greatly appreshed. t.i.a.
