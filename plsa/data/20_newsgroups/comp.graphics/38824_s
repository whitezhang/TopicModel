 well 48 bit colour *could* be for improved resolution but 16 bits per channel
 seems like a bit excessive. i have seen a paper that quoted 10 bits per channel
 of 12 bits for computational precision. more than that would seem to be wasted.
 
 perhaps the frame buffer uses another colourspace which needs more bits to
 represent the full range - rgb is a cube so it is a compact encoding.
 
 most likely however is that there are two separate 24 bit (8 bits per component)
 frame buffers. this set up, called double buffering, allows a complex 3d picture
 to be built up on one buffer while the other buffer (containing the previous
 frame) is displayed. this makes for smoother animation.
 
 >(sadly, i have access to none of them.  just a dec 5000/25.  sigh.)
 
 well hey if you want to brag about numbers, the 5000 range can take a pxg turbo+
 card with 96 bits per pixel. full double buffering (two 24 bit buffers), a 24
 bit z buffer and an extra 24 bit buffer for off screen image storage.
 
 mind you the card costs more than your workstation.
