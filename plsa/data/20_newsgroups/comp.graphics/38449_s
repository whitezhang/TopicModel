 peter,  there's a radiosity package ahead. the only problem is: there 
 are a few miles to sail ... ;-^
 
 let's be serious... i'm working on a radiosity package, written in c++.
 i would like to make it public domain.  i'll announce it in c.g. the minute
 i finished it. 
 
 that were the good news. the bad news: it'll take another 2 months (at least) 
 to finish it. 
 
 in the meantime you may have a look at the file
   radiosity_code.tar.z
 located at
   compute1.cc.ncsu.edu
 
 (there are some other locations; have a look at archie to get the nearest)
 
 hope that'll help.
 
 yours
 
 stephan
