 it is true the convex algorithm is faster than a general concave/multi outline
 algorithm, but not tremendously faster.  i spent awhile implementing and
 optimizing both flavors, and the convex turned out about 10% faster.  this is
 all c (on hp pa-risc the compiler got the inner loop [shooting the span] as
 fast as possible, as far as i could tell).  for any sort of game the database
 to render is known ahead of time, and can be made all convex.  definitely the
 way to go.
 
 p.s. sorry but my code cannot be made public domain....
