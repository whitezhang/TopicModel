 ==============================================================================
 has anyone created any interesting animations using dmorph
 i seem to be unable to create anything that looks remotely
 realistic although this is probably due to the crappy gif's
 at i am using (one of captain kirk and one of spock), i'm a
 bit of a 'trekker'.  what are the best type of pictures to use.
 thanks........
