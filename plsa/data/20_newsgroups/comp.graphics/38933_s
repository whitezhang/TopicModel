           the first annual phigs user group conference was held march 21-24
           in orlando, florida.  the conference was organized by the rensse-
           laer design research center in co-operation with  ieee  and  sig-
           graph.   attendees  came  from five countries spanning three con-
           tinents.   a  good  cross-section  of  the  phigs  community  was
           represented  at this conference with participants including phigs
           users, workstation vendors, third-party phigs implementors, stan-
           dards  committee  members,  and  researchers  from  industry  and
           academia.  the opening speaker, dr. richard puk, challenged phigs
           users  to  "take  charge of your phigs" by participating in phigs
           standardization activities and communicating their needs to phigs
           implementors.    the   closing  speaker,  dr.  andries  van  dam,
           described his vision of the future of graphics standards  "beyond
           phigs".
 
           technical paper sessions in the conference covered the  following
           topics:  phigs  and  x, application toolkits, application issues,
           texture mapping, nurbs,  phigs  extensions,  and  object-oriented
           libraries and frameworks.  panel sessions on phigs and pex, phigs
           non-retained data, real-world cad applications using  phigs,  and
           portability  issues generated enthusiastic discussions and formed
           a good forum for exchange of ideas, needs, and experiences.   the
           conference  also included a day full of tutorials on topics rang-
           ing from mathematics for 3d  graphics  to  object-oriented  tools
           based on phigs.
 
           next year's conference is planned for march, 1994.
 
           phigs everywhere
 
           at the conference, phigs  vendors   described   and  demonstrated
           phigs  products  that  run on all types of computers, from pcs to
           mainframes.
 
           megatek corporation demonstrated their phigs extensions including
           conditional traversal, composite logical input devices, texturing
           and translucency.
 
           template graphics  software  launched  figaro+  pro,  the  photo-
           realistic  option  for  phigs+.  figaro+  pro  is designed to add
           advanced rendering to the existing phigs+ api, with features like
           ray   tracing,  materials,  anti-aliasing  and  texture  mapping.
           radiosity support is also planned.
 
           figaro+ is an example of how tgs continues to add newly  emerging
           graphics  features to their products.  figaro+ supports immediate
           mode extensions to phigs and also supports sun xgl,  hp  starbase
           and sgi gl/opengl. figaro+ for nt will be released this summer.
 
           tgs also demonstrated the latest versions of figraph, a  powerful
           "2-call"  charting  system  based on phigs+, and figt, an object-
           oriented utility library for phigs/pex developers.
 
           g5g and gallium software demonstrated a new version of gphigs  on
           silicon  graphics  workstations. scheduled for summer, 1993, ver-
           sion 3.0 of gphigs, the company's  phigs+  library  for  worksta-
           tions,  will include an advanced phigs debugger that allows phigs
           developers to display and browse phigs structures and other phigs
           internal  state.  g5g  also  described  their non-duplicated data
           store that stores pointers to application data in the gphigs  css
           for  more  efficient  use  of  memory. in addition, g5g described
           their application gse that allows application callback  functions
           during  gphigs traversal.  gphigs and phigure, g5g's data visual-
           izer and application development toolkit, are currently available
           on  all  major  workstations  that support gl, x windows, pex, or
           starbase.
 
           wise software presented a slide show of  z-phigs  for  ms-windows
           and arena, a phigs based modeller/render. z-phigs implements most
           of the phigs+ primitives.  in addition z-phigs has built in  many
           advanced  rendering features like texture mapping, shadow genera-
           tion, area quick updates and ray tracing. a demo disk of  z-phigs
           or arena is available on request.
 
           atc exhibited grafpak-phigs, their full-featured phigs  implemen-
           tation  based  on  dec  phigs. grafpak-phigs is available on most
           workstation platforms with c, fortran and ada bindings and incor-
           porates pex support.
 
           within the booth sponsored by advanced technology center, digital
           equipment  corporation demonstrated dec phigs v2.4 running on the
           dec 3000/400 axp pxg. atcs' grafpak-phigs is a port of dec phigs.
           dec  phigs  v2.4 contains most phigs and phigs plus features with
           support for pex v5.1  protocol.  dec  phigs  also  contains  most
           gm/eds   phigs  extensions  including  post-to-view  as  well  as
           proprietary extensions to support immediate  mode  rendering  and
           the use of phigs in an x11 environment.

           the ibm exhibit featured a gto accelerator attached to an ibm 340
           workstation running graphigs and pex.
 
           hewlett packard and shographics demonstrated at the conference. a
           hewlett  packard  machine was coupled to display on a shographics
           pex terminal. hp showcased their latest  phigs  product  enhance-
           ments.
 
 
           phigs user group
 
           the phigs users group was formed to aid the development of  phigs
           applications  and provide user feedback to phigs implementors and
           phigs standards bodies.  for more  information  about  the  phigs
           users group, send e-mail to:
