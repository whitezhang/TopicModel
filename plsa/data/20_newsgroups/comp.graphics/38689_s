     i bought the diamond stealth 24 a few months ago.  it seems to be a
 great card especially with my multimedia presentations.  it runs graphics
 and animation as well as some near full motion video very well.  the only
 thing i can tell that it lacks is speed above 256 colors.  its qualit in
 between 256 and 16.7 million collors un unreal but you definitly
 compromise speed.  it seems to be a great card for graphics and it comes
 with some great software, but im not so sure about the excelerator
 part.  i used to own a paridise and it doesnt seem to be much faster
 than that.  one thing i do like is that it loads its own vesa driver
 from rom at startup, (i think) because i have never had to load it for
 links386 or any other programs that require special vesa drivers at
 startup.
