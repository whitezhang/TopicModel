 for better worse, the source on this on is michael barnsley. his article
 in the science of fractal images (peitgen et al) is a fair-to-middling
 intro. barnsley's book fractals everywhere is a more thorough treatment.
 the book covers iterated function systems in general, and their application
 to image compression is clear from the text.
