 i have a similiar question relating to anti-alaising that my friend has asked
 to have posted to the more knowledgable in this group. i'm sorry if this is
 an faq.
 
    "what anti-alaising methods do persistance of vision & polyray use?"
 
 thank you in advance. you can either email me or reply (or flame me if it is
 an faq :-) )
