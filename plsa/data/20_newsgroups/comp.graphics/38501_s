 
    i have a diamond speedstar 24x board that i want to program
 for 24 bit 640x480 graphics, or possibly 800x600 16 bit color.
 does anybody have any libraries supporting these modes on this
 board? even somes simple routines to set the graphics mode and
 plot individual pixels would be a great help. i plan to use the
 routines with djgp.
 
    thanks in advance. please respond also via e-mail.
