 here at lewis and clark college we have recently installed a digital film
 system (based on the mac quadra) that does non-linear, full digital editing.
 
 if you're considering such a system, here are the pros and cons:
 
 for the educational environment, this system is excellent.  we use it to
 produce a variety of educational materials for disemination on our local
 network.  because this programming is going to be viewed on other macs, the
 image quality is not as important as the ability to directly export the
 video to the net.
 
 we also use it to produce orientiation and promotional video programs for
 use by the lewis & clark community.  since these programs are not meant for
 commercial or broadcast use, image quality is not critical.
 
 the digital film system, for those of you who are uninitiated, is an a/b roll
 digitizing system on one $5000 jpeg compression card.  it was promoted as
 an inexpensive online editing system with svhs quality.  supermac, the maker
 of the card, is trying to achieve this quality level, but as yet, has been
 unable to deliver.  our system produces "near vhs" quality at 30 fields per
 second (640x480 overscan).  the card repeats every other field to get 60
 fields per second.  this results in a kind of super 8 film look that some
 find distracting.
 
 if you can get past this problem, you'll find the adobe premier editing 
 software quite enjoyable with which to work.  it produces thousands of
 different effects from crystalize filters to dve transitions to color matting.
 
 because of its non-linear nature, editing is fast and easy.  if you've ever
 used (or seen used) an avid or montage system, you'll recognize the methodology
 and the user interface.
 
 the total system with quadra 950 (40megs of ram), 1 gig drive, 21" apple mon-
 itor, panasonic svhs 1960 edit deck, audio gear (cassette, cd, eq, mixer, etc),
 composite monitor, digital film card will set you back about $20,000.
 
 for you video cowboys and girls, this system will not output at a quality
 that will satisfy most of your clients.  even though you can perform more
 effects than a toasterhead can imagine, an amiga based off-line based system
 will look better.
 
 we use both macs and amigas for our video work.  each for what each does best!
