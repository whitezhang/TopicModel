 
 	wgt is the wordup graphics toolkit, designed by yours truly and my
 co-programmer (and brother) chris egerter. it is a turbo/borland c++ graphics
 library for programming in 320*200*256 vga. we are currently producing it as
 shareware, but in a few years it may be a commercial product (excuse typos,
 there's no backspace on this terminal). features include:
 
 - loading and saving bit-images (called blocks from herein)
 - flipping, resizing and warping blocks
 - loading and saving palette, fading, several in memory at once
 - graphics primitives such as line, circle, bar, rectangle
 - region fill (not the usually useless floodfill)
 - sprites (animated bitmaps), up to 200 onscreen at once
 - joystick/mouse support
 - sb support (voc and cmf)
 - tile-based game creation using 16*16 pixel tiles to create
   a 320*200 tile map (or game world) like in duke nuke 'em
 - number of sprites increased to 1000
 - professional sprite creator utility and map maker
 -  routines to simplify scrolling games using maps, etc
 - fli playing routines, sprites can be animated over the fli while playing
 - pcx support, soon gif
 - ems/xms coming soon as well
