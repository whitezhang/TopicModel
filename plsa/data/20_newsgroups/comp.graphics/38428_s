 that is in fact the current version (it only came out in december).

 my test movie was created at 320*240 resolution, it wasn't being scaled up.
 scaling was a very cpu-intensive operation with the original quicktime (1.0);
 the current version has optimizations for ratios like 4:1 (160*120 -> 320*240),
 but even so, i'm prepared to believe that the performance isn't as good as
 with playing back an actual 320*240 movie. i haven't done any numerical
 measurements for scaled playback.
