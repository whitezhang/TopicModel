                           request for discussion
                                 for the
                           open  telematic group
 
                                   otg
 
 i have proposed the forming of a consortium/task force for the
 promotion of naplps/jpeg, fif to openly discuss ways, method,
 procedures,algorythms, applications, implementation, extensions of
 naplps/jpeg standards.  these standards should facilitate the creation
 of real_time online applications that make use of voice, video,
 telecommuting, hires graphics, conferencing, distant learning, online
 order entry, fax,in addition these dicussion would assist all to
 better understand how sgml, cals, oda, mime, oodbms, jpeg, mpeg,
 fractals, sql, cdrom, cdromxa, kodak photocd, tcl, v.fast, and
 eia/tia562, can best be incorporated and implemented to develop
 telematic/multimedia applications.
 
 we want to be able to support dos, unix, mac, windows, nt, os/2
 platforms.  it is our hope that individuals, developers, corporations,
 universities, r & d labs would join in in supporting such an endeavor.
 
 this would be a not_for_profit group with bylaws and charter. already
 many corporations have decided to support otg (open telematic group) so
 do not delay joining if you are a developer
 
 an rfd has been posted to form a usenet newsgroup and a faq will soon
 be be composed to start promulgating what is known on the subject.  if
 you would like to be added to the maillist send email or mail to the
 address below.
 
 this group would publish an electronic quarterly naplps/jpeg
 newsletter as well as a hardcopy version.  we urge all who wants to
 see cmcs hires based applications & the naplps/jpeg g r o w, decide to
 join and mutually benefit from this not-for_profit endeavor.
 
 note: telematic has been defined by mr. james martin as the marriage
       of voice, video, hi-res graphics, fax, ivr, music over telephone
       lines/lan.
