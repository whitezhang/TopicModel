 hi all,
 
 in short: looking for very fast assembly code for line/circle drawing
 	  on svga graphics.
 
 complete:
 	i am thinking of a simple but fast molecular
 graphics program to write on pc or clones. (ball-and-stick type)
 
 reasons: programs that i've seen are far too slow for this purpose.
 
 platform: 386/486 class machine.
 	  800x600-16 or 1024x728-16 vga graphics
 		(speed is important, 16-color for non-rendering
 		 purpose is enough; may stay at 800x600 for
 		 speed reason.)
          (hope the code would be generic enough for different svga
           cards.  my own card is based on trident 8900c, not vesa?)
 
 what i'm looking for?
 1) fast, very fast routines to draw lines/circles/simple-shapes
    on above-mentioned svga resolutions.
    presumably in assembly languagine.
 	yes, very fast please.
 2) related codes to help rotating/zooming/animating the drawings on screen.
    drawings for beginning, would be lines, circles mainly, think of
    text, else later.
    (you know, the way molecular graphics rotates, zooms a molecule)
 2) and any other codes (preferentially in c) that can help the 
    project.
 
 final remarks;-
 non-profit.  expected to become share-, free-ware.
 
 	any help is appreciated.
 	thanks
