 i have some color gifs which i would like to archive in a much smaller
 size using a grayscale palette of 16 shades. the quantization to 16 grays
 introduces some ugly bands in the pictures, which can be nicely eliminated
 by dithering. up to now i have used xv to process the images, but now i
 would like to automate the procedure.
 
 the problem is that xv can't (i think) convert images automatically, and the
 obvious alternative pnmplus (ppmquant and pnmdither) don't even get close to
 xv's quality. pnmdither apparently dithers in rgb, even though the images
 are in grayscale. the dithering routine in xv seems to use the natural image
 colors for the dither. is this or any similar routine available in the
 public domain? if so, where?
