 
 hello,
 
 we are looking for a graphics package (preferably complete
 with source code) that will run on our unix operating system
 (a sequent running dynix 3.2).  this graphics package must 
 support a wide variety of character based graphics devices 
 (pc's running a terminal emulator, primarily).  
 at this point, x11 graphics is not an option.
 
 this graphics program should, if possible, support these
 sorts of graphics operations (minimum requirements):
 
    1) complicated axes (log, linear, etc.) with fairly
       precise axis labels (multi-line labels, etc.)
       major and minor tickmarks on axes, etc.	
   
    2) it would be nice if some limited amount of color
       plotting were available, if the output device
       supported it.
 
 we have a copy of gnuplot and are currently using it, but
 gnuplot has some limitations.  we are looking for something
 more robust than gnuplot.
 
 at this point, i'm looking for information about packages that
 might solve our problems.  if you have any information, please
 contact me at the above email address.  if the product you know
 about is a commercial software package, please send a phone number
 or email address so that i can contact them about pricing, etc.
