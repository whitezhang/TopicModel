 14. plotting packages
 =====================
 
 gnuplot 3.2
 -----------
   it is one of the best 2- and 3-d plotting packages, with
   online help.it's a command-line driven interactive function plotting utility
   for unix, msdos, amiga, archimedes, and vms platforms (at least!).
   freely distributed, it supports many terminals, plotters, and printers
   and is easily extensible to include new devices.
   it was posted to comp.sources.misc in version 3.0, plus 2 patches.
   you can practically find it everywhere (use archie to find a site near you!).
   the comp.graphics.gnuplot newsgroup is devoted to discussion of gnuplot.
 
 xvgr and xmgr (ace/gr)
 -----------------------
   xmgr is an xy-plotting tool for unix workstations using
   x or openwindows. there is an xview version called xvgr for
   suns. collectively, these 2 tools are known as ace/gr.
   compiling xmgr requires the motif toolkit version 1.1
   and x11r4 - xmgr will not compile under x11r3/motif 1.0x.
 
   check at ftp.ccalmr.ogi.edu [129.95.72.34} in

 plplot
 ------
   plplot is a scientific plotting package for many systems, small (micro)
   and large (super) alike.  despite its small size and quickness,
   it has enough power to satisfy most users, including:
   standard x-y plots, semilog plots, log-log plots, contour plots, 3d plots,
   mesh plots, bar charts and pie charts.  multiple graphs (of the same or
   different sizes) may be placed on a single page with multiple lines in each
   graph.  different line styles, widths and colors are supported.  a virtually
   infinite number of distinct area fill patterns may be used.  there are
   almost 1000 characters in the extended character set.  this includes four
   different fonts, the greek alphabet and a host of mathematical, musical, and
   other symbols.  the fonts can be scaled to any size for various effects.
   many different output device drivers are available (system dependent),
   including a portable metafile format and renderer.
   
   freely available (but copyrighted) via anonymous ftp on

 15. image analysis software - image processing and display
 ==========================================================
 
 pc and mac-based tools (multi-platform software)
 ======================
 
 imdisp
 ------
   imdisp written at jpl and other nasa sites. can do simple display,
   enhancing, smoothing and so on. works with the fits and vicar/pds
   data formats of nasa. can read tiff images, if you know their dimensions
   [pc and macs]
 
 labview 2
 ---------
   labview is used as a framework for image processing tools. it provides a
   graphical programming environment using block diagram sketch is the
   "program" with graphical elements representing the programming elements.
   hundreds of functions are already available and are connected using a
   wiring tool to create the block diagram (program).  functions that the
   block diagrams represent include digital signal processing and
   filtering, numerical analysis, statistics, etc.  the tool allows any
   virtual instrument (vi, a software file that looks and acts like a real
   laboratory instrument) to be used as a part of any other virtual
   instrument.
 
   national instruments markets plug-in digital signal processing (dsp)
   boards for macintoshs and pc compatables that allow real-time
   acquisition and analysis at a personal computer.  new software tools for
   dsp are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology. the
   tools range from low-level debugging software to high-level block
   diagram development software.  there are three levels of dsp programming
   associated with the nb-dsp2300 board and labview:
   use of the nb-dsp2300 analysis library: ffts, power spectra, filters
   routines callable from think c and macintosh programers workshop (mpw) c
   that execute on the nb-dsp2300 board. there is an analysis virtual
   interface library of ready-to-use vis optimized for the nb-dsp2300.
 
   use of the national instruments developers toolkit that includes an
   optimizing c compiler, an assembler and a linker for low-level
   programming of the dsp hardware.  this approach offers the highest level
   of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use.
 
   use of the national instruments interface kit software package which has
   utility functions for memory management data communications and
   downloading code to the nb-dsp2300 board. (this is the easiest route for
   the development of custom code.)
 
 ultimage concept vi
 -------------------
   concept vi  by graftek-france is a family of image processing virtual
   instruments (vis) that give labview 2 (described above) users high-end
   tools for designing, integrating and monitoring imaging control systems.
   a vi is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory
   instrument. typical applications for concept vi include thermography,
   surveillance, machine vision, production testing, biomedical imaging,
   electronic microscopy and remote sensing.
 
   ultimage concept vi addresses applications which require further
   qualitative and quantitative analysis.  it includes a complete set of
   functions for image enhancement, histogram equalization, spatial and
   frequency filtering, isolation of features, thresholding, mathematical
   morphology analysis, density measurement, object counting, sizing and
   characterization.
 
   the program loads images with a minimum resolution of 64 by 64, a pixel
   depth of 8, 16, or 32 bits, and one image plane.  standard input and
   output formats include pict, tiff, satie, and aipd.  other formats can
   be imported.
 
   image enhancement features include lookup table transformations, spatial
   linear and non-linear filters, frequency filtering, arithmetic and logic
   operations, and geometric transformations, among others.  morphological
   transformations include erosion, dilation, opening, closing, hole
   removal, object separation, and extraction of skeletons, among others.
   quantitative analysis provides for objects' detection, measurement, and
   morphological distribution.  measures include area, perimeter, center of
   gravity, moment of inertia, orientation, length of relevant chords, and
   shape factors and equivalence.  measures are saved in ascii format.  the
   program also provides for macro scripting and integration of custom
   modules.
 
   a 3-d view command plots a perspective data graph where image intensity
   is depicted as mountains or valleys in the plot.  the histogram tool can
   be plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale. the twenty-eight
   arithmetic and logical operations provide for: masking and averaging
   sections of images, noise removal, making comparisons, etc.  there are
   13 spatial filters that alter pixel intensities based on local
   intensity.  these include high-pass filters for contrast and outlines.
   the frequency data resulting from fft analysis can be displayed as
   either the (real , imaginary ) components or the (phase, magnitude)
   data.  the morphological transformations are useful for data sharpening
   and defining objects or for removing artifacts.
 
   the transformations include: thresholding, eroding, dilating and even
   hole filling.
 
   the program's quantitative analysis measurements include: area,
   perimeter, center of mass, object counts, and angle between points.

 iplab spectrum
 --------------
   iplab spectrum supports image processing and analysis but lacks the
   morphology and quantitative analysis features provided by
   graftek-franceus ultimage concept vi.  using scripting tools, the user
   tells the system the operations to be performed. the problem is that far
   too many basic operations require manual intervention. the tool
   supports: ffts, 16 arithmetic operations for pixel alteration, and a
   movie command for cycling through windows.
 
 
 macintosh-based tools
 =====================
 
 ncsa image, ncsa paledit and more
 ---------------------------------
   ncsa provides a whole suite of public-domain visualization tools for the
   macintosh, primarily aimed at researchers wanting to visualize results
   from numerical modelling calculations.  these applications,
   documentation, and source code are available for anonymous ftp from
   ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu. commercial versions of the ncsa programs have been
   developed by spyglass.

   available at alw.nih.gov (128.231.128.7) or (preferably)
   zippy.nimh.nih.gov [128.231.98.32], directory:/pub/image.
   it has painting and image manipulation tools, a macro language,
   tools for measuring areas, distances and angles, and for counting
   things. using a frame grabber card, it can record sequences of
   images to be played back as a movie. it can invoke user-defined
   convolution matrix filters, such as gaussian. it can import raw
   data in tab-delimited ascii, or as 1 or 2-byte quantities. it also
   does histograms and even 3-d plots. it is limited to 8-bits/pixel,
   though the 8 bits map into a color lookup table. it runs on any mac
   that has a 256-color screen and a fpu (or get the nonfpu version
   from zippy.nimh.nih.gov)

   software) for scientific image processing and analysis.  video-rate
   capture, display, processing, and analysis of high-resolution
   monochromatic and color images.  includes c source code."
 
 tcl-image:
   "software package for scientific, quantitative image processing and
   analysis. it provides a complete language for the capture, enhancement,
   and extraction of quantitative information from gray-scale images.
   tcl_image has over 200 functions for image processing, and contains the
   other elements needed in a full programming language for algorithm
   development -- variables and control structures.  it is easily
   extensible through "script" (or indirect command) files. these script
   files are simply text files that contain tcl-image commands.  they are
   executed as normal commands and include the ability to pass parameters.
   the direct capture of video images is supported via popular frame
   grabber boards.  tcl-image comes with the i-view utility that provides
   conversion between common image file types, such as pict2 and tiff."

 adobe photoshop
 ---------------
 
   the tool supports rtrue colors with 24-bit images or 256 levels of grey
   scale.  once an image has been imported it can be rre-toucheds with
   various editing tools typical of those used in macintosh-based rpaints
   applications.  these include an eraser, pencil, brush and air brush.
   advanced rpastes tools that control the interaction between a pasted
   selection and the receiving site have also been incorporated.  for
   example, all red pixels in a selection can easily be preventing from
   being pasted. photoshop has transparencies ranging from 0 to 100%,
   allowing you to create ghost overlays.  rphoto-editings tools include
   control of the brightness and contrast, color balancing, hue/saturation
   modification and spectrum equalization.  images can be subjected to
   various signal processing algorithms to smooth or sharpen the image,
   blur edges, or locate edges.  image scaling is also supported.
 
   for storage savings, the images can be compressed using standard
   algorithms, including externally supplied compression such as jpeg,
   availlable from storm technologies. the latest version of adobe
   photoshop supports the import of numerous image formats including: epsf,
   epsf, tiff, pict resource, amiga iff/ilbm, compuserve gif, macpaint,
   pixar, pixelpaint, scitex ct, tga and thunderscan..

 colorstudio and imagestudio
 ---------------------------
   colorstudio is an image-editing and paint package from letraset that has
   more features than adobe photoshop but is decidedly more complex and
   therefore more difficult to use.  several steps are often required to
   accomplish that which can be done in a single step using photoshop.  the
   application requires a great deal of available disk space as one can
   easily end up with images in the 30 mb range.  the program provides a
   variety of powerful selection tools including the "auto selection tool"
   which lets the user choose image areas on the basis of color, close
   hues, color range and mask.

 digital darkroom
 ----------------
   the latest release of digital darkroom has five new selection and
   editing tools for enhancing images. one such feature allows the user to
   select part of an image simply by "painting" it. a new polyline
   selection tool creates a selection tool for single pixel wide
   selections.  a brush lets the operator "paint" with a selected portion
   of the image. note that this is not a true color image enhancement tool.
   this tool should be used when the user intends to operate in grey-scale
   images only.  it should be noted that digital darkroom is not as
   powerful as either adobe photoshop or colorstudio.

 image analyst
 -------------
   an image processing product for users who need to extract quantitative
   data from video images.  image analyst lets users configure
   sophisticated image processing and measurement routines without the
   necessity of knowing a programming language.  it is designed for such
   tasks at computing number and size of cells in images projected by video
   cameras attached to microscopes, or enhancing and measuring distances in
   radiographs.
 
   image analyst provides users with an array of field-proven video
   analysis techniques that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of
   instructions to enhance feature appearance; count objects; determine
   density, shape, size, position, or movement; perform object feature
   extraction; and conduct textural analysis automatically.  image analyst
   works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera, or
   a disk-stored image.
 
   within minutes, without the need for programming, the image analyst user
   can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image.
   measurements and statistics can be automatically or semi-automatically
   generated from tiff or pict files or from captured video tape images.
   image analyst recognizes items in images based on their size, shape and
   position.  the tool provides direct support for the data translation and
   scion frame grabbers. a menu command allows for image capture from a vcr
   video camera or other ntsc or pal devices.
 
   there are 2 types of files, the image itself and the related sequence
   file that holds the processing, measurements and analysis that the user
   defines.  automated sequences are set up in regions of interest (roi)
   represented by movable, sizable boxes atop the image.  inside a roi, the
   program can find the distance between two edges, the area of a shape,
   the thickness of a wall, etc.  image analyst finds the center, edge and
   other positions automatically. the application also provides tools so
   that the user can work interactively to find the edge of object. it also
   supports histograms and a color look-up table (clut) tool.

 rsvga
 -----
   "i have been getting up to speed on a program called rsvga available from
   eidetic digital image ltd. in british columbia.  its for ibm pc's or
   clones, cheap (about $400) and does all the stuff erdas does but is not
   as fast or as powerful, though i have had only limited experience with
   erdas.  i have used rsvga with 6 of 7 landsat bands and it is a good
   starter program except for the obtuse manual"
 
 imagine-32
 ----------
   it's a 32 bit package [i suppose for pcs] called "imagine32"
   or "image32" the program does a modest amount of image processing --add,
   subtract, multiply, divide, display, and plot an x or y cut across the image.
   it can also display a number of images simultaneously.
   the company is compuscope, in santa barbara, ca. 
 
 pc vista

   otherwise, made out to regents of the university of california
   to cover duplication and mailing costs.
 
 
 software tools
 --------------
   it's a set of software "tools" put out by canyon state
   systems and software. they are not free, but rather cheap at about $30 i
   heard. it will handle most all of the formats used by frame grabber
   software. 
 
 mirage
 ------
   it's image processing software written by jim gunn at the
   astrophysics dept at princeton. it will run on a pc among other platforms.
   it is a forth based system - i.e. a forth language with many image
   processing displaying functions built in. 
 
 data translation source book
 ----------------------------
   the data translation company in massachusetts publishes a free book
   containing vendors of data analysis hardware and software which is
   compatible with data translation and other frame grabbers.
   surely you can find much more pc-related stuff in it.
 
 maxen386
 --------
   a couple of canadians have written a program named maxen386 which does
   maximum entropy image deconvolution. their company is named digital
   signal processing software, or something like that, and the software is
   mentioned in an article in astronomy magazine, either jan or feb 92
   (an article on ccd's vs film). 
 
 jandel scientific (java)

 unix-based tools
 ================
 
 iraf (image reduction and analysis facility)
 --------------------------------------------
   developed in the national optical astronomy observatory, kitt peak az
   it is free, you can ftp it from tucana.noao.edu [140.252.1.1]
   and complement it with stsdas from stsci.edu [130.167.1.2].
   email to iraf@noao.edu for more details.
   apparently this is one of the _de facto_ standards in the astronomical
   image community. they issue a newsletter also.
   they seem to support very well their users. works with vms also last
   i heard, and practically has its own shell on top of the vms/unix shells.
 
   it's suggested that you get a copy of saoimage for display under x windows.
   very flexible/extendable  -- tons (literally 3 linear feet) of
   documentation for the general user, skilled user, and programmer.
 
 alv
 ---
   a sun-specific image toolkit.  version 2.0.6 posted to
   comp.sources.sun on 11dec89.  also available via email to
   alv-users-request@cs.bris.ac.uk.
 
 aips
 ----
   astronomical image processing system.  contact: aipsmail@nrao.edu
   (also see the usenet newsgroups alt.sci.astro.aips and sci.astro.fits)
   built by nrao (national radio astronomy observatory, hq in charlottesville,
   va, sites in nm, az, wv).  software distributed by 9-track, exabyte, dat,
   or (non-anonymous) internet ftp.  documentation (postscript mostly)
   available via anonymous ftp to baboon.cv.nrao.edu (192.33.115.103),
   directory pub/aips and pub/aips/text/publ.  installation requires building
   the system and thus a fortran and c compiler.
      this package can read and write fits data (see sci.astro.fits), and is
   primarily for reduction, analysis, and image enhancement of radio astronomy
   data from radio telescopes, particularly the very large array (vla), a
   synthesis instrument.  it consists of almost 300 programs that do everything
   from copying data to sophisticated deconvolution, e.g. via maximum entropy.
   there is an x11-based image tool (xas) and a tek-compatible xterm-based
   graphics tool built into aips.  the xas tool is modelled after the hardware
   functionality of the international imaging systems model 70 display unit and
   can do image arithmetic, etc.
     the code is mostly fortran 77 with some system c language modules, and is
   available for suns, ibm rs/6000, dec/ultrix, convex, cray (unicos), and
   alliant with support planned for hp-9000/7xx, solaris 2.1, and maybe sgi.
      there is currently a project - "aips++" - underway to rewrite the
   algorithmic functionality of aips in a modern setting, using c++ and an
   object oriented approach.  whereas aips is proprietary code (licensed for
   free to non-profit institutions) owner by nrao and the nsf, aips++ will be
   in the public domain at some level, as it is an international effort with
   contributions from the us, canada, england, the netherlands, india, and
   australia to name a few. 
 
 laboimage
 ---------
   (version 4.0 is out for x11) it's written in c, and currently
   runs on sun 3/xxx, sun 4/xxx (os3.5, 4.0 and 4.0.3) under sunview.
   the expert system for image segmentation is written in allegro common lisp.
   it was used on the following domains: computer science (image analysis), 
   medicine, biology, physics. it is distributed free of charge (source code).

 disimp
 ------
   (device independent software for image processing) is a powerful
   system providing both user friendliness and high functionality in
   interactive times.
 
   feature description
 
   disimp incorporates a rich library of image processing utilities and
   spatial data options. all functions can be easily accessed via the
   disimp executive. this menu is modular in design and groups image
   processes by their function. such a logical structure means that
   complicated processes are simply a progression through a series of
   modules.
 
   processes include image rectification, classification (unsupervised and
   supervised), intensity transformations, three dimensional display and
   principal component analysis. disimp also supports the more simple and
   effective enhancement techniques of filtering, band subtraction and
   ratioing.
 
   host configuration requirements
 
   running on unix workstations, disimp is capable of processing the more
   computational intensive techniques in interactive processing times.
   disimp is available in both runtime and programmer's environments. using
   the programmers environment, utilities can be developed for specific
   applications programs.
 
   graphics are governed by an icon-based display panel which allows quick
   enhancments of a displayed image. manipulations of look up tables,
   colour stretches, changes to histograms, zooming and panning can be
   interactively driven through this control.
 
   a range of geographic projections enables disimp to integrate data of
   image, graphic and textual types. images can be rectified by a number of
   coordinate systems, providing the true geographic knowledge essential
   for ground truthing. overlays of grids, text and vector data can be
   added to further enhance referenced imagery.
 
   the system is a flexible package allowing users of various skill levels
   to determine their own working environment, including the amount of help
   required. disimp comes fully configured with no optional extras. the
   purchase price includes all functionality required for professional
   processing of remote sensed data.

 global imaging software
 -----------------------
   "we use global imaging software to process avhrr data, from the dish to
   the final display. select a chunk of five band data from a pass,
   automatic navigation, calibrate it to albedo and temp, convert that to
   byte, register it to predesigned window, all relatively automatically
   and carefree.
 
   it has no classification routines to speak of, but it isn't that
   difficult to write your own with their programmer's module.
 
   very small operation: one designs, one codes, one sells. been around for
   a number of years, sold to weather service and navy.  runs on hp9000
   with hp-ux.  supports 24-bit display"
 
 hips
 ----
 (human   information   processing laboratory's image processing system)
 
   michael landy co-wrote and sell a general-purpose package for image
   processing which has been used for basically all the usual image
   processing applications (robotics, medical, satellite, engineering, oil
   exploration, etc.).  it is called hips, and deals with sequences of
   multiband images in the same way it deals with single images.  it has
   been growing since we first wrote it, both by additions from us as well
   as a huge user-contributed library.
 
   feature description
 
   hips  is  a  set  of  image  processing  modules  which together provide
   a  powerful  suite  of  tools  for  those interested in research,
   system  development  and  teaching. it  handles  sequences  of  images
   (movies)  in precisely the same manner as single frames.
 
   programs and subroutines have been developed  for simple image
   transformations, filtering, convolution, fourier and other transform
   processing, edge detection  and line  drawing   manipulation, digital
   image compression and transmission  methods, noise generation, and image
   statistics computation. over 150 such  image transformation programs
   have been developed.  as a result, almost any image processing  task
   can be performed quickly and conveniently. additionally, hips allows
   users to easily integrate  their  own custom  routines.   new users
   become effective using hips on their first day.
 
   hips features images that are  self-documenting.   each image stored  in
   the  system  contains  a  history  of the transformations that have been
   applied to that image.   hips includes  a  small  set of subroutines
   which primarily deals with a standardized  image sequence  header,  and
   a  large library  of  image  transformation tools in the form of unix
   ``filters''.  it comes complete with source  code,  on-line manual
   pages, and on-line documentation.
 
   host configuration requirements
 
   originally  developed at  new  york  university,  hips  now represents
   one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image  processing
   environments currently available.  it runs under the unix operating
   system.  it is modular  and  flexible, provides automatic documentation
   of its actions, and is almost entirely independent of special equipment.
   hips is now in use on a variety of computers including vax and
   microvax, sun, apollo,  masscomp,  ncr tower, iris, ibm at, etc.
   for image display and input, drivers are supplied for the grinnell and
   adage (ikonas) image processors, and the sun-2, sun-3, sun- 4, and
   sun-386i consoles.  we also  supply  user-contributed drivers  for  a
   number of  other framestores and windowing packages (sun gfx, sun
   console, matrox vip-1024, iti ip-512, lexidata,  macintosh ii, x
   windowing system, and iris).  the hipsaddon package includes an
   interface  for the  crs-4000. it  is  a  simple matter to interface hips
   with other frame- stores, and we can put interested users in touch with
   users who  have interfaced hips with the arlunya and datacube max-
   video. hips can be easily adapted for other  image  display devices
   because 98% of hips is machine independent.
 
   availability
 
   hips has proven itself a highly flexible  system,  both as  an
   interactive  research tool, and for more production- oriented tasks. it
   is both easy to use, and quickly adapted and extended to new uses. hips
   is supplied on magnetic tape in unix tar format (either reel- to-reel or
   sun  cartridge), and comes with source code, libraries, a library of
   convolu- tion masks, and on-line documentation and manual pages.

 mira
 ----
 [ please don't confuse that with the thalmanns animation system from
   montreal. these are altogether different beasts! - nfotis ]
 
   mira stands for microcomputer image reduction and analysis.  mira gives
   workstation level performance on 386/486 dos computers using svga cards in
   256 color modes up to 1024x768. mira contains a very handsome/functional
   gui which is mouse and keystroke operated. mira reads/writes tiff and fits
   formats, native formats of a number of ccd cameras, and uncompressed binary
   images in byte, short integer, and 4-byte real pixel format in 1- or 2-
   dimensions. the result of an image processing operation can be short integer
   or real pixels, or the same as that of the input image. mira does the
   operation using short or floating point arithmetic to maintain the precision
   and accuracy of the pixel format. over 100 functions are hand-coded in
   assembly language for maximum speed on the intel hardware.  the entire
   graphical interface is also written in assembly language to maximize
   the speed of windowing operations.  windows for 2-d image and 1-d image/data
   display and analysis have dedicated cursors which read position and value
   value in real time as you move the mouse.  there are also smooth, real time
   contrast and brightness stretch and panning of a magnified portion of
   the displayed image(s), all operated by the mouse. a wide selection of
   grayscale, pseudocolor, and random palettes is provided, and other 
   palettes can be generated.
 
 
 supported functions include such niceties as the following:
 
 o  image & image: + - / * interpolation
 o  image & constant: + - / *
 o  unary operations: abs value, polynomial of pixel value, chs, 1/x, log,
