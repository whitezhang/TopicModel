    just because the 68070 can run upto 15mhz doesn't mean the cd-i
 is running at that speed.  i said -> i understand it is a 68070 running
 at something like 7mhz.  i am not sure, but i think i read this a long
 time ago.
 
    anyway, still with 15mhz, you need sprites for a lot of tricks for
 making cool awesome games (read psygnosis).
