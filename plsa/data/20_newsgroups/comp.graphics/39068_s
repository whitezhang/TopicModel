 hello all,
    i need to make  some torso 3d scans and would like the phone numbers of
 companies in the midwest that make scans, and the numbers of companies that
 make the sanners (ie cyberware). does anyone have an idea of how much a
 single scan costs and the best format to save it in? i am not sure on what
 software platform i will be using it in, probably either softimage or
 wavefront. so i think a spline based format would be best. please forward the
 numbers to me personally as i am having problems accessing usenet lately.
 thanks in advance!
