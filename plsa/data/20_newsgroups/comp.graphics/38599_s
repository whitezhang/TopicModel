 : i have to beg to differ on this point, as the batch file i use
 : to launch cview cd's to the dir where cview resides and then
 : invokes it.  every time i crash cview, the 0-byte temp file
 : is found in the root dir of the drive cview is on.
 
 this is what i posted that cview uses the root directory of the drive
 cview is on.  however, since it has so much trouble reading large files
 from floppy, i suspect that it uses the root directory of the drive the
 image files are on.
