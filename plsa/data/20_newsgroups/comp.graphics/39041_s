 yes i have written something that creates meshed fractal terrain
 surfaces for exactly the purpose you require, importing into 3d
 modelling packages. be warned, the data content is high and brings
 many packages to their knees. we use it primarily for microstation
 but it exports dxf, as well as other formats, so you should be ok.
 you can get it from my ftp mirror site in the us.
 it is
    wuarchive.wustl.edu
 my stuff is located in the
    mirrors/architec
 directory. please ftp the readme file first.
