 dear binary newsers,
 
 i am looking for quick c or microsoft c code for image decoding from file for
 vga viewing and saving images from/to gif, tiff, pcx, or jpeg format. i have
 scoured the internet, but its like trying to find a dr. seuss spell checker 
 tsr. it must be out there, and there's no need to reinvent the wheel.
 
 thanx in advance.
