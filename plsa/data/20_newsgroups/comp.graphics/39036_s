 how about the gnu people, handing out very good, free software?  i've also
 distributed two decent-sized programs myself, the go player fumiko (at
 ftp.u.washington.edu) and the genetic neural network programmer cerebrum
 (somewhere out there).
 
 i've only had time to write these programs because of scholarships and
