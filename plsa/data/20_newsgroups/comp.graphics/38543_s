 this doesn't sound right to me.  i have an ati ultra pro vlb card with 2mb
 vram, and i'm pretty sure it is not interlaced at 800x600 in 24bit mode.  i'm
 at work right now so i can't check it out, but i know that when i set it up
 the utility let me specify non-interlaced for this mode.  and i haven't 
 noticed it the couple times that i have put the card in this mode in windows,
 but i could be wrong because i very rarely use this mode.  for most of my
 applications at home 1024x768x16bpp is what i use.
