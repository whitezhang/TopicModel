 i'm a mac user who wants to use some of the rayshade models i've built
 using macrayshade (rayshade-m) with stratavision 3d.  since stratavision
 can import many different model files i thought this would be a cinch...
 but i haven't been able to find a simple translator that will work on the
 mac.  any ideas?
 
 stratavision 3d should be able to import:
 
 dxf
 minicad
 super 3d
 swivel 3d professional
 
 out of the box and:
 
 rib
 igs
 
 with externals.
 
 also, if anyone knows of any other translator externals available for
 stratavision 3d (esp. rayshade!) please e-mail me!
 
 btw, i'm going to send mail to the rayshade usrs mailing list tomorrow (i
 misplaced the address) but since most users of rayshade do not seem to
 operate with macs, i'm not getting my hopes up...
 
 thanks in advance,
