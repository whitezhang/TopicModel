 hi,
 
 can anybody suggest robust algorithms/code for computing the point of intersection
 on n, 2-d lines in a plane. the data has outliers and hence a simple least squares
 technique does not seem to provide satifactory results.
 
 please respond by e-mail and i will post the summary to the newsgroups
 if there is sufficient interest.
 
 thanks,
