 
 i am considering creating a "demo" for the ibm pc for my band.
 i would like to combine interesting graphics and a sample of 
 my music in the program.  i have seen things like this
 done for other platforms, and even a few for the pc, but since
 i'm completly new to this, i have no idea wher to start.
 i'm pretty sure that i am not skilled enough to put this 
 together, but i was hoping that you (collectivly) could
 a. let me know what issues i need to worry about, things i
    should take into consideration when developing the 
    concept.
 b. perhaps someone knows of a programmer/artist who would be interested
    in this type of a project.
 
 i know these are rather broad questions, but any information
 would be most helpful.  thanks!!
