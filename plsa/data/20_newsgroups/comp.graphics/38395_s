 i'm using "rayshade" on the u.w. computers here, and i'd like input
 from other users, and perhaps swap some ideas.  i could post
 uuencoded .gifs here, or .ray code, if anyone's interested.  i'm having
 trouble coming up with colors that are metallic (i.e. brass, steel)
 from the rgb values.
 
 if you're on the u.w. machines, check out "~fineman/rle.files/*.rle" on 
 stein.u.washington.edu for some of what i've got.
