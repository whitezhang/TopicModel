 hello,
 i purchased my new 486 with a noname graphics card installed which is obviously 
 speedstar 24 compatible. its name is "vga 4000 truecolor".
 it is accompanied with some drivers and the utilities vmode, xmode and
 at least one more mode, as well as some drivers for lotus, windows, etc.
 only one of the drivers is told to provide the truecolor mode, namely
 the windows 3.1 driver.
 nowhere else, except in the ad, is any pointer to the truecolor mode.
 some articles in this group about the speedstar 24 and some other facts
 made me believe that my card is compatible to that one.
 
 does anybody out there know how this mode can be adjusted? how can i write
 a driver which allows me to have 16.7 millions of colors with a resolution
 of 640 x 480 with 45 hz interlaced ?
 
 greetings,
     wolfgang
