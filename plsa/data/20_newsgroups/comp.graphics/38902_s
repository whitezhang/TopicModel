 i use aldus photostyler on the pc and i can turn a colour or black and white
 image into a negative or turn a negative into a colour or black and white
 image.  i don't know how it does it but it works well.  to test it i scanned
 a negative and used aldus to create a positive.  it looked better than the
 print that the film developers gave me.
