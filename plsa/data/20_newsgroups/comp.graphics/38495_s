 i would like to program tseng et4000 to nonstandard 1024x768 mode by
 switching to standard 1024x768 mode using bios and than changing some
 timing details (0x3d4 registers 0x00-0x1f) but i don't know how to
 select 36 mhz pixel clock i need. the bios function selects 40 mhz.
 
 is there anybody who knows where to obtain technical info about this.
 i am also interested in any other technical information about tseng et4000
 and trident 8900 and 9000 chipsets.
 
 			thanks very much
