 actually, iff is a *format standard*.  it is not a picture file format, sound
 file format, but there exist several formats that use the iff standard.  the
 iff picture standard used by mostly everybody is a form ilbm (or just ilbm).
 the only 3d iff specification i know of is tddd, which is used by imagine and
 it's predecessor, turbo silver.   it is possible that some of the other amiga
 packages use another *iff* spec, but i don't know of any.  lightwave will load
 tddd form's i believe.
