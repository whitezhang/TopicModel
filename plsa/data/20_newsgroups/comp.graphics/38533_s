 that's closer, but i dislike "apps".  "software" (vs. "hardware")
 would be better.  would that engulf alt.graphics.pixutils?  or would
 that be "programmer"?
 
 i don't know if traffic is really heavy enough to warrant a newsgroup
 split.  look how busy comp.graphics.research is (not).
 
 it's true that a lot of the traffic here is rehashing faqs and
 discussing things that would probably be better diverted to
 system-specific groups, but i don't know whether a split would help
 or hurt that cause.
 
 maybe we need a comp.graphics.rtfb for all those people who can't be
 bothered to read the fine books out there.  right, dr. rogers? :-)
