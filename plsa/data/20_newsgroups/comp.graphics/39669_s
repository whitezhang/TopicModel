 the subject says it all. i bought adobe type manager and find it completely
 useless. i ftped some atm fonts and couldn't install them. what's the use?
 are you supposed to be able to convert atm fonts to truetype?
 
 if there's anyone out there who has this program and actually finds it 
 useful, enlighten me!
