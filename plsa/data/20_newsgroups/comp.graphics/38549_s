 i don't want texture mapped, cause if i did i'd asked for them. :)  just
 a simple and fast routine to do filled polygons.  as for the processor, it'd
 be for a minimum of a 286... maybe 386 if i can't find a good one for 286s.
 ideally, i want a polyn function that can clip to a user-defined viewport,
 and write to an arbitrary location in memory.  of course the chances of
 finding something like that are pretty remote, so i guess i'd need the source
 with it.  oh, and i guess it would need to be in asm otherwise it'd be too
 slow.  i've seen some polygon routines in c, and they've all been waaay too
 slow.  its for a 3d vector graphics program.  i've been hunting high and low
 for a polyn function in asm, and i can't find one anywhere that i can use.
 i've found one or two polyn functions, but my asm is pretty bad, so i won't
 even try to rewrite them. :)
