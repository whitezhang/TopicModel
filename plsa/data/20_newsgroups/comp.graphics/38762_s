 hmm... 48 bit aye?
 well, it beats a 32-bit design for thee sake of ellegance.
 48 bit means 16 bits per primary colour.
 the 2^48 nr of colours is a bit misleading. it makes more sense to see it
 as 65536 possible shades of pure red.
 this might actually make some sense, since 256 shades of red (24 bit colours) 
 may produce visible 'jumps' in intensity.
 then again, a byte per primary colour for each pixel is the most elegant way 
 of doing colour graphics, because it leaves ya such a tidy (and fast) program
 code.
 
 	take care,
