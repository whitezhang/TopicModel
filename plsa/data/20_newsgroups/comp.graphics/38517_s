 there are several public domain utilities available at your usual
 archive site that allow 'extraction' of single frames from a .gl
 file, check in the 'graphics' directories under *grasp.  the problem 
 is that the .clp files you generate cannot be decoded by any of 
 the many pd format converters i have used. any hint welcome!
 let me know if you have problems locating the utilities.
 hope it helps.
