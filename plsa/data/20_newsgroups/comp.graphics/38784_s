 systems (i.e. photo processing gear) use as much as 96 bits of color info.
 why? why not, oversampling is never a bad idea especially if the
 hardware's only task is image manipulation, and profressional photographers
 demand professional results.

 	strange question, but anyway, there's the vgx line, the newer
 indigo^2, and the onyx systems are the new big boys on the block (you
 can get a 24 processor system with twice the graphics performance of
 a reality engine). there's more, but i don't have my handy "periodic 
 table of sgi's" on me...
