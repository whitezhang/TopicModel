 looking for a graphics/cad/or-whatever package on a x-unix box that will
 take a file with records like:
 
 n  a  b  p
 
 where n = a count  - integer 
       a = entity a - string
       b = entity b - string
       p = type     - string
 
 and produce a networked graph with nodes represented with boxes or circles
 and the vertices represented by lines and the width of the line determined by
 n.  there would be a different line type for each type of vertice. the boxes
 need to be identified with the entity's name.  the number of entities < 1000
 and vertices < 100000.  it would be nice if the tool minimized line
 cross-overs and did a good job of layout.  ;-)
 
   i have looked in the faq for comp.graphics and gnuplot without success. any
 ideas would be appreciated?
 
 thanks,
