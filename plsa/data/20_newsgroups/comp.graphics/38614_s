 there are 2 books published by m&t books that come with c source code on
 floppies.  they are:
 
 programming in 3 dimensions, 3-d graphics, ray traycing, and animation
 by: christopher d. watkins and larry sharp.
 
 photorealism and ray tracing in c
 by: christopher d. watkins, stephen b. coy, and mark finlay.
 
 i have the first book and it is a great intro to 3-d, ray tracing and
 animation.  most of the programs are on the disk compiled and ready to run.
 
 i have only glanced at the second book but it also appears to be good.
 
 hope this helps!
