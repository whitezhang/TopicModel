 significant progress has been made recently in shape analysis using
 neural networks and the energy minimization concept. ablex publishing
 corporation is planning a special volume on "shape analysis", scheduled
 for this year.
 
 this volume will be a part of "progress in neural networks," an annual
 book series reviewing research in modelling, analysis, design and
 application of neural networks. the primary aim of this volume is to
 present, in a single volume, the most important achievements made on
 this important topic, which are otherwise scattered in diverse literature.
 
 authors are invited to submit original manuscripts detailing recent
 progress. suggested topics include, but are not limited to: shape modelling,
 shape estimation, shape recovery, shape representation, shape matching,
 surface reconstruction and surface decomposition. research work utilizing
 neural networks directly or based on energy minimization techniques such as
 markov random field, mean field annealing, simulated annealing, graduated
 non-convexity algorithms and resistive networks are most welcome.
 
 the paper should be tutorial in nature, self contained and preferably,
 but not necessarily, about fifty double spaced pages in length. please send
 electronically (if you prefer, you can send a hardcopy to the address below)
 an  abstract and an outline to
 msuk@ima.enst.fr
 by may 30, 1993. the full paper must be submitted by july 31, 1993 to:
