 how can i find these files and graphics that people
 are downloading from their unix systems? then, how
 do i download them? i am a complete beginner in
 this (obviously), so please baby-step me through
 the process. first of all, i don't see amongst
 these newsgroups where there is anything remotely
 like a gif, tif, or compiled shareware program?
 
 thanks in advance for any information you can
 give me. (i know there is a unix command, "ftp,"
 that will allow me to do this, but first i
 need to know where to go to find the file
 i want download via ftp, etc.
