 it traces beautifully. but - there's a trick to tracing. i've traced entire
 cartoon images into custom clip art, but you can't expect to just point to
 the image and get it just like that, it takes a little work (in some cases
 a lot of work). you need to trace a drawing piece by piece, and then put it 
 together... it's kinda hard to explain in type, but if you're ever in reno
 i can give you a little demonstration!
