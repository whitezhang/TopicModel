 excuse the sheer newbieness of this post, but i am looking for a decent
 paintprogram which will save to various file formats (.bmp  .pcx  etc etc)
 via ftp, freeware, or shareware.  i would like to check out the available
 programs for little $$ before i check out the commercial market.
 
 thanks in advance for any help or direction you can give me.
