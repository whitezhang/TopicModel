    i have a group of gif images that each contain 6 small images in 
 the same place on all the images. i need a program to crop out the
 small images to a new gif file. all the programs i can find make me
 use the mouse or keyboard to define the cropping coordinates. is there
 a program out there for a pc that can take the crop coordinates on
 the command line?
