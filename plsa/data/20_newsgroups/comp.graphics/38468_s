 help!
 how do you write to the second bank/page of memory when in vga
 320x200x256 colour mode?. ie: to perform page flipping animation
 and buffering of the screen.
      i have tried using the map mask registers, but this does not
 perform the required task (although it does do something).
 
 note: it *must* be able to work on a standard vga (ie: not
 necessarily a svga card).
 
 many thanx in advance...
