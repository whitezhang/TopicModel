 am i glad you write that. i got flamed all along because i begged not to
 crosspost some nonsense articles.
 
 the problem with crossposting is on the first poster. i am aware that this
 posting is a crossposting too, but what else should one do. you never know
 where the interested people stay in.
 
 to split up newsgroups brings even more crossposting.
