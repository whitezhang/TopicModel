 the gl file is an archive containing individual frames or pieces of
 frames (usually stored as .pic or .clp files), fonts, and a .txt file
 that tells the grasp animation system how to display it.  gl stands
 for grasp library.  there is probably a detailed discussion of this subject
 in the alt.binaries.pictures faq.
 
 there are freely distributable viewers for gl files, and they are usually
 named grasprt?.exe (replace the ? with a version digit or letter).  most
 gl files contain frames that are hardware-specific to particular modes
 of the cga, ega, or vga adapters on pcs.  i think that there are some
 copies of grasprt available by anonymous ftp (i know that i got one there
 a long time ago).
 
 		good luck
