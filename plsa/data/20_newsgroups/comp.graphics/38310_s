 hi steve,
 
 as the author of multiverse, i feel i had better respond to your
 mailnote questioning whether anyone had managed to compile this
 software - the quick answer is yes! the long answer is yes - but a
 few have had a few problems with their platforms - not all unix's are
 the same, you know! as far as "many bugs" go, it would probably be more
 useful to everyone (including you) if you were a bit more explicit! :-)
 
 platforms it has succesfully compiled and run on are: rs6000, dec ultrix
 sun solaris so it is possible.
 
 the main problem is that i don't have access to other platforms than the
 rs6000, so if there are portability problems then the only way i hear
 about them is by people letting me know and giving me a clue as to
 how to fix it.
 
 as far as the software not doing anything, do you really think i would
 bother releasing it, if that was the case? perhaps you didn't read the
 few docs that are supplied. the dogfight world is made up of clients
 only, so if you're in there on your own, then you're not going to see
 anything! the dactyl world has quite a lot of scenary - so if you don't
 see anything there, then this is definitely a problem!
 
 one final word - if you're not interested, don't bother with it.
 if you are interested, then please remember that i'm not asking for
 any money! so why not try a little patience and constructive criticism,
 maybe that will get results??
