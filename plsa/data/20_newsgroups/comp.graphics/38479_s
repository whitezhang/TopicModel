 	i have a problem, i hope some of the 'gurus' can help me solve.
 
 	background of the problem:
 	i have a rectangular mesh in the uv domain, i.e  the mesh is a 
 	mapping of a 3d bezier patch into 2d. the area in this domain
 	which is inside a trimming loop had to be rendered. the trimming
 	loop is a set of 2d bezier curve segments.
 	for the sake of notation: the mesh is made up of cells.
 
 	my problem is this :
 	the trimming area has to be split up into individual smaller
 	cells bounded by the trimming curve segments. if a cell
 	is wholly inside the area...then it is output as a whole ,
 	else it is trivially rejected. 
 
 	does any body know how thiss can be done, or is there any algo. 
 	somewhere for doing this.
 
 	any help would be appreciated.
 
 	thanks, 
 	ani.
