 i'm also interested in info both public domain and commercial graphics library 
 package to do pc vga graphics.  
 
 i'm currently working on a realtime application running on a pcc with a 
 non-dos kernel that needs to do some simple graphics.  i'm not sure if 
 reentrancy of the graphics library is going to be an issue or not.  
 i suspect i'll implement the display controller as a server process that 
 handles graphics requests, queued on a mailbox, one at a time.  if this 
 provides sufficiently frequent display updates then i believe that i can 
 restrict all graphics operations to be performed by the server and thus 
 constrain access to the library to a this single process and avoid the need
 for a reentrant graphics library.  
 
 being fairly new to the realtime systems world i may be overlooking something,
 what do you think?
