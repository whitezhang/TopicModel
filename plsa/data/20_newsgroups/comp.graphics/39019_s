 howdy...  i think you would be interested in infini-d 2.5 for the mac.  there
 is no dos or windows version.  it's quite an amazing program.
 
 "some" of the features:
 
 *  bevel text
 *  timeline based animation sequencer
 *  realtime bounding box preview
 *  object linking
 *  phong shading
 *  ray tracing
 *  bounding box shading
 *  wireframe shading
 *  ghourad shading
 *  flat shading
 *  anti-aliasing (none, low, medium, high)
 *  environment maps
 *  quicktime support (wrap a qt movie around an object)
 *  procedural surfaces
 *  composed surfaces (for layering surfaces)
 *  alpha channel support
 *  import eps, dxf, and swivel 3d files
 *  export dxf and swivel 3d files
 *  spline based animation
 *  animation assistant (for creating smooth movements and other stuff)
 *  object morphing (surfaces and bevels morph too)
 
 ... and lots more that i can't remember right now...
 
 anyway, it's not as expensive as some of the other animation/rendering
 packages.  i think you can get it for around $699 from macwarehouse.
 they also have educational discounts...
 
 well, hope that helps a bit.
 
 see ya...
