 i am using an ibm dx-50 with eisa and local bus....and i need to get a
 local bus video card....
 
 the only hitch is that i need one that will allow me to do the fastest
 anims (or flics) from ram. i have 64-megs of ram in 16-meg simms
 
 i am using 3d-studio from autodesk and imagine from impulse...
 they both write out in the .flc format....
 
 so does anyone know what would be the best card for showing fast anims
 from ram.... ie. like the orchid, diamond stealth viper, ati....etc
 
 any help would be appreciated.... ( i am trying to circumvent the single-
 frame route)
 
 email me at trb3@ra.msstate.edu
 or just post back up here...thanks
