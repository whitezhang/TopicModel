 hi,
 
 my name is rahul and i am doing ms at usu, logan
 my query is:
 	i have a hp workstation: hp series 400 with x running on it.
 i have a true color - 24bit color monitor connected to this machine.
 normally i have the capability to display 256 colors from a max of
 16.7 million. since the monitor is true color i can see 16.7
 million at a time. 
 que: do we have a facility in x(c-function call) that will enable me
 to specify any rgb combination and see it on screen? i am using
 xstorecolor to set the pallette of a max of 256 colors.
 que: if not. is there any way i can display a true color image
 on a true color monitor using xlib function calls?
 
 we are generating ray traced images and 256 colors are indeed a
 painful limit. besides i need the facility to display the true color images 
 i will be generating on a true color system without color 
 quantification.
 please, if anyone can help i'd be obliged
 
 rahul
