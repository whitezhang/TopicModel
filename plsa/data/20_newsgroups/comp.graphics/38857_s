 
 now i have a couple raytracing questions.
 just so you know i'm using povray 1.0 (both ms-dos and unix) and i'm generating targa files of varying size.
 
 1) ok, so i can view these wonderful pictures on my screen.  what's the best way  to get them on to paper?  would it be possible to take it to kinko's and have   them make an actual picture on paper from it?
 
 2) i was thinking about making a small animation bit with different raytraced 
 frames.  is this a bad idea?  any tricks to it?

  how would i get a sequence of targa files made into an animation 
 that i could put on a videotape?  is there a cheap way?
