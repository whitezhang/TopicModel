 
 i need a graphics display program that can take as a parameter the name of
 the file to be displayed, then just display that image and then quit.
 
 all of the other graphics display programs come up with a menu first or some
 other silliness.
 
 this program is going to be run from within another program.  i have lots of
 memory and vga color.  any graphics format will do.  has anyone heard of such
 a beast?
