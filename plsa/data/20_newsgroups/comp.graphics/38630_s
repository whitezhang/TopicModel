 
 hi,
          i have a friend who is working on 2-d and 3-d object recognition. he is looking
 for references describing algorithms on the following subject areas:
 
 thresholding
 edge segmentation
 marr-hildreth
 sobel operator
 chain codes
 thinning - skeletonising
 
 if anybody is willing to post an algorithm that they have implemented which demonstrates
 any of the above topics, it would be much appreciated.
 
 please post all replies to my e-mail address. if requested i will post a summary to the
 newsgroup in a couple of weeks.
 
 
 thanks in advance for all replies
