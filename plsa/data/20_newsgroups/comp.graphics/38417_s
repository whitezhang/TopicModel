 a while back someone had several equations which could be used for changing 3 f
 iltered grey scale images into one true color image.  this is possible because
 it's the same theory used by most color scanners.  i am not looking for the obv
 ious solution which is to buy a color scanner but what i do need is those equat
 ions becasue i am starting to write software which will automate the conversion
  process.  i would really appreciate it if someone would repost the 3 equations
 /3 unknowns.   thanks for the help!!!
