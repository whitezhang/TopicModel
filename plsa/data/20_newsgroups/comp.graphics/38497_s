 
 
 g'day all,
 
 can anybody point me at a utility which will read/convert/crop/whatnot/
 display hdf image files ? i've had a look at the hdf stuff under ncsa 
 and it must take an award for odd directory structure, strange storage
 approaches and minimalist documentation :-)
 
 part of the problem is that i want to look at large (5mb+) hdf files and
 crop out a section. ideally i would like a hdftoppm type of utility, from
 which i can then use the pbmplus stuff quite merrily. i can convert the cropped
 part into another format for viewing/animation.
 
 otherwise, can someone please explain how to set up the ncsa visualisation s/w
 for hdf (3.2.r5 or 3.3beta) and do the above cropping/etc. this is for
 suns with sunos 4.1.2.
 
 any help greatly appreciated. ta muchly !
 
 cheers,
 	markus
