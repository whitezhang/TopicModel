 it's not a bad question: i don't have any refs that list this algorithm
 either. but thinking about it a bit, it shouldn't be too hard.
 
 1) take three of the points and find the plane they define as well as
 the circle that they lie on (you say you have this algorithm already)
 
 2) find the center  of this circle. the line passing through this center
 perpendicular to the plane of the three points passes through the center of
 the sphere.
 
 3) repeat with the unused point and two of the original points. this
 gives you two different lines that both pass through the sphere's
 origin. their interection is the center of the sphere.
 
 4) the radius is easy to compute, it's just the distance from the center to
 any of the original points.
 
 i'll leave the math to you, but this is a workable algorithm. :-)
 
 
 an alternate method would be to take pairs of points: the plane formed
 by the perpendicular bisector of each line segment pair also contains the
 center of the sphere. three pairs will form three planes, intersecting
 at a point. this might be easier to implement.
