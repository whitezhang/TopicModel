 ============================
 
 when i read the comp.graphics group, i never found something about 
 radiosity. is there anybody interested in out there? i would be glad 
 to hear from somebody.
 i am looking for source-code for the radiosity-method. i have already
 read common literature, e. g.foley ... . i think little examples could 
 help me to understand how radiosity works. common languages ( c, c++, 
 pascal) prefered.
 i hope you will help me!
 
 yours
 peter
