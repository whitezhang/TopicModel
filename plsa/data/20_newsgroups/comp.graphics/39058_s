 perhaphs what bill gates and steve jobs are now is the result of the
 natural evolution of a "successful" hacker.  either you make money, go
 to jail (lee feldenstein [sp?]), or just fade away as "oh, that's uncle
 so-and-so who *really* likes computers...".
 
 what a "computer hacker" is and does will change as long as the definition
 of the word "computer" continues to change.
