    sean, the 68070 exists! :-)

    sean, i don't want to get into a 'mini-war' by what i am going to say,
 but i have to be a little bit skeptic about the performance you are
 claiming on the centris, you'll see why (please, no-flames, i reserve
 those for c.s.m.a :-) )
 
    i was in chicago in the last consumer electronics show, and apple had a
 booth there.  i walked by, and they were showing real-time video capture
 using a (radious or supermac?) card to digitize and make right on the spot
 quicktime movies.  i think the quicktime they were using was the old one
 (1.5).
 
    they digitized a guy talking there in 160x2xx something.  it played back quite
 nicely and in real time.  the guy then expanded the window (resized) to 25x by
 3xx (320 in y i think) and the frame rate decreased enough to notice that it
 wasn't 30fps (or about 30fps) anymore.  it dropped to like 15 fps.  then he
 increased it just a bit more, and it dropped to 10<->12 fps. 
 
    then i asked him what mac he was using... he was using a quadra (don't know
 what model, 900?) to do it, and he was telling the guys there that the quicktime
 could play back at the same speed even on an lcii.
 
    well, i spoiled his claim so to say, since a 68040 quadra mac was having
 a little bit of trouble.  and this wasn't even from the hardisk!  this was
 from memory!
 
    could it be that you saw either a newer version of quicktime, or some
 hardware assisted centris, or another software product running the 
 animation (like supposedly macromind's accelerator?)?
 
    don't misunderstand me, i just want to clarify this.
 
    but for the sake of the posting about a computer doing it or not, i can
 claim 320x200 (a tad more with overscan) being done in 256,000+ colors in 
 my computer (not from the hardisk) at 30fps with scala mm210.
 
    but i agree, if we consider mpeg stuff, i think a multimedia consumer
 low-priced box has a lot of market... i just think 3do would make it, 
 no longer cd-i.
