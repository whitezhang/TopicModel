 since this was posted on comp.ai, i assume there is an ai angle to this.  hacking is
 what ai students do when they're really supposed to be doing something else, e.g.
 thesis research & write up, getting their supervisors' pet programs to run properly,
 etc.  no-one gets much glory for hacking, and no-one gets any money out of it.
 producing good free software requires an enormous investment of time & resources that
 not many people can, or want to, afford - particularly during a recession.
 
 in addition, over the last 10 years, i think there has been a de-emphasis on producing
 running programs in ai research, and a greater emphasis on more formal approaches to
 problem-solving.  students have been proving theorems instead of writing programs.
 at a conference a year or two ago, johann de kleer suggested that everyone should
 'get back to the keyboard' and write more programs that demonstrate their ideas -
 and i have to say i'm inclined to agree.
 
 (i don't claim to be a superhacker, but i don't think that invalidates my remarks.
 and i'm sure this isn't the whole story.)
