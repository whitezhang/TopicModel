 concerning the proposed newsgroup split, i personally am not in favor of
 doing this.  i learn an awful lot about all aspects of graphics by reading
 this group, from code to hardware to algorithms.  i just think making 5
 different groups out of this is a wate, and will only result in a few posts
 a week per group.  i kind of like the convenience of having one big forum
 for discussing all aspects of graphics.  anyone else feel this way?
 just curious.
