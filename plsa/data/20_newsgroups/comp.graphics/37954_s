 i am interested in any information on stereoscopic imaging on a sun
 workstation.  for the most part, i need to know if there is any hardware
 available to interface the system and whether the refresh rates are
 sufficient to produce quality image representations.  any information
 about the subject would be greatly appreciated.
 
     thanks!
