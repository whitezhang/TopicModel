 i have a paradise svga with 1mb, the 90c030 chip (1d). the docs say that
 i can display the following modes : 640x480x32k colours and 800x600x32k cols
 if i have the ramdac hicolor chip. i have checked the board and i do have
 such a chip. now, the problem is that i can't get this mode to work !
 graphics workshop 6.1 claims that it can display 24 bit images dithered
 down to 15 bit colour with my board, but it doesn't work. i have tried
 writing some assembler code to get the modes working and i have found out
 that each pixel is addressed by a word ( 16 bit ), but only the lower 8 bits
 are considered ( this happens in 800x600 mode, the 640x480 mode refuses to
 work i.e. remains in text mode ).
 could someone please help me.
