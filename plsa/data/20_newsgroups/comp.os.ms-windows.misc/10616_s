 hello,
 
 i want a little network for 3 users. all users want to run windows.
 the most important things i want for the network are: file-sharing,
 mail utility, two printers on one of the computers and a fax/modem
 card on one of the computers. we all want to use each others harddisk.
 
 my idea was to buy three computers (one 486dx and two 386dx). all
 three have a 40mb local harddisk, the 486 also has a very large
 harddisk. all three also have a network card. the 486 is connected to
 the printers and contains the fax/modem card. and last but not least:
 workgroups for windows.
 
 my questions:
 - is this possible?
 - what exactly are the possibilities and advantages of workgroups
   for windows?
 - will all the computers be fast enough? behind all three, someone
   is working.
 
 thanks,
 martijn
