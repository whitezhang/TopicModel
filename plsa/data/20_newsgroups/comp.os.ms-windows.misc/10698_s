 i think it is important to clear up your first reply.  you gave the
 impression that you should not use smartdrive with stacker.   you are
 correct re: caching the compressed drive.  however, as i understand it,
 you can cache the uncompressed drive.  thus if you have compressed your
 disk c:, you will have a c and probably a d drive under stacker.  c being
 the compressed disk (which is just a large file on d:) and d being the
 uncompressed disk.  you should only attempt to stack d:.  in fact, with
 win 3.1 and smartdrv.exe, it seems smart enough to automatically default
 to stacking your a,b and d drives.
