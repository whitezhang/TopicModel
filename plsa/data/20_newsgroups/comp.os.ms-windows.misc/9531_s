 hi...
 
 	the best sound conversion program i've ever seen is soundtool, which
 is shareware from germany.  i found a copy somewhere in wuarchive.wustl.edu
 a long time ago, but i don't know offhand what directory it was under.  it's
 great at converting files of all types, including mac, next, sun, and
 various pc formats... it's also a great player and editor, with various
 special effects that put windows' sound recorder to shame.  it requires a
 driver for various sound cards... the only builtin one is for the pc speaker
 (and even that sounds pretty good), but if you're just using it to convert
 things, you can convert them in soundtool and then play them in sound
 recorder.
 
 give it a try!
