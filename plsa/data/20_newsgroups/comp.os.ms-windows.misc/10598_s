 
 	yesterday, a friend of mine got a new driver for his card that more
 than doubled the speed... naturally, besides being a tad jealous (same 
 machine -- different cards), it got me thinking... what if i am using a slow
 driver? wouldn't that be _horrible_ ? :) so netlanders, i need samples of
 your collective experience (sic) -- do you proud owners of a trident 8900c
 video card w/ 1mb vram have tried out more than one driver fro ms win 3.1
 which? which is the fastest? not to be selfish, and to give you a motive
 for responding, i promise i am going to collect all the answers, and the
 actual drivers (provided u give me a site to get it from or uuencode&mail)
 get the winmarks using pc magazine`s winbench and... post the results here...
 i am interested in svga drivers only (plain vga users should run the win
 driver, or this is what i 've heard -- dont flame me!) particularly
 800x600x16 and/or 800x600x256 (that should cover the majority of svga users)
 well, what are you waiting for? hit that r or f or whatever...
 all input welcome -- so are money and sun sparcstations...
 thanx in advance...
