 cliff, do you know the difference between "windows" and "win-os/2"?  here's
 a helpful hint:
 
 running "windows" under os/2 2.0 is only possible in real mode, in a dos
 box. of course, this is only possible with windows 3.0, since windows 3.1
 no longer has a "real mode".
 
 the ability to run standard mode, the ability to have an os/2 <-> windows
 clipboard, the ability to run seamless, and a few other things were all added
 by ibm to "win-os/2".
 
 now, everybody who is running "windows" in real-mode in a dos box under os/2
 2.x raise your hand. finally, everybody who is running "win-os/2" under os/2,
 raise your hand.
 
 get the picture, cliff?
