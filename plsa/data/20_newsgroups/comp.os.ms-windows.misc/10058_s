 well, i got  winzip from cica (don't know which version, but i think
 it's the latest, as this is not long ago), and i was initially imressed.
 but here's the low-down:
 
 winzip is a *great* progra, *as long as you only unzip*.  it lets you
 vew files, unzip only selected files, and even puts the files in a
 /checkout directory, and creates a "checkout" .grp and group if you want
 to check the program out.  it even prompts for deletion of these on
 exit, if you didn;t like the program.
 
 *however* (big however over here).  i have problems zipping.  i don't
 konw specifics on this, or ammount of consistency, but sometimes when i
 "zip" a few files, or add a file to a .zip, dos will violate something
 or other, and i'll be asked (in a kind, micro$oft kind of way) to quit
 all applications, quit windows, and restart my computer.  i don't know
 (as i said) how consistent this is, as i jdont' zip much (and when i do,
 now i just go to dos and use it from there, or just use the "run" cmd)
 but i *do* know it's happened when i added files to an existing .zip
 file, *and* when i created a new .zip file, using selected files only.
 i don't know if it's happened when i zip an entire dir.
 
 still, it has a rather nice interface, and quite useful "unzip"ing
 functions.  if the above is fixed, i'll be the first to register the new
 ver.  (as for now, a good old, "run-->unzip *.zip" will work.
 
 (ps> if a new ver *is* out that fixes these, please let me know).
 
 peace,
 mickey
