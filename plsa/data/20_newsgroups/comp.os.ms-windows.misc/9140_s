 on ftp.cica.indiana.edu in pub/pc/win3/misc/winadv.zip is a writeup by
 steve gibson of infoworld with winbench 3.11 and a number of other 
 benchmark results for nine isa and four vlb video cards.  this is a 
 very current upload and is likely to have any card you're currently 
 giving serious consideration.  not in xls format.  latest version of
 winbench that i know of is ver 3.11.  i believe they try to maintain
 the same rating scale between versions, and new versions are released
 to defeat the lastest coding tricks put in by driver programmers to
 beat the benchmarks.  don't know on the last one.
