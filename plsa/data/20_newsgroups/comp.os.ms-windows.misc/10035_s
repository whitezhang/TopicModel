 i have an eisa machine and i just do not understand why most
 eisa video cards only match the performance of their isa
 counterparts. for instance, the eisa orchid pro designer iis-e is
 only about as "fast" as the isa diamond speedstar plus, which isn't
 what i would call "fast."
 
 i don't understand why eisa video cards aren't, as a group, on the
 same level of performance as local bus cards, given that eisa video
 cards have a 32 bit bus to move data around, instead of isa's 8 bits.
 
 since they are not, why would anyone (me included) pay a higher
 cost for a eisa video card when its performance is no better than
 and often worse that a much cheaper isa video board, such as a
 diamond speedstar 24x? from pc magazine's (i think) recent report,
 i know that ati makes a pretty fast eisa video card, but it's
 around $500, which is just about double what my wallet will allow
 me to spend. and, for $500, i could get a diamond viper and still
 have $100 left over (of course, i'd have to get a local bus mother-
 board too...)
 
 can anyone shed some light on my confusion/frustration?
