 i installed windows for workgroups on my network and i'm having problems 
 mapping drives in the file-manager.
 
 situation:
 if i put lastdrive = z in my config.sys, netx will run but i can't access
 drive f: to log in to novell.  
 if i don't put lastdrive = z in my config.sys i can't access other w4wg 
 drives from the file-manager.
 
 it seems that there should be a way to make netx work with the lastdrive = 
 statement in my config.sys.
 
 i would appreciate any help.  it's probably an easy problem that all you 
 windows guru's solved many many moons ago...
 
 thanks,
 tom bilan
