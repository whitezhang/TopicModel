 it depends on wether you are going to replace this with an icon that
 comes standard with windows, or with an icon from some other icon manager.
 
 well, if it is one of those that comes with windows, just highlight the 
 item by clicking once on it, click on 'file' and then on 'properties'.
 you should see a box which says 'change icon'. click on it. you are going
 to be presented with some icons (sometimes just one). if you don't like
 any of those presented, click on the 'browse' box, and look for the file
 'moricons.dll' select it. browse through the icons presented, and just
 double click on your desired icon.
 
 if you want to replace it with an icon from some other icon manager,
 say iconpower for instance, open the icon manager at the bottom of your
 screen, where it will not block the application icon you wish to replace.
 when you have found your desired icon, click on it once, and while holding
 the mouse button down, pull this icon over the one you wish to change.
 and thats it!
 
 regards
