 
     this may be an faq (if so, please direct me to the known answer) but i
     am getting frustrated and looking for help.
 
     i am running win 3.1 with ndw 2.2 on a 486sx with 8 meg of memory and a
     6 meg perm swap file and am getting exceedingly frustrated that my
     applications are not giving back system resources when i close them.
 
     when i load windows i start with about 83% resources available but many
     of the application programs i run regularly (wpwin 5.2, vb 2.0, winqvt
     2.8, lotus organizer, etc.) seem to not return all their resources when
     i exit them.  after a day or two of work i often find myself down under
     50% of available resources even when i have no applications other than
     my shell running.
 
     i am aware this is a known problem; what i am looking for are some
     suggestions of what i might do to mitigate it.  
 
     1. what software is the culprit?  win 3.1, ndw, my applications?  are
     some modes of win 3.1 (standard, real, enhanced) better than others at
     plugging this leak?
 
     2. are their system.ini switches i can set to help plug this leak?
 
     3. do people know of patches or third party software that help with
     this?  seems like increasing or better managing system resources is a
     great market for a third party memory company like qemm.
 
     4. if i run progman instead of ndw will the leak subside?  (i was
     hoping that ndw 2.2 would have plugged this, but it seems no different
     than 2.0 in how it deals with memory and resources.)
 
     5. when i am writing vb code are there things i can do to make it less
     likely my code will eat resources?
 
     6. any other suggestions that i don't know enough to ask for
     specifically?
 
     thanks for your help.  as this is a common problem and i have seen only
     a little discussion of it on the net there are probably others who
     would like to read answers so please publish here rather than sending
     me email.
