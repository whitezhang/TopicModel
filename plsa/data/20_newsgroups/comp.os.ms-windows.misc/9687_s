 i just got mathcad 4.0, and the manual is not clear on the matter.  on page 8:
 
 	:
 	:
 
 * at least 4 megabytes of memory.  all memory about 640k should be configured
   as xms.
 
 	:
 	:
 * at least 8 megabytes of virtual memory....
 
 common sense suggests that you should be able to run it (4+8=12 < 16) but the
 new mathcad is kinda kooky, and thus is not subject to the laws of common
 sense...
