 the original riscs had small instruction sets, and simple ones. the
 idea was that a) every instruction should be completable in a single
 clock cycle and b) to have no microcode and c) extensive pipelines.
 
 a few comparisons (from patterson: reduced instruction set computers.
 cacm v28. 1, 1985):
 
 cpu		year	instructions	microcode
 ---		----	------------	---------
 ibm 370/168	1973	208		420kb
 dec vax 11/780	1978	303		480kb
 ibm 801		1980	120		0
 ucb risc 1	1982	39		0
 stanford mips	1983	55		0
 
 while researching for the vlsi vax, dec discovered that 60% of the vax
 microcode is there to support 20% of the instruction set which
 accounted for a mere 0.2% of all instructions executed. the uvax 32
 subsetted the architecture onto a single chip and used a software
 emulator for these very complex instructions, the full vlsi uvax
 included the entire instruction set, was 5-10 times more copmlex but
 only ranm 20% faster.
 
 cpu		chips	microcode	transistors
 ---		-----	---------	-----------
 uvax 32		2	64k		101k
 vlsi uvax	9	480k		1250k
