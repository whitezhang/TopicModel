 
 hey all...i got an equation editor, and since it didn't automagically
 appear in my "object" dialog box (i.e. insert-->object-->equation), i
 decided to manually place it there.  so i went into win.ini (is there
 another way to do this?), the [embedding] section, and added 
 
 equation=equation,equation,<path\filename>,picture.
 
 didn't work.
 quit windows, go back.  aha: mistake. correct it.  it looks fine.
 start windows...doesn't work.  play with it for a while, at one point
 having two entries to see if one works and th'other don't, and finally i
 get it to work.  the only thing i can see that's different now is that
 it's now the first item on the list, and it used to be the last.  but
 now i end up with *three* "equation" entried, and *all* of them working.
 (and only one entry in win.ini).
 
 so does any netian know what's wrong? or rather, how to correct this?
 (i.e. make "equation"appear but once?).
 
 also, all the entries in the [embedding] appear as above.
 it's obvious that <path\filename> is the executable, or whatever, and
 "picture" has something to do withthe way it appears
 (picture/description?)
 
 but what are the others?
 i.e., in
 
 soundrec=sound,sound,
 whate's the difference between the 1st "sound" and the 2nd?  
 and what is "soundrec"?? (i don't think it's the name of the executable,
 as other entries (e.g. msworkschart=...) aren't)
 
 thanks, i.a.
 mickey
