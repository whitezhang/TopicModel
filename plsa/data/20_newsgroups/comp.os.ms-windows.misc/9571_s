 
 	i have an 8514/a card, and i am using windows in 1024x768 mode 
 	(normal 8514/a font, not small).  in the 386 enhanced mode
 	the dos window font is too small for my 14" monitor. is there a 
 	way to spacify the font size for the dos window? you'll have to 
 	excuse me if there is a trivial answer, since i am fairly new to
 	ms windows world.
 
 	thanks.
