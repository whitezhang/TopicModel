 i know you said e-mail preferred but because this is a common problem
 with wpwin i'll post it here.
 
 the screen only looks like the text is gone. usually you can just
 page-up then page-down and when it does a complete refresh the
 text reappears. i have had--on "rare" occasions--to completely 
 exit (save first) the program. when i reopened the file, all chaos
 had been resolved. i don't know why it does this, but it is annoying.
 the graphics problems have now made me a word for windows user!!
