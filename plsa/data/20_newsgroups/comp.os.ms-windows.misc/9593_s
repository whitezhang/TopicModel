 
 hi,
 
   i recently bought an orchid fahrenheit 1280+. it's a real nice card,
 but i'm having very big problems with it.
 
   the basic problem is that vertical lines are missing from the display
 in windows. something like every other line or so.
 also, when i use a dos gif viewer, namely vpic 6.0c, in fahrenheit 1280
 mode, vertical lines are swapped. it's very strange looking.
 if it uses vesa standards, however, it works great! only it thinks there's
 only 512k on the card. (there's 1mb on there).
 
   i have contacted orchid support, and they tried to be helpful, but didn't
 have the answer. i don't think the card is the problem, since it works great
 on my friend's computer.
 
   here is my setup:
 fahrenheit 1280+, 1mb, bios 1.1
 386-25, opti-chipset2, ami bios 1990, 5mb ram.
 maxtor 120mb harddrive, (slave)
 maxtor 40mb harddrive (master)
 panasonic c1381 monitor,
 version 4.6 windows drivers.
 windows 3.1
 i tried taking all memory managers, etc off, and took all other cards
 (besides disk controller) off.
 
   my friend's setup is 386sx-16, shamrock monitor.
 
 if anyone has seen anything like this, or can otherwise help, i will be very
 greatful.

 tony.
