 when i use file manager's disk copy, i find that
 windows (3.1) can read the whole 1.2mb disk at one time, 
 but only 98% of a 1.44 disk. it looks like a problem
 of memory. however, the pc has 4mb ram. there should be some 
 way to allocat more extended memory for disk copy. 
 please advise me on this matter. thanks in advance.
