 i think the support droid was malfunctioning and confused the disk space
 limit with the virtual address space limit.  as far as the disk is
 concerned, you are limited only by the amount of contiguous free space.
 the limit that causes the message, "windows will only use ...," is the
 amount of virtual address space that the virtual memory manager will
 create, and this is a function of the amount of free memory that you have
 when windows starts.
 
 in the [386enh] section of system.ini, you can specify a parameter:
 
 	pageovercommit=multiplier
 
 the following description is from the windows resource kit:
 
 	this entry specifies the multiplier what determines the amount of
 	linear address space the vmm will create for the system, which is
 	computed by rounding up the amount of available physical memory to
 	the nearest 4 mb and then multiplying that value by the value
 	specified for pageovercommit=.  increasing this value increases the
 	amount of available linear address space, causing the size of data
 	structures to increase.  this also increases paging activity
 	proportionately and can slow down the system.  you can specify a
 	value between 1 and 20.  the default is 4.  to change this entry,
 	you must edit system.ini.
