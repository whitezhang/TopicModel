 compress?  i have not corrupted data due to having caches other than
 pc-cache running, so that is not it.  the first time i try to run ami
 pro after loading windows, it loads, but causes (i think it was a) 
 segmentation fault in amipro.exe right before it finishes, with all times
 after that only managing to get to the logo box that first pops up when
 it begins loading, and then causes a general protection fault in module
 amiproui.dll at 0002:1147.  i have not been able to fix this problem except
 by reinstalling ami pro.  this has happened twice, with both times being
 after having ran compress on my hard drive.  btw, i am not running stacker
 or any other disk compression programs, and if you don't already know,
 pctools compress is actually a defragger, despite it's name.  my system is
 a 386-40mhz, with 16mb of ram and a nec (oem) hard drive, etc, but that
 shouldn't make a difference.
 
 please email me as i can't keep up with the newsgroup, and it will cut down
 on net traffic anyways.  thanks.
