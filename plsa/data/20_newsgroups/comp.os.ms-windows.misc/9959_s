 if you want to get them and get them now (also the most up to date) use
 the bbs at 1-408-439-9096.  they may take an hour to download so do it
 when rates are low.  yeah, i know it costs but locking up your system
 gets old quick.  maybe someone has them on the net.  i've got the
 stealth drivers.
