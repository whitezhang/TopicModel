 	just got a ss24x based on its good ratings, but am a little
 under-impressed.  first, is it's performance in 16.7 mill. supposed
 to be comparable to a trident 8900 (or other unaccelerated vga)?  i 
 came up with only ok performance on winspeed.  in 256, it was between
 good and great.  second, does anyone know where to get that jpg viewer
 "for the ss24x".  i saw it on cica or something.  does it work better.
 
 thanks for any help.
