 when i use the terminal software for windows such as terminal.exe or 
 crossttalk, it doesn't use the whole window.  i mean, when the software's
 window size is max, it still scrolls around the 2/3 of window.  it does not
 use whole window.  i set "stty rows 30", but still the same. scrolls at 2/3
 from the top of the windows.  could anyone tell me how to setup these software
 to use whole window?
 
 thanks in advance.
