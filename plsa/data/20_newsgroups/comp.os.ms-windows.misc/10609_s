 i would like to find a windows 3.x driver for a video board that is
 based on the chips & technologies chipset.  the actual board is a
 scorpion framegrabber made by univision.  it is based on the c&t
 chipset, but only barely supports the graphics mode.  i am hoping that
 any c&t driver could be used in the 640x480x256 mode.
 
 thanks.
