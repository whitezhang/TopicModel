 atm will do nothing for your truetype fonts.  if your truetype fonts are
 sufficient for your needs, don't run atm.  i have a lot of fonts that i can
 install either as type-1 postscript (under atm) or as truetype.  i have
 noticed that:
 
     1.	truetype font files are at least 1/3 larger than their type-1
 	equivalents.  if you are using a disk compressor, though, be aware
 	that truetype fonts will compress, whereas type-1 fonts will not
 	(they are encrypted).
 
     2.	with a 300 dpi laser printer, the "artificial bold" version of a
 	truetype font is indistingishable from the original, forcing me to
 	install the actual bold (and bold-italic, etc.) variants if i want
 	to use them.  type-1 postscript fonts under atm generate a visually
 	distinct bold variant from the base font.  i realize that the
 	artificial bold font that atm generates is aesthetically inferior
 	to the hand-generated bold truetype variant, but it is sufficient
 	for my needs, and not having to install bold variants saves me 50%
 	on disk space (uncompressed).
