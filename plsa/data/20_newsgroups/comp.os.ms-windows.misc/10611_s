 you don't, and never had to.  that's what enhanced shells are for.  remember 
 4dos and ndos?  i mean, come on, you can't expect dos to cover everything 
 from r1.0.  microsoft has other projects to work on.

 i don't think they deliberately crippled the project.  on the other hand, it 
 is a technical achievement for what it does considering that it rides on
 top of dos.  i mean, you get a gui with reasonable speed on a pc.  with 
 xwindows running on top of linux or something similar you're still gonna 
 need a fast processor.

 except for the people who use dos programs, which means about 75% or more of 
 the business world.
