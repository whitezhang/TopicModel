 ==> introduction
 
   cosy_pak is set of packages and notebooks for classical control and 
 (some) modern (state space) control analysis and design methods. the
 notebooks in cosy_pak follow a typical `control engineering i' course
 taught at many universities around the world for the junior/senior 
 level undergraduates. there is no fee to use cosy_pak but certain 
 responsibilities are expected of the user (see copyright notice in the 
 readme file included below). for starters e-mail / fax / mail (post) 
 the registration form included in the readme file.
 
 cosy_pak is available via `anonymous ftp' from
 
           mishna.esys.cwru.edu (internet no : 129.22.40.23) 
 
 in the /pub directory. 
 
 p.s.: a typical ftp session in unix is given after the readme file.

 **********************************************************************
 
 --> changes in version 0.9 (update from v0.81 to v0.9)
 
 	in this version, we have revised cosy_pak to take advantage of 
 the more robust signal processing functions available in mathematica v2.1.  
 since mathematica 2.1 provides a better  and  working 
 laplacetransform and inverselaplacetransform functions than 
 mathematica v2.0 did, we adopted them. this has made cosy_pak 
 smaller. thus brian evans' signal processing packages that supported 
 the laplacetransform  and inverselaplacetransform functions in the 
 cosy_pak v0.81 are no longer needed directly by cosy_pak v0.9. for 
 power users who  use signal processing we still recommend the use of the very  
 fine  brian evans package on signal processing (available at 
 the anonymous  ftp site gauss.eedsp.gatech.edu  or  ip # 130.207.226.24).  on  
 the  downside, the disadvantage of this update 
 can be that mathematica 2.1 requires more runtime resources than its 
 previous version. 
 
 
 ***********************************************************************	
 --> for mathematica 2.0 users
 	
 	we have included the laplacetransform package from mathematica 2.1 in  
 the directory `for_2.0'. please move all files and directory under for_2.0 into  
 the calculus directory under mathematica packages directory. 
 
 **************************************************************************
 	    
 --> introduction
    
     this is an unsupported release of cosy_pak - a control systems 
 analysis package for symbolic control systems analysis using 
 mathematica 2.1. classical control systems analysis and design methods and some  
 modern control systems methods have been implemented in this package. 
     
     this package and the attendant notebooks were developed on a 
 next (tm) computer (a unix based workstation). they have been 
 used as a supplementary teaching aid along with  standard control 
 engineering texts (ogata [1991], phillips and harbor [1991]) for 
 undergraduate courses in `control engineering i' taught at the systems 
 engineering department of cwru. in addition to the next, they have 
 also been tested successfully on apple macintosh computers (tm), and, 
 ibm pc's (tm) running ms windows(tm). we would be very much interested 
 to hear from you if you or anybody you know uses this software on 
 platforms not mentioned above. ibm users however will have to 
 evaluate the notebooks first to visualize the graphics.
 
     once installed (see below for instructions), this  collection  of  
 mathematica  packages  can be loaded by any user. bundled with the 
 packages are many notebooks ("cosy_notes") which demonstrate  
 the functionality of these packages. the notebooks follow a plan of 
 many fine, standard, undergraduate control engineering text books 
 listed in the references. examples used in these notebooks have 
 been collected from the various references given at the end of this 
 file. the contents of the notebooks in the "cosy_notes" directory are

 --> compressed files
 
         the files that contain  a  complete set of the cosy_pak v0.9
 packages and notebooks for mathematica are:
 
  cosy_pak_09.tar.z     		compressed tar file for unix systems
 	
  cosy_pak_09.sit.hqx     	compressed sit file for macintosh 
  				systems and encoded by binhex 4.0 
 				format (requires the   shareware
 				 stuffit file v 1.5.1 or higher). 
 	
  cosy_pak_ibm_09.zip    	zip file for the ibm pc running ms-dos
     
      once expanded the mathematica files can also be used on 
 macintosh / ibm pc / unix systems also.
 
 
 --> installation of cosy_pak
 
  o in unix command line type the following command:
 
       zcat cosy_pak_09.tar.z | tar xvf -
 
  o in macintosh open the .sit.hqx file using the shareware
     stuffit v 1.5.1 or higher.
   
  o in ibm command line type the following command:
 
       pkunzip -o -d cosy_pak_ibm_09.zip
 
 note: this .zip file was zipped by zip utility v2.0. you must use 
 pkunzip version 2.0 or  higher to unzip it.  ibm pc's may limit the 
 directory name characters to eight. in that event type "pkunzip -o -d 
 cosy_pak.zip.  you can also unzip the cosy_pak_ibm_09.zip file on any 
 unix machine if you have unzip utility on it.
 
 
      uncompressing and untarring "cosy_pak_09.tar.z" or unzipping 
 "cosy_pak_ibm_09.zip" will create a directory called "cosy_pak".
          	
 once the files are expanded you should see a single directory 
 "cosy_pak" containing the following three files, four 
 sub-directories and their contents:
 
 sub-directories in "cosy_pak":  
   cosypak    - contains control tool box packages 
   manual     - cosy_pak manual in .ps, .rtf, .txt, and .wn formats. 
   cosy_notes - contains notebooks 
   for_2.0    - contains laplace transform package from mathematica 2.1
   		for mathematica 2.0 users.	 
     		
 files in directory "cosypak":
   chap1.m   chap2.m   chap3.m  chap4.m  chap5.m   chap6.m  chap7.m
 	
 files in directory "cosy_notes":
 	01_introduction.ma	  
 	02_math_model.ma
 	03_1_transient_response.ma   
 	03_2_transient_response.ma   
 	03_3_transient_response.ma   
 	04_steady_state_response.ma
 	05_root_locus.ma	  
 	06_freq_response.ma 
 	07_state_space.ma         
 	
 files in directory "for_2.0":
 	laplacetransform.m     diracdelta.m	
 	sub-directories in "cosy_pak":	common
 	files in directory "common":  support.m
 
 ********************* important ********************	
 
 	the notebook example files(.ma files) will be under the 
 "cosy_notes" directory.  to use the notebooks, move the directory `cosypak' to  
 a 
 directory that  mathematica can recognize :
 	
         /locallibrary/mathematica/packages     	on a unix machine,
         my_harddisk:mathematica:packages   	on an apple macintosh,
         c:\winmath\packages                  	on an ibm pc.
 
 	at the beginning of the "initialization" cell of each notebook 
 in  "cosy_notes" directory, we list the example about how to make 
 mathematica identify the directory:
 
 	(* initialization of path *)
 
 	(* example for a unix machine  (default) *) 
 	(*
 	$path=join[$path,
 	{"/locallibrary/mathematica/packages"}];
 	*)
 	
 	(* example for an apple macintosh  *) 
 	(*
 	$path=join[$path,
 	{"my_harddisk:mathematica:packages"}];
 	*)
 	
 	(* example for ibm pc 	
 	 *)
 	(*
 	$path=join[$path,	
 	 {"c:\winmath\packages"}];	
 	*)	
 
 change the pathname according to your machine by removing the 
 mathematica comment sign `(*' and `)*' before and after `$path' 
 setting.
 
 	this command makes mathematica recognize the directory
 
         /locallibrary/mathematica/packages     	on a unix machine
         my_harddisk:mathematica:packages   	on a apple macintosh
         c:\winmath\packages                	on an ibm pc
 
 
 --> mathematica 2.0 users
 	
 	we include the laplacetransform package from mathematica 2.1 in 
 the directory for_2.0. please move all files and directory under for_2.0 
 into the calculus directory under mathematica packages directory. 
 
 
 --> getting started
 
        after installation, start mathematica and open the notebooks in 
 the "cosy_notes" directory. all notebooks load their own packages. 
 navigate in the notebooks and enjoy. ibm users however will have to 
 evaluate the notebooks to visualize the graphics.
