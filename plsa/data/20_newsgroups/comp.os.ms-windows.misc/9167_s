 and why they are considering using winbench as a test, they may want
 to read everything steve gibson has said on the subject in his
 infoworld column the past couple of month.  in short, virtually
 every board manufacturer cheats on the test by writing things in the
 driver that is there only to make the board appear faster on the
 winbench suite.  so the winbench score has no bearing in reality to
 how cards stack up on real world tasks.
 
 in the last pc-magazine they benchmarked some of the new accelerators,
 and admitted that many of them 'cheated' on winbench.  interestingly,
 they 'allowed' one type of cheating behaviour (caching for bitblt
 operations, no matter how unreal), yet did not allow a couple of other
 types of cheating behaviour that some of the cards used.  at least
 one card was eliminated from the "editor's choice" because of
 cheating on the benchmark.
