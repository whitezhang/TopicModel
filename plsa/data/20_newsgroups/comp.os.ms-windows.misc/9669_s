 i have a small windows program which i can not get to work; 
 the program looks vaguely like this:
 
 =============================================
 char f1[80];
 
 int winmain(...
 {
   lstrcpy ((lpstr)f1, "hello");
   ...
 }
 
 long far pascal wndproc(...
 {
   lstrcpy ((lpstr)f1, "hello");
   ...
 }
 
 ============================================= 
 i am using large model under windows 3.1; after linking without
 errors, the rc program said
 
 sorting preload segments and resources into fast-load section
 copying segment 1 (53679 bytes)
 rc : fatal error rw1031: segment 1 and its
      relocation information is too large for load
      optimization. make the segment loadoncall or
      rerun rc using the -k switch if the segment must
      be preloaded.
 
 using the -k switch seems to interfere with the proper function of
 the second lstrcpy call... can anybody explain what is going on and/or
 how to fix it?
 
 
 thanks...
