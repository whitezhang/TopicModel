 
 surely some one of you is familiar with what a mail-order company goes
 through. this company has only a few products, but thousands of clients.
 i need a sales, billing, and receivables program to handle the thing,
 but i need to be able to customize it myself, own the source, etc. anyone
 willing to sell me the basic stuff (in any development language) i'll
 be willing to pay about $1,000 to. 
 
 it has to be ready now. i need this sort of solution immediately. with more
 time i'll just develop one myself. if you can have me a prototype in
 two weeks, you can make some quick cash.
