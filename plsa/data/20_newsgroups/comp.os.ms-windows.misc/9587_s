 i have a 486dx-33 computer with a soundblaster 1.0 card.  i'm running
 microsoft windows v3.1.  i have the sb driver set up properly to play
 normal sounds (.wav files, etc.).  i want to play midi files through the
 media player that is included with windows.  i know i have to set up the
 patch maps or something in the midi-mapper in the control panel.  i know
 nothing about midi.  (this is to be the way i'll get my feet wet.)
 
 how do i set up windows so that i can play midi files?
