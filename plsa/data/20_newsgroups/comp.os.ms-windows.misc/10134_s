 lets see... what ms products don't have major bugs in them?  oh, but
 the fifth release the bugs are generally cleared up, even if their
 customers must buy new "releases" from them that are little more than
 bug fixes.  anyone who buys a $2500 computer system and then runs ms
 windows on it is in desperate need of sympathy.  
 
 oh wait! ms innovated the plastic housing on the ms mouse---didn't
 they?  "logitech inside"

 you can't even really call it secondary creativity when a company
 gathers together a bunch of knock-off packages and peddles them to
 neophytes.  if ms does anything, it appears someone has to do it
 first.  it appears that ms is finding out that throwing money at
 technological problems is by no means a guaranteed solution.
