 please help if you can. whenever i try to run windows useing the 16
 million color mode with the drivers supplyed with my diamond stelth 24x
 it will lock up requireing a full system reset to break out. the drivers
 that i have for windows are v.1.00 for windows 3.1 (which is the version
 of windows i am useing)
 
 my setup
 ---------
 386dx40 128kcach
 4 megs of ram
 14" svga touch monitor non-interlaced
 ami bios
 
 any and all help would be apreciated, the card seems to work fine in other
 modes, i usually run windows in 800x600 mode and probs at all, so i am
 hopeing it is a driver and not a card problem.
