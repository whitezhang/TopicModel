 do you mean the icons _of_ the program groups, or the icons of the
 individual programs _in_ the program groups?  i assume you mean the
 latter, and the answer is: sure you can.  just click once (not double)
 on the application icon, then alt-f p (file | properties).  click on the
 change icon box and tell it the icon filename.  or use the browse
 sub-selection.

 i use alt-tab.  hold the alt key and repeatedly press tab until you see
 program mangler up.  then release the alt key.

 english is my native language and i love it.  but don't try to tell me
 that it's easy to learn or that it makes sense.  if it were, "baseline"
 would rhyme with "vaseline".
