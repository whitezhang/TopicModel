 
 i friend of mine installed dos6 at work and is hooked up to a novell
 network, running netware 386 v.3.11.  the problem he's having is that the
 doublespace program is using drive 'h' as the swap drive, which is
 confliting with the networks mapped drives.
 
 is there switch to place the swap drive to someother drive?
 please e-mail....thanks a bunch!!
