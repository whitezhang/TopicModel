 i have a 386/33 with 8 megs of memory
 
 i have noticed that lately when i use programs like wpfw or corel draw
 my computer "boggs" down and becomes really sluggish!
 
 what can i do to increase performance?  what should i turn on or off
 
 will not loading wallpapers or stuff like that help when it comes to
 the running speed of windows and the programs that run under it?
 
 thanx in advance
 
 derek
