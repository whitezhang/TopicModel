 while i do not think he is lying, i also feel hesitant to take anybody "on their
 word" unless they can attribute a source for thier claims. with all the fud 
 and misinformations and misconceptions and outright lies flying around the 
 advocacy newsgroups, i do not trust any unsubstantiated rumor or claim 
 - especially from any employees of ibm's or microsoft, or anyone who seems to
 have a vested interest.
