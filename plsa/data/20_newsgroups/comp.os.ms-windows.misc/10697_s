 aha, i think i found the problem and it isn't dirt!  another guy here was 
 using a different kind of mouse and was using 640x400x16 video driver (the 
 default vga for windows).  he has an s3 localbus card like i do and when i 
 loaded the s3 video driver in windows for him, his mouse became jumpy too.  
 seems like it is the s3 driver!  is there any newer one than version 1.4 
 that would solve this problem?  it is really bad.  i have to use the 
 keyboard instead sometimes!  the s3-w31.zip on cica is version 1.4 (which is 
 the same version that came with my card).
