 
 hi, 
 
 i have a simple question. is it possible to create a overlapped thickframe
 window without a title bar; ie
 
 	(ws_overlapped | ws_thickframe) & ~ws_caption 
 
 
 i don't seem to be able to get rid off the title bar.
 
 i have another question:
 
 i have a overlapped window(say v) which has few child windows (a,b,c, etc)
 the window shows up with all it's children fine. now, i create another 
 child(t) with a ws_thickframe style and placed on top of one or more of
 it's siblings. style ws_thickframe is used so that i can resize it. how do
 i make sure that the child 't' will always be at the top of it's siblings.
 i used setwindowpos() and bringwindowtotop() without success. what's happening
 is that while i am resizing 't' it shows up but as soon as i let go, it goes
 behild it's siblings.
 
 any help would be greatly appreciated.
