 
 using a windows 3.1 printer driver, i would like to "print to a file", with
 output as a postscript file.  later, i would like to take this postscript file
 to a machine with an attached hewlett packard 4m laser printer, and print the
 document at 600 dots per inch resolution.
 
 i would like to use this method to print from wordperfect for windows, and from
 an image processing program that can output images in postscript.
 
 here's the problem:  the windows postscript printer driver (pscript.drv)
 doesn't allow me to specify 600 dpi.  in fact, the setup dialog for this driver
 does have a pull-down menu for "resolution", but the only choice given in the
 menu is 300!  not a really useful menu.
 
 any ideas?
