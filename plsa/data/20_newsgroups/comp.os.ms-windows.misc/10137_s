 take a look at winqvt/net -- the latest version is qvt/net 3.4
 it comes in versions that are direct to packet driver, as well as a pc nfs 
 version.
 
 it is priced quite low; registration = $40, student registration = $20, and is 
 a nice package -- comes complete with vt220 terminal emulation, ftp, pop3 
 client, lpr, and nntp client.
 
 you can ftp it from "biochemistry.bioc.cwru.edu" /pub/qvtnet/qvtnet34.zip
 
 it was also uploaded to ftp.cica.indiana.edu recently.
