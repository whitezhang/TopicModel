 hi,
 
 if you have developed your own windows application you must have a 
 sdk of some sort that contains the hc.exe or hc31.exe file to 
 compile and generate .hlp files out of .rtf files.
 rtf files are generated by a wordprocessor like word for dos or w4w.
 
 if this is not the solution be more specific about your application.
