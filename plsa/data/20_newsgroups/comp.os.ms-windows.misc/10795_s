 no, but...
 
 you can allocate real static data within code segments!
 when you need more dynamic memory you can allocate data on the global heap.
 
 you can forget most of what was written about memory management. under 3.1
 you have paged virtual memory. you can lock every block without hampering
 the memory manager. you can use far pointer everytime without always lock/
 unlocking the memory block.
 
 an besides: dll's are mostly just disguised exe's, that happen to be called
 by another task.
