 there's a program called "icon frightener" included with the book stupid
 windows tricks by bob levitus and ed tittel (addison-wesley, 1992).  it's
 freeware.  if it's not on the net anywhere, i'll happily email a copy to
 someone who's willing to upload it (i can't upload through our internet
 firewall).
