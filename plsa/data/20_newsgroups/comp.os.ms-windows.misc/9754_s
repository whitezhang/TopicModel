 hi,
   i am working on gathering data on the way that users use
 computers. this involves getting subjects to type and use a 
 mouse. i want to be able to watch what they are doing without 
 being in the same room. it would be ideal if i could watch
 the session on another monitor without the subjects knowledge.
 i believe that spliting the monitor cable will only work for
 short distances, ie <5m. i will need to be approx 10m away, as
 the cable travels.
   the pc's are connected to a tcp\ip network and run windows 3.1.
 is there any software that will allow me to watch what is 
 happening on another pc?
 thanks
 regards
