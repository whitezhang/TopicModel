 hello winnetters:
 
 i have seen a great deal of discussion herein on the relative merits of 
 ms access and borland paradox/win.  however, are there any users out there 
 with experience with the database package called "approach".  it has gotten
 a number of very good reviews from the various mags. and it seems like it
 would require less hardware overhead than paradox.  i have ruled out access
 because some aspects of it are extremely non-intuitive, e.g. requiring a
 field to always have a value.  i like what i've seen of paradox, but it
 seems like the resource requirements are greater than what i have (386/25 mhz,
 6 mb ram).
 
 so, please provide me with your thoughts are "approach", good and bad.  thanks.
