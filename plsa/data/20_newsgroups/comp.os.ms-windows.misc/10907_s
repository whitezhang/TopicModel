 does anyone have any information or better, first-hand experience,
 of the new epson bubblejet printer - stylus 800??
 
 i'm particularly interested in hearing how well it works under windows;
 i presume that a special printer driver is required - is it supplied
 as standard? is it able to print everything that a standard postscript
 laserprinter could??
 
 many thanks for any replies - george
