 speaking of that.....
 my comp has "emmexclude=$e000-$efff" or something of that nature in the
 system.ini file.  or some system file for *windows*.
 
 i was just wondering if having that line in a *windows* startup file is
 better, as it will give some more memory on dos apps., but disable it
 when you run windows?
 
 (actually, i *do* think that that line is also in the system.1 file)
 
 peace,
 mickey
