 
 i know this is probably a faq, but...
 
 i installed the s/w for my ati graphics card, and it bashed my windows
 logo files.  when i start windows now, it has the 3.0 logo instead of
 the 3.1 logo.
 
 i thought the files that controlled this were
 
 \windows\system\vgalogo.rle
 \windows\system\vgalogo.lgo	
 
 i restored these files, but it didn't change the logo.  anyone know what
 the correct files are?
 
 thanks.
