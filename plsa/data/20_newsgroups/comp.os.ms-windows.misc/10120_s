 determine the last dblspace drive required and set that as lastdrive in your
 config.sys  if you are using w4ww you might want to go a couple of drives higher
 to give you some shared drive space.  reboot and novell will set its first
 drive one above the lastdrive in config.sys.  you might have to remap some
 of your novell drives if they were originally mapped to lower drives.  make
 sure that the bat file or whatever you are using to log onto novell is set
 to the correct drive (one above the lastdrive setting in the config.sys file).
