 well, i thought that highmem.sys would do that too. i just took out emm386  
 of my config.sys, and i'm still loading my other drivers high (mouse, vga  
 shadow bios, dos-key etc.) i haven't checked mem/c, but i believe i have  
 managed to load them high (ie between 640kb and 1024kb).
 
 also, ever since i took out emm386, windows loads slightly faster, i get  
 about 3 extra meg of freemem in windows (i'm running 386 enhanced with 4  
 meg ram, 7 meg swap) and i got rid of my ctrl-alt del reboot problem  
 (before, the computer would not reboot using ctrl-alt-del after exiting  
 windows). 
 
 i would really like to keep emm386 out of my config.sys. anybody else have  
 info on this???
