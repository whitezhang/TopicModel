 gee, i remember the old 8" floppy disks we used on an s-100 cp/m system
 back in high school.  not to mention those old 24" multi-platter disk 
 packs that held about 15mb that went in the big washing machine
 drives at the local college i took some programming classes at.
 and this was even in the early '80's....
