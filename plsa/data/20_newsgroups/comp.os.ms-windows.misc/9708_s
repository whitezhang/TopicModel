 you do not need the sdk. what you need (and can get free) are
 
 location: ftp.cica.indiana.edu
 index:      /pub/pc/win3/index
 
 first get /pub/pc/win3/uploads/what.zip (~1.3m) this contains the help
 compiler among other things. it is free from microsoft.
 
 then get these (i think these are free too)
 
 dir:	/pub/pc/win3/programr
 files:  hag.zip, whag.zip wfwhlp.zip
 
 these are shareware
 
 dir:    /pub/pc/win3/util
 files:	hwab21.zip, qdhelp.zip, qdtool.zip
 
 dir:	/pub/pc/win3/winword
 files:	drhelpev.zip (macros for word 2.0 to convert doc to hlp files).
