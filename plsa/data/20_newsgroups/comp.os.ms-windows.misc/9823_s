 salutations!
 	i don't usually subscribe to these newsgroups so i would really
 appreciate it if someone could possibly e-mail me the answer to my problem.
 i have been using windows 3.1 since buying it last winter but i have just
 now come across an annoying bug. i now have about 8 different groups in
 program manager but it seems that everytime i install something new that
 makes a new group, it promptly disappears after i turn of windows!
 this happened when i installed excel and winfax pro v.3. they both created
 their own groups but when i turned off windows and reran them, they were
 gone. i had to manually pull them up as new items and put them in a
 previously existing group as all new gropus disappear as soon as i turn
 off windows.
 	my set up:
 			precision 386dx-25 w/ 4 megs
 			trident 8900c with 1 meg 
 			windows 3.1 running in 800x600 colour mode
 			logitech mouseman
 			
 thank you in advance!
