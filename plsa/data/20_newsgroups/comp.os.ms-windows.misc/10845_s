 
 my windows 3.1 installation has somehow gone awry.  whenever i try to run
 windows now, the logo comes up ok, but when it tries to enter windows
 itself, the screen gets totally screwed up as if it's in the wrong
 graphics mode or something.  it's completely illegible although functional
 as i can still exit to dos with an alt-e return combination.
 
 i tried to reinstall windows again, but if you recall, halfway through the
 installation process, install takes you into windows and there my graphics
 problem surfaces again so i cannot complete the re-installation.
 
 all this started after trying to get a game working on my system but my
 config.sys and autoexec.bat have been restored to what they were before
 this problem cropped up.
 
 i'm running a 486-33dx with a diamond stealth vram (i've resinstalled the
 stealth video drivers again but with no luck).  i'm also using qemm and
 stacker 3.0 but windows is installed on an un-stacked partition.  and of
 course, it worked perfectly before.
 
 any email replies and suggestions would be appreciated.  thanks.
