 a while ago i installed spss for windows as part of an evaluation. once
 the evaluation was complete i duly deleted the software from my pc.
 
 unfortunately there is still a "ghost" of spss left: when i run
 something like "write" and go to embed an object then "spss chart"
 appears on the list of objects i'm offered. i looked around all
 the obvious "ini" files without success. the next thing i tried
 was looking for the string "spss chart" in every file in the 
 windows directory. it turned up in a file called req.dat (or
 reg.dat). unfortunately the file was binary and so i didn't feel
 inclined to edit it.
 
 i'd welcome a solution for removing spss from the list of ole servers.
