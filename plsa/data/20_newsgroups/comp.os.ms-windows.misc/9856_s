 i'm not 100% sure, but i think the t800 was a 25mhz transputer?  so ya tie
 a gazillion of them together to get 100mips.  (the newest is the t9000
 which kicks anyone's butt :)... haven't seen them used much though).
 
 anyway, to respond, i think the pentium (cisc) is better than the more advanced
 risc (e.g., like the alpha, etc.  the 66mhz pentium has approximately the
 same "performance" as the superduper 133mhz alpha - here, performance is the
 weird specint92 that everyone refers to? - this is what i *heard* - the
 alpha still kicks in the p5's butt in fp - again, this is what i *heard*).
 and in the computing world, if you sell lots of chips (like intel), and
 make it faster (like intel), you are the winner (like intel), even though
 you have a sucky architecture from over 10 years ago (like intel :0).
 
 if you can make a "cisc" chip (superscalar, superduperpipelined, superfast)
 with the ideas behind the "risc" ideology, you got a cisc chip.  and then
 i admit i can't see the advantages of risc over cisc...
 
 if the latest technology is a generation behind, then it sucks (relatively
 speaking).
 
 now i may sound like i like intel, but i'll have to say that the p5 is some
 real kick butt pile of si and sio2...
 
 but i hope that motorola really catches up with the 68k line... or i'm gonna
 start crying...
