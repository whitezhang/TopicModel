 
    i have been using winqvt/net 2.81 under win3.1 (dos 5.0) for quite
 sometime without any problem.  i recently installed dos 6.0 on my 386-40 pc
 and i cannot run winqvt/net any more.  i keep getting "packet received for
 invalid port-reset sent" messages on the console window.  i can't
 get more than 1 telnet window and can't use ftp!!!
 
    any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
 
    thanks,
