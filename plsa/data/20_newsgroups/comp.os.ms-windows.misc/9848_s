   i had the same problem.  at first, i thought it was the video driver and 
   made sure i had the most current drivers, because the problem was most
   evident at svga resolution modes.  it didn't help and after a bit of
   experimentation, determined that the problem existed in standard vga
   resolution mode. it was just much less noticeable.
   
   my mouse was an older ms serial version i bought second hand in 1990. it
   worked just fine in dos and dos based graphic applications.  on the 
   guess that the problem was with the resolution of the mouse, i borrowed
   a new mouse (a ms bus model) and tried it.  that solved the problem.
   so, if your mouse is old, you may want to try replacing it for a newer
   one.
