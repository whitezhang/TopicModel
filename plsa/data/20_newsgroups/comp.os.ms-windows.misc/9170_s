 there you go.  com1 and com3 use the same irq, therefore you can't use
 a mouse on com3 and a modem on com1, or vice versa.  it's a limitation
 of dos.
 
 and in fact windows will not see a mouse on anything other than com1
 or com2.  accept this fact, and either get a bus mouse, or get a new
 computer.

 no.  the advice above applies....
