 
 is anyone familiar with a virus that infects the winhelp.exe file?
 
 i have recently noticed some unusual system behavior and ran
 norton antivirus for windows.  it indicated a possible unknown
 virus in the winhelp.exe file in both the mwindows and winos2
 directories.  neither file changed since i installed my os/2
 system in january as far as i know.
 
 any information about this possible virus and suggestions on
 remedies would be greatly appreciated.
