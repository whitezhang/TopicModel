 if you are planning on using this on a regular basis, conncting the printer
 to file can become bothersome because windows then asks you for the filename
 that you want to create. i've found that putting a line in system.ini in the
 ports section with just a path and filename works. the only problem is that
 if you send more than one job, the second one deletes the first.
