 
 i'm new to the ms-windows world, and while a fairly competent
 sparc/nextstep programmer, i have no idea which development kit
 to purchase.  i have heard good things about borland c++ with
 application frameworks and microsoft's visual c++ with sdk (?)
 
 what i would like is peoples comments on which package or set
 of tools they find useful or productive and why.  there are a
 plethora of other kits such as gui toolkits available and i'm
 wondering which of these are best in terms of reliability, plug
 and go type operation, readability and so on.  i'd be interested
 in comments on these or anything else you may find useful.
 
 i will summarize to the net if there is enough interest.
 
 
 thanks,
 veenu
