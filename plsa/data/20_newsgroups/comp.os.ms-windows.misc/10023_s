 i've been running dos 6 for about a month.  i was generally impressed with
 the improvements:  the multiple boot configurations were great, the
 new commands were nice, and doublespace worked fine (twice as slow for
 large data transfers, twice as fast for small with smartdrv).
 
 until now.
 
 this morning at 4 am while i was working on my research paper, i had to
 reboot a hung dos program (that did no disk i/o) from within windows 3.1.
 when my machine finished rebooting, i found my windows directory and about two
 thirds of my other directories were irreversibly corrupted.
 
 i cannot afford problems like this.  i'm returning to dos 5.

 p.s.  i've also noticed bad sector errors from doublespace where none should
       exist.
