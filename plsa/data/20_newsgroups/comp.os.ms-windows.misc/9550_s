 look on ftp.cica.indiana.edu for gws.....zip. they embed the release
 number in the name, and i'm not sure what the lates is. it is graphics
 workshop. there is a dos and a windows version. both work great. i even
 had someone bring me some images from the amiga, and converted them to
 great looking wallpaper as 256-color .bmp files
 
 if you can't find it, repost, or let me know, and i'll dig up the archive.
