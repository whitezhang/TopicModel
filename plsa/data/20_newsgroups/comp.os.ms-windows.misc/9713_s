 presumeably, you mean without a _permanent_ swap file. if windows needs a
 swap file, it will upo and create one if a permanent one doesn't exist.
 permanent is generally faster though. i don't know why mathcad wouldn't
 be happy with either type--ver. 3.0 is and so should any program conforming
 to the win specification.
