 there has been a long running discussion over changing the startup
 logo for windows for a few weeks here. while all the copy methods are
 great & haven't seen any mention of a program that will do it for
 you..... 
 
 well... i found one on cica called winlogo (can't remember where
 unfortuantely), and it seems to work real well... even comes with a
 couple example .rle files. 
 
 what i'd really like though is a way to create .rle files myself,
 specifically the rle4 format mentioned in the winlogo readme file. can
 anyone point me in the direction of such a beast with a real directory
 path ?? all the ones i've seen mentioned didn't pan out.....
