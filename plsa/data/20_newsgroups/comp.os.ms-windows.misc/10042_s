 
 title says it all: i'm in need of a truetype oem character set font - ie
 one that contains the line drawing and other characters in the pc 
 character set similar to those you get when running a text mode application.
 
 if anyone could point me at such a thing, i'd be grateful.
 
 [the only oem fonts included with windows are not truetype.]
 
 regards,
