 here's an interesting table showing how much resources an application
 uses and how much it gives back on shut down.  this is take from
 windows user may 1993 issue:
 
 
 application		min. resource use	resource not returned
 			gdi	user		gdi	user
 
 winsleuth gold v3.03	10	6		2	14
 word for windows v2.0b	10	0		5	0
 lotus 123 v1.1		13	3		3	2
 arts and leters v3.12	7	7		3	1
 powerpoint v3.0		9	1		3	0
 corel draw v3.0		10	6		3	0
 micro. designer v3.1	10	2		2	0
 crosstalk v2.0		0	0		0	0
 excel v4.0a		11	8		0	0
 hijacck v1.0		2	2		0	0
 image-in color pro	3	2		0	0
 picture publisher v3.1	21	8		0	0	
 powerleads!-
   executive ed. v1.03	0	5		0	0
 adobe type manager v2.5	1	0		na	na
 skylight v2.0		1	0		0	0
 
 *the numbers are in percentage and are in a decreasing order.
 
 what does this table tells you, if you frequently start and exit a
 program that doesn't give back all of it's resources, then you
 continually lose these resouces.  therefore, only open these programs
 up once and leave them open.
 
 
 btw:  maybe people can add to this list so we know what application to
 watch out for.
  
 later,
