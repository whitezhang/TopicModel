 hello - i am in need of a file viewer for 24 bit tiff images, to run under
         windows (3.1 if it matters); alternatively a package to run an
         x-server on top of windows would do very well. unfortunately the
         budget for this is limited so whatever i end up using has to be
         public domain or very inexpensive. thanks in advance for any help,
 
         john
