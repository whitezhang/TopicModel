 infoworld (april 26, 1993 issue) has two articles about problems with dos
 6.  a 'second look' article calls it a 'loaded gun' and that people
 should exercise extreme caution if they decide to use it.  the point out
 that doublespace and memmaker are both problem areas that will cause a
 number of folks problems.
 
 ms's response was to the effect that there had been no problems reported
 that they could duplicate (probably are not trying too hard).
 
 cringely reports that a lot of folks are getting/going to get burned
 on the 900 support lines - his example was a call that cost $67.50, 
 for 3 minutes of tech support after 25 minutes on hold.  i want to see
 the ms spin doctors explain this.
