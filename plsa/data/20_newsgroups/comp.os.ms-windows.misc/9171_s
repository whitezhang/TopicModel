 i contacted lotus about this problem today.  it has been reported previously
 and there is a fix.  apparantly the problem only occurs when tab characters
 are used immediately preceding the equation frame.  the work around when
 equations are expected to touch the right margin is to delete at least one
 preceding tab and use space to align the frame (or use set frame where
 placed w/no text wrap around).  unforutnately, once the page run-on has
 occured you are hosed. so the moral of the story is use only space characters
 to align equation frames.
 
 hope this helps the rest of you who have already contacted me with this 
 problem.
