 please research carefully.  just because a fax modem behaves like
 a printer on a "local" machine, doesn't guarantee functionality 
 when a "local" machine has fax software printing to a "remotely
 installed" fax card.  i tried this with workgroups and the 
 fax software didn't like it at all.  could have been winfax's
 peculiarisms but i don't think so.  a lot of special hardware
 interaction takes place internally.  in my case, a fax manager
 program merely "intercepts" the print job and spools it to
 it's own directory, not print manager's spool directory.  to
 software, it appears the job was "printed".  print manager 
 plays no part in the handling of the actual process.
 
 pardon me if i've incorrectly assumed this is what you were
 up to.  a truely network-aware fax-modem will most likely be
 required, or a lot of weird setup and tinkering.
 
 good luck.
