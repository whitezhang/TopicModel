 	yes, and it's pretty much what they claim.  i haven't had time to
 try all of it.  considering the price, even if you decide you don't like it,
 it should be saleable over the next 2-3 months for what you have in it (once
 the price goes up).  all in all it's very serviceable; and in my humble
 opinion, more powerful than access.
