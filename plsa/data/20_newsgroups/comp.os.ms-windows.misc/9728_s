 i am getting garbled output when serial printing thru windows & works
 etc.  this has occurred on several systems and goes if a laserjet 4 is
 used.  i suspect that there is no need for handshaking in this case due
 to the capacity (memory/speed) of it.  there is no problem printing from
 dos.  are there any obvious tweaks i'm missing.  i'm sure its not just
 me with this problem.  thanks for reading....  john atherton
