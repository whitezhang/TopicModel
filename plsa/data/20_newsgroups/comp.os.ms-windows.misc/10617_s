 last night i tried to reinstall the utilities from the windows 3.1 resource
 kit disk. the setup program appeared to run perfectly normally, but when it
 had finished, there was no program group created. now, i know i've done
 this before successfully, and creating a group myself didn't exactly tax
 me, but i'm curious as to what might be going on. i can only assume that
 something left over from the last time i had it installed is getting in 
 the way, but i can't figure out what. any clues, anyone?
