 as a beginer, i just wonder how to transfer files from the sun 
 system (which is on the network) to my pc at home (not connected
 to the network). i tried to use 'comit' to do so, but it was very
 slow and it seemed that getting multiple files at the same time
 was impossible. could anybody give me some hints & infomation?
 
 thank you in advance.
