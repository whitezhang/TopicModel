 i believe you have the correct files. i think what you'll have to
 do is go back into setup and choose change video adapter or
 whatever it is called. then the trick is choose the same adaptor
 you currently have. what setup does is it actually changes the
 file win.com whenever you go into it and change the video
 hardware selection. it incorporates the contents of vgalogo.rle
 into win.com when you do this. this trick can also be used to
 change the startup logo into whatever you want it to be.
