 1) make sure your hard drive is defragmented. this will speed up more than 
    just windows btw.  use something like norton's or pc tools.
 2) i _think_ that leaving the wall paper out will use less ram and therefore
    will speed up your machine but i could very will be wrong on this.
 there's a good chance you've already done this but if not it may speed things
 up.  good luck
