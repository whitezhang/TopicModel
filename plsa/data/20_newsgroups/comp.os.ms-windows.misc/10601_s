 seen from a typographically point of view, atm using postscript fonts
 is better than truetype; the hinting mechanism incorporated in ps is
 gorgeous.
 multilingual users may see the limit of possible different characters in
 a ps font as problematically; they may have better use of the unicode
 features of tt fonts (in windows nt).
 
 i've seen *lots* of really beautiful and printable-in-small-size ps fonts;
 i haven't seen those as tt fonts. most of them are rendering quite
 inaccurate (in small sizes, esp. as screen fonts).
 simply compare timesnewroman as a ps font with the tt font; the first
 looks better.
 
 i am hoping that there will be atm/nt !
