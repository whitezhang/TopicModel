 on a similar note, has anyone found out a way to do this with ms foxpro for
 windows? my setup.ini file was modified on disk 1 (all encrypted).. well,
 of course i forgot about microsoft's stupid arrangement when i got the 
 software, and used my name (it was paid for by the company i'm doing 
 consulting for. when my job is done, it's their software).. any ideas before
 i start doing dumb things to a copy of that file??

 ps no - i don't want to pirate this software. i just want to avoid having
 to buy a new copy in order to change the registration information and then
 having a copy lying around i don't use...
 
 maybe i can get a new disk 1...
