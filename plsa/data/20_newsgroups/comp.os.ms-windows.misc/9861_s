 my problem: i wasn't aware of the fact that i would need an *scsi*-cd-rom for
 windows nt when ordering the beta-sdk-package. so my question: is there any driver
 available that will allow me to use my mitsumi (non-scsi) cd-rom for installation ?
 if there is one, from which place (ftp-site) can i get it ?
 
 many thanks in advance
