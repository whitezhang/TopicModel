 development of what?  in-house apps?  maybe, but  certainly not apps
 to be sold on an open market.  statistics like that are laughable,
 because they may simply mean that there are not enough shrink-wrapped
 usable apps for unix and they have to be developed disproportionately
 often as compared to the installed unix base.
