 i think you may be chasing the wrong problem.  i don't think it is the
 function overloading at all-- i do that sort of thing all of the time
 in bc++ without a hitch.  the big problems i have encountered in
 porting mfc to bc++ is that fact that mfc _depends_ on a couple of
 invalid c++ assumptions.
 
 i have never gotten the _entire_ ctrltest app to run under bc++, but
 the reason is that ms makes some bad assumptions about the order in
 which static/global objects are initialized (i.e. some objects are
 getting accessed before they are initialized).  the problem is in the
 owner-draw menu code somewhere-- if you comment out that section, all
 other pieces of ctrltest work fine.
 
 two other major gotchas i have found using mfc under bc++:
 
 - the cfile::openflags enum uses hard-coded numbers for the open mode,
   rather than the manifest constants defined in fcntrl.h (which differ
   between msc and bc).
 
 - all of the mfc collection classes depend on another bad c++
   assumption-- that a reference to a base object can used be in place
   of a reference to a derived object (true for pointers, not for
   references).
 
 i am sure there are other problems along the same lines, but i have
 not encountered them (yet).  i have not seen mfc 2.0 yet, but i hope
 that some of these will be addressed.  if they are not, all of ms's
 hype about portability to other vendor's compilers will be just that.

       if these were my employer's opinions, i wouldn't be posting them.
