 does anyone know the phone and fax number of the asymetrix
 corporation. i am also interested in their e-mail address.
 
 i would also like to know what the current status of their product toolbook
 is. i received the last update 1.5 about 1.5 year ago. are their any new
 developments or is toolbook slowly dying?
 
 regards,
 
 rob de winter.
