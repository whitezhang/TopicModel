 if you need just to change the wallpaper, then i've written a short
 program in vb that does this by using systemparametersinfo-function.
 the bad news is that you need vbrun200.dll to run it, and the dll is
 some 350kb (the program is about 7kb). the order of pictures depends
 on the system date and the number of bmp-files in the directory, so
 the picture remains the same if you execute the program multiple times
 during the same day and the number of bmps has not changed.
 
 if you feel this is what you need then i could uuencode it and email
 it to you. (it is unavailable via ftp.)
