   hi.  one of my coworkers is having a very odd problem.  his mouse
 works fine in dos applications, if you load them from the c: prompt.
 under windows, the mouse pointer is present, but does not move.  even
 if you load a dos app under windows, the mouse doesn't work.
 
   the computer is a zeos 386sx-20 w/diamond speedstar vga running ms
 dos 5.0 and windows 3.1.  mouse driver is microsoft's 8.2.  i've tried
 switching the mouse from com1 to com2, i've tried a different mouse,
 i've reinstalled mouse.drv, and i can't get the blamed thing to work.
 the only difference between his system and mine (where the mouse works
 perfectly) is that he has an expansion card with an additional
 parallel and serial port.  could that cause the problem? 
 
   thanks in advance for any help.
