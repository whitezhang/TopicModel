 help!
 
 i am trying to find software that will allow com port redirection under
 windows for workgroups.  can anyone out there make a suggestion or reccommend
 something.  i would really hate to have to write some driver for the serial
 port that would support the network, but that is my next step.
 
 thanks in advance.
