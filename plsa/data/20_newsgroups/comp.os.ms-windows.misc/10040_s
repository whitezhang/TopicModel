 i'm looking for any information regarding text search engines...  specifically,
 i'd prefer source or binaries which will run in a ms-windows and/or unix
 environment scanning either flat files or common db structures...
 
 references to pd, shareware, or commercial implementations welcome...
 
 please reply via email -- i'll summarize if desired.
 
 thanx !
