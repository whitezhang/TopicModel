 regarding the horror stories about dos6/doubledisk and stacker 2.?
 killing hard drives:
 
 i was wondering if the dos 6 mirror command works on the doubled
 drive info as well as the normal fat table and partition table.
 if it records the vital doubledisk info, then using it daily
 should go a long way toward protecting yourself against the
 type of catastrophic failure discussed.  if it doesn't, then
 shame on microsoft.
