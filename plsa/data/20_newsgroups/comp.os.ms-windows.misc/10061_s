 we are researching what support there is on various platforms for applications
 to use multi-byte characters (e.g., japanese kanji).  we know that unix
 and x windows can contain support for the i18n standard (depending on level
 and platform).  what support for i18n or wide characters exists on the mac, 
 windows 3.1 and windows nt?
