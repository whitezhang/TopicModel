 >i've pursued and researched this question over the last month or so because i have the same requirements you do......and the long and short of it is that the windows mouse drivers don't accept mice at any but com1 and com2 using irq4 or irq3 unless you buy special drivers from someone who has them.....i've talked to mouse systems who say their driver doesn't support other than com1 and com2 as above , but who claim to be releasing one that will soon!??.

 i had this problem when i first loaded windows.  my i/o card is for 2 hd's
 2 fd's 1 parrelel 2 serial (1 for mouse and 1 for my external modem) and
 a game port.  problem enters.  the darn serial ports have no selection for 
 com settings, they are stuck on 3 and 4.  
 good card for hd's and fd's but lousy for serial. 
 
 i called microsoft and other places.  the long and short of it is
 windows wants com1 and 2 only!, for mouse selection.
 i went out and bought a small i/o card just for parrelel and serial.
 now i have all 4 active com ports and lpt1 and lpt2.
 this half card was less than $20.
 
 mouse on com 1  external modem on com 2,  i disabled the lpt2 so i could use
 the interupt for my scanner card irq.
