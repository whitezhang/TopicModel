 
 i am running windows 3.1 in 386 enhanced mode.  the sound card i have
 is the ati stereo f/x-cd sound card which claims adlib and soundblaster
 compatibility.
 
 using windows mediaplayer, i can play the midi files that came with
 my sound card.  however, i can't play any of the midi files that belong
 to the winjammer midi editor that i ftp'd from cica.  i also can't
 play any midi files i generate with muzika (also from cica).  when i
 try to play the files, a dialog box pops up saying that the music
 may not play right, and it has a checkbox asking me if i wish to disable
 this message in the future.
 
 is this normal, or do i have something set wrong?  i would really like
 to be able to write music on muzika and have my computer play it.
 
 i also ftp'd the game dare2dream for windows (from cica) and its music
 won't play either - i get the same dialog box.
 
 the midi mappers that i have are ati ext midi, ati opl3 midi, and vanilla.
 i have tried using all three.
 
 any help, suggestions, shoulders to cry on, etc. would be appreciated
 very much.
 
 john p.
