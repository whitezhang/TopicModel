 been messin roun progman.ini have ye?  i'm gessing you've been "tuning"
 the system, that's the only way i can remember getting a blank screen
 from ctrl-esc.... when one of the progman.ini parameters was twinked to
 0 or 3, can't remember.  i've never seen win 3 do something like that on 
 her own, captain.
