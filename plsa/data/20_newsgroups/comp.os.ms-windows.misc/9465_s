 
 
 	i'm looking for a program that will let me use a windows
 common dialog box to select a file to use when running a dos app.
 
 	basically, i have several dos apps that i use now and then
 with different files.  they all accept a file as a command line 
 parameter, but the only way (at least that i know of) to do this
 easily when running them from windows is to set up the pif file so
 that it prompts me for additional parameters (at which point i type 
 in the file name).  
 
 problems are:
 
 	1) sometimes i can't remember where the file is exactly located and it
 would be nice to browse my directories for it without having to use the
 file manager.
 	
     and 2) i'm lazy and hate to type long pathnames for files burried 
 several directory levels deep.
 
 	if anyone can point me to such a program or let me know of some
 other way to handle this, i'd appreciate it.
 
 thanks,
 
 tim
