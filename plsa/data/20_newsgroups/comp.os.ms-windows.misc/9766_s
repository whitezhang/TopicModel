 i've never had quicken but i did use mym in it's early days. i have ms money
 for windows now and a financial planning package called wealthbuilder by
 reality technologies and money magazine. p.s. i also do my taxes with turbo
 tax. all of these packages are good in their own way but none of them
 really support me in doing what i really need to do - manage my finances.
 
 the first company that comes along with a windows based package that:
     manages budgets and accounts
     manages loans
     calculates taxes
     uses all of the above and knowledge about my investing philosophy to
       help me invest in the right investment vehicles, and
     integrates it all together
 
 will have my business for life.
