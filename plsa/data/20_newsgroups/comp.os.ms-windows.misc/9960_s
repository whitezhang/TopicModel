 can't guarantee that it'll work for everyone, but i finally fixed my mouse
 jumpiness problems: i installed a bus mouse. (sorry, i didn't say the solution
 was free.) in the past i'd tried everything with my microsoft serial mouse.
 (cleaning it, unloading all kinds of tsrs, turning off smartdrv write
 cacheing, changing com ports, ...) nothing worked. yesterday i finally broke
 down and bought a mouse systems bus mouse. the improvement is even better
 than i had imagined! so much so that my old mouse must have been jumpy
 all the time (i just thought it was jumpy sometimes), and i had gotten so
 used to it i didn't notice. my wife, who uses the computer about once a
 month, noticed the improvement literally within a second!
 
 i can't say anything about other bus mice, but with the mouse systems
 one you'll have to give up either com2 or lpt2 to an irq. also, if you
 don't know, mouse systems mice have three buttons. the driver includes
 a utility that lets you assign keystrokes to the middle button.
 
 hope this helps someone else. if you're anywhere near as frustrated as i
 was, it's well worth the $80.
