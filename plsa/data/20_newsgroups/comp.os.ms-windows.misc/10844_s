 i agree that this should be added to some sort of faq list.  but we have
 strayed from the original topic.  our computer environment is pretty split
 between mac's and pc's... i am lucky and get to have both on my desk.  but
 there are people who have pc's and need to share data with the mac users
 here.  the mac users have no problems because of package called dos mounter
 which automatically lets the mac read dos disks natively.  for the pc there
 is no equivilant... that i know of!  both mac-ette and macsee have been 
 inconsistant under the dos platform, and requires you to perform the activity
 in a dos program to selectively transport the files.
 
 the question originally posed was if there is such a program that hooks into
 windows like a .dll that will interpret the reading of a mac disk when it is 
 in a pc, and allow access to it through the standard file dialogs.  it is quite
 clear that this would only be available for the 1.44mb flopies.
