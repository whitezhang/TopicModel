 windows nt
 
 
 i need some information on the new windows nt.
 anything you have would be appreciated. i know nothing about it.
 (well, except that it exists.)
 some questions... 
 
 memory requirements, hard drive space, release date? is it out?
 how is ibm reacting? intel?
 can it replace other lan os's?
 
 anything else like specs, speed, etc..
 
 thanks in advance!
