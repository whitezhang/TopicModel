 do you mean a prog. that doesn't jump to the dos display and then back or 
 create a temp. dos window?
 
 if yes then i might recommend winzip from ftp.cica.indiana.edu.  i'm afraid 
 i don't have the file name or version but you should be able to find it.
 
 it's fully compatible with ver. 2.04g and very functional.
