 there are a couple.  i am personally using screenpeace, which is a
 screen saver which will also select your wallpaper from a specified
 directory (not necessarily the windows dir.).  let me know if you want
 info.  i've been pretty happy with screenpeace, and the latest version
 (3) is *not* at cica, but  oak, /windows3/scrpc3or.something
