 well, you can't say that it don't work.  the inability to read 800k mac
 disks is not a sw problem.  rather, it's a hardware limmitation on pcs. 
 
 i have seen a post about a program able to read non-1.44mb mac disks,
 which comes with a watchamacalit <ma memory's faling> card, which you
 just drop into a com port or something.  don't remember specifics, tho.
 peace,
