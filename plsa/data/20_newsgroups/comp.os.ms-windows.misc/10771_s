 shareware is available from the net, magazines, distributors, clubs,
 friends, and bulletin boards. i don't think people have any problems
 getting hold of it.
 
 fill gaps in dos? there's no need for many people - dos 5 provides
 more services than i need as it is. i just run windows on top of it.
 
 btw, my windows must be an operating system - it provides a disk
 operating system that dos can't access. (nfs...) :-)
