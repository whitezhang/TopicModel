 	hello
 
 i have a question about the demo files for amipro v3 uploaded in cica.
 i downloaded it and tryied to install it.  however, it didn't work.  
 in addition, it altered or eliminated my nwres2.dll file so that i had
 to reinstall my norton desktop again.
 
 is there anything i have to know to install it or do i eventually have 
 to ask lotus to send a working model to me (i heard that they have it)?
 i just want to see its look and feel before buying it.
 
 any pointer would be greatly appreciated.
 thank you
