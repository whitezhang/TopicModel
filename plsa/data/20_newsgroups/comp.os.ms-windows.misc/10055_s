 this pretty much confirms my original impression after reading
 through the documentation on dos-6.  the double space sounds nice,
 but not on your primary disk!!  i'll probably wind up making a
 disk partition d: and doublespacing *it*, using it as an archive.
 probably would be useful on floppy disks as well.  but on c:?  uh, uh...
 
 [i particularly disliked the note that said something like "double
 space is irreversible"].
