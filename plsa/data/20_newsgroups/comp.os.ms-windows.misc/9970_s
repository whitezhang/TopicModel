 howdy
 
 we have been having a real problem with an ast 386sx/16 machine with
 4mb of ram.  we installed paradox for windows, (but i don't think 
 paradox is the real problem here), and the installation went ok
 (windows is installed on a local drive, paradox installed on a novell
 network (netware 386 v3.26 or greater), dos 5, win 3.1) but the program
 will not load in 386 enchanted mode.  the thermometer bar goes to 60%
 and we then either get a 'invalid command.com' or a windows nastygram
 talking about an illegal instruction.  i've checked out the command.com
 thing, but as a long-time c programmer, i've crashed my share of machines
 with pointer problems and this is a standard behavior :-)
 
 anyway, paradox will run in standard mode, but not enhanced.  we also have
 quattro pro windows, exhibiting the same behavior.  spent about 2 hours
 with borland's tech people, with no avail.  the guy i talked to a microsoft
 didn't want to really dig in and help, as he gave up pretty quickly.
 somewhat disappointing, really.  i expected more from microsoft.  you'd think
 with all the millions of windows installations that they would have seen all
 the possible problems, but i guess not...
 
 microsoft had sent us a 13 page fax on fixing uae and general
 protection faults (sorry, i can't fax anything out of here so please
 don't ask, try microsoft), which we tried.  we did *everything* they
 said, and still no luck.
 
 so.  if you can help, please mail me.  this problem is driving us nuts.
 i will greatly appreciate any information anyone can pass on.
 
 thanks
