 has anyone else been playing with that wincmd utility from pc magazine?
 if so, i am having trouble concatenating string variables together and
 need your help.  for example:
 temp = "path"
 temp2 = "file.ext"
 fullpath = temp+"/"
 say fullpath			// output = 'th/'
 fullpath = fullpath+temp2
 say fullpath			// output = 'h/file.ext'
 
 so, it seems to be dropping the first few characters with each
 concatenations.  is it that i am out of memory -- i only have maybe 20
 variables total -- the article didn't mention memory limits. 
 
 email me if you have an idea or would like to see the actual source and
 output.  thanks for your help.
