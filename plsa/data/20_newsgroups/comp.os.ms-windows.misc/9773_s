 
 	i'm attempting to transfer files from my home computer running
 windows 3.1 terminal to a workstation at school.  the file transfer protocol
 at home is kermit for binary files.  i'm running kermit on the workstation at school and
 setting the file transfer protocol to binary.  i am unable to upload files
 to school but can download files from school to home.  during download,
 terminal displays ther retrying message several times then the message '
 verify you're using the correct protocol'.  
 	anyone have any ideas on how to fix?  either e-mail or post to this
 group. 
 
 thanks, in advance,
