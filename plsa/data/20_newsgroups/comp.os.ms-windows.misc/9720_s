 hi folks,
 
 at the end of the summer i'm planning on getting a new computer (486dx50 or
 486dx2/66) and have been poking around in computer shopper.  anyway i saw
 the ads for the diamond viper (local bus, 2mb memory, 50 million+ winmarks)
 and was wondering if anyone has had any experience with it (good/bad/not worth
 the money/etc.)  any information at all would be nice.
 
 also, a few other questions.  anyone know of a good cheap 15"+ 1024x768 ni
 monitor?  and what is a good cd-rom drive that meets mpc standards and is
 controlled via scsi?  how about a 250mb tape drive on scsi?
 
 thanks for your time,
