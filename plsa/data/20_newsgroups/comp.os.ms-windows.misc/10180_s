 
 i've been using final from coda for some time, but suddenly it stopped using 
 my fonts. i have a 386 pc with lots of disk space and memory, a postscript 
 laser, win3.1, finale 2.0.1 and i recently installed atm 2.0. i've been 
 fiddling around with the windows setup for some time, and when i needed to do 
 some work with finale things didn't print properly. it might - and it might 
 not - have anything to do with the installation of atm from 1.something to 
 2.0, but i don't have the old atm lying around anomore. 
 
 the most annoying problem was that the petrucci font didn't print, which is a 
 rather important font :-) 
 
 i managed to get direct printing to work if i included ownps=0 in the 
 [finale] section of win.ini, but compile postscript listing still doesn't 
 work; and it's those .eps files i need. when i look at the .eps files 
 generated the only font which appears there is courier. i found out that if i 
 manually changed the courier 24-point to petrucci 24-point in the .eps file 
 everything worked ok, but i'd rather avoid that since i have a lot of songs 
 to work with. 
 
 and yes, in the special/font/font names dialog box all the fonts i need are 
 listed, with the correct mapping between finale, screen and printer fonts. 
 finale is obviously aware of the fonts since direct printing of a score works 
 well (that is, after i included ownps=0), and all my other windows 
 applications print petrucci and the other fonts well. 
 
 has anyone encountered problems like this? 
 
 what is the current version of finale from coda music software? i have 2.0.1
 
 are the people at coda available on internet or x.400?
 
 i'd be grateful for all hints and help.                                -mats
