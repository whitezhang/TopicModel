 this is a common problem with highly complex truetype fonts.  microsoft
 admits to a problem with older versions of the postscript printer driver,
 but i've found it to be pretty generic.
 
 you can get around the problem by adjusting the parameter outlinethreshold
 in the [truetype] section of win.ini.  this entry specifies the number of
 pels-per-em at which windows will render truetype fonts as outline fonts
 instead of as bitmap fonts.  the default is 256.  i've generally been able
 to get fonts to work by setting outlinethreshold=160.  depending on your
 printer resolution and the point size you are using, you may need a
 different value.
 
 the windows resource kit warns against going above 300.  presumably, that
 might cause fonts to print as square boxes or something.  :-|  (i'm not
 smiling.)
