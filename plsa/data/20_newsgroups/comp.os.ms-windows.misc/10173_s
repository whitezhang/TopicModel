 	i'd say that the massive crash problems are exceedingly rare.
 	windows _itself_ almost never crashes, but it can be crashed by
 	an errant application (my personal favorite?  any one of the corel
 	3.0 programs).  on the other hand, i have had os/2 crash randomly
 	a number of times, mostly just running it's own applications.
 
 	for instance.  today i discovered a new one.  while i was downloading
 	with procomm plus for windows (running seamless with the standard
 	vga drivers on a run-o' da mill vga card--640x480), i decided that
 	i wanted to edit a copy of a quote that i wanted to add to my 
 	.finger.  but since i've learned not to really trust seamless, 
 	i fired up a full screen winos/23.1 session.  whoops, the download
 	finished while winos/2 was loading.  it had _just_ gotten
 	the pointer up, so i hit alt-escape to get back t the desktop
 	(i have a lot of fonts, so loading takes a good long while).
 	
 	blam.  screen trashed, procomm hangs up.  hm.  well, i can sorta
 	see the mouse, so i clicked on the minimized winos/2 session 
 	and got back my fullscreen windows session (but the color were
 	off--red and green and yellow and brown instead of blues and greys).
 	so i closed this, and got back to the desktop (now fully restored).
 
 	pp+ was still sitting, window open, but it was no longer 
 	"connected" to the com port--so i exited it (the normal way--
 	it told me i was still online and it would hang up, though it
 	was _already_ hung up).  hm.  well, load anothe--no, bad idea. 
 	shutdown and reboot.
 
 	ok, refresh first.. now, shutdown.  yes, everything is closed...
 
 	hm.  nothing seems to be happening.  let's see.. ah, the 
 	windows list still comes up.  ok, let's try shutdown again.
 
 	no go.  huh.
 
 	alright, wait 60 seconds to see if it's just running slow.
 
 	hmm.  still seems to be running os/2.  try shutdown again.
 	nothing.  oh well.  reboot.  enjoy the checkdisk time.
   
 	in this case, a part of the os crashed not only itself, but
 	os/2 entirely (which isn't even smart enough to tell when it;s
 	been compromised, i guess).  in everyday (specifically _today_)
 	use.
 
 
 > os/2 gives each windows app a vdm and they can't touch each other or
 >(generally) anything they aren't supposed to have.
 
 
 	that's the idea, anyway.  in truth, when a program crashes on 
 	os/2, it will bring the system down with it.  the programs that
 	would just gpf under windows do the same under os/2, but programs
 	that are fine under dos and windows bring os/2 screaming to a halt,
 	task protection or no.  
 
 	for instance, i'm still wondering why print preview in a windowed
 	wp 5.1 (dos) locks up my system.  it works fine under dos or even in
 	a dos box under windows 3.1.  (admittedly, it doesn't crash if i run
 	wp51 full screen, but the first time this bug big me, it bit hard).

 	please explain.  the only time i wait on anything under windows is
 	when i'm copying or formatting a floppy, or when printing (and even
 	then, not long--i get 9 to 11 pages dumped to the printman per 
 	minute, and can _still_ go do things--slowly--while it's doing 
 	this--i've downloaded with pp+ @9600 while printing).
 
 
 
 > and not being able to adress your memory better than dos,
 
 
 	not sure what you mean here.  os/2 sees 16 megs, uses 5 or six
 	of these for it's own use (more if you want to count winos/2). 
 	windows sees 16 megs, uses 3 or 4 (more like 5 if you count the
 	disk cache as i am for os/2) for itself.  if memory efficiency 
 	were a big issue, pc geos would be the current king of the 
 	intel desktop.

 	on the other hand.. i am finally able to say with some confidence
 	that both os/2 and windows have a bit of hardware sensitivity to
 	them.  for instance, the machine i am sitting at runs both fine, 
 	while the machine next to me constantly locks up under windows. 
 	(but ran os/2 without a hitch once i got it through a 5-crash 
 	install).  on the whole, i'd say os/2 is a whole lot more sensitive
 	than windows, but there are (i suppose) machines that windows
 	just doesn't like.
