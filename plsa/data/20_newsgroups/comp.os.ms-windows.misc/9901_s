 a couple of weeks ago i posted a question concerning
 communicating
 between vb and msaccess using dde. the answers i received at
 that time
 allowed me to get a prototype of my project working. however,
 during
 this process i have come up with new problems.
 
 1) there seems to be a limit of 255 characters for a dde topic
 string. is
 this inherent in all dde systems or just peculiar to msaccess
 or vb?
 
 2) it is easy to query an access database from vb using the
 dde sql command,
 (provided the above limitation is overcome by using short
 field and table
 names) but how is one meant to update a database?
    a) a dde sql update command does not seem to work.
    b) initiating an access macro using a dde execute command
 from vb cannot
       be used because when the macro requests information from
 vb using a
       second dde channel the programs dead lock until time-
 outs occur.
       (the vb to access channel has to close before the access
 to vb channel
       is initiated, i guess.)
    c) access does not allow vb to dde poke the information.
 
 
    the way i eventually managed to update a database was by
 sending key-
    strokes from vb to access using the sendkeys command. this
 technique has
    the problem that access cannot be minimised and it must
 always be in a
    state ready to respond to the sequence of key-strokes vb
 sends.
 
 are all the above statements correct or have i made incorrect
 assumptions?
 are there any better work arounds to the above? are there any
 signs of an
 odbc driver for access?
