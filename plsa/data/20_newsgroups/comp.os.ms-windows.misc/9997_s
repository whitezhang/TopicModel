 i am starting to work on a project using dde to transfer data.  the 
 application came with an excel macro which can transfer the data.
 i need to 'port' it to 1-2-3w.  1-2-3w uses a very different setup
 for dde macros.
 
 does anyone have any suggestions as to good references?  i have 
 downloaded "ww01117:  windows dynamic exchange (dde)" [the ms
 application note].  any books worth getting?
 
 the specifics are:
 
 server application:  dionex ai-450 chromatography data system
 client application:  1-2-3 for windows v1.1
 
 except for the macro, dionex did not provide any documentation
 for dde.  also, i am having problems because i am trying to develop
 the application on my pc, but to actually get data, you need to be
 connect to the instrument.  any help here would be appreciated, too.
 
 thanks,
