 i don't know the specifics of the compression algorithm, but i've used the
 shareware program, paintshop, to convert between the two.  you can download
 it from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, but i don't know what the file is called
 or what directory it is in (you can start by looking in pub/pc/win3 or try
 scanning the index files).
 
 to convert a .bmp file to a .rle file, you just load the .bmp file and do a
 "save as..."  select "windows bitmap" and "compressed" (or is it "rle"?)
 whatever it is, it's fairly intuitive...
 
 sorry i don't have all the details, but i'm currently on an ibm3151 dumb
 terminal and can't do much researching...good luck!
