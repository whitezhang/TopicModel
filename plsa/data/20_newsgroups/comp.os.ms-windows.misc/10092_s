 you bet your bippy it's built like a tank.. and not just mechanically either!
 
 this past weekend we had a nasty thunderstorm and the impossible (*&^%)
 happened - i got a direct lightning strike on my house - and to the second
 floor outlet box into which my faithful deskjet 500c was connected. there
 was a .303-bullet-sized hole in the aluminum siding with some solidified
 aluminum slag dripping from it. you could actually see the electrical box
 through the hole! the outlet itself was fried and i'm still amazed the
 whole damn house didn't burn down.
 
 i lost 2 electric garage door openers,  2 vcr's, 2 telephones (all of which
 were on the opposite side of the house), a zyxel u-1496e high speed modem,
 a vga monitor, a 1024x768 color monitor, the rs232 and parallel ports on my
 x terminal and a wd lan card in my pc. not a good night!
 
 but, the deskjet ran as soon as i found a functioning serial and parallel
 port to connect to it.
