 risc used to mean "reduced instruction set computer", true.  they
 still use the same acronym, but only to be familiar.  what risc really
 means is a recently-designed cpu.  :-)
 
 in general, most risc cpus are like this:
 
     a large number (32 or more) of general-purpose registers
     a fixed instruction size, usually 32 bits
     an instruction may make only one memory reference
     memory references must be aligned
     there are delayed branches (branch after the next instruction) or
 a target prediction bit (probably will/won't branch)
     instructions may complete out of order relative to the instruction
 stream
