 after hearing endless debate (read: name-calling) over which os is better, dos
 and windows or os/2 and finally having enought resourses to play with a couple
 of different operating systems, i have decided to put the two products to a
 head to head test, as so many fellow newsposters have suggested.  i have, 
 however, no desire whatsoever to use a version of os/2 which wont really
 do what it says (i.e. run windows apps)  os/2 2.0-2.1 will not run windows
 apps in 386 enhansed mode, something that most larger windows apps require, but
 os/2 2.2, which is supposed to be in beta test, is supposed to.  i have heard
 that os/2 2.2 beta is available via ftp, and i was wondering if anyone knew
 where to obtain a copy.  i would appreciate any information, as i would like, 
 once and for all, to establish for myself which is the best os for my needs.
