 i just got a copy of tobias' managing your money v9.0.  i have quicken 6,
 and it's wonderful for some things, but mym seems to have some features
 that q6 doesn't.  for example, q6 doesn't seem to be able to handle
 monthly automatic deductions from a checking account (you know, a
 monthly payment that gets electronically deducted every month from
 my checking account).  or is there something that i'm not doing right,
 and q6 can actually do that?  anyway, mym seems to be able to handle
 monthly deductions.  in fact, it can apparently do better than that.
 that is, you can specify monthly, bimonthly, quarterly, even yearly.
 anyway, is anyone aware of a comparitive study of the two programs?
 or can someone just give me their own personal impressions?  maybe
 someone who has used both.  or maybe someone who is familiar with
 each could give me a capsule review?  anything would be greatly
 appreciated.  if i keep mym, i have to pay for it, and i don't know
 whether it's worth doing.  if mym is better than q6, of course i
 will keep it.  but if q6 can do everything mym can do (maybe even
 better), i won't.  thanks all!
 
 if you post a reply, please also cc me.  thanks.
