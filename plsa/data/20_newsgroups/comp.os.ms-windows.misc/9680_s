 i would be very appreciative if someone would answer a few 
 questions about windows for workgroups.
 
 i currently have novell netware lite which does not work with
 windows very well and is a conventional memory hog (ver. 1.1).
 i am considering moving all our machines to w4wg.
 
 q1:  how much conventional ram does w4wg use over and above the
      driver for the network card?
 
 q2:  if i have a novell ne2000 card, are the lsl and ipx drivers
      still needed?
 
 q3:  does w4wg do a license check over the network to ensure each
      machine is running its own licenced copy of w4wg? (note: i do
      not want to break the license agreement and i will buy a copy
      of w4wg for each of our machines, it is just that i would like
      to try it out first to see if it meets our needs. returning one
      opened copy is much easier than returning n opened copies.)
 
 q4:  if you buy the upgrade to windows 3.1 for w4wg does it replace
      all of win 3.1 as you install it or does it depend on current
      win 3.1 files?
 
 q5:  if i install windows nt on my server when it comes out, will i have
      any troubles with the w4wg machines?
 
 when i started this message, i was going to ask only 2 questions but i got carried
 away. i'll stop now ;-).
 
 i look forward to your replies.
