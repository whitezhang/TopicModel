 you must of read too many os/2 advertisements.  "crash protection" is such
 a marketing gimick, it isn't funny..  out of 4 months of using windows on my 
 new machine i've only had it crash once, and i don't have a "run of the mill"
 configuration.
 
 microsoft is not a leader in innovation, but they certainly know how to 
 build a better mousetrap.  now, what's wrong with that??
