 what version of winfax do you have?  the newest version (3.0) has an ocr
 (optical character recognition) built in... what this means is that it can
 take a fax (ie, a letter) and convert it into ascii so that one can edit
 the document w/o re-typing it... however, i found that the ocr that comes
 packaged with winfax does not work as well as omnipage professional (also
 by delrina software)... so, once again, winfax ver. 3.0 has what you are
 looking for... good luck!
