 
 hi,
 
 i got a ne2100 compatible ethernet card, and i just received my copy
 of chameleon nfs. unfortunately, it is not compatible with the ne2100
 (only ne2000 or ne1000). what is the latest version number for chameleon
 nfs ? did soemone tackle this problem ?
 
 thanks for help,
 
 f. popineau
