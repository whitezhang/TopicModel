 since running any gui over a network is going to slow it down by a
 fair amount, i expect windows nt will be multiuser only in the sense
 of sharing filesystems. someone will likely write a telnetd for it so
 one could run character-based apps, but graphics-based apps will have
 to be shared by running the executables on the local cpu. this is how
 things are shaping up everywhere: client-server architectures are
 taking over from the old cpu-terminal setups. 
 
 note that the next does this: you can always telnet into a next and
 run character-based apps but you can't run the gui. (yeah, i know
 about x-windows, just haven't been too impressed by it...)..
