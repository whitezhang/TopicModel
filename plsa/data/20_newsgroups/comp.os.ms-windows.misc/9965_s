 
 sorry about that - don't want to alarm anyone...
 
 i don't think there is any correlation between the crashes and pctools.
 i reinstalled ami pro, and ran compress again, with no problems.
 i think problems may have been related to filling my disk until it had
 0 bytes (!) left while ftping, although i would think it wouldn't
 matter since ami pro wasn't running at the time, and i made space available
 immediately anyways.
 but, whatever, the cause, it is working now.
