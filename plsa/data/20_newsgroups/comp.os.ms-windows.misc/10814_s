 paintshop pro for windows is a fantastic product.  it can handle tiff, gif,
 bmp, pcx, and many other formats, displaying them and converting between
 them.  there is a shareware version of the program; i assume it's available
 in the windows areas of the standard anonymous ftp locations (i'd try
 ftp.cica.indiana.edu).  log in as ftp, use your username as a password,
 and look for a program called psp101.exe or something like that.  i have
 the registered version, and the only major difference i can detect is that
 the unregistered version pops up a message when you start the program
 asking you to please register it.
 
 once again, fantastic software.  up to 24 bits, huge images, everything.
