 and/or taking the rubber ball out of the mouse (should be directions
 in the manual or on the bottom of the mouse) and cleaning it with
 alcohol (isopropyl, i believe - the same alcohol as used for cleaning
 your cassette deck).  this is good to do every so often, even if you
 have a mouse pad.  dust still gets caught in the mouse and on the
 rubber ball.  as well, lint and other garbage may find it's way onto
 the rubber ball and get into the mouse damaging the horizontal and
 vertical sensors.
 
 hope this helps.  good luck.
