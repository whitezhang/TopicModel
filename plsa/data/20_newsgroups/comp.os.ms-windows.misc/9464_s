 this is the 2nd reguest for discussion ( rfd ) for the creation of 
 comp.databases.ms-access 
 
 the discussion period started on april 6 and it will last until april 28,
 ( 22 days ).
 
 this is an official rfd for the creation of a new newsgroup for the
 general discussion of the microsoft access rdms.
 
 name: comp.databases.ms-access
 
 moderation: unmoderated. at this time, no need for a moderator has been
 assertained. future evaluation will determine if one is needed.
 
 purpose: 
 access is a new rdbms for the windows operating system. it includes wysiwyg
 design tools for easy creation of tables, reports, forms and queries and a
 database programming language called access basic.
 the purpose of the group will be to provide help to people who use access's 
 wysiwyg design tools to create simple databases as well as to people who use 
 access basic to create complex databases.
 
 rationale:
 eventhough access is a new rdbms, it is very popular because of its graphical
 development enviroment and its initial low price.
 been a version 1.0 product means that all access users are novices.
 for that reason a newsgroup is needed where access users can discuss 
 their experiences with the product and answer each other's questions.
