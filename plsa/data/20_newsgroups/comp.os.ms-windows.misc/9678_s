 walther,
 i'd have a look at the maximum resolution the combination of the video card
 and screen would have without flickering. i'd only suggest using the color
 screen if it does 800*600 without flickering. if this is not too small for
 your tastes at a 14"....
 personally i'd prefer the mono-screen as i always have quite a few windows
 open. if you only run one program at a time or rarely switch maybe the
 color 'surplus' is worth trading in  the smaller size. if you want to
 develop programs you will always have to check the colors. i used a
 14" mono screen (worst of both worlds) and was surprised how the colors looked
 i choose on a color screen.
