 it is correct that vc++ is not considered an upgrade for c7. c7 is
 basically a dos product, vc++ is a windows product. as windows is not
 an upgrade for dos, it is a separate operating system product line, its
 utilities cannot be upgrades for dos utilities. however, i have also
 been told that it is not an upgrade for qcwin, which it should be!
