 
 hello.
 
      i purchased a video card called et-4000 true color card which
      can provide about 1700k colors. but the question is i can't find
      the corresponding drivers for windows 3.1 , i am now using 65k
      colors driver for win31. it works fine , but i think it will be
      better if i use 1700k driver. so, please tell me whether such a
      driver is available !
 
      thanks in advance.
