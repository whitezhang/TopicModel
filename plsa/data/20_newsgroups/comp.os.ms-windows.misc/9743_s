 hi.  my last question for the year.  i have a mail-order no-name notebook
 with 4 meg ram.  i never have problems with my huge ramdisk or when
 running desqview, but win3.1 and w4w2.0 constantly crash on me, most
 commonly citing a "memory parity error."  the only thing i can do is turn
 off and re-boot.  my cmos ticks off & counts all the memory every startup,
 and there is never a problem with this either.
 
 could it be a bug in my windows copy instead of the hardware?  i remember
 having some disk error problems when installing it.
 
 
 is there any change i could make to lessen the frequency or likelyhood of
 this happening (i think win vs win /s produce different crashes, but both
 crash frequently nonetheless)
 
 i know this is a pain, but please answer by email because my home account
 doesn't have rn.  and i will stop asking questions now.  thank you.
