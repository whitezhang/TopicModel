 this is silly. is unix a mature os? depends on who you ask, and how

 so why do you need something like behierarchic to create groups under
 the apple menu? everyone knows that apple menu items are a ripoff of

 and this is easy on a mac? give me a break. having spent hours moving
 system extensions around and restarting the mac to see why a certain
 app crashes all the time, i find this laughable.
