 
 anybody seen mouse cursor distortion running the diamond 1024x768x256 driver?
 sorry, don't know the version of the driver (no indication in the menus) but it's a recently
 delivered gateway system.  am going to try the latest drivers from diamond bbs but wondered
 if anyone else had seen this.
 
 post or email
