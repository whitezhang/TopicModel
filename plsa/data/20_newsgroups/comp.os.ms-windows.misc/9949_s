 i have a modest system of aliases/macros that enables me to download
 mail from a public access unix system to my ms-dos box. i read and reply
 to the mail with a ms windows 3.1 based editor.
 
 everything works peachey keen as long as the author of the message has
 maintained his text at 80 col. max. width. sometimes i get slightly wider
 messages that run off-screen, so i have to use the cursor/slider to read
 the whole thing.
 
 i'm using ndw deskedit mainly, but i've experienced the same prob with
 all other ms windows editors. i've fiddled with word wrap settings in
 the various editors, but to no avail. i know i'm missing something very
 basic in editor setup, but what is it?
 
 oh yeah, ms word for windows converts everything flawlessly but for what
 i'm looking for that's like using a tank to crack walnuts.
 
 i'd really like to have an editor setup that would display all incoming
 ascii files in a readable format to my screen.
 
 thanks in advance,
