 hello,
 i have some problems with my diamond stealth local bus graphic card.
 when i try to start windows my system stop and display:
 "no free files handles,cannot load command,system halted"
 it's perhaps a bios setup problem but i'm not used to my ami-bios setup
 if somebody can explain me;how to setup shadow video rom, others 
 shadow rom ,and also how to config the two "advenced ... setup"
 for a best utilisation of my graphic card.
 thanks for any answer.
 ch.robert
