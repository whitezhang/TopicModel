 hi all,
 
 has anybody tried to compile ctrltest from the mfc/samples directory,
 after compiling the mfc-libs with bwc ?
 
 seems to me, that bwc isn't able to distinguish pointers to overloaded
 functions.
 for example, imagine the following 2 (overloaded) functions:
 void same_name ( void ) 
 void same_name ( int )
  
 after trying the whole day, i think, with bwc its impossible to take the
 adress of one of the above two functions and assign it to a properly defined
 function pointer. 
 am i right ? has anybody else had this problem ?
 
 	thanx
