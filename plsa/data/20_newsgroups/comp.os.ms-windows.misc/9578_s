 hi,
   have you used mac system 6.x or 7.x? if the answer is positive, you would
 know if ms-windows is a "mature" os.
 
   days ago people doubted that ms-windows is not a real os. i can see why
 they have such question. ms-windows confuses many people. microsoft
 simulated mac, but it did a lousy job.  for example:
 
 (1) you can not create hierarchy groups. there is no way to create a group
     in a group. (if you know how, please tell me.)
 (2) too many system parameters to take care of. 
 (3) uncomplete documentation. it's not easy to find the reason why causes
     an unpredictable error.
 (4) group deleting/file deleting
     after deleting a group, users have to use file manager to delete files.
     but if users forget to delete some related files, the disk will be full
     of nonsense files.
 (5) share problem
     once you create two windows doing compilation and editing in some
     language (w/o good editor), there will be a sharing problem. you just
     can not open or save the program if it is loaded. it makes sense to
     prevent from saving, but not opening.
 
 microsoft try to compromise between dos and windows, but they just make 
 ms-windows a graphical dos with capacity doing mutiple dos jobs; 
 the worst thing is they complicate the environment. the orginal purpose
 of ms-windows should be to simplify the environment, and make pc easier 
 to use.
   
   it's by no means easy to satisfy everybody, but if microsoft want to
 keep their reputations, they should evaluate the user interface more
 carefully before products distribute.
 
   no flame, please.
