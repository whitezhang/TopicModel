 i solved my problem.  i still do not understand why it happens ths
 way; perhaps some of you c++ gurus can explain this to all of us!
 
 for some reason when i define the following functins in the class
 definition (in the .h file) the compiler thinks some pure virtual
 functions are not defined.  when i placed these two in a separate
 source file and compiled them, the problem went away.  any ideas what
 happen?  are the functions that are defined in the class construct all
 inline ?  is this the problem?
 
 virtual int            isequal (const object _far &obj) const
 { return this == &(hashentry&) obj; }
 
 virtual void           printon( rostream os) const
 {
  os << "[ hwindow is " << (void _far *) hwindow << " ]\n"; 
 }
