 i've got a probelm with printing envelops on my deskjet 550c from word
 for windows.
 
 history: when i had a deskjet 500, i had to modify the macro so that
 it would disable reverse printing since there seemed to be a bug that
 interferred with printing envelops.  that bug is still present, however...
 
 now: the problem i have is that my deskjet 550 print driver (came with
 the printer i bought in december) still wants to print the envelops in
 portrait mode.  however, the deskjet 550 feeds envelops the from the
 narrow end (i.e. landscape mode).  how do i get the printer to print
 the envelops in the correct orientation?
 
 please please please do not post this to the net since:
     (a) due to end of the semester cruch, i can't keep up on these groups,
 and (b) i will summarize the best answer(s) to the net anyhow!
 
 thanks in advance,
 craig stevenson
