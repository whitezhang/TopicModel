 i believe the beta version of the service is available via ftp on 
 ftp.cica.indiana.edu
 in pub/pc/win3/nt called something like nwnt.zip
 
 there is an index ascii file there, which lists the programs in that directory
 and what they do.
 
 unfortunately this beta will also disable netbeui and tcp/ip over your
 primary nic, so if you really want to run it, get yourself an extra nic and
 bind it to that.  
 
 otherwise wait for next release, like i am.
