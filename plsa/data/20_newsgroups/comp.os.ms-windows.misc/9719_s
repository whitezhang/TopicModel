 i'm looking for a decent windows news reader. i've given up on winvn 0.76
 since it doesn't work very well with the winsock.dll of the ibm tcp/ip for
 dos 2.1.
 
 what the status of trumpet for windows? will it use the windows sockets ?
 i liked it in dos but had to abandon it since i started using ndis to access
 our token ring (results in invalid class error :(
 
 
 bye!
