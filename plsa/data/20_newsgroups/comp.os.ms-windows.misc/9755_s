 
 trying to pin point a hardware problem with my disk, maxtor
 7213at.  group files get corrupted on a regular basis.
 only happens on this drive, d had only one corrupt file
 in over a year and it was under the control of winword on c.
 32-bit disk access and smartdrive are off.  since installation
 of dblspace problem has turned from an annoyance to a reason for
 murder.
 
 since the most frequent files corrupted are the *.grp files,
 are these the last thing written to when exitting windows?
 
 also, are there any pd/shareware utilities available that do
 a more thorough job than dos 6, ndd 4.5, etc?  dos 6 and 
 win 3.1 compatable.
 
 thanks
