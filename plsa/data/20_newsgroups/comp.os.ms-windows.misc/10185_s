 the number you gave is the borland bbs, and darned if i can find any
 stealth drivers there!
 
 diamond's bbs is 1-408-730-1100 - according to the manual i got with
 my stealth-24.  i have had a bunch of trouble using the right drivers
 that came with the card (locking up, de-syncing, etc.) so i hope you 
 do better than i do!
