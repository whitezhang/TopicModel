 i posted this to the apps group and didn't get any response, so
 i'll try here. i am trying to use the latex help feature
 available in emacs for windows and read that you need a separate
 latexhlp.zip file along with a vms2hlp.zip file to convert this
 to windows help. has anyone found these files or gotten this
 command help to work?
 
 thanks, steve herrod
