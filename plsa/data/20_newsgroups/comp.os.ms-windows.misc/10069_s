 ok, i just got a new 486/66 16 mb, with a ati ultra pro and i can't get
 into windows. it says that i need more memory available, but i have 15mb
 ogf extended mem & 512k of conventionnal. i have disabled my memory aperture
 because it didn't find any "free" memory, but it still gave me a message that
 the memory aperture will conflict with system memory. i think that's why
 it want to get in windows.
 
 any help will greatly be appriciated.
 
 please reply by mail, because this site is a week late on news
