 good question.
 answer: the eisa bus does move 32 bits rather than isa's 8/(16?)
         but it still moves it at about the speed as the isa bus.
         i think that's either 8 or 10 mhz.
         the local bus designs also move 32 bits like the eisa, but
         they move the data at the cpu speed, up to 40 mhz.
         so, on a 33mhz cpu, the local bus is moving 32bit data at
         33 mhz, and the eisa is moving 32bit data at 8 or 10 mhz.
         so the local bus should be 3 to 4 times faster than eisa on
         a 33 mhz cpu.  eisa should be about two (maybe 3) times as
         fast as isa.

 that's a very good question.  the eisa bus does have more advantages
 over the isa bus than just it's width.  for example: more/better 
 interrupts and bus mastering.  but these other factors do not impact
  a video card very much.  they have more impact on file servers with 
 multiple hard drives, full-throttle network cards, cd-roms, etc.
