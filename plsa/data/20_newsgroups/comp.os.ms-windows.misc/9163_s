 i am in charge of purchasing some computer software for a small office and i
 have a few question about microsoft's office pack.  
 
 1)  i was wondering, are the programs that are packaged with the office
 pack--winword, power point, excel, and ccmail--complete and the latest
 addition?
 
 2) are the programs "hobbled" in any way? 
 
 3) can we update single programs at a latter date ( i.e. from excel 4.0 to
 excel 5) ?
 
 4) do you receive all of the necessary disks and documentation?
 
 5) is there anything that i should be aware of that makes the office package
 less of deal that it seems?
 
 sorry if i seem skeptical put the price for the office package--$439.39 on the
 street--sounds like a great deal for the office that is purchasing its first
 computer and software.  but all four complete programs for less than $450
 makes me just a little suspicious.  maybe its just me.  
 
 thanks for your help in advance
