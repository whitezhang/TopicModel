 i think you're deliberatly overstating the requirements for os/2.  
 considering that os/2 is a multi-threaded true multitasking os and
 takes the place of dos and windows and more, i actually think the 
 requirements for os/2 are very reasoable.  i also think that anyone
 using windows 3.1 without 8 megs of ram, a 386-40, and 200 megs of
 hard drive space, is beating their head against a wall.  those are
 also legitimate requirements for os/2.  in fact, the requirements 
 for windows 3.1 and os/2 are about equal.
