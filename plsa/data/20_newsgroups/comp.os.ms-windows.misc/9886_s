 //i'm using bc++'s objectwindows (version 3.1) and trying to get some data 
 //processed in a window object. however, when the calling program invokes 
 //the window object, it gives up the control to the window object, and keeps 
 //executing the next statement. i would like the calling program, after 
 //invoking the window object, to wait until the window object is closed. 
 //can i do that? my program may look like:
 
 class mywindow : public twindow
 {
 	...
 };
 
 void mycallingprog(...)  // could the calling program be a c function?
 {	...
 	mywindow *mywinobj;
 	mywinobj = new mywindow(...);
 	getapplication()->makewindow(mywinobj);
 	mywinobj->show(sw_shownormal);
 
 	next statement;  // i want the program to wait here until mywinobj
 	...              // is closed so that i can get some data back from 
 	...              // mywinobj. i specified the window style to be 
 	...              // ws_popupwindow, didn't help. is there any other way 
 	...              // to execute the window object so that the calling 
    ...              // program won't give up the control? any help would 
 }                   // be appreciated.   thanks.  -- jun
