 
     i just moved from borland c++ 3.0 to visual c++ today. when i tried
 to compile my c++ program, it complained a function prototype problem.
 it turned out that the typedef word in ms c++ is a byte, not unsigned int.
 
     could anyone shine some light on this subject ? why a word is a byte ?
