 in windows i created a permanent swap-file of 7771kb as win3.1
 recommended me to do that (32bit access).
 if i use emm386.exe, after win3.1 startup i have 6689k of memory
 free, if i leave emm386.exe out of my config.sys i have 9935k
 of memory free, and windows recommends me a swap file of 11769k.
 
 i use dos6, with memmaker, have 4mb of internal memory and a 486dx,
 
 does anybody knows why this is happening (possibly win needs
 some umb's to manage virtual memory?, if true, which umb's, those
 that emm386 can find without including suspicious parts?)
 
 i need an optimized dos-environment, because i develop applications for
 dos using a windows programming environment.
