 this list appears to imply, that ms-windows that has a cost listed
 above at $70, comes with a c compiler, c++ and fortran. it does not, of
 course. these are expensive add-ons that drive the price way beyond $70.
 ( i don't know if the same applies to os/2 )
 
 as far as unix is concerned;
 there is a free unix, linux, that has cc, ~c++, fortran ( f2c ),
 xwindows and many other features besides, with a large number of utilities
 that can be optionally added. and there is also a free 386bsd i believe.
 both these unix's are quite robust. you can check out comp.os.linux
 
 if you don't want to "throw our many down the tubes", you've got to break
 that list down a little more.
