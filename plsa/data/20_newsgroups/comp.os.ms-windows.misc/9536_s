 have you tried setting files in your config.sys file to a fairly high
 number? (i've got mine set to 100; i've seen numbers from 40 to 100 
 recommended). also check your stacks statement, stacks=9,256 is a good
 starting point. try increasing it if it's already set there (such as
 to stacks=12,256, etc.). both stacks and files have been identified as
 _one_ cause of frequent win3.1 crashes.
