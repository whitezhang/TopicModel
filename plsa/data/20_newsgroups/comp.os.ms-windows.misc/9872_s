 i would like to change all of the system fonts in windows... i have a 
 program that will generate system fonts from truetype, but i was 
 wondering if there is a problem to help you set up all your system
 fonts.
 
 also, how do i change the icon text color... all of my icon text is black,
 and i want to change it... couldn't find any options in control panel or
 in win.ini
