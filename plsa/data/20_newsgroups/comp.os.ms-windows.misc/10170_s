     overview
 
     the dib image file format is intended to be a "device independent  bitmap"
     file  format.  (what microsoft means by "device independent" is unclear to
     me.) four pixel resolutions are supported: 1 bit, 4 bit, 8 bit, and 24 bit
     pixels.
 
     these images were intended for use on dos (ibm, or little-endian) systems.
     if	you  are  creating them on another architecture you will have to byte-
     swap all short and long integer values.
 
     by convention, dib images end in the extension ".bmp".   this  is  because

     they  are  a  super-set of earlier "bitmap image files".  consequently you
     will sometimes hear dib files referred to as "bmp" files.
 
     since dib images files are a super-set, there are three "flavors"  of  dib
     images:
 	 o   dos dib images.  these are the recommended	 convention,  and  the
 	     form  which i will describe how to create.	 they are intended for
 	     applications running under ms windows /3.0 in a dos environment.
 	 o   os/2 dib images.  my understanding is that these are  the	flavor
 	     of dib images that were used by the presentation manager.
 	 o   old-style bitmap images.

     differences between flavors
 
     the dos dib images consist of:
 	 1.  a "bitmapfileheader" file header which identifies the file	 as  a
 	     dib  file.	  this	header	also gives the total size of the image
 	     file, and the offset to the image data.
 	 2.  a "bitmapinfoheader"  image  header  which	 specifies  the	 image
 	     attributes.
 	 3.  an optional palette of colors used by the image.  if  it  exists,
 	     this  may contain 2, 16, or 256 entries.  each entry is a windows
 	     rgbquad structure.
 	 4.  the image data itself.
 
 
     the os/2 dib images consist of:
 	 1.  the same "bitmapfileheader" file header which identifies the file
 	     as	 a  dib	 file.	 this  header also gives the total size of the
 	     image file, and the offset to the image data.
 	 2.  a "bitmapcoreheader"  image  header  which	 specifies  the	 image
 	     attributes.
 	 3.  an optional palette of colors used by the image.  again, if  this
 	     exists  it	 may  contain  2, 16, or 256 entries.  each entry is a
 	     windows rgbtriple structure.
 	 4.  the image data itself.
 
 
     the old style image bitmap consists of:
 	 1.  either a bitmapinfoheader or a  bitmapcoreheader.	 which	header
 	     type is determined by the first long integer (dword) value.
 	 2.  an optional color palette.	  this	palette	 may  be  composed  of
 	     either   windows	rgbquad	  structures  (if  the	header	was  a
 	     bitmapinfoheader) or windows rgbtriple structures (if the	header
 	     was a bitmapcoreheader).
 	 3.  the image data itself.
 
 
     creating dib image files.
 
     creating a dos dib image file consists of several straight forward	steps.
     the headers need to be created and then written to the file.  these header
     structures are defined in the ms  windows/3.0  "windows.h"	include	 file.
     palette  information  needs	 to  be	 stored for images that are not 24-bit
     images.  the five general steps are:
 	 1.  filling  in  the  bitmapfileheader	  and	the   bitmapinfoheader
 	     structures the basic image information.
 	 2.  if the image is a 1-bit, 4-bit, or an 8-bit image,	 creating  the
 	     color palette of rgbquads.
 	 3.  calculating the total file size and putting this  information  in

 	     the "bfsize" field of the bitmapfileheader.
 	 4.  calculating the offset to the image data from the	start  of  the
 	     file,   and   putting  this  in  the  "bfoffbits"	field  of  the
 	     bitmapfileheader.
 	 5.  writing to the file the bitmapfileheader,	the  bitmapinfoheader,
 	     the color palette, and the image data (in that order).
 
     the following sections describe structures in terms of microsoft  c	 type-
     defined  keywords.	the following table describes these keywords for those
     not familiar with microsoft c.

     the bitmapfileheader
 
     this structure is defined in "windows.h" as:
 	 typedef struct tagbitmapfileheader {
 		 word	 bftype;
 		 dword	 bfsize;
 		 word	 bfreserved1;
 		 word	 bfreserved2;
 		 dword	 bfoffbits;
 	 } bitmapfileheader;
 
     the "bftype" field is the two ascii characters 'b' and 'm'.	  this	serves
     to	identify  the  file  as	 a  dib	 image file.  on an intel byte ordered
     machine (ibm or a compatible), this constant can be formed	in  c  as  the
     quantity ('m' << 8 | 'b') == 0x4d42 on an intel system.
 
     the "bfsize" field is the total size of the file.  for our	purposes  this
     field  is equal to: the size of the bitmapfileheader, plus the size of the
     bitmapinfoheader, plus the number of entries in the	 color	palette	 times
     the	 size  of  a  rgbquad, plus the number of bytes of image data.	if the
     image data is being written out in an uncompressed form, this value can be
     calculated	ahead  of  time.   otherwise, this field needs to be filled in
     later.
 
     both the "bfreserved1" and the "bfreserved2"  fields  are  always  set  to
     zero.
 
     the "bfoffbits" field is set to the offset to the start of the image  data
     from  the  start  of the file.  for our purposes, this field should be set
     to:	 the  size  of	the   bitmapfileheader,	  plus	 the   size   of   the
     bitmapinfoheader,  plus  the  number of entries in the color palette times
     the size of a rgbquad.  this works out because the image data  is  written
     write after the color palette if one exists.

     the bitmapinfoheader
 
     this structure is defined in "windows.h" as:
 	 typedef struct tagbitmapinfoheader{
 		 dword	 bisize;
 		 dword	 biwidth;
 		 dword	 biheight;
 		 word	 biplanes;
 		 word	 bibitcount;
 		 dword	 bicompression;
 		 dword	 bisizeimage;
 		 dword	 bixpelspermeter;
 		 dword	 biypelspermeter;
 		 dword	 biclrused;
 		 dword	 biclrimportant;
 	 } bitmapinfoheader;
 
     the "bisize" field is set to the size of  the  bitmapinfoheader  structure
     itself.   when  reading  the  image	 file,	this  value is what is used to
     determine  that  the  image	 contains  a  bitmapinfoheader	 and   not   a
     bitmapcoreheader.
 
     the "biwidth" field is the width of the image in image pixels.
 
     the "biheight" field is the height of the image in image lines.
 
     the "biplanes" field should always be set to 1.  this data is written  out
     as if there was one color plane.
 
     the "bibitcount" field is the bit-depth of the image.  this must be either
     1, 4, 8, or 24, depending on the bit-depth of the image data.
 
     the "bicompression" field tells how the image data is compressed if it  is
     compressed.	   dib	images	support	 two  forms  of	 run-length  encoding.
     however, i have never seen any images which use it, and don't know yet how
     it works.  set this field to zero (long zero, or 0l), to indicate that the
     data is not compressed.
 
     all subsequent fields of the bitmapinfoheader  structure  may  be  set  to
     zero.   a  requirement  of	the  interpretting software that it be able to
     compute these fields as necessary from the previous information.
 
     the field which you might want to explicitly specify might be "biclrused".
     for	 4-bit	and  8-bit  images  this  field	 indicates that not all of the
     possible color entries are used and that the  image	 contains  "biclrused"
     colors.  if you are using only 32 colors with an 8-bit image, then you may
     only want to save 32 of the possible 256 palette entries.  generally,  set
     this field to zero.

     color palettes
 
     each entry of a  color  palette  is	 a  rgbquad  structure.	  the  rgbquad
     structure is defined in the "windows.h" include file as:
 	 typedef struct tagrgbquad {
 		 byte	 rgbblue;
 		 byte	 rgbgreen;
 		 byte	 rgbred;
 		 byte	 rgbreserved;
 	 } rgbquad;
     the "rgbreserved" field is always zero.  for each color used,  the	amount
     of blue, green, and red are filled into the structure and the structure is
     written to the file.  a value of zero in  the  "rgbblue",  "rgbgreen",  or
     "rgbred"   fields  indicates  that	that  particular  component  does  not
     contribute to the color composition.  a value  of  255  in	any  of	 these
     fields  indicates  that  the  component  contributes  fully	 to  the color
     composition.
 
 
 
     image data
 
     there are three surprises about the ordering of image data	in  dib	 image
     file.   the	 creator  of  this  format  was determined to be creative, and
     certainly was.
 
     within the image data, each line written out is padded to  the  next  four
     byte  quantity.   so,  if  you had an 8-bit image which was only one pixel
     wide, you still have to write out four bytes for every  image  line.   the
     number of bytes per line can be calculated as:
 
 		 bytes_per_line = (width_in_pix * bit_depth + 31 ) / 32 * 4;
 
 	---or, in terms of the fields of the bitmapinfoheader structure---
 
 		 bytes_per_line = (biwidth * bibitcount + 31 ) / 32 * 4;
 
 
     when writing out your image data, you must write it out bottom line first.
     the	 bottom line of the image as you would look at it on the screen is the
     first line of image data in the file.
 
     for 1-bit, 4-bit, and 8-bit images, information is written	as  you	 would
     expect.   one  bit	images	are  padded  eight pixels to a byte.  four bit
     images are padded two pixels to a byte.  eight bit images are written  one
     pixel per byte.  twenty-four bit images are written three bytes per pixel.
     however, for 24-bit images the information must  be	 written  out  in  the
     order  blue,  green, red.  while most image file formats write data out in

     an "rgb" ordering, a dib image file	 writes	 the  data  out	 in  an	 "bgr"
     ordering.
 
     summary
 
     this  should  provide  enough  information	to  create  dib	 images	  from
     applications  such	as  scanners  or for image exporting routines.	if you
     find out any more about dib images, please pass the information on	to  me
     so that i can modify this document accordingly.
