 	i assume you're using the driver available from cica (hp4-v108.zip).
 bring up the setup screen of the printer through control panel. click on the
 "options" button brings up another screen of choices. change the "graphics
 mode" from "hp-gl/2" to "raster" and check the box "print truetype as graphics
 (this is only available when you choose "raster"). now you should be able to
 print all your truetype fonts correctly. good luck.
