 	first of all, without wanting to sound nagging and bossy, yes it is
 a trivial answer and that's perfectly fine ( otherwise how is one supposed
 to move up to the complicated and challenging questions, we net readers so
 much enjoy :) ?), and the massive crossposting of your article was not
  justified...
 please refer to appropriate newsgroups next time (by the way c.o.msw.misc is
 ok :) ). now as far as your problem is concerned: try playing around with
 the settings in the 'fonts..." dialog box under the window control menu (that
 little square at the top left corner of the window..).
