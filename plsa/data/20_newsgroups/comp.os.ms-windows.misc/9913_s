 another alternative is to clean the mouse you've got.  sometimes the
 rollers inside the mouse pick up a ball of lint or other debris.  open the
 bottom of the mouse, take out the ball and use some alcohol on a q-tip to
 clean it out.  inspect the inside for any hairs or fuzz.  i have had my
 mouse get real jumpy and cleared up the problem with this procedure.
