 	winzip 4.0 (ftp.cica.indiana.edu:pub/pc/win3/(util?) ). it is
 a shell (it does call dos ), but a very, very good one. it will also
 do arc, arj and lzh. it fully supports pkzip 2.04 . try using it...
 it might be a shell --very unobtrusive--, but that also means you dont
 need to update it with every every-other-letter-of-the-alphabet version
 of pkzip... :)
 hope it helps....
