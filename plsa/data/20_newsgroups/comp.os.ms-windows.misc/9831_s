 
 i am looking for a windows utility that would give me a listing of files
 in a directory, but also display a description of the file.  this utility
 would allow me to enter and edit file descriptions of, hopefully, any 
 length (maybe a small window with a scroll bar?).  i would then be able
 to browse my directories and be able to see what is in a file without
 having to open or execute it.  any such beast out there?  if not, anyone
 want to write one?
