 two things that annoyed me about the pc magazine review:
 
 1.  their benchmarking technique is seriously flawed, as was clearly shown
     by the graphite and #9gxe's "cheating".  can't they just admit that
     their benchmark is to easy to optimize for and/or cheat on?  wintach
     is much harder to beat...
 
 2.  the big "cheat" that hercules/iit used was overlappipping bitblit and
     polyline optimization, and hercules sent them a new driver which didn't
     do this -- but produced almost identical scores.  yet, the only thing
     pc magazine says is that scores are not "legitimate" -- couldn't they
     at least make some comment about its real-world performance?
 
 i'm not so much going by winbench for performance, but, rather, by steve
 gibson's results, which are more real-world based (like using micrografx
 draw to benchmark).  if you believe gibson, that is ... :)  he writes:
 
     "despite these documented cheats, i have to say that in real-world
      applications the hercules graphite adapter actually draws faster than
      any other display adapter in the industry.   [...]  even though it's
      just a modest isa bus card, it outperformed every local bus adapter i
      have, including the stealth 24 vlb, the fahrenheit 1280va/vlb, the
      ati vlb mach32 and even the weitek p9000-based diamond viper vlb."
 
 this kind of praise is enough for me to be interested in it, bogus winbench
 or not!  :)

 i already returned the ati gu+.  my dealer had sold eight of them, and 
 seven were returned to him.  i'm now (temporarily) back to running an
 original ati gu, until i get my graphite.  and, yes, the gu is faster in
 my 16 mb system than the gu+, especially in bitmap handling (that's where
 you use bitblits).
 
 hercules has a promotion available for vars and software developers: you
 can buy one graphite or graphite vlb for 50% off list to try it out.  at
 just $199 for graphite or $249 for the vlb version i decided it was worth
 trying (i'm supposed to get the vlb board within two weeks).  i'll post
 my impressions when i get it...
