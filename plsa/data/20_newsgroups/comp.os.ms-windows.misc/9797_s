 if you install the soundblaster windows drivers correctly, and have
 the latest drivers, the media player should be setup to play files
 authored to microsoft's multimedia midi authoring standard (general
 midi), see the section in the back of the voyetra manual in the
 soundblaster midi upgrade kit.
 you'll find that midi files exist with all kinds of different
 mappings, so don't expect them to always sound correct without using
 some kind of midi file editor, such as voyetra's sequencer plus.
 
 you can attempt to use the midi-mapper to remap the patches for
 soundblaster, but since you cannot modify the sbfm.drv you are allways
 stuck with the instruments that come with this driver.  unless you can
 find an editor for making modifications to the instrument settings in
 sbfm.drv , i would suggest you locate the early version of
 soundblaster drivers that were mapped to mt32 voices, and the later
 drivers that are mapped to the general midi voices.
