 very well indeed.  at home (a vl bus version of the graphics pro) i can stretch
 an avi window to 640x480 and it will continue to play back smoothly.  it drops
 a few more frames but on most machines even attempting such a thing would mean
 one frame update every 30 seconds.  an isa graphics+ was able to do "zoom by
 2" without any perceptible performance penalty.  it is the best performance
 i've seen so far with the possible exception of an intel indeo board (which
 uses overlay so it doesn't have to move the decompressed data over the isa
 bus at any point).
