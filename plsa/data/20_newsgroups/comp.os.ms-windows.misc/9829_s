 do you mean that the pentium is better than a risc?  or that it will outsell
 them all?  if the first, you have to remember that intel cisc (like the
 pentium) are a always a generation away from the best riscs... also riscs
 cpu are more costly because they are not sold in the same quantities (not
 even on the same order)...  but i remember reading about 3 years (maybe 2)
 about a t800(?) from hypercube that did a 100 mips, was superscallar and
 reordered its instruction itself so
