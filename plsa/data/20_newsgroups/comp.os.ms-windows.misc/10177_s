 i assumed he was referring to os/2's 32-bit flat model addressing while dos
 (and therefore windows) use 20-bit segmented addressing.  as a programmer, i
 agree that segmentation unnecessarily complicates things.  it's annoying, too.
 but when just a windows user, i don't think about it much.  and, i doubt many
 other people think about it (or even care) when just writing a document,
 calcing a spreadsheet, etc...it works and they get their work done.
 
 just a neutral comment:
 it's funny, i think, how arguments about windows vs os/2 sound so very
 similar to arguments about atheism vs christianity or something like that.
 it's somehow very personal to people.  convictions are irrational and
 there's nothing wrong with that--it's just...interesting.
