 if you are managing pc's on a novell network, get the network management
 tools provided by either sabre software or automated design systems. 
 among the many features, you'll find utilities that can help you to
 manage .ini files stored on users' workstations or home directories. 
 this is commercial software and well worth the money.  to date, i have
 not found anything available via ftp that could compare.  reply to the
 address in my .sig for more info.
