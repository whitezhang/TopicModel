  
 i am not sure whether i am here in the right area, but does 
 anybody here know whether windows nt does/will include a x 
 windows server so that it can run x window applications 
 remotely? this is because we are considering at our university 
 to use pc's for word processing and program development, 
 whereas the bigger jobs are to be run either on sun 
 workstations or on fujitsu super computers.
  
 thank you very much in advance,
 hein.
