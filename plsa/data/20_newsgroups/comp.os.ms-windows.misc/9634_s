 i had this very same problem, and did 'work around' by turning parity checking off, but that only
 worked while i was in windows, and the parity error would occur immediately after exiting
 windows, however,the problem turned out to be 3 chip simms vs 9 chip simms.  i can't use 3 chip simms in my 
 computer, and when i replaced them, the problem vanished, forever.
