 i use a pc with a screen access program (ibm screen reader) and a
 speech synthesizer. (accent sa).
 
 i would like to find out about screen access programs for the windows
 platform.  i heard that were a couple of them out now under beta
 testing, i would like to find out addresses/prices etc.
 
 thanks,
