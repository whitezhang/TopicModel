 autodesk animator is a good tool. the one i like is show partner/fx. if
 you want it, i could give a copy to you. i did a lot of advertising with it -
 it lets you create both graphics (any resolution) and text frames, run it all
 as a "film", you can make choices and include music - i guess that's just
 what you need. if you're really interested, email me.
