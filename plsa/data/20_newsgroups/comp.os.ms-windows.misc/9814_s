 i just bought a bj-200 printer a couple of days ago.  i compared it to the 
 sample print of an hp deskjet 500 and knew that the hp wasn't for me.  the 
 bj-200 is pretty fast and really prints with good quality.  i can compare it 
 with the hp laserjet iiid postscript and they look almost identical (
 depending on the kind of paper).  i don't have problems with the ink not 
 being dry, it seems to dry very fast.  probably within a second.  since 
 canon is giving a $50 rebate until the end of may, it is really a good buy.
