   well, i've come into some money and want to buy cd-rom, sound board
 and speakers.  i have not kept up on any material relating to sound
 boards and cd-rom's because until now i never thought i'd have enough
 money.  
 
   so can you guru's out there point me in the direction of a good
 package including cd-rom, sound, and speakers (and software i
 suppose)... or since i don't really need the cd-rom right now give me
 some good ideas for sound boards and speakers.  those i could really
 use now.  i have looked at soundblaster pro, which costs about as much
 as i think i want to spend on a board (~$120), and i've looked at the
 gravis sound board, which is about $140 and i don't know the
 adv/disadv of either of these boards.  
 
   right now i want to use it with any games that support sound, and to
 use in windows 3.1 to utilize sound capabilities there.  so any
 concise info on sound boards, complete multimedia packages, etc would
 be greatly appreciated.  if anyone else is interested in this info i
 would be glad to summarize responses and post.  
 
   and if this is some type of faq please point me in the right
 direction and don't bother taking up a lot of bandwidth.  thanks!
