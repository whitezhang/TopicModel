 
 i've got an old super vga card manufactured by sampo of taiwan and i'm
 looking for a windows 3.1 driver for it.  it's based on the cirrus logic
 cl-gd510a-32pc-b chip.  i've contacted the suppliers here in new zealand
 and they say that only windows 2 divers were ever written by the manufacturer.
 so if there's a v3.1 driver out for this chip set i'd like to know - 
 preferably by e-mail at rjwjames@waikato.ac.nz
                      
 thanks is advance
