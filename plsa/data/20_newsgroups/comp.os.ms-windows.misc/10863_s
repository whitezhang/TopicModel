 lotus organizer!!!  quick, cheap, pretty!  and has all of those features

 you might look at one of the shell alternatives provided by third
 parties.  norton desktop for windows, for instance.
 
 personally, i *like* file manager, which comes with windows.  it's much
 faster than ndw's, and the file manager that's part of windows for
 workgroups even has a decent button bar.

 that first you can do with file manager, but the others you'll need
 to look at ndw or pc tools for windows, etc.

 i haven't yet seen a decent freeware or even shareware shell.  but
 it may be just me.
