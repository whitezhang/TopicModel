 it certainly smacks of that! remember the "poll" that you quoted saying that
 you had seen a 95% of users being satisfied with dos 6.0? care to recall how
 unbiased the sample set was? that post sure looked like fud....and coming
 from a microsoftie .... well, it sure seemed like something was not on level.
 
 advocacy is good - but spreading fud to advocate your favorite os is very 
 unethical - especially when you have a vested interest in the success of that
 os.

 that is because their actions seem to invite this opinion - never seen more 
 defensive people in my life. moreover, many of their posts seem to encourage
 this too, imho.
 
 seriously speaking, it is a shame that ms techie employees get the heat for
 ms's actions - most of which are perpetrated by the management and marketing.
 i am sure that they are very talented etc ... i have not doubts about their 
 abilities, just about the ethics of their marketing practices.
