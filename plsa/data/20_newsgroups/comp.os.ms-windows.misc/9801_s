 
 
 
 is their a pd/freeware hard drive utility that can handle
 a compressed ide drive without screwwing it up?
 
 need to document occasional failures in reading/writing,
 check overall integrity of disk's hardware and sectors.
 
 i believe that all of my problems with dos/windows can
 be isolated to my drive.  getting occasional corrupted
 files, even with smartdrive, 32 bit access turned off.
 had these problems under dos 5.  only with drive c.
 drive d may have had one failure, but that file was
 under the control of win/winword on drive c.
 
 all utilities available to me report no problems.
 dos, ndd (nu4.5).  another symptom, sd took forever
 on c, and kicked me out with a suspension till ndd run
 6 to 8 times.
 
 thanks.
