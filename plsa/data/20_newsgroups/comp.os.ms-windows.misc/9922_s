 ummm.. i think you left the message out...
 
 i get these protection faults all the time on my machine at work, a
 486 33mhz with 4mb ram, windows 3.1, with dos 5.0.  
 
 at home (on a 386 40mhz, 8mb ram, windows 3.1 and dos 5.0) i *never* get
 these.  
 
 any idea what could be wrong?  someone already suggested i check for tmp
 files in the windows/temp directory, there are none there.
 
 the message i get is:
 
 	this application has violated system integrity due to an invalid
 	general protection fault and will be terminated.
 
 i only have this problem with applications running in dos boxes (with or
 without .pif files setup for them).
 
 any hints/help greatly appreciated.  please post since at least one other
 person is also having gpf problems.
 
 thanks,
     gordon
