 i've had the same problem with a maxtor 7213a.  turned off
 smartdrive, 32 bit disk access, etc.  this same disk aborts
 norton speed disk (nu 4.5), up to 8 times, requesting ndd to be
 run when attempting to defrag drive.  at some peoples' suggestion
 i reformatted my drive and reloaded dos 5.0, win 3.1 from
 scratch.  a few people found that installing 3.1 on top of 3.1
 beta on top of 3.0 caused a similar problem, so i tried this
 drastic solution.  when the problem reoccurred, i didn't have the
 brains not to load 6.0 and dblespaced the drive.
 
 i get arround the annoyance by copying my *.grp files to *.gro.
 when i get the message, i run file manager and copy the
 offeniding group files from *.gro ove rthe *.grp.  then i quit
 and restart windows(if the group is an often used important one.)
 
 this really sucks.  but i'm pretty sure that the problem is the
 drive (especially with the nsd problem).  i will be going with
 out over 66% of my memory after finals for 2 to 4 weeks, while
 the guy i bought the disk and system from, goes over it and
 either fixes it or replaces the drive.  i can't wait to have a
 system that will run consistently with all hte goodies!
