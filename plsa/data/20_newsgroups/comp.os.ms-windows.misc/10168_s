 it does sound funny, i will admit.  but for me it is true.  windows crashed on
 all of the time (and from what i have read in pc mag, this is not the exception)
 .  os/2 gives each windows app a vdm and they can't touch each other or
 (generally) anything they aren't supposed to have.  if windows works for you,
 then great.  maybe this is why some people don't see why os/2 is the os of 
 choice.  if windows doesn't crash on you, and you don't mind waiting on each
 task, and not being able to adress your memory better than dos, some of the
 key reasons for using os/2 are gone.  i probably  would still use it, but it
 would be more of an even fight.
