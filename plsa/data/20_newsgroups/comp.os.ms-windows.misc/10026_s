 
 word 2.0c doesn't show the period-centred character to indicate
 spaces if i use the ttfonts from coreldraw.  our editors need to
 be able to see how many spaces are in text but the character 
 displayed is a large hollow box.  they overlap each other and
 characters on each side, which is useless.
 
 i believe the character used by w4w is the period-centred (0183).
 this character shows up with the windows charmap display as the
 hollow box which tends to confirm this.  i have edited the corel
 font with fontmonger and changing the font graphics for the 0183
 character makes no difference to the font output in charmap or w4w.
 altering the paragraph (0182) or cedilla (0184) does alter their font
 graphics displayed however!!
 
 is the w4w character used to indicate spaces the period-centred character? 
 
 has anyone been able to get this character displayed from a coreldraw ttf?
