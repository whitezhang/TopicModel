 perusing through my windows 3.1 directory, i came across a file
 called regload.exe.  i assume this is part of the registration
 database, but neither my windows manual, win resource kit, nor
 pc mag's description of files in the windows directory had a
 reference to it.  at least not one that i could find.  does
 regedit.exe use it?  or am i way off base?
