 i have used both version 1.17 drivers for win 3.1 and the new 2.03 drivers.
 i have had none of these problems.  no gpf's at all.  i have a feeling that
 your problems are not with the card or drivers.  the ati ultra drivers are
 considered some of the most reliable on the market, and the ss 24x ones 
 seem quite good as well.  maybe you should check bios problems in your
 gateway.  i know a few people with gateway dx2's, and all of them have
 found some problem or other with compatibility -- especially with graphics.
 
 the only gpf's i have ever had can be directly attributable to using/
 abusing applications.  i even got the newest drivers from diamond when 
 people started complaining.  i still only have one small problem with
 them, and it is that the hardware cursor is slightly jumpy during writes/
 reads to the swap file.
