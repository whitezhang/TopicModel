 it was 93%-94%, and actually another msdos team member posted it.
 note that people not on the msdos team would not necessarily know
 about that, or...
 
 >care to recall how unbiased the sample set was? 
 
 when i heard those numbers i wondered how they got them (having
 worked in product support and knowing that the typical support caller
 has very little positive to say about the product, i figured it wasn't
 from there...) so i wandered over to the marketing folks and asked.
 and i was told it was from a survey of registered users.  and i 
 posted that on the net when people asked where the 93% figure came 
 from.

 hmm. i figured, if chuck posted the numbers, why not include where
 they came from? (i also find it interesting that postitive info is 
 "fear, uncertainty & doubt".)

 ????  i think you've got me confused with someone else. i don't 
 pretend that msdos provides what all people need, or that other
 oses (including unix & os/2) don't provide useful and/or necessary
 features.  i also don't push people to use msdos; i even posted in
 comp.os.msdos.misc that i suggest _waiting_ before installing a 
 new os, esp if you have trouble (support is always overloaded 
 during release, unless the sales are a total bomb).

 i ain't saying some of us don't get defensive sometimes. do you *really*
 think msdos gets any more respect within microsoft than outside it?
 
 i just mean we all aren't cut out of the same dough with the same cookie
 cutter. we don't all think alike.  yeah, chuckst and i have some "inside"
 info on msdos - doesn't mean that everyone else does :)
