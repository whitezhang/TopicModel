 
 i quit windows normally to run a special dos app, got done with it
 and tried to start windows.  ok got the title screen, windows
 background, dos with an error about loading progman.exe.  hum, yep
 progman.exe is still there.  must be bad, ok pull off progman.exe
 from a backup tape, start windows, get the windows title screen,
 windows background, dos with the same error.  hum!  fire up the
 good ol' norton disk doctor, test, 500 lost clusters!  ok, fix them,
 and look through them, doesn't look important.  remove the windows
 directory, and reinstall from disks.  fire up windows, title screen,
 background, program manager, success!  
 
 i have a 486/50 (amy) with 4 meg of ram, 120 meg hd, svga, running under
 dos 5.0, no special memory managers or stuff, just the basic windows 3.1
 a 12 meg permanent swap file using 32-bit access.  i mainly use windows
 to run more that one dos app at a time.  (ie downloading with qmodem
 with a dos window open, and possibly pov running in the background.)  
 
 i've noticed that since i started using windows a few months ago, lost
 clusters have gotten more and more common.  although i don't like
 having data just disappear, it really haven't been a problem except
 for today.  has anyone else had any problems with lost clusters while
 running windows?  and what could i do to fix the problem, i'd sleep
 better knowing amy wasn't loosing her marbles. :)
