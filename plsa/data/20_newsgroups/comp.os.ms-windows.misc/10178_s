 i  _do_ know  that  ibm systems, the ps/2 56slc2, in  particular, have
 absolutely no  problem  with  os/2--never had  a "random" crash  while
 running any of  my programs under  os/2.   in fact, i  don't  remember
 _ever_ crashing.
 
 of course, i really don't run any  os/2 programs, just the  same bunch
 of dos and windows stuff that i've always been running.
 
 and  when  i  had  the  56slc  (this is  the  386slc  system)  running
 dos/windows, i had only  one crash, and it was consistent.   ftp had a
 tendency  to  crash  whenever  i would  get  large  files (>1mb)  from
 particularly fast  clients  (dtr's  150k-200k/sec), i  figured out the
 problem was with smartdrv's write buffering--if i turned off the write
 buffer, everything would work fine.
 
 ftp under os/2 has never locked,  though.  i can even format  floppies
 (to use the most often cited example of the superiority of os/2.)

 yeah, i guess i'm willing to admit that os/2  is somewhat sensitive to
 specific hardware.  wp51 for dos works perfectly fine on my slc2...

 well,  i save all  my  personal files to floppy,  and when  i did that
 under windows, a floppy save of a large file hung up the system.
 
 i  also found  it quite bothersome to  have  to  continually tweak the
 tasking options  on fractint for dos whenever i wanted to do a fractal
 computation in the background.

 the idea is  that os/2's dos sessions can see more memory than windows
 dos  sessions.  i  let  xpl (a  shareware calculus program) see around
 720kb of free _conventional_ memory, which lets me  do bigger symbolic
 manipulations than is possible  under straight dos (where it would see
 around 610kb of conventional ram.).  i  also found it really handy for
 my _own_ dos-based programs, which, without  any re-writing, could now
 handle larger data sets, simulate for more iterations, etc. of course,
 the  point is  now moot,  since  the os/2 programs i now write  simply
 _never_ run into memory limitations.  i never programmed  for windows,
 so i don't have much of a comparison here, though....
