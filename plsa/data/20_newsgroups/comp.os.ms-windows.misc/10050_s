 hi everybody out there,
 i just got the third beta release disk (march 93) of windowsnt
 and still am not able to boot up that system. the final step
 achieved is the display of io-error 0x0069. but, since this is
 the beta release of the sdk for nt and not of nt, microsoft does
 not include a manual on the os itself, explaining what this
 error means of what i can do to get rid of. my configuration
 is: 
 mainboard     hauppauge 4860-25, rev. a7 (a 486 with socket for i860)
               28megs of memory (512k*36,1m*36,2m*36)
 ami eisa scsi controller (15series), latest bios, 16mb cache 
               st41200n hard disk
               syquest 555 removable disk
               toshiba 3301 cd rom drive
 proaudio spectrum plus 16
 longshine ethernet card lcs8634 (ne2000 comp.)
 et4000 graphics card, 1meg (colorimage5)
 the system is running fine under dos and windows 3.1 etc, but
 trying to do the setup for nt,
 - automatic setup does not recognize controller (aha1542-compat.)
   when adding manually, nt complains not finging any cd-rom drive
 - the manual setup (winnt) does not copy everything from cd to hd,
   does not recognize controller, but takes it manually.
   setup continues until it tries to boot. then it starts loading
   several stuff from disk (seems to fing the hd), but messing up
   with that damned io-error 69.
 i took away all io cards not essential, but that did not make any
 effect.
 anybody got any ideas? help would be greatly appreciated.
