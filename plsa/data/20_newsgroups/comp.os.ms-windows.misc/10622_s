 
 i'd like to get a system running os/2 2.0 ga talking to a network of pcs
 running windows for workgroups.  acting as a server would be wonderful,
 but client access would be enough.
 
 can i run wfw 's net utilities in a dos box?  or is there a way to actually
 get os/2 to talk to wfw?  will os/2 lanman clients talk to wfw?
 
 dazed and confused,
