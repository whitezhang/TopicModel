 hi there,
 
 we are running a 120 node token ring with windows 3.1 and novell 3.11.
 
 every once in a while, we run into "the black screen of death", a phrase
 coined by robert x. cringely in a recent infoworld column.  
 
 basically, sometimes when you quit windows, the screen goes black and
 you get a nice little flashing cursor in the top left corner of your
 screen.  also, sometimes when you exit to dos, the same effect occurs.
 cringely hints that microsoft and/or novell has a patch for windows'
 virtual interrupt controller that  may solve this.  neither company
 seems to know what i am talking about when i call them.
 
 has anyone else noticed this phenomenon?  
 
 is there a fix for it?
 
 any response is welcome.
