 
 hello netters
 
 	i recenlty aquired enough money to purchase a laser printer.
 the other day, i bought the computer shopper mag.  i was looking through
 printer review section and noticed the winprinter800.  the machine is 
 incredibly low priced for all the features it has 
 
 			800 dpi!
 			8meg ram
 			postscript compatable
 			envelope printing
 
 my question is does anyone have one of these or know why the price is so
 cheap?  i would appricaiate it if someone would pass on their knowledge
 on this subject.  thanks alot!
