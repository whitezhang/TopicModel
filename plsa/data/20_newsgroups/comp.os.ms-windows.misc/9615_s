 
 i have an okidata 2410 printer for which i would like to have a printer driver.
 has anyone seen such a thing?  there is not one on the microsoft bbs.
 i can print to it from windows but i have no fonts available and with
 paradox for windows i can't print labels on it unless there is a proper printer
 defined.
 
 
 thanks,
