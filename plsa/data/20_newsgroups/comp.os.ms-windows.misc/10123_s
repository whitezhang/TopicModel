 personally, i'll be blasphemous and say that if microsoft keeps doing
 what it does so well, i hope to see much harsher/stricter copyright
 and patent laws for computer algorithms, concepts, interfaces, and
 other intellectual properties to protect real innovators. i'd hate to
 be one who actually does innovate, and then have microsoft come in
 like a huge vulture and use their brute mass (development staff,
 marketing, etc) to get fat off of my innovation. i don't have all
 that much sympathy for apple's complaint against microsoft, since
 they just took the ideas from xerox's pa research center when the
 federal government forced xerox to disclose their patents over
 antitrust fears. however, for other companies and individuals who
 have a great idea, yet get it "borrowed" by larger corporations who
 can afford to quickly bring it to market, without any licensing from
 the original innovator, i feel much sympathy.
