 
 is there a hot-key for the windows 3.1 screen saver utility?  if not, is
 there an easy way to create one?  the reason that i need one is that my
 dad's company is anal retentive about leaving a computer while the
 information can be accessed so the employees are not allowed to walk away
 from the computer until the screen saver kicks in (as if that is terribly
 secure).  also, the system manager won't let any software be added so 
 another program such as lock32.zip from cica or a different screen saver
 is out.
 
 thanks for any and all help.
