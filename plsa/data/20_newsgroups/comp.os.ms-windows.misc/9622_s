 i hope this will clear it up :
 
 (taken from one of my lecture notes)
 
  " ...  the alternative approach (to cisc),
  which has been adopted by many in
  recent years, has come to be known as "risc": the reduced
  instruction set computer.  this can be characterised simply as
  "simpler is faster"; by simplifying the design (e.g.  by reducing
  the variety of instructions & addressing modes), the hardware can be
  designed to run faster.  even at the cost of needing more
  instructions, the same task can be done more quickly by the simpler,
  faster design.
 
  a typical risc processor will:
 
     o provide a large number of registers (e.g.  32);
 
     o perform all data operations on registers;
 
     o provide few addressing modes (e.g. immediate or 'register + offset');
 
     o only allow load & store operations to access memory;
 
     o only use a few instruction formats;
 
     o only support a few data types (e.g. integer, unsigned, floating).

 are 50-50 it will.
