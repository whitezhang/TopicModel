 
 after setting up a very large (>4 pages) table in word for windows
 i asked word to print it to my hp laserjet ii -- worked fine at first.
 after much editing of the table contents (but not structure) output
 requests now kick the lj into manual feed mode for the document
 containing the table.  other documents without tables print correctly.
 
 where should i look and what should i change to get the document with
 the long table to use the paper drawer rather than kick into manual
 feed mode? [i believe i've tried all the obvious printer manager changes
 as well as replacing the hppcl.[lp]00 files with archived versions.]
 
 thanks for any and all help.
