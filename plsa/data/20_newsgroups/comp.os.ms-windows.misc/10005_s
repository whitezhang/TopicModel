 
 does anyone know how to configure a dos app in progman
 so that only one instance of it can be running at a time?
 
 i'd really appreciate some help on how to do this.  i
 would prefer responses through email if it's not a big 
 deal, or at least through email _as well as_ posting.
 
 thank you!
