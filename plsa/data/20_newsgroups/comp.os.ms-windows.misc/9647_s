 has anyone experienced problems formatting a system floppy in the file
 manager under dos 6?  i get a formatted disk but when i boot with it,
 my hard drive isn't recognized.  i did install doublespace.  also, i
 *was* able to make a good-working system floppy from the dos 6 command
 shell (no windows).
 
 let me know if you've had this problem too and if you've heard what's
 going on.
