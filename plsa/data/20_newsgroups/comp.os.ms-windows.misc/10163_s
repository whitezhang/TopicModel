 since loading windows, two of my dos applications have been
 acting strangely.  it appears that font changes and page
 orientation changes (so far) are not being recognized in
 wordperfect/dos and quattropro/dos.  another dos application
 does accept font and page orientation changes, so i don't
 think the problem is with the printer.
 
 i reloaded quattropro, and these changes are still not
 accepted whether launching from windows or the dos prompt.
 
 does anyone have any suggestions as to where to look or how to
 correct this problem?  i've ordered quattropro for windows,
 but need a landscape application printed immediately.  please e-mail.
 
 thanks in advance!
