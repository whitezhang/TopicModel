 i am running windows 3.1 on a 386sx-16 mhz with five megs of memory.
 
 the motherboard came with one meg, and i added the four megs this past
 weekend.  they were 1x9 70 simms.
 
 i had installed in the application menu ms-dos command park.  up till
 today, it parked the disk from the application menu without any problem.
 
 when attempting to park the heads today, i received the following
 message:
 
 
 stop        this application has violated system integrity due to
             an invalid general protection fault and will be
             terminated.
 
 what does this message mean?
 
 thanks,
