 like it or not stock prices and sales of a particular product are measures
 of success. they can be measures of short term or long term success. i think
 in ms case they are a good measure of their long term success. the original
 post mentioned how it seems on this group that there are a large number
 of people attacking ms and not willing to accept anything positive about ms.
 i was trying to make a point that the attacks are over emphasized and to
 look at the sales of ms products they definitely tell a different story.
 
 i also think a large number of the attackers or debaters as you call
 them are highly technical. look around in the real world people don't want
 to grep and auck and ls -l they just want to push the buttons and get their 
 job done on a reasonably priced piece of hardware that does not need 
 a computer smart guy to load configure etc etc. like it or not ms and the
 multitudes of business applications that exist to run under windows does
 this and does it well. we are running 150 pc's loaded with a complete
 suite of mostly ms windows applications in an administrative business
 function on a novell network running all software off the server.
 it does the job quite well and if we had it to do over again we would pick
 windows again. 
 again i repeat to ms keep doing what you are doing. you are doing a great
 job.
