 i have the ati ultra pro local bus with 2mb vram, and i am perfectly happy with
 the windows drivers (currently using version 59).  it does everything you
 mention below, but also does 1024x768x16bpp true color.  as a matter of
 fact it also supports high refresh 1280x1024 at 256 colors.  the performance
 is great.

 supposedly the new matrox ultra-something-or-other actually does some
 3d rendering (at least has some hardware support for z).  good luck in
 your search.
