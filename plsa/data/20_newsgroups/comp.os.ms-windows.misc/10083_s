 has anyone observed this?  if i copy a large, say 800k+ file (a large pkzip
 file for instance) to my floppy drive (3.5") under ms windows 3.1 via either
 program manager or a dos shell, the file copied under the dos shell 
 has errors whereas the file copied from within program manager does not.
 
 the corruption is detected by executing "pkunzip -t b:\file.zip" after 
 both copies.  the file copied via the dos shell always shows corruption.
 
 
 now here's the kicker:
 
 
 i have many windows open while doing this; both dos and windows apps.
 supposedly all windows' apps share the same time slice, whereas the 
 dos apps get their own equal time slice (unless overriden).
 
 
 so, as an example, i have 5 windows' apps open, 2 multitasking dos sessions running,
 and one execution-execlusive dos shell iconized (inactive).  under this 
 scenario, cpu time is divided into two major slices:  one for all the windows
 apps and one slice for the running dos app.  
 
 when copying under windows pgm mgr, i'll assume the other windows and dos tasks
 are essentially inactive.  thus pgm mgr gets, say, 80% of the windows slice and
 95% of the execution-background dos shell's slices.  thus it gets (.8)(.95)^2 = 
 .72 or 72% of the total available cpu time. 
 
 when copying in a dos shell, i activate the execute-exclusive mode dos shell
 (no other dos background tasks allowed), full screen, under the windows task
 manager.  the cpu time available to this shell would be 80% of the windows slice
 (assumming inactive windows applications) and 100% of the dos slice: 
 (1.0)(.8) = .8 or 80% of the total available cpu time.
 
 so why do i get copy errors under dos if it has the greater amount of cpu
 time?  is program manager working in a pre-emptive mode during the floppy 
 copy?  it must be!
 
 
 
 miscellaneous data:  running windows on top of dos 5.0, qemm 5.x, rapidbios.sys,
                      2.0 mbyte smartdrive (no delayed writes), two ramdrives, 
                      logitech mouse driver 6.2, full 16mbytes motherboard ram,
                      64kbyte motherboard cache, 386 dx 33 mhz.
                      
                      running dos-edit.com tsr in the dos shell.
