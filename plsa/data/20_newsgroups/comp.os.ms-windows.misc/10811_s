 these are perfectly valid points and i agree. i'm glad we (ms) are starting
 to remedy this situation with dos 6 (and it will get better in future 
 releases). you do need to be aware of some history, however. in the 
 mid-late 80's, ms's point of view was that os/2 was going to take over
 the world and dos would be phased out. as such, resources for dos
 (and windows, for that matter) development were mostly redirected to os/2.
 the theory was to keep just enough resources on dos to support people
 until they started using os/2, so utilities and such for dos fell by the 
 wayside.
 
 then windows 3.0 hit the market, os/2 flopped (1.x, at least...2.x seems to
 be doing a little better, but its future is still cloudy), and people either
 stayed with their dos (3.x and 4.x) apps or moved to windows. about that
 point in time, ms made its decision to drop os/2 for dos/windows in the
 short term and windows/nt in the long term. dos 5, much improved over dos
 3.x and 4.x, was the first result of ms's refocussing on dos and windows.
 version 6 takes things somewhat further and i suspect future versions will
 offer even more in terms of "real" os features (i work on nt and have no
 real clue about what my coworkers over in dosland are doing, but i do
 know that there are a heck of a lot more of them than there were a
 few years ago).

 of course these are my opinions. if you want ms's opinions, as a pr person.
