 i would expect the eisa board to be more than twice as fast as the isa
 board.  not only are you moving data on a path twice as wide (at
 least), but there is a difference in the number of clocks required for
 bus transactions between the two busses.  most isa boards require
 multiple clocks per bus transaction -- typically this is around 3-4.
 eisa boards are suppose to be able to 'burst' at a 1:1 rate, so i
 would expect performance to be 6x-8x that of an isa card.  
 
 so i guess, for me, the question is unanswered still.  i would expect
 him to be able to see a 6x speed difference, and he apparently does
 not.
