 
 hi everyone,
 
 i would like to get an example program(source code) to get started with a simple
 editor (similar to windows dialog editor, but lot simplified) . can someone
 point me to a source such as a programming windows book, or example program
 comes with windows sdk (from microsoft or borland). i would greatly appreciate
 it.
 
 all i want to do is to be able to place a edit control or combobox or a listbox
 on a window and be able to drag and resize.
 
 if anyone has written similar program and don't mind sharing code or ideas, 
 i would appreciate it very much.
 
 thnx in advance, manu das
