 hi
 i'm having a problem with truetype fonts in windows 3.1. i have installed
 the cyrillic fonts i found on cica and now a strange thing happens:
 sometimes windows uses cyrillic when its supposed to use times roman.
 examples: the pc-tools backup (version 7.1) has one line of cyrillic text
 in its opening banner, the next to last line. importing a word for windows
 text written in times into wp5.2 also results in cyrillic.
 does anyone have an idea where to look for the problem?
 thanks
