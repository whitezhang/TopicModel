 actually, you might be surprised to find that not everyone who develops
 mainstream dos and windows apps develops them under dos or windows.  pc
 week recently printed a rumor that microsoft's excel development group
 does its development under os/2.  another trade rag did an article
 recently about a group doing windows development on sun sparcstations
 with softpc to test out their work.  sco unix is and has been a
 reasonably popular development platform for dos, windows, and even os/2
 apps.  dos and windows are simply not robust or stable enough for
 development work, imho, and apparently others agree.
