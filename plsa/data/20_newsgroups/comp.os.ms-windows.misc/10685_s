 	if jd power and associates did the survey, i would like an 
 	anonymous ftp site to pick it up at.  only a sucker believes
 	an ms released survey results about an ms product.  ok--assume
 	that the results of the survey, whatever they are, are 100%
 	honest.  if the results indicated extreme dissatisfaction with
 	the product, is ms going to tell us to stop buying ms-dos 6.0
 	because it sux? :-)  sure....

 	well, these "statistics" are to shut people up and add some
 	microscopic weight to ms' arguments.  as i just said, you have
 	seen what automakers do.  who is going to believe chrysler if
 	they tell us, "in a 'random' chrysler-conducted survey..."
 	my theory about certain people is that they are convinced that
 	if a point is maintained long enough, it is true.  after all,
 	what is the focus of this company?  information.  money and
 	information.  technology is, for some, an expedient toward
 	these ends.  why did bill gates drop out of college?  
 	was it because he couldn't afford it at the time?  was it
 	because (as the wsj says) he couldn't wait to use what he
 	knew to go out and make money?  bill gate's answer to this
 	question would be highly interesting.  i await it.
 	i can't stomach bill declaring himself a visionary and
 	using every available opportunity to build up the cult
 	around himself and then having ms sell dos and windoze
 	as their main stays.
