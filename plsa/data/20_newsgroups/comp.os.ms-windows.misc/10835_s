 i have been backing up my hard drive ever since i had to re-install
 everything from scratch after a crash (learned the hard way, didn't i?!).
 i am using a windows-based backup program (actually norton), and i 
 began wondering about the logic of this.  sure, if i accidentally delete
 a file, i can get it from the archive.  but what if my disk crashes again?
 i would not be able to start windows to run the backup program!  (note,
 by crash, i mean, there was some error message that prevented the machine
 from booting properly.  i think i gave up too early, but i didn't have
 the time/patience/tools to figure out exactly what the problem was.  my
 hard drive needed cleaning up anyway. yeah right...)  this whole scenario
 is complicated by the fact that i am using stacker.
 
 so i think there are 2 possibilities:
 
    1) i'm right.  if my disk really crashes, i would at least have to
       re-install dos and windows to get the backup program working.
    2) i'm wrong.  there is an easy way to make a "mirror" of a hard disk
       that can easily restore it's state from scratch.
 
 the polls are open...
