 i have heard many things about the ati ultra pro card. some have
 been positive but most are negative. could people please confirm
 these?  (i am interested in the eisa version in particular).
 
 1) the card does not work in a system with 32m ram.
 
 2) the card works in a 32m system with some switches
    set but it is much slower.
 
 3) the card is _interlaced_ in its 24bit (true-colour) modes.
 
 4) the latest build 59 drivers still do not work in many
    cases.
 
 5) this card is the fastest full colour card for the money.
 
 6) this card is the greatest thing since sliced bread. ;-)
 
 thanks for your feedback. i will summarize.
