 *** this is long ***
 
 i have 16mb of memory on my 386sx (25 mhz), an intel math coprocessor, and
 a 120mb hard drive with 20mb free (no compression).  i have been running
 mathcad 3.1, under windows 3.1 in enhanced mode, with a 5mb ram drive,
 2mb/1mb smart drive, and no swap file (permanent or temporary) for
 several months.
 
 i am interested in the faster mathcad 4.0, but i am concerned about reported
 swap file requirements and the legitimacy of mathsoft's claim about increased
 speed.
 
 to 386sx users:
 
   will mathcad 4.0 run without a swap file, or insist that i use a swap file?
 
 so far, in response to a less detailed description of my setup, or in
 unrelated postings, the more informed answers, on the net or by e-mail,
 appear to be:

 * so it seems that in addition to the system requirements shown on mathsoft's  *
 * advertisement for 4.0, that you need a swap file, possibly as big as 12mb.   *
 * looks like i would just need an 8mb swap file, and would need to choose (or  *
 * can i?) between a faster permanent swap file, or a slower temporary swap file*
 *                                                                              *
 * apparently a win32 subsystem ships with mathcad 4.0 - how much disk space    *
 * does this require?                                                           *

 i also received these answers:
 
   1) by mfdjh@uxa.ecn.bgu.edu (dale hample) >>
 
    >> if you've got 16 megs of ram, why not configure 10megs as a ram disk for

 * can mathcad 4.0 + win32 be configured to use such a ram drive instead of a   *
 * swap file?  if not, i don't see how using dos 6.0 for an alternate bootup    *
 * would provide windows with this swap file.   some time back i remember a     *
 * discussion about the issues of using a ram drive to support a swap file,     *
 * but i thought this involved slower, < 8mb systems.                           *
 *                                                                              *
 * i have dos 6.0 but for various reasons have not yet done a full installation.*

 * by the way, is a full installation of dos 6.0 required to avail oneself of   *
 * the "alternate bootup" feature?  which files from the installation disks are *
 * required?                                                                    *
