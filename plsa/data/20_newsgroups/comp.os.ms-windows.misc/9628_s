 hhhheeeellllpppp meeeeeee!
 
 	i installed a 256 color svga driver for my windows last week.   
 this driver was downloaded from ftp.cica.indiana.edu specifically for  
 paradise svga card.  however, after i installed it and when i run windows,  
 the startup screen in the beginning becomes the old windows 3.0 startup  
 screen ????!!??!!
 
 	everything works fine except the startup screen.  i know the  
 startup screen must have been changed in the system.ini file (or is it ?)  
 but i couldn't figure out what to alter!   can some one help me with this?   
 please e-mail to my address:
 
 	thang@tree.egr.uh.edu  or  thang@jetson.uh.edu
 
 in addition, can anyone know where can i get a 1024x680 paradise svga  
 driver (256 color) ?  this is a used computer and i do not have anything  
 (drivers, etc) regarding the driver....
 
 thanks in advance.......;o)
