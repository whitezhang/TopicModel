 wfwg does use ndis but it cooperates well with the ndis shim for odi.
 (i've heard that it is as fast as ndis direct)

 the additional tsr load is minimal.  i think i eat another  20k total.
 this is worth it to me since it allows me to get to my windows nt 
 box.  novell hasn't released a decent nt novell client yet so i share
 through my wfwg box.         
                                                
 this solution is very usable.
