 
 i have an ibm and run windows 3.1.  a friend installed norton desktop for
 windows on top of this.  it loads automatically when i type "win", and
 surely adds to the (already dismally slow) process of starting up.
 
 i would like to know how to stop or uninstall this program!!
 
 i have taken it out of win.ini, but it still pops up running with windows.
 i did a big search and found reference to it in ndw.ini, system.ini and
 progman.ini.  removing it here causes a failure when starting up windows
 (progrman.ini has a "group 7 = ...ndw.exe..." which can't be deleted.)
 
 is there anyone familiar with ndw who can tell me how to turn it off??
 
 		thanks!		chet
