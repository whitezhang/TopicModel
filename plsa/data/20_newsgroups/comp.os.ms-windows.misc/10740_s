 if you happen to be running the new msdos 6, you could use multi-
 setup to provide a menu with a menu choice for each person using
 the machine ... power up, select your name,  the menu will use your
 personal sections of config.sys and autoexec.bat thus setting up the
 path, then running your windows copy!
