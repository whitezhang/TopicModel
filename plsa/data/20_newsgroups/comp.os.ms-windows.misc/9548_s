 hi, everybody:
     i guess my subject has said it all.  it is getting boring
 looking at those same old bmp files that came with windows.  so,
 i am wondering if there is any body has some beautiful bmp file
 i can share.  or maybe somebody can tell me some ftp site for
 some bmp files, like some scenery files, some animals files,
 etc....  i used to have some, unfortunately i delete them all.
 
 anyway could me give me some help, please???
 
 thanks a lot!
