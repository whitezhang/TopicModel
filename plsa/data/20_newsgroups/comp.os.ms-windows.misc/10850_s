 it has been done, but the other companies don't have the marketing
 budgets that ms do.  4dos, for instance, is everything that
 command.com should have been (but never could be under ms).  those who
 use it usually find it more addictive than crack cocaine.  but they
 have to rely on word of mouth for sales.  it seems to have worked
 pretty good so far, but your corporate weenie manager type usually
 likes to see a big glossy ad in pc magazine.  that's okay, marketing
 isn't a fundamental human right, but they've got a product that's
 superior to the dos command interpreter in every way.  they have a lot
 more to be proud of than ms does.  if ms really gave a damn, they
 could duplicate it, buy it outright (they've got the money), or even
 use the old ruse of sending engineers out to help them with
 compatability issues and absconding with the technology.
 
 dos is a mediocre product at a cheap price backed up by top notch
 marketing and vendor agreements.  the "mediocre" was excusable in the
 early days when it was someone else's hack, but they've had ten years
 to play with it.
 
 an interesting thought on that: most ms products that i'm aware of in
 the last few years allow you to access the names of the designers and
 programmers through easter egg screens, including windows, or at least
 have the names buried in the files.  is there such a thing in dos 5.0
 and 6.0, or are they too ashamed to have their names on it?
