 
 to clarify:  
 
 vc++ *is* considered an upgrade for c7.  there will be no product
 called c 8.0 (although the command-line compiler of vc++ lists its
 version as 8.00).  c7 is not a "dos"-only product -- it is a c/c++
 compiler capable of producing executables for dos or windows, as is
 vc++ (pro. ed.).  the (significant) difference is that vc++ comes with
 many windows-hosted tools (ide, etc) which assist developers in
 creating windows executables much more quickly (basically by
 automating the thousands of lines of boilerplate code).  initial
 impressions have been very favorable.
 
 everyone who is a registered user of c7 should have received a
 considerable amount of info regarding the specifics of c7. if you
 haven't, call microsoft and i'm sure they'd be happy to send you some!
