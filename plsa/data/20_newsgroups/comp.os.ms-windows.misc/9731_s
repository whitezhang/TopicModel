 one difference will _probably_ be the same difference as between os2 and
 windows 3.x now--one will likely have a lot of software available for
 it and one won't (emulation, with the inevitable incompatibilities that
 crop up in spite of all the contrary claims, just doesn't count when you
 _have_ to use a certain software package that doesn't quite run properly
 under the emulation...). developers want to channel their resources toward
 a platform that has a large installed base, and in a case like that the
 platform that is most successfully _marketed_ (regardless of its relative
 sophistication) will win.
