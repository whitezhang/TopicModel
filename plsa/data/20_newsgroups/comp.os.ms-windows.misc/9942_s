 i was at the trenton computer fest and there were many sources of
 ink refills for the hp and canon, so if you don't like the ink you're using,
 you have a choice.  there is a frequently asked question (faq) list
 that's reposted occasionally that reports how to refill the cartridges
 yourself with inks that are available from the stationery store
 instead of a "specialty" ink with the specialty price.
 
 i'm not sure, but i think i found another legal source of cheap
 hypos for injecting ink into the cartridges.
 more on that when my mail order succeeds.
