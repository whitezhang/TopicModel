 
 i have uploaded the most recent windows drivers for the cirrus gd5426 
 chip based display cards to the uploads directory at ftp.cica.indiana.edu
  (file is 5426dr13.zip). they're very recent, i downloaded them from the 
 cirrus bbs (570-226-2365) last night. if you are unable to get them there, 
 email me and maybe i can upload them to some other sites as well.  
 i have a local bus based card (vl24 bitblaster from micron) but i think 
 the drivers work with isa cards (or at least includes drivers for them).
 
 i found the new drivers to be a significant improvement over the 1.2 version, 
 improving my graphic winmarks (v3.11) by about 2 million (7.77 to 9.88) 
 although this could be the result of intentional benchmark cheating on 
 cirrus's part but i don't think so.
 
 from steve gibson's (columnist for info world) graphic card comparisons 
 (also found at the cica ftp site under the name winadv.zip) i extracted the 
 following for the sake of comparison:
 
 							wintach
              		winbn3.11	word	sprsht	cad	paint	overall
 steve's system:
 486/33 vlb:
 ati graphics ultra pro	  9.33		10.34	 20.78	8.28	14.90	 13.58
 
 my system -
 486sx/33 vlb:
 vl24 bitblaster		  9.88		 8.65	 11.71	18.84	15.40	 13.65
 
 
 its no viper, but i think its a hell of a deal at about a third of the cost of 
 the ati card and when compared to the other cards included in gibson's review.
 
 micron system owner's, i would be interested to hear your opinions on the 
 dtc 2270vl local bus disk controller. my system came with a maxtor 7120 
 drive (120 mb) and at first was only giving me disk winmarks of about 16 kb/s, 
 i am now at 22 kb/s. is this about as good as it gets? i can't get a norton's
 sysinfo disk reading because the contoller intercepts the calls, at 
 least that was what the program said.
