 the may issue of pc/computing page 246 has a windows hint and tips for
 just this thing.  you have to edit the win.ini file and add a couple
 of lines.  i tried it and it works.  i actually made my title bar
 and iconized text, and icon text smaller.  on my monitor it works well.
 you can select a larger font also.  you edit the win.ini file with
 a font name in your system directory.  read the article because i would
 not want to retype it here in case i type errored and caused your
 system problems.
