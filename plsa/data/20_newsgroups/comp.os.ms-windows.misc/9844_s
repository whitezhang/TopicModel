 can somebody help me out there? i have just purchased win 3.1 and i just
 can't get dos apps (text mode apps) to run in a window on their own. i've
 tried mucking around with the pif settings etc, but to no avail. what am
 i doing wrong? (i didn't get this problem under v3.0).
 
 thanks in advance ...
 
 jason.
