 hi, i am using a dtk 386-20mhz 13meg memory to run a variety of
 programs, and have had problems off and on with lock up,
 but now i am trying to run an application that wants a lot of memory
 over a period of time (playmation 24 bit rendered) and it is 
 locking up everytime.  i have an ati ultra + w/2meg which i have
 tried in each of the video modes, i have excluded the region of
 video memory from a000-c800 segments from the use of emm386,
 have tried adjusting the swap partion from large to nonexistant (to
 prevent swapping) and i have rem'd all tsr's and utilities in config.syus
 and autoexec, and even tried using the default program manager, disabling
 my hp dashboard.  even with a minimal system, no swap, no smartdrv,
 no tsr's, no windows utilities and exclusion of video regions it still
 locks up completely (no mouse control, no response to anything except
 3finger salute, and even that does not stop by the standard windows
 screen, but simply does a full reset immediately).  just about out
 of ideas, anyone out there have any????  thanks
