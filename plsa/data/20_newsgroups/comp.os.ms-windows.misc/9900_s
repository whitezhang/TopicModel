 is anyone out there running a ms-dos system with a localtalk board? i am on an
 appletalk network, hooked up with a daystar digital lt200 mc localtalk
 interface board, running on a ps/2 model 70. i'm using the appleshare pc
 software for file server and network access. it works fine under dos or the
 window or os/2 dos box. but when i try to load it *before* windows, so that
 every application i run could get access to it, the machine crashes hard as
 soon as i start up an application. and of course, things look pretty hopeless
 for os/2 (but who knows). 
 
 so, does anyone have experience with this bizarre and obsolete setup?
