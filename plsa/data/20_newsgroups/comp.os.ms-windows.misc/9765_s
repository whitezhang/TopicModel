 it sounds like something/one may have set the 1000's separator to "." in
 contol panel (under international).  this makes 23,482 look like 23.482
 and file manager is chopping off what it thinks is the decimal part of
 the file size. 3,356,345 becomes 3.356.345, and again, file manager is
 confused by the decimal points where there should be commas, chopping
 off everything to the right of the first period.
