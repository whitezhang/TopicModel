 help!
 i am working on a project that involves using text with foreign language
 characters (in this case norwegian). i have been manipulating the data
 with excell 4.0 and then exporting the data as comma seperated variable
 files to an rs6000 workstation.  the norwegian characters show up fine
 under windows, but appear as "funny" characters on the workstation.  the
 workstation is setup for national language support and we have problem
 entering the norwegian characters from the workstation keyboard. 
 on further investigation i found that the character codes used by
 windows are different (for these characters) than those specified by the
 msdos code page.  the msdos codes seem to be the same as the
 workstation.  what gives, and how can get around it.
 please reply by e-mail as i will be out of the office the next few days
 and will not be reading the news.
 thanks.
