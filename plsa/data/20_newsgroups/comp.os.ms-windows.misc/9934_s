 i really appreciate this information.  however, given that i don't have
 direct internet access - which means i don't have archie access - i must
 resort to using ftpmail.  this means that i need the site name and the 
 directory where these workspace managers are located.
 
 so, can you (or anyone else) post or email me the needed information?
 
 thanks very much!!!
