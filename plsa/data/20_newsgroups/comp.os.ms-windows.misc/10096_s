 it's interesting to see how the greatest vapour-project of the world
 has not been able to make much of a difference here :-)
 
 before you think it's a interesting rag, they have this incredibly
 incompetent article/opinion piece by someone named robert ziff which
 has preposturous statements like "sun has sold around 300
 multiprocessing servers"!!!!!!  (in that case usc has around 4% of all
 sun mp servers on earth :-)) he is off by a factor of 50? 100?  
 i thought of sending them a "factual disaster" email message; they have
 a column titled "how to contact us" but being silly pcheads they seem
 to have never heard of the internet.
