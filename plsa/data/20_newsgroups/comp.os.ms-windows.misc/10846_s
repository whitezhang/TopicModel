 using the software you're using, i agree with you there.  what i did:
 i installed dos, windows and cpbackup (functionally the same
 as your norton, for the purposes of this discussion), and used the 
 dos "backup" command on just that much.  to restore, i boot to the 
 "system" diskette, and use dos "restore" to read in that much, then
 boot to windows and restore my full backups using cpb (norton, in your
 case), overwriting what i've just restored.  that allows me to keep
 this skeletal windows essentially unchanged, with all my customization
 on the "real" copy done using the 3rd-party backup utility.

 seems possible, if you can put skeletal versions of dos and your backup
 utility on a "system" floppy.  then you could restore it all on one "go".
