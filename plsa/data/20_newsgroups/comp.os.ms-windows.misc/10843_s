 i'm waiting for june first to roll around when i can then get my 
 hands on pc-solaris...unix for the intel chip!  i know that there
 are many of other unix possibilities out there, but this includes
 the wabi (windows api binary interface...i think) technology that wil
 run windows apps straight outta da box.  if this flies in enhanced mode,
 then here's another contender to look out for in the corporate/education
 market.
 
 too big and complex for the home front...windows 4/mac sys7 will take those
 while win4wkgrps - nt - os/2 will fight it out for the small-to-mid businesses.
 
 however, once the powerpc becomes available (especially in laptop/notebook form)
 then these will migrate into all markets....the ability to connect up to a unix
 machine at work and yet still run windows/mac apps at home is going to be real
 attractive to alot of people!!!
 
 just my predictions.
 
 mike
