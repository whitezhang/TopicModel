 the sensitivity is changed using the /s, /v, or /h parameter.  
 the commands do the following:
 /v - vertical sensitivity
 /h - horizontal sensitivity
 /s - both 
 
 follow the parameter with a number from 1 to 100 (1 - slowest, 100-fastest).
 the default is 50.  you can type the command "mouse /s75" right from the
 keyboard or add it to autoexec.bat.
 
 hope this helps.
