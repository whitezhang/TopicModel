 lots of drivers are available off ftp.cica.indiana.edu in pub/pc/win3/
 drivers/video. i've tried two: et4cview.zip and et4turbo.zip. these
 give you a choice of turbo and non-turbo drivers. the turbo drivers
 were fast but caused mouse problems with my machine (which has a
 diamond speedstar card). i finally got turbo drivers (wndspeed by
 binar) from diamond. amazing. blazingly fast (for a non-accelerated
 card) and best of all - no gpf's for a month or so...
