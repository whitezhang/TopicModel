 well, in the latest windows magazine, there is an advertisement for a program
 that will help you uninstall windows apps from your harddisk (uninstaller)
 but it can be used to update a network, but only for deleting, not adding
 or changing their *.ini files.  (uninstaller, by microhelp inc.  $79
 1-800-922-3383)
 
 i am also looking for an *.ini updater for my pc network, and so far without
 any luck.  so for the time being i have been pushing dos and it's batch
 language to its limit...look into dos 5.0's (i am assumming that dos 6.0
 has the same command, maybe even more..or less..improved) replace command.
 i use this to update our users personal files with a master set in a batch
 file that is run everytime they invoke windows.  this basically overwrites
 their color schemes, but does what i need it to do.  not neat, but does
 the job...i'm looking for a better solution though.

 just relaying what i know...a not for profit service.
