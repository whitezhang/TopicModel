 hi,
 	we've been having problems on a few setups when printing to a
 serial printer (dmp or laser). i have used works and windows write. the
 output is ok from dos and if i send plain text output, but anything
 fancy garbles or just doesn't output. the exception is outputting to a
 lserjet 4 which 'appears' to be fast enough receiving data, not to
 bother about handshaking messages. i'm sure i'm not alone in this. i've
 tried most of the print/network manager options i can think of. anyone
 had similar problems they've cured and would like to tell me 'bout it??
 thanks
