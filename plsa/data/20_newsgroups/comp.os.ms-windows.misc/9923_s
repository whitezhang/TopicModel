 somewhere (ftp.cica.indiana.edu or simtel20 mirror) there is a program  
 called winlogo.zip that does the trick. it works great. i believe the  
 reason why you can't change the files you mentioned is that the logo is  
 actually imbeded into the windows executable (somebody please  
 correct/expand on this)
