 hmm...has anyone of us computer geeks (me included) ever consider
 that inovation is not limited to software/hardware.  true, ms
 products do not boast features that ms invented, but how many products
 out there by other vendors out there are truely innovative in
 their continuing development? 
 
 i think what makes ms special to the public is thier innovative pricing.
 it is true the xwindows/mac/next all have some feature(s) in thier gui
 that are better than ms.  but people like me can't afford them.
 it is true that apple has lower their pricing on the low end models..
 but they are just that...low end.  system 7 is a better operating
 system, but the machines they operate on just are too expensive for
 my tastes...a unix platform is powerful enuf, but tell the common
 user to set up .xdefault (i am still confused on what some of them things 
 do) and they either puke or faint.  
 
 if u think about it, low prices aint innovative if u come down to it.  but
 for the product it offers and on the lower cost (and powerful hardware
 that it runs on as compare to macs)....ms is kinda innovative..
 
 oh yea, i guess the fact that the support products and applications
 they have garnered for mswindows does make them kinda innovative too..
