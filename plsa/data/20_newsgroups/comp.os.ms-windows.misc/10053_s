 here is another hint:
 
 	i have a really jumping mouse (ps2 type), and finally the mouse
 stops jump changing himem.sys (yes, himem!), is you use:
 
 device=himem.sys /m:x
 
 x can be 1,2,...,8 (of course my computer don't appear on the list for
 these parameter)
 
  and maybe, your mouse can stop jump... (but your problem looks more
 like a dirty mouse ;)...
 
 	hope it help (to anybody!)
