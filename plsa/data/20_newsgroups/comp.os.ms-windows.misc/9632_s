 	hmmm, let's see: i could upload some .bmp files (i have around 15
 b/w and color ones), but i'd rather give you the fishing pole instead of the
 fish:here it goes:  
       begginers guide to the coolest windows backgrounds:
 step 1: ftp to cica (ftp.cica.indiana.edu user:anonymous passwd: guest)
 cd to pub/pc/win3/(util?desktop?) and get one of these : wingif14.zip,
 pspro??.zip gws?????.zip . they will scale, dither and convert gifs to bmps.
 get the index file from the win3 subdir too for future reference...
 step 2: ftp to wuarchive.wustl.edu or plaza.aarnet.edu.au or archive.orst.edu
 and cd to graphics/gif get the index file... now gigabytes of pictures
 are waiting to become your desktop... 
 advice: if you have a slow computer (<486dx w/4mb ram), make your bg b/w
 by selecting b/w dither in any of the abovementioned apps..
 hope it helps...
