 to windows 3.0, yes.

 it's definitely dated - i used os/2 1.21, & alpha 2.0 (when msft was
 developing it...)

 i preferred windows 3.1 because it was more stable & faster than 3.0,
 but could still run more apps than os/2 (again i made this choice
 before 2.0 was released).

 no, i've seen no such data.

 hmm. are you sure?  i'm speaking from my own experience as an
 os/2 _user_. certainly people in, say, the nt marketing group 
 would be in a unique position to present the results of, say,
 research on upcoming nt and os/2 apps (vs windows and ms-dos apps).
 part of my point was that just cause one works at microsoft does 
 not mean one has access to such data (if it exists).

 i will confess to, at times, attacking the poster.

 again, my point was that not all microsofties are here to "sell" 
 readers on our products (which would conflict with the "no-ads" 
 philosophy of usenet).  nor do we necessarily have access to info
 that others have.
 
 i also get tired of people assuming that microsofties are, like,
 members of the borg.
