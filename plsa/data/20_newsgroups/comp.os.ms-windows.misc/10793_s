 i really think you are comparing apples and oranges. nobody disputes
 that os/2 has more big os features. the question is does an 
 individual need the power. the sales of windows vs os/2 answer that
 question. the next question is even if i did want to run os/2
 and i had this big monster machine to run it on, is there a diverse
 set of applications to run on it that allow me to productviely do my
 work. go to your local computer store to answer this one.
 i think the comparison you need to be doing is nt vs os2/2.1. this
 is where the new battle lines will be drawn. windows 3.1 has won
 the single user pc war the next one will be the client server
 war and the entries are nt, os2/2.1, unix and netware 4.0.
 granted these os's will be eventually scaled down to be
 attractive to the single user pc and that will probably be phase ii'
 of the war. who wins only the marketplace will tell but it sure 
 is fun watching and arguing about it tho.
