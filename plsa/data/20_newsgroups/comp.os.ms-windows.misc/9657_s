 
 hi,
 
 i have a 486/66mhz sys based pc with 8m ram and a problem.
 
 what is the best way to configure high memory with qemm/386max ??
 i have a speedstar 24x video card and use hyperdisk disk cache
 software. the problem is running windows 3.1 in enhanced mode and
 having any high memory to load stuff high?
 
 note :
 i tried, as recommended to exclude the region a000-c7ff but windows
 insists on starting in standard mode.
 
 any suggestions?
 
 dan
