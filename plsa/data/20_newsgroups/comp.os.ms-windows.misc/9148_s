 nathan,
   win31 has a fixed limit of 64k gdi memory, regardless of physical ram
 installed, this is twice that of win30, but not nearly robust enough for
 many developers and power users.
  
 using amish launch as your shell, you can reduce gdi memory usage by as
 much as 15% over progman, ndw 2, dashboard, and other graphical type icon
 based and other shells.  also, nesting, and full hot-key global support
 is offered, something no other shells have at this time.
