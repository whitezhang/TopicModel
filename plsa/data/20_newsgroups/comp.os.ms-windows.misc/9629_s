 if you are interested in a program which is very easy to use, i strongly 
 suggest approach 2.0.  it is extremely easy to use, make reports, etc.  i
 own both it and paradox, and i almost never use paradox.  if you need to 
 build up a complicated application, then paradox is the way to go.  i have
 heard horror stories about the access programming being extremely cryptic.
 since you seem like you will probably be doing fairly small stuff (work/
 home use and you have not used a database before), i recommend approach.  i 
 have found only one small thing which i would like it to do more easily:
 i have one database where the order in which the records are entered must 
 be different than what is the logical ordering.  to permanently reorder (to 
 use the old dbase iii command) the records requires sorting the records 
 appropriately (no problem, since i almost always use them in this order)
 exporting the database to another database (which can still be an approach 
 database), and then copying the exported files back to the original 
 filename.  this is a small weakness, considering the other items i really 
 like about approach.  it is also a little slower than paradox (other than 
 the loading, paradox takes forever and a minute to load).  paradox also 
 takes a lot of memory (both hard disk (around 12mb) and ram).
