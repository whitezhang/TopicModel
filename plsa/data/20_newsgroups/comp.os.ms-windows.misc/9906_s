 word for windows lets me designate text as being in a language other
 than us english.  (alt-f l, format | language, as i recall.)  so i mark
 it for english (uk), but it still accepts "rumor" and squawks at
 "rumour".  as far as i can see, microsoft didn't include the english
 (uk) dictionary on my disks.  (i don't mean to imply that i was singled
 out; i assume that nobody in the u.s got them.)  i dialed the microsoft
 bbs, but nothing in the word for windows section looked helpful.
 
 can anyone tell me where or how to obtain the uk spelling dictionary for
 winword 2.0?  the file name would be spell_uk.lex or something similar.
 
 email please; i'll post a summary.

 english is my native language and i love it.  but don't try to tell me
 that it's easy to learn or that it makes sense.  if it were, "baseline"
 would rhyme with "vaseline".
