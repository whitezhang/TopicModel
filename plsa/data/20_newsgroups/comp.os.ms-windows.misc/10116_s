 
 a friend and i have ati graphic ultra display adaptors, and they have
 been reasonably good performers, but we both have had irritating compatibility
 problems with the ati drivers and are ready to change to something faster
 and more compatible with windows. i have heard rumblings that the new orchid
 9000 card is very fast. anyone have experience with this card? what is
 currently available that is fast, compatible, does 1280x1024x256 non-
 interlaced and cost under $500?
