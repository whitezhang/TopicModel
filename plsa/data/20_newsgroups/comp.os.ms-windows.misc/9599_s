 i have (had) several problems with the card.
 - applications crashed when moving the mouse (vga mode). fixed by removing
   the line stacks=0,0 from config.sys. the default value stacks=9,256
   does just fine.
 - random white pixels all over the screen when moving the mouse, in a
   256 color graphical mode (the hardware cursor modes). fixed by turning
   off the hardware scroll ("24xmode scrolloff") before entering the graphics
   mode. this also fixed the problem of the windowed dos boxes under windows.
   with the hardware scroll enabled, applications write garbage outside the
   window.
 - the screensavers do not remove the cursor in 256 color modes (hardware
   cursor). i don't know if this is a windows problem or a driver problem.
   clearly there should be two types of cursor removing functions: a remove-
   for-draw, which can be ignored for hardware cursors and a remove-
   unconditionally. do other cards with hardware cursors have the same problem?
 - the vesa driver does not support the 640x480x16m truecolor mode. (universal
   vesa drivers do not run at all).
