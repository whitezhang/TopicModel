 you're right.
 
 you cannot read or write a mac or apple ii 800k 3.5" disk or apple ii
 5.25" disk without extra hardware. however, mac 1.44mb disks can be read
 and written in a pc 3.5" hd drive with software only. 
 
 this should probably be added to every pc and mac faq file. it sure gets
 asked enough.
