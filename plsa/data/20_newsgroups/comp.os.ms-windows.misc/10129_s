 i have the text on the non-un*x x11 servers, so i do know that there are
 x11 servers available for use with mswindows 3.1.  my question is, does
 anybody have any relevant information on the usability of these servers?
 has anyone tried to use them on a token ring network and gotten them to
 work?
