 i am having a really bothersome problem using the msdos prompt in windows 3.1
 to open a dos box.  when i am done with the dos box, i cant get back to windows.
 if i do alt enter to shrink the box or use 'exit' to close it, the screen goes
 black and i have to control-alt-delete until i kill windows.  i get a couple
 of screens about app not responding.
 
 i think things are still alive under the black screen because if i alt-tab
 to cycle through the running apps, i get flashes of text but then the
 black returns.
 
 this persists even if the machine is powered on and off.
 
 i am working with an app developed using borland's 3.1 application frameworks
 and c++.  it seems to work fine.
 
 hardware is a 486 with 16meg ram; not on a network.  video is a tseng 
 vga.  dos 5.0.
 
 i reinstalled windows a couple of time but the problem comes back.  i am
 using temporary swapping for virtual memory.
 
 i would really really appreciate any hints anyone might offer.
 
 thanks,
 
 jim cant
