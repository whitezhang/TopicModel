 sorry about confusing subject/summary/keywords!!!
 
 i am a postgrad researcher in esl/applied linguistics at edith cowan
 university in perth western australia...
 
 i desperately need help!!! i need to record the results of word
 processing sessions in windows - so that i can sit down and replay the
 results of my research subjects' wordprocessing behaviours -
 naturally, i can do this with the windows macrorecorder - and 2 or 3
 other apps in windows - but i cannot pause/resume!!!! - i.e. all i can
 do is to ctrl/break to get out - this is useless for a researcher who
 needs to be able to pause the wordprocessing session he is replaying
 to make notes/annotations - and then resume from where he left off...
 
 i am just about to commence my research for my masters thesis and
 would be extremely grateful for any assistance - if anyone can help
 could they mail me at:
 
 johnoliver@odin.dialix.oz.au
 
 many thanks in advance...
