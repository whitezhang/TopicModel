 it will certainly *help* to be able to run windows and dos apps but
 the only way that solaris or os/2 or any other scheme is going to 
 challenge microsoft is if they can somehow get the prices for solaris
 or os/2 or whatever apps, down to a dos competitive level.  everybody
 would rather run a solaris app on a solaris system and an os/2 app on
 an os/2 system, they usually just can't afford a unix system because
 of the high prices for good unix software.
