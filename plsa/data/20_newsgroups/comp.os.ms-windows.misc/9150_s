      don't bother if you have cpbackup or fastback.  they all offer options 
 not available in the stripped-down ms version (from cps!).  examples - no 
 proprietary format (to save space), probably no direct dma access, and no 
 tape drive!
 
      you need ms defrag if you use doublespace to work on the compressed 
 volume.
