 i have written the file manager hfm, wich has two windows which compare
 the files in two directorys to find out wether there are equal or 
 similar files. the 7 most important operations, copy, move, delete,
 show the file, start a progam, navigate in the directory tree can be
 invoked by dragging a directory entry with the mouse. this is very
 convenient, because the selection of the file and the operation to
 be performed, occur in one move. for bitmap graphic viewing the
 program vpic can be integrated, for spreadsheat and database files
 i use the view program from pctools 7.1. hfm can be configured to
 use arbitrary viewers to show special data formats. it does
 also present archives from pkzip etc. as simulated subdirectorys.
 this filemanager has a somewhat non standart user interface, but
 it is very convienient to use and is the prefered file manager 
 in several labs in our university. 
 the drawback of this filemanager is, it's still a dos program and
 the development of a windows version has not yet begun. i use the
 program package run18.zip, where run tells its windows companion
 sched.exe which windows program should be started. in this way you
 can start a windows program from a dosbox. the new version 3.19
 (to be released soon) includes a new command for automating this
 windows program start.

 mirror sites)
