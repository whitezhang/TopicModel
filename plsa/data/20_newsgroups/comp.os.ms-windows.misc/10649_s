 for the most part, this newsgroup is "attack" oriented.  microsoft has been
 attacked on anything ranging from the quality of our products, the
 intelligence of our people, the integrity of our business, etc.  anyone
 would get defensive when being baselessly attacked.  we are human beings as
 well.  you should expect a response when a claim that an employee might
 feel is unwarranted is leveled.
