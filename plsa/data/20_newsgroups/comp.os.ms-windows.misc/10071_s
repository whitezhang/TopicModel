 hi, folks,
 
 i have a question:
 
         how can i generate a pcx file using word for windows (2.0) ?
 
 i know i can select a postscript printer driver to get a ps file, but how
 can i generate a pcx file ? is there a printer capture utility for windows
 that ever exists ? or a utility to transfer ps format to pcx format, or
 tiff format?
 
 please reply by e-mail, i will give a summary. thanks.
