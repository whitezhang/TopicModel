 i just purchased the norton desktop for windows, and i also have
 norton utilities.  when i installed ndw, it wanted to rem out the line
 that installed ep (ep /on) and the command to invoke the image utility.
 it replaced the image command with a new image command that invokes the
 version of image that came with ndw.  this makes sense, as presumably the
 image version with ndw is newer than the one with nu.  it did not, however,
 install smartcan in the autoexec.  now two questions:
    1:  will nu use the image data saved by the newer version of image invoked.
        i.e. are the two version of image compatable?
    2:  will erase protect use the info from smartcan, and vice versa?
        i use both dos and windows, and i want to make sure that when i
        erase files in either environment, they are going to be protected.
 
 from the experiments i have run, the two programs (erase protect and
 smart erase) don't use each others info.
 i currently have both ep and smartcan loading within my autoexec, and
 i don't see any conflicts;
 
 fyi :  norton desktop for windows version 2.2
        norton util's version 6
 
 thanks for any help.
