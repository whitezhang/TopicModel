 for logitech rodents use  the lmouse driver that comes with windows....
 also you need to be using a video driver that supports use of the mouse,
 both the vga and supervga that come with windows 3.1 will support it. 
 both of these are 16 color drivers, if you're lucky the manufacturer of
 your video card might have a driver that is compatable and will support a
 mouse.
