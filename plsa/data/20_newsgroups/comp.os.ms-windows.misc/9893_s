 ok, i have a 486dx50(isa) w/ diamond stealth vram 1mb.
 i was really satisfied w/ its performance in windows.
 but now more and more games needs higher frame rates in dos' vga,
 especially this new strike commander. ;-)
 this stealth vram can only give me 17.5 fps. ;-( (i use 3dbench).
 my winmark was 6.35 million, i think.
 
 so right now i'm considering to replace it w/ a new card, which hopefully
 can perform approx same w/ my current vram in windows and also
 can perform dos' vga preferably >30fps.
 
 i also saw the 3dbench benchmark list from someone who compiled it
 in csipg and it looked that speedstar 24x and orchid prodesigner 2d-s
 ware the fastest for non local bus motherboard.
 both can give >30fps in dos' vga w/ 486dx2/66.
 does anyone have a winmarks for both of those cards above with the processor
 type ? which one is the worthiest(not necessarily fastest)?
 any other card recommendation is welcomed too.
 
 also, if possible, where can i get 'this' card for the cheapest? ;-)
 
 thanks in advance, folks!
