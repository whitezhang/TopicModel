 	i don't think the question is:
 		"will os/2 x.x run windows y.y apps now?"
 
 	a more important question is:
 		"will subsequent os/2 versions continue to run apps
 		from subsequent windows versions in the future?"
 
 	can it keep up?  will a future os/2 3.0 run windows 4 apps?
 	ole2 is very complex and is the sign of things to come.
 	after this fall, i believe ibm no longer has any rights to
 	view microsoft code.  after that, the only way to maintain
 	some sort of compatibility is to reverse-engineer.  would
 	you want to reverse-engineer an ole2 application?
