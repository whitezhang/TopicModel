 
 has anyone had any experience with a replacement comm driver for windows
 called turbocomm.  i read about it in pcmag apr 23 1993 and am interested
 but not willing to shell out the 45 bucks the company wants just to try it
 out.  it supposedly eleminates the problems that occur during a high speed
 file transfer and a disk access made by another program running at the same
 time.  if anyone has any pro/cons about this product, i would be very inter
 ested to hear them.  please email at the address give below.  thanks.
