      i am using wfw 2.0c with a canon bj10e. the printer driver is that 
 which comes with windows 3.1. unfortatunately, i am having a problem with 
 printing page numbers on the bottom of the page. i can print page number 
 on the top of the page, but not on the bottom. has anybody had a similar 
 problem and/or does anybody have a solution for such a problem.
