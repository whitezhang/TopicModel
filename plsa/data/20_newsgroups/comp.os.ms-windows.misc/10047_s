 
    anyone know of a good software package that will allow us to keep track of
 who is printing what and when?  is there any way to get print manager to keep
 a log?  is there a print manager replacement that will do this?  how about a
 package that will only allow access to the system for people in a password 
 file?  i looked at chastity, but it will let you log in without a password,
 and doesn't keep tabs of who got on and when.  
    any help will be greatly appreciated.
