 on all 1.44mb drives (both mac and pc), the disk spins at a constant
 rpm.  on 800k mac disk drives, the spin rate of the disk is varied so 
 that the tracks pass under the head at a constant speed; a slower rotation
 for the outer tracks, and a faster rotation for the inner tracks.  a pc
 needs special controller hardware to make this happen.
