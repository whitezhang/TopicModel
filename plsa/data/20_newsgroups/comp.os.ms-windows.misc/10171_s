 i have a very funny yet confusing problem.  i am using telemate within
 win 3.1.  everytime i close dos box, my telemate operation get affected
 (normally i am doing file transfer).  however, if i open + close windows
 program everything seems running smoothly.  my file transfer operation
 get affected only if i close dos box.
 
 can somebody please gimme some pointers on what is going on and how to
 fix it??
 
 thanks in advance
