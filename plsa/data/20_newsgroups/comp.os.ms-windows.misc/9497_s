 it also runs os/2 character based apps and posix apps.  the dos, 16bit
 and 32 bit windows apps run in a windows 32 bit subsystem.
 
 if you consider the fact that nt has:
  the lanman redirectors,
  built in support for tcp/ip
  built in support for netbeui
  comes with tcp utils like ping and an ftp client, etc
  applications like schedule+ and a 32 bit version of msmail
 
 the storage argument isnt an issue.

 i ran it on a 486 with 8mram and it did a ton of disk swapping, with a 19m
 virtual memory paging file.  it functioned but it crawled.  (this was the oct
 build)
 
 i upgraded the machine to 16m and the performance is good,
 at that point i installed the march build.  consider they
 are probably still working on the feature set, and havent done a lot of fine
 tuning to the code yet.

 i have little info on chicago so i cant make a comparison.  is it in beta?  is
 there anyone out there who has tested both and cares to make a comparison?
 just my $0.02
