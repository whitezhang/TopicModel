 i've been using ms access (still available from some stores for $99.00)
 and i am quite pleased with it.  it's relatively easy to learn, very easy
 to use and somewhat easy to program.  i highly recomend it, particularly
 at $99.00!  i have not used paradox for windows, but i don't expect it to
 be $30.00 better than access (imho).
