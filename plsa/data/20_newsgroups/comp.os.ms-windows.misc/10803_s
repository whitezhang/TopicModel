 states that the user must separately acquire the microsoft windows
 software development kit (sdk), which contains the windows tools
 to build the drivers. if we are using borland c++ with application
 frameworks, is this necessary? we also have a copy of the microsoft
 press programmer's reference library (books) which normally comes
 with the sdk, and microsoft macro assembler 6.0. why is the sdk
 neccessary for development of virtual device drivers?
