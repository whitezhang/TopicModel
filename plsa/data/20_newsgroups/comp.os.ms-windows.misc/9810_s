    -----or, if you need to use a service bureau and they're only set up to use
    type 1 fonts. from what i've heard (pure hearsay) the results of outputting
    tt fonts as type 1 is _not_ as good as using high-quality type 1 fonts in
    the first place.
 
 unless you `print' to file with the correct resolution set for the
 final output device (image setter).  a problem with tt fonts in windows
 is that they do get converted to t1 format ok, and the hinting is even used
 while this is done, but the resulting t1 fonts are not hinted.  the result
 is that they will work fine on a device of the resolution assumed by the
 printer driver when the ps file is generated, but they will not look
 good when printed at a different resolution.  
 
 so when you print to an attached ps printer, with the ps driver set up for
 this printer results, may be quite good.  but if you take a ps file made for
 that printer and run it on a device of different resolution (such as an
 image setter), then the results may not be so good.
