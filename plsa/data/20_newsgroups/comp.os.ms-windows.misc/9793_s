 i posted a similar query and got these replies which i am testing (so far so
 good)..
 
 * turn hardware scrolling off before going into windows (24xmode scrolloff)
 
 * in the pif file for dos window, set "emulate text mode"
 
 * get the latest drivers from the diamond bbs (or cica): dates are 1-20-9.
