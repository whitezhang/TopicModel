 hi
      i have never used mym so i can not help you with the comparison of the
 two products.  i am, however,  a devoted quicken user, and i can tell you
 how to set up the weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly transactions.  first
 use the memorize feature (ctrl-m) to record the recurring transactions. 
 next, define a transaction group which uses these memorized transactions
 and specify the frequency that it should be used (i.e. monthly).  quicken
 will/can not automatically make the transactions for you, but now all you
 do is recall the group and all of the individual transactions will be
 entered at once.  additionally if you are using the bill minder, it will
 remind you when each transaction group is due.  for example, you could have
 three transaction groups.  one for payments at the beginning of the month,
 middle of the month, and one for quarterly payments.  i hope this helps.
