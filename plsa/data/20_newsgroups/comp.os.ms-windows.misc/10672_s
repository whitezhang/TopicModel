 hello all!
 
     it is my understanding that all true-type fonts in windows are loaded in
 prior to starting windows - this makes getting into windows quite slow if you
 have hundreds of them as i do.  first off, am i correct in this thinking -
 secondly, if that is the case - can you get windows to ignore them on boot and
 maybe make something like a pif file to load them only when you enter the
 applications that need fonts?  any ideas?
