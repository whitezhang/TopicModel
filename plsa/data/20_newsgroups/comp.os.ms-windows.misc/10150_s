 here's the situation:
 
 at home, i have ms word for windows but no printer.  at work, i
 have windows + a postscript printer, but not ms word.  so, i
 configure my machine at home to use a postscript printer, and use
 the print to file option, which produces a nice postscript file,
 which i then bring to work.
 
 my question:  how do i print this postscript file through the print
 manager at work? if, for example, i select print from the file
 manager, it treats the postscript as a text file, and gives me
 several pages of postscript gibberish.
 
 i know that i can open a dos window and do:
 
 	 copy file.ps com1:
 
 which does work, but seems not to multitask very well -- other applications
 run rather slowly and often pause for 10's of seconds.
 
 there ought to be a way of passing the postscript file to the print
 manager, but if there is, i can't find any mention of it in the
 documentation.
 
 anyone know how to do this?
