 we have heard many bad things about the ati ultra plus card (mainly having
 to do with its buggy windows drivers).
 
 i would like to replace by ati graphics ultra with a true-colour accelerated
 card. i was about to buy the ati ultra plus (eisa) but it has had so much
 bad press that i am reconsidering.
 
 
 i would like an accelerated card
              a card that does 24bit true colour at 800x600 at least
              a card that does 1024x758 at 256 colours (or more)
              a card that has fast polygon fills
              a card that has fast bit blits
              a card that has a robust windows driver
              a card that has high speed non-interlaced refresh
 
 any suggestions?
 
 my app requires lots of 3d poly grahics and complexing true colour
 imaging.  i would sure like a faster solution that what i have now.
 
 thanks,
