 the higher memory limits apply to isa cards only, as far as i know.  the vlb
 and eisa version should have no problems.

 again, the memory aperture need only be disabled if you have more than 124m ram
 (eisa and vlb) or 12 m (isa).  32m should not be a problem for you.

 nope.  i can use 640x480 at 72hz, 24-bit and 800x600 at 70hz, 24-bit, all
 non-interlaced.

 they aren't perfect, but are much improved.  i don't recall the last time which
 i had to leave mach 32 mode (ati gup mode) and switch to 8514 or vga mode due
 to software incompatibility.

 it's quite fast, but whether or not its the fastest is open to debate.
