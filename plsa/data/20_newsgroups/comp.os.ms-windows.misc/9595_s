 hi there,
 
 with a 16megs of ram, is there a need to run/load smartdrv for
 windows 3.1?  if yes, can i run/load ramdrive without smartdrv?
 if i need both ramdrive & smartdrv, is the following config.sys
 settings ok:  ...smartdrv.sys 2048 2048
               ...ramdrive.sys 2048 /e
 
 thanks in advance for e-mail reply.
