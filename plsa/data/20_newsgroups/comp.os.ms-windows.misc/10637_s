 one can only remap special-command keys in procomm it seems. i
 would like to remap other keys too - especially "altgr 2", and
 such combinations.
 
 anybody know a plain or dirty way to do this?? (of cause most
 people settle for remapping function keys, but i don't see
 why there should be a limitation...)
