  i thought i'd reply to this, though i ain't brad.  at any case, a lot
 of picture-file viewers that will convert, say, between .gif,etc, to
 .bmp *will* convert to .rle.  i know for a fact that paintshop
 (shareware from cica; /desktop, i think, filename psvvv.zip (i think,
 where vvv is the ver. number.  if that's not true, let me know and i"ll
 post a corection).
 
 
 this, however, will write your .rle file with a .bmp extension, so you
 have to rename it.
 
 now, another thing....
 this is from the windows' faq:
 
 your file has to be less than 64 k
 ( at least that's what the faq says, but mine wont work for more than
 about 30...maybe they mend 32k, i don't know).
 
 your file has to fit vga size (480 * 860, or whatever standard vga size
 is.)  if you use a non-vga screen (e.g. cga, ega, svga, there is also a
 way to do it, but i thing instead of vgalogo.lgo you use another file,
 such as cgalogo.lgo, egalogo.lgo, or something.  i'm not sure about
 this, as i have a vga, but i'm sure you could find it in the faq (a
 windows help ver. of which *is* available at cica, but don't konw the
 filename). 
 
 also....your .bmp has to be 16 colours or less.
 
 these specs rule out some of the good .bmp's.  i found cartoon drawings
 work quite well as they have the advantage of looking good with little
 memory.
 
 finally, remember to save your current win.com before, and put your
 new win.com in the windows directory.  also, don't start windows from a
 directory where another win.com is present, as *that* is used instead of
 the one in the windows dir, and win. won't start.
 
 
 share this fairly, but don't take a slice of my pie (pf).
