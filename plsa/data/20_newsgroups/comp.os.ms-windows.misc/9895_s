 stacker achieves better compression ratio than dos6, yet the
 latter comes with virus detection, memory manager, and multiple
 booting. each of them are not so good as the nav, qemm or ndos
 in my opinion, but with a package of only $45, it's nice if
 haven't yet installed all of those stuffs.
 
 both certainly work with win31.
