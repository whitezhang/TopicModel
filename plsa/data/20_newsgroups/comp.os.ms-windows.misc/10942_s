 i have the following problem on a dell 450se with the ati graphics ultra pro 
 eisa:
 
 when i start windows, the first 5 times i try to run an application, it does
 not start. windows will show the following error message:
 
    error executing application. there is not enough memory to run the    
    application.
 
 after the first 5 tries, the application i want to run will start, and 
 afterwards there are no more problems. when i change the video driver from 
 mach 32 to 8514/a, this problem does not occur, so i suspect the ati 
 drivers (i tried both the build 55 and build 59 driver).
 
 does anyone have a clue?
