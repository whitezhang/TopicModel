 in trying to use the equation editor in word for windows 2.0 i get
 a couple of error messages along the lines of:
 
 >can't find font mt extra for default printer. some characters my not be
 >displayed or printed.try installing equation editor again or reinstall a 
 >new printer.
 
 similar for the font fences.
 
 i know i have these fonts on my system but are unable to use them.
 i have tried both of these solutions to no avail.
 
 if anyone has had similar problems and has found a way to fix this, could 
 they let me know. it is urgently required !!
 
 thanks ,
