 but i don't want to have to run blasted windows every time i want to delete
 a tree - it is absolutely ludicrous to load a hog like that just to delete
 some files!  it would be like requiring a crane to change the tyre on a car.

 only because its crap, which is noones fault but their own.

 by deliberately crippling the product?  surely no...
 
 oh, hold on, i guess you're right.  that certainly stinks of microsoft
 marketing techniques.
 
 but the point still remains that a command to delete trees is not new
 technology, and is the kind of thing one would have expected to see long
 before windows was even dreamt of.

 well amen to that, but i wish it were a damn sight deader.  for a dead
 product, its used an awful lot.  and i suspect its going to carry on
 twitching for a long while yet, which isn't doing anyone any good.
 
 (and microsoft don't appear to have given up marketing dos, so it is a very
 unusual form of death indeed).
