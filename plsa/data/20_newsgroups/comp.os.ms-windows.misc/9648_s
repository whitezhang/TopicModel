 
 hey now.  first of all, sorry to post this dos question in a windows
 group, but i'm in kinda a hurry, so i can't scramble to find the dos
 groups' names.  
 
 anyway, anyone know where i ccan find the exit codes to dos commands?
 the manual doesn't seem to have all of them.  i'm particularly looking
 for copy, in order to make a "move" batch file, such that if the file
 wasn't coppied properly, it won't be deleted.
 
 
 please e'mail louray@seas.gwu.edu
 thanks, i.a,
 mickey
