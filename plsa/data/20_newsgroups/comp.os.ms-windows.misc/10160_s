 old mach8 chip).  i am quite pleased with the performance so far, but have
 one problem.  when using windows in 800x600, i have noticed that the 
 tile bars and scroll bars are significantly larger than they were when i
 was using the trident card.  is there a setting in my .ini files that i can
 change to make these smaller ?  i could not find the faq for this list...
