 for a vga card these are the correct files but you can't just copy them
 back and expect it to work.  you have to create a new win.com file.  try
 the command (you will have to worry about what directories each file is in
 since i don't know your setup):
 
 copy /b win.cnf+vgalogo.lgo+vgalogo.rle win.com
 
 (i grabbed this from _supercharging windows_ by judd robbins--great book)
 this is also how you can put your own logo into the windows startup screen.
 an rle file is just a specially compressed bmp file.
 
 hope this helps
