 if it's any consolation, i had a similar problem. as i recall, if i exited
 from a dos session while in full-screen mode, the menu titles had changed to a
 scrambled version of the icon title font (or something like that). it only
 started happening after i used icontitlefacename in win.ini to change the
 desktop font to arial. so i stopped exiting from dos sessions while in
 full-screen mode.
 
 my mac used to do something similar. aren't computers weird?
