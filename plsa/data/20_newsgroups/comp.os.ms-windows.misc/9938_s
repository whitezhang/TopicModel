 i'm trying to find tom haapanen, formerly tom@wes.on.ca
 who was the keeper of the faq for this newsgroup.
 he was working at watrerloo engineering software,
 but netfind can't even find that (but it may have
 been a uucp connection).  if anyone knows how to
 contact tom, please let me know.
 
 thanks,
 tom schlatter
