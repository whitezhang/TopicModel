 sorry, i don't have the demo, but i do have the program and have been
 using it for the past few weeks.  since i now have dos 6 as well, i
 don't use many of the features of pct4win.  but i do so use:
 	- the pct desktop with drag and drop printing, folders in
           folders, and multiple desktops
 	- the file manager which is far superior to win 3.1's fm.
