 i'm told that i can replace the colorful windows logo that appears as
 windows invokes with a graphic of my choosing.  the challange is that the
 image must be in 'rle' format.  i've got gif's, pic's, jpg's, tif's, etc...
 everything but rle's!
 
 what's the best route to converting these things?  
 what program should i download, and from where?  
 has anybody else done this, and do you have the steps available?
 
 thanks.  e-mail to ivory@e7sa.epi.syr.ge.com or ivory@tower.com would
 be prefered.
