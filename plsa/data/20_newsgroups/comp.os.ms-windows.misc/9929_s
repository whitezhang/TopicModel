 hello,
 
 i thought this problem might have something to do with windows 3.1 smartdrv and
 a vesa video card...any ideas???
 
 i recently purchased a 486dx-33 machine and am having problems where the 
 machine will suddenly freeze or reboot.  this may happen in windows 3.1 or dos 
 5.0.  sometimes it is after printing a document, sometimes after using the 
 mouse, and sometimes just when i am sitting there.  twice when it happened, the 
 machine rebooted and sounded seven beeps.  i looked in the documentation and 
 the seven beep code meant a problem with interrupts.  the machine has the 
 following configuration and files:
 
 486dx-33
 ami bios
 5.25 and 3.5 floppies
 170 meg ide hard drive
 256k cache
 microsoft compatible mouse on com1
 citizen gsx-145 on lpt1
 ni supervga monitor with vesa windows accelerator card w/ 1meg
 two vesa slots
 windows 3.1
 dos 5.0
 
 config.sys
 ==========
 device=c:\windows\himem.sys
 dos=high
 devicehigh=c:\dos\setver.exe
 files=20
 buffers=20
 stacks=9,128
 
 autoexec.bat
 ============
 @echo off
 lh c:\windows\smartdrv.exe 1024
 prompt $p$g
 path c:\dos;c:\windows;c:\mouse
 lh c:\mouse\mouse
 set temp=c:\dos
 lh c:\dos\doskey 
 
 
 when the machine freezes, i can't use the mouse or keyboard or use ctrl-alt-del 
 to reboot.  if any one can give me any help, i would greatly appreciate it.  if 
 anyone can help configure this machine for the best efficiency (memory wise) i 
 would appreciate that also.
