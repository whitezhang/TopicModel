 yes - ignore the manual.  just insert the evelope - don't use the keypad
 to move it up.  the windows driver sends a message to the printer that
 tells it to load the envelope - if it is already loaded, it gets ejected
 and the printer tries to load another.  the instructions in the manual
 are for dumb dos apps. that don't send the "load envelople" message.
