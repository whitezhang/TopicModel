 wow, what did you use it for?  single-tasked word processing?
 i have 8 files loaded right now and a 29-mb virtual machine (12mb of
 ram). my friend down the street gripes that he can't even format a
 floppy in the background.  many unix people love os/2 because they are
 used to multi-tasking systems.
