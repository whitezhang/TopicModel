 	hmmmm, why do i get the feeling that this is gonna start one of
 those endless threads 'mac vs win" and might even end up as "os/2 vs win".
 well, i dont know if windows is a mature os, if i have seen one (in which
 case that has to be x-windows :) ), but dont be so quick to judge... 
 first of all to try to use plain vanilla windows is as courageous as to try
 to use plain vanilla dos. there are _lots_ of very nice commercial and
 shareware packages/utilities that will boost up windows past what ms itself
 thought possible :)... for example, norton desktop for windows 2.0 (a replace-
 ment for progman) will give you group-within-a-group capability and will
 even change group icons, it will launch progs by association (well, fileman
 does that too) or by dragging the file in the apps icon (now mac doesnt do
 that, huh? :) )... and the list goes on and on... now, windows _is_ kinda
 hard to finetune, boost and configure, but thats trhe price to pay for not
 paying $$$ to get a mac or an os/2 capable machine (an entirely differet
 story ...)... on the other hand if you dont like the idea of pm's icons
 not correspnding to the files themselves, well they are not supposed to :)..
 pm is a program _launching_ utility not a file manager... modify your 
 settings to have fm as your shell and not pm, or get a couple of utilities
 from cica that supposedly give you a 'mac feel'... i dont wanna get in the
 discussion which is a better system: mac's are good in their own way -- they
 are _different_ not better or worse than win pcs-- (actually i am writing
 this from a mac lab as a user assistant - so dont think i am partial to win:) )
 by all means check out the stuff in cica (ftp to ftp.cica.indiana.edu under
 the pub/pc/win3 subdir user: anonymous), or wait for startrek (mac's os on
 a pc !!! -- the threads we are gonna have then !!! :) )...
 just trying to avoid another mac-win war...
