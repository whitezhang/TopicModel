  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 not unreasonable, since the smartdrv packaged with dos 6 is version 4.1.
 make sure that all your drivers (himem, emm386, smartdrv) are being
 executed from the dos directory.
 
 loss of the cache provided by smartdrv could be your problem; if not,
 i don't know what might cause the startup delay.  my testbed for dblspace
 (which has a *very* minimal amount of data on the disk so that i don't
 eat up too much time as i install and uninstall dblspace) boots in 
 about 20 seconds from the "starting ms-dos" herald to the end of the
 autoexec.bat execution.  i don't have handy a system with a more
 realistic volume of data to time.
