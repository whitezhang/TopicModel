 to all hardware and firmware gurus:
 
 my current home project is to build a huge paddle keyboard for a 
 physically handicapped relative of mine.  my goal is for this keyboard
 to look exactly like an at sytle keyboard to its host system.
 this will be a highly endowed keyboard with a little pcl from z world
 at its heart.  the only thing i lack is detailed information on the
 hardware signaling that the 486 (with  windows 3.1  and dos 5.0) will be 
 expecting.  my project is independant of windows, my hope is that some of
 you fellow window's users/programmers will recognize what i need and be 
 willing to point me in the right direction. 
 
 i have the winn l. rosch hardware bible (2nd edition).  the hb gives
 most (if not all) of the information i will need concerning scan codes 
 and even a wire diagram for the ps/2 style connector i will need, but it 
 leaves a number of important questions unanswered.
 1.  is it synchronous or asynchronous serial communication?  i'm
     guessing synchronous since the host is providing a clock.  in either
     event, how is the data framed?
 2.  is it half-duplex or truly one way?  i'm guessing half-duplex
     since the host can turn leds on and off.
 3.  are there any chipsets available for communicating with the "at
     keyboard standard" (other than by cannibalizing a real keyboard)?
 
 if anyone knows of a book or article (or any other written source of
 information) on the above, please advise me at gamet@erg.sri.com.
 whatever i do it must be safe for i cannot afford to replace the 486 in
 the event of a booboo.
 
 thank you for your time.
 danke fuer ihre zeit.
