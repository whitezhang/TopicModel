 i am looking for the latest drivers for the actix graphics accelerator card. 
 the driver i am currently using is version 1.21 and doesn't support more 
 than 256 colors in 1024x768 mode even you have 2mb memory. 
 
 the bbs support for actix is unbelievable! they are still using 2400bps 
 modem! it will take you hours to download the drivers, it hurts when you
 are calling long distance. is there any ftp site that has a collection
 of video drivers for windows?
 
 btw, anyone using this card, and how do you like it so far?
 
 thanks.
