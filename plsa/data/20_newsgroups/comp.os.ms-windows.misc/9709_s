 
   here is an annoying problem. whenever i save an icon which contains dark
 colors like dark red or dark purple, these colors are converted to the
 bright colors. this happens with every icon editor including the image
 editor that came with sdk. i don't have this problem with .bmp files
 either; only with .ico files or icon libraries. the problem is with
 the icon colormap field in the icon file header. checking the file
 with a binary editor, i can see that the masks are ok. by editing the
 colormap manually (copying from another icon that i didn't edit) i can
 fix the colors. does anybody know what may be causing this problem? 
 
 thanks.
