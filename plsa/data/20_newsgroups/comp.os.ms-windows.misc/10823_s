 many thanks to those who responded to my question.  unfortunately i have
 had no luck in actually getting such a font, and a lot of people interested
 in geting one, and so i have decided to create my own truetype font fitting 
 that description.  this font is based on that used in the 1904 issue of 
 dineen's dictionary and is typical of that found in irish books from the 
 early part of the century.  this may take me some time to do (in my
 limited spare time) but i'll make it available to anyone who is interested, 
 when it is ready.
 
 the responses i received are summerised below:
 
 kevin donnelly (caoimhin@smo.ac.uk) mentioned that michael everson
 (everson@irlearn.ucd.ie) had developed some clo/ gaelach fonts
 for the macintosh and may be able to advise me.  i contacted michael
 and he told me that he has three fonts available for the macintosh, and
 that he will eventually port them to the pc, but that he will be charging 
 ir 100 (about $160) for each one.
 
 pbryant@ukelele.gcr.com mentioned that he uses two font that have a
 'nice irish/gaelic look to them'.  these are "durrow" and "american 
 uncial-normal".  i don't know where you can get these but i don't
 think that they have the effects i am looking for.
 
 finally, rhiannon@netcom.com (rhia) mentioned that the "meath" font
 included in the casady & greene fluent laser fonts 2 package
 is very much like what i was describing.  i faxed casady & greene for
 info but got no reply.
 
 so that's it.  i'll post these newsgroups when i make my font available.
 
 colum twomey.
