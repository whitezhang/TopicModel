 all right.  not saying i know any more than the average salesguy, i'll give 
 your question a shot. 
 
 the key issue that i bought my bj-200 on was ink drying speed.  you really 
 have to try awful hard to get the bj-200 ink to smear.  the hp deskjets need 
 10-15 seconds to completely dry.  in both cases, however, do not get your 
 pages wet.  unlike laser printers, the material on your pages is ink, not 
 toner.  but that should go without saying.
 
 my pc has very little memory (only 2meg ram), so the bj-200 takes a little 
 while to print ----- but every application i use takes a while to run.  once 
 the computer is solely printing, it purs like a kitten and puts pages out 
 every 15-30 seconds, depending on how detailed your graphics are.  
 
 the bj-200 can do windows soft fonts.  i'm assuming that the deskjet can, or 
 hp wouldn't sell many......
 
 size is another factor.  the bj-200 is much smaller, but the hp is built 
 like a tank.  i bet the bj-200 would get damaged first.
 
 finally, the print quality.  i love the bj-200's resolution.  it looks like 
 a good laser quality print.  the hp's i've used.....they look like ink.  not 
 as impressive.  
 
 so, i chose the canon.  any other opinions?
