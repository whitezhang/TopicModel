 
 software that comes together with the videoblaster
 is designed to work together with the soundblaster
 (from the same manufacturer).
 
 since i do not own a soundblaster: is there a possibility
 to use the pc speaker driver to play audio files for
 the videoblaster (.avi = audio video interleave files) ?
 
 i think what i should have is a device driver for
 the media player that controls the pc speaker driver
 instead of the soundblaster card (something like mcispkr.drv).
 
 has anybody heard of such a driver?
 or am i on the wrong track?
 
 any information on this appreciated!
 
 (please send e-mail, since i don't watch this group regularly.)
