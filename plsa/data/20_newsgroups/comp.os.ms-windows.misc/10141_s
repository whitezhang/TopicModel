 note that the two tables don't talk about the same population.  one is
 fortune 1000 companies favoring the platform as their primary
 application platform, the other is sales (to everyone, not just
 fortune 1000).  fortune 1000 companies don't do a lot of development
 with the mac as their top platform.  i would expect that that would
 explain the discrepancy.
