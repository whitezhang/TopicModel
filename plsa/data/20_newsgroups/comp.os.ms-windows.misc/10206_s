 
 i am working with visual basic v2.0 for windows.
 specifically, i am working on an application that generates formatted reports.
 since, some of these reports can be rather large, my first question is:
 
 1.  is there a way to increase the size of a list box or text box in
 visual basic/windows beyond the 64k limit?
 
 as i have not (as yet - being optimistic :-) come across a way to get
 around the above problem, i am working on the following approach:
 
 i am trying to create my own defined template in ms-word, using the
 wordbasic macros so that i can open up word from visual basic(vb) and load
 this template of mine, which will work in the following way:
 
 it will first open myown.ini file (created in vb - at the time when the
 user selected the kind of report he weanted) and read the section from the
 .ini file and jump to the appropriate code in template - which will then
 open and read a file pertaining to the section it read from the .ini file.
 
 1.  when using the getprofilestring function in wordbasic, is there a way
 to specify/change the default .ini file (which is win.ini) to myown.ini file?
 
 2. when using the file input$ function in wordbasic - is there a way to
 read more than the 32k at one time?

 any help will be appreciated.
