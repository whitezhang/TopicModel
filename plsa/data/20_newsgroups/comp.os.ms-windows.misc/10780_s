 this ms bashing has definitely lost all its humor value.
 
 i think most of the people posting are forgetting that most users
 of ms products do not even know about internet, and unix is that
 very unfriendly place where bizzare abreviations replace the rather
 comfortable abreviations they know. and the abreviations have subtle
 differences between the different vendors. while pc users tend to
 customize any windowing setup, they can not do much with their 
 command line.
 
 so to most of the computer users in the world ms product symbolize
 quality. ms has made their life easier, and more productive and to them
 that is quality. they do not care about what innovative things ms has
 done, other than to make their life with a computer one heck of a lot
 easier. you may know better than most computer users in this world
 but that will not change their perception.
 
 face it until unix come up with a decent gui that is available to
 all variations of unix it just will not catch on with the mainstream
 of computer users. we here on the net are not mainstream computer users.
