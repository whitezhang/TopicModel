 	this is one of the trickiest problems w/ win 3.1 ... personally i run
 telix 3.2 for dos under windows just fine (and 've been waiting for the win
 version froever... :) ), but i have to admit i am the exception to the rule:
 i have tried installing various dos comm progs on friends' machines, most of
 them w/ big problems... some of the stuff you have to lookout for: 
 1) always run the prog thru a .pif, never by calling its .exe, 2) in the .pif
 _always_ toggle on _lock_application_memory_ --actually this is something
 ms points out in the readme.wri file, and is especially critical for downloading
 3) go under ctrl panel/386 enh and check for _all_ your com ports 'alway warn'
 --it will help u w. debugging this thing and it's 'healthier' 4) check where
 are u running the mouse from - com port - 5) check the com port addresses from
 your bios setup and from ctrl panel/ports/(setup?)/advanced..
 these might help u... if yu still have problems, get $100 and buy procomm+win..,
 :) hope it helps somehow...
