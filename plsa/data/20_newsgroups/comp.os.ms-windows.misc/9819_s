 i am using dos quick c 2.5 in a dos window under windows 3.1, and the other
 day while i was running the compiler, i got a general protection fault
 immediately followed by a "serious disk error".  when i rebooted, i found
 that about 15 files had gotten "cross-linked" which is a pretty serious
 corruption of the hard drive file system.
 
 i am concerned that quick c in a dos window has somehow strayed outside
 its protected mode world and corrupted the smartdrv.exe disk cache and
 that is what caused the disk problem.
 
 i thought that dos programs run in dos windows were pretty well-contained 
 by windows.  if that is true, then maybe the quick c compiler has nothing 
 to do with it.  has anybody else had this type of problem?
 
 (i only recently "upgraded" from quick c 2.0 to 2.5.)
