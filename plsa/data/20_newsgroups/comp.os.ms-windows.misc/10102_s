 source for "does not" comment: the cd-rom and manuals for the march beta
 -- there *is* no x windows server there.
 
 will there be?  of course.  (even) if microsoft supplies one with nt,
 other vendors will no doubt port their's to nt.
 
 according to a recent newsletter from hummingbird communications ltd.,
 they announced exceede/nt at uniforum 93.  the announcement reads like it
 is "here now", but there is no order or price info.  i would guess it
 must be rsn.  there is a dev kit too.
