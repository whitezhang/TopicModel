 hey folks!
 
 just moments ago, i uploaded the bungee jumper after dark module that
 was widely talked about on here some time ago.
 
 it's at ftp.cica.indiana.edu, in /pub/pc/win3/uploads, titled simply
 bungee.zip.
 
 be sure to set your ftp connection to binary mode before downloading.
 if you have any other after dark shareware/freeware modules, please
 upload them too.  the more the merrier.
