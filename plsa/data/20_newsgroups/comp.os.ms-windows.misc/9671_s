 
 i just got off the phone with mathsoft technical service. they
 are now admitting a problem of unknown nature with maple and
 norton desktop for windows. they have no clue at this time
 and are collecting configuration information on the systems
 which exhibit the problem. anyone having problems loading the
 maple solver in mathcad 4.0 under ndw shoud call technical
 support at 617-577-1017. they made no schedule promices,
 but are actively working on the problem.
 
 in the meantime, the workaround is to provide a configuration
 selection in autoexec.bat to use progman (yuk, pew) whenever
 you plan to use the maple solver and ndw otherwise. i am using
 norton be to place a little menu on the screen with a 5 second
 timeout to auto boot ndw.
