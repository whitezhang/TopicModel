 i'm looking for some recommendations for screen capture programs.  a
 couple of issues ago, pc mag listed as editor's choices both conversion
 artist and hijaak for windows.  anyone have any experience with those or
 some others?  i'm trying to get an alpha manual in the next few days, and
 i'm not making much progress with the screen shots.  :^(
  
 i'm currently using dodot and i'm about to burn it and the disks it rode
 it on.  it's got a lot of freaky bugs and *oversights* that are driving
 me crazy.  tonight it decided that for any graphic it writes out as a
 tiff file that's under a certain arbitrary size, it will swap the left
 and right sides of the picture [!].  usually it confines itself to not
 copying things to the clipboard (so i have to save and load pix for
 editing in paintbrush) or crashing every hour or so.
  
 the one nice thing it has, though, is it's "dither" option.  you'd think
 that this would turn colors into dots, which it does if you go from, say,
 256 colors to 16 colors.  but if you go from 256 or 16 colors to b&w,
 you can set a threshold level for which colors turn to black and which
 turn to white.  for me, this is useful because i can turn light grays on
 buttons to white, and the dark grays to black, and thereby preserve the
 3d-effect on buttons and other parts of the window.
  
 if you understood my description :^) can you tell me if another (less
 buggy!) program can do this as well?
  
 much thanks for any help.
