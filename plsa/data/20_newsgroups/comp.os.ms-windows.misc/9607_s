 hi there!  i have a few games that i'd like to run under windows 3.1 and can't
 get the pifs adjusted right.   for example wing commander.  in my dos prompt, i
 have more than 620k available for programs.  this is enough to run wc.
 so i build a pif giving wc a couple of megs of extended memory etc.. and run 
 it.  wc prompts: "loading wing commander..." and then a message about 
 "using extended memory..." etc... and then my screen goes black (just before
 the opening scene-the orchestra-would have appeared.)
 
 i also have a pool game that does almost the same thing.  it opens up and
 prompts me for what kind of video driver i have.  (cga, ega, etc...)  i
 respond ega and the screen goes black.   
 
 on both of these a ctrl-alt-del getss me back to windows.  
 
 has anyone run wing commander under windows?  or has had the problems i
 describe and fixed them?   here's the rest of my setup:
 
 	400mb disk free
           8mb memory   ~5 free during win session
         386dx-25
        
 respond here or on e-mail.   if anyone else needs this info, send me mail in
 a couple of days, and i'll forward the replies to you.
