 i have a 486 sx 25 and i recently added a scsi drive to my system using an  
 adaptec 1522 (non busmastering) controller. yesterday i ran coretest to  
 find out drive performance and these are the values i got
 
 seagate 106 meg: 875.1kb/sec	14.5ms avg seek   3.7ms track to track 
 quantum 400 meg scsi: 991.2 kb/sec  12.7 avg seek 3.6 track to track.
 
 first off all are these good results? i don't know what typical values  
 are.
 
 what i'm wondering now is the following. my swap file is currently on the  
 ide. i could move it to the scsi which is 13% faster, but then i would not  
 be able to use 32-bit access which might actuall make it slower. so on  
 which drive should i put my swap file to get best results? is there a swap  
 file speed test program out there?
 
 finally, i also ran the above tests with the aspi2dos driver loaded and i  
 got no difference whatsoever in performance. is there any reason at all  
 why i should load this driver?
 
 thanks in advance, i will post a summary if i get enough responses.
