 you're using drivers version 2.02 or earlier. the latest is 2.03, available
 from their bbs or by snailmail. it at least fixes the wfw problem.
 
 the reason i wanted to reply in public instead of private mail is because
 of following: i talked to their tech support a few days ago and was told
 that i can expect a new version near the end of the month. which should be
 about now...
 
 however, i have a problem when switching back from a dos session in standard
 mode. apparently they don't know of this problem and seem to be surprised
 why anybody would want to use standard mode at all.
 
 
 it's a great card for the price, at least when i bought it. now there may be
 better alternatives.
