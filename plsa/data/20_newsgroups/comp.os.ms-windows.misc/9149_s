 not true! both type 1 and tt fonts can be of excellent quality and poor quality
 at any size. it all depends on the font's maker and the complexity of the glyphs
 related to the size and resolution at which they are viewed. probably the reason
 for your opinion/experience that tt is inferior is because most tt fonts on the
 market today have been converted from type 1 outlines to tt either by the font
 vendor or end-users using fontographer or fontmonger instead of the tt fonts being
 hand-hinted to take advantage of the tt hinting language. at best these converted
 tt fonts will be on a par with the type 1 font of its orgin.
 
 truetype is a much richer and more robust hinting language than type 1 (the hinting
 of diagonals for instance, which tt does and type 1 cannot). if you check out the
 windows 3.1 core fonts (times, arial, courier, symbol, wingdings) you'll see what can
 be done with tt. there are other fonts out there that have been hand-hinted and not
 just converted. some of the microsoft tt font pack 2 fonts are hinted very well.

 again, not true. the characters in a tt or type 1 font depend on the maker. if someone
 converts a type 1 font to tt they'll only get the characters in the font of orgin. tt
 allows for much more flexibility in this area as well. you can have thousands of glyphs
 in a tt font file (mac/ps/windows/unicode char set) and use the characters appropriate
 for the particular platform you are running the font on. for instance, all or our fontpack
 2 tt fonts have the mac/windows char set in them. the metrics of the fonts are such that
 if the font is brought over to the mac the user will have access to the full mac char set.
