 
 request for information
 
 i have been reading about an organisation called "winword developer's relations
 group".  i believe they have produced publications called winword software
 development kit (or wordbasic sdk) and 'the proceedings of the windows
 developers' tools conference, wordbasic' sessions assembled by steve wexler.
 
 would you be able to help me with a contact name and address for this
 organisation or these publications.
 
 thank you
