 backdesk.zip is on cica, but i'm not sure of the whole directory.
 
 another to throw into the running is topdesk.  it is alsow on cica, but
 i'm not sure where.  it is more complicated then backdesk, but i've found
 it to be more stable and more usefull.  i recomend it to people who
 have already used a virtual desktop.  oh yeh, it's free.
