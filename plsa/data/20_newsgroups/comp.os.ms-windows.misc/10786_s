 excellent suggestion, ron.  and as a further comment on dos 6, if
 you decide to install windows standalone configuration completely,
 in more than 1 directory on your hard drive, and use dos 6 to
 jump to a specific copy for each user, you could be saving yourself
 many megs of disk space if you use the setup /n and /a technique!!
