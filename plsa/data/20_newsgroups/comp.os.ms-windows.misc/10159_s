 
 has anyone else observed this behaviour and if so, what have you
 done to cure it?
 
 one workstation in a wfw network goes deaf to any form of communication from
 other workstations until it goes out on the network itself. from then on other
 workstatons can interact with it until some time later when it goes deaf 
 again. 
 
 the workstation is set up to share its discs etc. the machine
 is a 486dx/33, 8mb ram, with diamond stealth video.  it behaves this
 way with a variety of 16 bit network adapters, including a smc elite.
 it also behaves the same way if i use the windows vga driver, rather
 than the diamond drivers.
