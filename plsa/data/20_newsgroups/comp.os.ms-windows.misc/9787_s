 i have a microsoft serial mouse and am using mouse.com 8.00 (was using 8.20 
 i think, but switched to 8.00 to see if it was any better).  vertical motion 
 is nice and smooth, but horizontal motion is so bad i sometimes can't click 
 on something because my mouse jumps around.  i can be moving the mouse to 
 the right with relatively uniform motion and the mouse will move smoothly 
 for a bit, then jump to the right, then move smoothly for a bit then jump 
 again (maybe this time to the left about .5 inch!).  this is crazy!  i have 
 never had so much trouble with a mouse before.  anyone have any solutions?  
 
 does microsoft think they are what everyone should be? <- just venting steam!
