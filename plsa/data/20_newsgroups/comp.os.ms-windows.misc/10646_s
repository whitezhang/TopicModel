 
 on a recently acquired gateway 2000 machine, when starting windows,
 three copyright statements flash on the screen right after the ms logo
 disappears and before programmanager takes over.  this does not happen
 on any other of our machines, and i am wondering whether this is a
 feature or whether this is related to several problems we are having
 with the machine.
 
 the system is a gateway 2000, 4dx-33 machine.
 
 the messages that appear are:

 the autoexec.bat file looks like this:
 
 @echo off
 prompt $p$g
 set mouse=c:\msmouse
 c:\msmouse\mouse
 path=c:\;c:\dos;c:\windows;c:\123;c:\wp51;f:\apps;f:\system;f:\winapps;f:\public
 set temp=c:\windows\temp

 lh winpkt 0x60 0x62
 lh ipx
 lh netx
 f:\login\login
 win :
 
 the config.sys file looks like this:
 
 device=c:\windows\himem.sys
 dos=high,umb
 device=c:\windows\emm386.exe noems x=d000-d1ff
 stacks=9,256
 files=50
 buffers=30
 shell=c:\dos\command.com /p /e:1024
 
 does anyone know what is going on?  any help would be much
 appreciated.
