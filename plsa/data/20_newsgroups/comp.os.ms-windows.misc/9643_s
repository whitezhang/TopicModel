 
 hi!  i will like to know if there is a fortran library for ms-windows v3+ out
 there.
 
 i have several lots of source code written by past a/ps in ms-fortran, and
 recently have needed to port them to ms-windows... i would like to avoid a
 major code-rewrite if possible - maybe a windows library is all i need?
 
 please help - reply by e-mail to:  traversmorgan@swell.actrix.gen.nz
