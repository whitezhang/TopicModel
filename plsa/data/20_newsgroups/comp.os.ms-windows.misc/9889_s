 this isn't entirely true. it is true that truetype fonts are
 larger than their atm counterparts, but atm fonts *do* get minimal
 compression. running stacker 3.0 report generator, i get:
 
 	 file type:      compression ratio:
 	 -------------   ------------------
 	 *.ttf (truetype)     1.4:1.0
 	 *.pfb (atm)          1.1:1.0
 	 *.pfm (atm metric)  11.8:1.0
 
 although the metric files are small, they compress quite largely.
 and, as you can see, even the regular .pfb files have *some* compression.
 
 so, doing the math on one such comparitive font file:
 
 ttf times = 83260 bytes/1.4 = 59471 bytes (compressed)
 pfb times = 51549 bytes/1.1 = 46862 bytes (compressed)
 
 you still win out, even if the atm times font *isn't* compressed.
 
 your mileage may vary depending on compression program.
