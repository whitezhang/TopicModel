 by night i'm an amiga user. by day i work with windows. i'd be much more 
 comfortable in windows if i had two things.
 
 1. a good personal information manager. you know- a calendar, address book,
 reminder list etc... rolled into one clean interface.
 
 2. a good file manager. microsofts is very poor by my standards. how
 about one that has a left and right window and allows file operations 
 between them. being able to launch programs from the same interface
 would be nice. as well as text reading and graphics viewing. those
 who are familiar with directory opus on the amiga know what i'm
 looking for.
 
 if anyone can steer me towards an ftp sight with these programs it would
 make my transition to windows a lot easier. please reply via email
 as i rarely get to read this group. thanks so much!
