 after setting up windows for using my cirrus logic 5426 vlb graphicscard
 it moved a normal window from one place to another. 
 my parameters where just the following : 486 dx 33 vlb 
 the card is equipped with 1 mb dram (not vram, there are 8 sockets for vram) 
 and the moving of the window just looked like it looked at a friends
 386dx 25 (387dx) and an normal isa et4000
 
 what i was wondering why is it not using the bitblt  engine which
 is suuposed to be on the chip.
 
 how are the experiences here..
 have i done something wrong ?
 (i installed the mswin 3.1 multiresolution drivers which where supplied 
 with the card ?!)
 would be nice if somebody could tell about his experience with this card
 also if there are new(hopefully faster) drrivers around i would love to 
 how to get hold of them :-) (ftp or whatsoever :-) )
