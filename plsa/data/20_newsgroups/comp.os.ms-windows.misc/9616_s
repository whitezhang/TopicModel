 
 i am looking for a win31 driver (or set) for my diamond 
 speedstar 1mb video card. does anybody know of an archive
 site that has these? i looked at cica and it had drivers for
 the stealth card and for generic et4000 cards but not one 
 specifically for the speedstar. is there one? or has diamond
 dropped the speedstar out of the driver development loop.
 
 thanks for any info,
 
 rob
