 // hope i am in the right group! i'm using bc++'s objectwindows (version 3.1),
 // trying to get some date processed in a window object. however, when invoking
 // the window object, the calling program gives up the control to the window
 // object, and keeps executing the next statement. the source code may look
 // like the following:
 
 class mywindow : public twindow
 {
 	...
 };
 
 void mycallingprog(...)  // could the calling program be a c function?
 {	...
 	mywindow *mywinobj;
 	mywinobj = new mywindow(...);
 	getapplication()->makewindow(mywinobj);
 	mywinobj->show(sw_shownormal);
 
 	next statement;  // i want the program to wait here until mywinobj is closed
 	...              // so that i can get some data back from mywinobj. 
 	...              // i specified the window style to be ws_popupwindow, didn't
 	...              // help. is there any other way to execute the window object
 	...              // so that the calling program won't give up the control?
 }                   // any help would be appreciated. thanks!  --jun
