 we are searching for one or two instructors for tutorials on advanced
 windows programming under nt.  if anyone has attended a course that was
 very good, we would really appreciate recommendations.
 
 please email me directly at paller@fedunix.org; i don't get to see these
 newsgroups often enough.
 
 thanks in advance for any help.
