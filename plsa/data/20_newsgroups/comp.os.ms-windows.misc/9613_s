  
 can someone out there tell me how to switch window's screen resolution
 quickly and easily?  i know that i can go back into install to do it,
 but what i'd really like is to have is the ability to just change a
 couple of startup or configuration files and have the resolution
 changed.  i already have both video drivers that i need on my system,
 so that isn't a problem.
  
 thanks,
  
 sean.
