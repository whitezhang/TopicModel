 
 i have recently graduated and am looking to move into a bigger house,
 leaving me with a condo to sell...  it was originally listed at
 59,000, but is now listed at $54,900.  the following is a list of
 features.
 
 master bedroom 	14x11
 bedroom		11x10
 living room	16x13
 dining room	10x9
 kitchen		9x11 w/ extra cabinets
 1 full / modern bathroom
 full wtw carpeting /new/ excluding bath, oil hot water heating
 /converting to gas this summer/, central air, condo fee $183/mo
 including heat; hot water; landscaping; pool; tennis courts.  
 
 in addition: washer, dryer /both in condo/, refrigerator, dishwasher,
 2 ceiling fans, all window treatments /i don't understand why i can't
 call them curtains.../, and a mantle!
 
 large storage room in private basement, plenty of undesignated
 parking.
 
 if you'd like to free me for the bliss of regular homeownership,
 please call kathleen sullivan at the rohrer&sayers real estate agency:
 609-546-0004.  she'll arrange for a showing off.
 
 now for that disclaimer caca:  subject to errors, changes, ommissions,
 withdrawls, and sales without notice.
 
 this posting is not to benefit or at the request of any commercial
 agency.  i simply want out.  flames can be sent to /dev/null
 
 thanks,
