     iomega 44 mb removeable hd for sale w/ 16 cartridges.
     
     total storage space comes out to be about 750 mb.  6 cartridges still in
     original shrinkwrapping, unused.  note:  this is not compatible with
     sysquest 45 cartridges.
     
     scsi interface required... plugs right into the back of macintoshes,
     but i don't have a controller for the ibm.  all utilities i have for it
     are for the mac.  if you have a mac, then this is for you!  i have a
     ton of software on these disks that i don't use anymore, because i sold
     my mac system.  stuff included:  most of the pd stuff from info-mac
     site, lots of gif's, and lots of sound effects.  (1 entire disk with
     just sounds)
    
     i am asking $900 for all, plus shipping.
