 i am looking for a copy of the first world wrestling federation album in
 record format.  will pay $10 for a good condition record and original
 album jacket and inserts.  the album i am looking for has a picture of
 a bunch of the wrestlers ina recording studio front and back with the
 good guy wrestlers and the bad guy wrestlers making faces at each other.
 songs include 'land of a thousand dances" or something like that.
