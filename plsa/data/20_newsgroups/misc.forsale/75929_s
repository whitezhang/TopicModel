 this is the final public update to my dragon magazine auction.  if there
 are no new bids then the current bids stand (like that's gonna  happen.  :) ).
 after this, any updates will be by e-mail *only*.  the entire auction 
 will end as soon as the bids stop coming in.  so if you want to get in
 on  this, be sure to bid now.  all bids must be made in *at least*
 25 cent increments.  buyer will pay shipping.  (unless you have any
 particular fancy, it will be us mail 4th class special, with lots of
 padding).  
 all dragons are bagged.  the condition of them vary quite a bit, 
 so i've come up with my own condition system.  some dragons may be missing 
 items like the inserts.  if you have any questions, feel free to ask.
 *
 condition ratings - usually this is just an evaluation of the cover, as
 most of the material inside is in great shape.
 excellent - ie-"as you find them in the store"
 very good - still in great condition, but can tell it's been boughten
 good      - on down the line
 very fair/fair - indicates lots of use (but still "decent")
 poor      -  indicates the material inside may be damaged (usually by
 scissors).  
 a * by the condition indicates that something from the magazine is 
 missing (usually the insert)
 i'll post another public update sometime this weekend (which will be the
 final public posting, after which the auction will be by e-mail until
 the bidding stops)
 *
 again if you have any questions, ask away.
