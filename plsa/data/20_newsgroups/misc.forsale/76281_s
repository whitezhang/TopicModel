 looking for a video in and out video card for the ibm.  one that will
 allow you to watch tv (coax) or video in, and will do video out,
 digitize pictures.  and if i am in windows, and would like to be able to
 look the rca out for the card to my tv and have it display on there, as
 well as dos apps.
 
 i heard of these snes and genesis copiers, that will copy any games, are
 those for real?
