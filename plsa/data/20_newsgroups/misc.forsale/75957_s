 
 i would like to sell my dot matrix printer so i can upgrade to inkjet.
 it is a "panasonic kx-p1124 24 pin multi-mode printer".  here are the
 stats (from memory and the manual):
 
 -  360x360 dot-printing for hi-res graphics, etc.
 -  very fast (up to 192 cps) printing in "printer-controlled" (as
 	opposed to windows driver-controlled) printing
 -  bidirectional printing for faster processing speed
 -  5 fonts ("courier","prestige","bold ps","script","sans serif")
 -  epson lq-2500 and ibm proprinter x24 printer emulation
 -  can accept single sheets, envelopes, and 3 non-carbon copies by
 	friction feed
 -  front or bottom paper feed
 -  6kb buffer
 
 i will send a sample document and a printed gif/jpeg file to anyone
 who wishes to send a sase.  with purchase (prepaid, please!), i will
 include the following accessories:
 
 -  manual
 -  cable (centronics)
 -  remaining stack of tractor-fed paper (about .4")
 -  free copy of windows printer driver (unless this is illegal, or if
 	it is included with windows)
 -  free unregistered dos shareware program ($2 registration, i think)
 	that apparently offers some word processing capabilities
 	from dos
 
 the last two will be on a disk (either size).  i am asking for around
 $165, but i am open to any (reasonable) offers.  i am a college
 student, so i cannot afford to buy a new printer without getting a
 considerable portion of the money from this printer.  this price
 includes all above items, and shipping (probably ups) is included as
 well.  i have the original box, but only one of the original styrofoam
 end pieces.  i will use a towel on the other end (you get a free towel
 too!!).  worked fine getting it here.  the whole shebang might not fit
 in the original box; i will figure this out after the offers come in.
 email any questions and offers.		-jon.
