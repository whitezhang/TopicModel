   i used this setup to run autocad and 3d studio.  the combination of
  local bus and the weitek co-processor made for very fast cad and modeling
  work.  the weitek coprocessor can cut 3d studio render times in half and
  sometimes more.  it also increases redraws and regens when modeling in
  both 3d studio and autocad.  everything is less than a year old.  i am
  asking $950.00 + shipping for the whole package.  please respond via email.
  thanks.
