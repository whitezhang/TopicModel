 i'm looking for a sharp 6220 or ti travelmate 2000 for parts.  mine has
 a bad ram chip on the motherboard and i want to see what i can get for
 parts before sending it off to sharp for repairs.  if you have one,
 drop me a line.
 
 also, i'm trying to set one up for a friend who needs to read his old
 5 1/4 inch diskettes.  anyone have the pinout of the diskette expansion
 connector on the back of the 3.5 inch floppy box? 
 
 if you respond, please include a phone number. i can't always get through 
 with email.
  
 as always, 
 
 thanks,
 
 jim lewczyk
