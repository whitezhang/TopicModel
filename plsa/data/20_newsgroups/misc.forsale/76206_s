 i have recently purchased a pb170 and have no more use for my
 rasterops 8xl.  it has been a great card.  i should have traded it
 with my iici, but i forgot.  my forgetfulness si your gain.
 great 8 bit video that supports:
 
 640x480 (apple 13"/14")
 640x870 (apple portrait)
 800x600 (silly dos monitor resolution)
 1024x768 (60hz & 75hz)
 1152x870 (apple 21")
 
 has hardware pan & zoom and supports virtual desktops up to the size of
 2 newspaper pages.  includes standard apple monitor cable or card to bnc,
 you choose.
 
 i am asking $250 (it's still advertised in macworld for up to $499). 
 completely negotiable.  i can get a monitor and sell the pair.  i will
 accept offers for software or powerbook accessory trades.
 make an offer.
