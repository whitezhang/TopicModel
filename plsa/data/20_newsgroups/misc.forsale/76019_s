 
 hello everyone,
 
     i have a casio tv-470 lcd color television for sale.  it
 is in mint condition.  retail is $199 but i'm looking to
 get about 1/2 of that for it, tops.  highest bidder in 
 a week gets it, assuming the highest bidder is at least $60.
 
 tv comes with black case and uses 4 aa batteries.  they also
 sell ac adaptor.  it has external jack for phones and external
 antenna, etc.  the picture is very good and it has electronic
 tuning so you don't have to screw with tuning a picture in, etc.
 i have the box and all documentation.  this has seen less than
 3 hours use as i have all but sworn off tv.
 
 best regards
 jack waters ii
