 
 irwin suggests the use of pre-formatted tapes for their tape drives, as
 you often can't successfully format a tape and need  bulk-erase it before
 you can format it again. anyway, i have some new, preformatted tapes for
 irwin 250 tape drives. 
 irwin accutrak series 120-250mb, $16/ea. new never used.
 3m dc2120, rhomat format.  $16/ea. wraped.
 
 email if interested.
