 
 hi to all.
 
 since all of you could also be a seller as well as a buyer, i'd like to bring
 this issue for discussion - what would be the best solution in case a deal 
 became a lemon?
 
 as i understand most people selling things over the net do not grant a warranty,i am in such a situation that the seller did not state whether a warranty would be granted or not and the item i received is out of order. the seller insisted
 that it was 'in good condition' when he sent it and so would just return half ofthe amount that i paid if i send the item back to him and after he is sured it
 is bad. is this reasonable?
 
 basically i would like to believe the seller tells the truth. also, i am positively to say that i've not done anything wrong which might cause the failure of 
 the thing. my assumption here is everyone is honest - so rule out the possibility that either one of the two parties or both are liars.
 
 i would like to hear your opinion - either in here or directly respond to my
 e-mail address.
 
 i know there is such a risk that you could lose money. but, how can we make it
 enjoyable to most people and not wasting the bandwidth?
 
 chein
