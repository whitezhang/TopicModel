           i  am  cleaning  out  the coffers.  i have a virtually 
           mint collection of heavy metal magazine.  this is  not 
           a  music  mag  but the really neato mag with giger and 
           moebius  artwork,  et  al.  jam  packed  with  amazing 
           sci-fi  and  fantasy artwork by many masters.  all are 
           mint with the exception of the 3 that have split  seam 
           on  the  cover  only but are otherwise perfect, no cut 
           outs or missing pages.  i have sep, nov and dec issues 
           for 1978, all issues for 1979, 1980, 1981, 1982,  1983 
           and  jan  thru  sep  for  1984  (72  issues  in  all i 
           believe).  i will not break  them  up.  they  will  be 
           sold  as  a  single  lot.  send  your  offers  to  me. 
           shipping not included,  these  are  pretty  heavy.  of 
           course  if  you are local (mass, usa) you can come get 
           'em in person.
