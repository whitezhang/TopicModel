 greetings netters,
 	i have a seagate 3144 130mb ide drive forsale.  i bought it yesterday
 and have been able to come across a 215mb that i am going to buy, but i 
 need to sell this one.  i guarantee that it will work.  there is still a
 transferable warranty i believe.  it was only used as a boot drive, not a
 server (source) drive.  i just want my money back out of it...$180.  thanks
 a lot and offers appreciated.  dave 317-495-5978  kari@sage.cc.purdue.edu
