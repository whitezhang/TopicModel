 >cipher tape drives				$10.00 
 what a silly boy i was, now i have zillions of messages like
 "does that include shipping" 		
 "is it scsi"
 "what rom version is it"
 "will it work on a maximegalon gargantuabrain 9000"
 ok, the deal is this - if you live in the twin cities, email me, and set
 up a time, sure, you can drop round and grab one for a tenner.
 else
 min order $20 (2 drives) + shipping. no guarantees they are good for
 any purpose at all (they look newish & clean), no technical
 negotiations. they are model 525 floppytape, part # 960273-639
 revision d. 17 pin floppy style connector on the back
 else
 they go in the bin - life is too short for extended negotiations over
 $10 items :-)
 cheers
 mike.
