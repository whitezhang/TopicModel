 i have used jvc's top of the line portable cd player for three months now.
 i have mostly used it in my car on long trips, so it has less than 20 hours of use on it.  the unit is one of the best that i have seen and listened to, but
 i am going to part with it to install a disc changer in my car.
 
 features include:
 	17 hz - 20,000 hz
 	rechargeable nicad batteries
 	wireless remote control
 	ac adaptor
 	headphones
 	carrying belt and case
 	digital 6 band graphic eq with spectrum analyzer
 		25 presets, 5 user programmable
 	rca connections and cord
 	jvc compulink capability (cord included)
 	programmable from remote
 	intro, random, repeat playback
 
 i will include a discwasher (tm) power converter to convert an automobile's
 12v dc to the 5.5v dc that the unit requires.  i had to buy this one because
 it was the only one that fits, (jvc makes a unique connection that cannot be
 found at radio shack etc).
 
 i paid $235 for the disc player and another $30 for the power converter.
 i will sell the disc player alone for $180, or both items for $190.
