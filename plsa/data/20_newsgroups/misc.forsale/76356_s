 	i have some brand-new shrinkwrapped boxes of 8" floppy disks that i
 would like to sell.  they are all 3m disks:
 
 40 (4 boxes of 10) ss/sd 8" floppy disks
 60 (6 boxes of 10) ds/dd, w/wp 8" floppy disks
 
 misco is selling the ss/sd 3m disks for 25.90 for a box of ten and they are
 selling the ds/dd 3m disks for 31.90 for a box of ten.  i will take the
 best offer i can get for the disks (as many boxes as you want).
 
 	i also have a quantity of 8" floppy disks that 
 some people were getting rid of, probably due to an upgrade to a newer drive
 system.  all the disks are used and most have labels on them, but they all 
 appear to be in good physical shape.  however, i make no guarantees of the
 quality of these disks.  here are the statistics:
 
 quantity	make	type
 
 10		3m	single side/double density,soft sector,128 bytes/record
 66		memorex single side/double density,soft sector,128 bytes/record
 
 i will accept the best offer i receive for the disks and i'm willing to sell
 them off in different amounts, the minimum being a box of ten (if i get no
 offers on these disks i would considering throwing them in with the new
 disks i'm selling above). 
 
 i also have a head-cleaning kit for 8" disk drives for which i will take
 the best offer i can get.
 
 all sales are final.
 
 i would prefer to ship cod and add the shipping costs onto the total order 
 cost.
 
 please send e-mail to formula@athena.mit.edu if interested.
