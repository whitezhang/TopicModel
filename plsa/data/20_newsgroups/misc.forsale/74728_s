                i have a nice residential lot available.  it is approx-
           imately 1/2 acre in size.  it is located in the development
           called belvedere plantation in pender county, eastern north
           carolina, north of wilmington.  the lot is near the intra-
           coastal waterway.  golf and tennis are located on the
           development property.  belvedere plantation also has a mar-
           ina facility on the icw.  this lot is nearby to all of the
           facilities mentioned.
 
 
 
                i own the lot outright but it does not look like i will
           get back to the area anytime soon.  i would like to sell it
           for that reason.  make an offer.
 
 
 
                if interested please send e-mail.
