 fellow netters,
 
 i just wanted to let you know that there are a few honest and good people out
 there (even outside of iowa).  i'm sorry if anyone thinks that i am wasting
 space, but i thought you might want some relief from the "so-and-so is a thief"
 posts.  not that i think we shouldn't hear about the bad deals, but it would be
 nice to hear some good news once in a while.
 
 after seeing his post on one of the for sale groups, i mailed mr. mark miller a
 request for his copy of wordperfect 5.1 for dos.  he suggested a price of $50
 in his ad, but when i phoned him, he quoted $40 plus shipping.  that sounded
 more than fair to me, so i told him that i would send him a check the next day. 
 imagine my surprise when i logged into my account the following day and found a
 message from him saying that it had already been sold (after i had just mailed
 the money order).  after another e-mail message to him, he apologized and
 assured me that it was a mistake - i was the one who he was holding it for.  he
 sent the package as soon as he got the money, along with a letter stating a
 transfer of license.  this wasn't good enough for wordperfect, so i asked him
 to fill out one of their forms.  no problem - we thought.  it took three times
 to get it to the right address (my fault).  anyway, he mailed me the form for
 my signature and included a workbook that i had no idea was included in the
 deal.  again, he apologized for not sending it before.  i now have the world's
 best word processor and a renewed hope in the world that there are a few good
 ones left.  i recoend that if you ever see that mark is selling anything thatat
 you may want, give him a call.  if i had the choice, i would purchase all of my
 software from him.
 
 bravo, mr. miller!
