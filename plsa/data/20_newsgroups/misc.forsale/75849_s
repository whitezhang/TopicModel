         this is truly an excellent printer and is the low-cost
         alternative to a laser printer.  it prints with the
         quality of a laser printer, but for a fraction of both
         the inital cost and he long term cost (that is,
         replacement of ink cartridges as opposed to replacement
         of toner).  the printer prints at a maximum of 300*300
         (d)ots (p)er (i)nch (d.p.i.) on many different types
         and sizes of paper, including envelopes and
         transperencies.  printer prints in both landscape and
         portrait modes.  printer can accept up to two
         cartridges giving it things like more memory or
         additional fonts.  printer works excellently with
         windows and dos and brings truetype to its full
         potential.
  
         i originally purchased the printer for $375.00.  make me
         an offer, but i would prefer to stay in the $300.00
         range.  i will pay the shipping to anywhere in the 
         continental u.s.a.
  
         if you are interested, please either leave me email or
         call kirk peterson at (303) 494-7951 anytime.
  
         thanks!
  
 
 
         p.s. the printer will work with any computer that
              can accept a standard parallel or serial
              connection.  (that is, ibm, amiga, etc.)
