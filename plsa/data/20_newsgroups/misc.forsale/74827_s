 looking to save money?  i am your man.  i will mail you 
 $5 in food coupons for only$2.50.  or you will get twice the dollar amount
 of coupons.  so mail $15 and get $30 dollars in coupons. sounds like a great
 deal well it is.  send sase to 766 s.elizabeth st. salt lake city, utah 84102
 enclose money in form of a money order.  personally, i would not trust a person
 to send coupons after money is sent.  well, let me earn your trust.  send
 $1 dollar, and i'll send you your $2 in store coupons.  
 then we'll talk more
