 i participated a promotion by a company called visual images. 
 they sent me a award certificate three months ago and asked 
 me to buy their promotion package in order to receive the major
 award. they mislabled my address and i did not receive my package
 until one month ago. i was mad and angry about how it took them
 so long to get my package. so i wrote them a letter and requested
 for a refund. they never return my letter. i was lucky enough to
 find out their telephone number through operator and received the
 package. i immediately returned the package and wrote them another
 letter to ask for refund. the package was returned because they
 address they put on the package was incorrect. i attempted to 
 call them and learnd that they have changed their telephone number.
 it took me at least 10 phone calls to find out their new number,
 but they refused to take any responsibility. i spoke to their
 manager and she said she would call me back, but she has not call
 yet. but i was able to get their address from their front desk.
 should i just go ahead and send the package? or should i waite until
 they call me back?
 
 i know there are several people on the net has experience with the
 same company. i would like to know how they got their money back.
 if you have similar experience, please advise me.
 
 thanks in advance,
