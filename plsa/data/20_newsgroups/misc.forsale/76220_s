 i have a pair of oakleys that cost about $100 new a year ago.  i hardly ever
 wore them because they just don't look right on me.  they are orange and
 blue and are the "blade" kind (terminator style).  i am willing to sell these
 for $40 to the first response i get. 
 i also have a bulls vs. blazers game for the snes that is in perfect
 condition.  i am selling it for $35.  it includes the instruction manual.
