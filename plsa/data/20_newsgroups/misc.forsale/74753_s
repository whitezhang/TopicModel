 
 	ok people, i really need to sell this sampler to pay off bills, so
 i'm even going to include 3 sample cds worth at least 200 separately in
 this deal.....
 
 	it's an emax ii with standard memory and 16 bit stereo sampling
 	it's rackmount and has at least 24 voice pol., it's got a brand new
 	connor (sp.?) 170 meg internal scsi drive (4 wk old, never used) 
 	it works perfect and runs perfect. in addition access to a friends
 	sound library of over 1gig of sounds is available... all this for 
 	only $1600.. the sample cd's are based on dance/house/techno stuff.
