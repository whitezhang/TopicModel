       agreed.  i have yet to run into a problem in deals over the net
       and i have bought things from cds (plenty!) to a full computer.
       the only small problem that i have had was with ups rather than
       the seller.  besides, complaints are always what get the
       publicity....when something goes wrong, people complain.  rarely
       have i seen posts stating how well a deal went through.  i guess
       kevin is practically a first!
