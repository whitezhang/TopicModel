      asking price:  $150 shipped prepaid
                              (c.o.d. orders pay c.o.d. shipping).
 
      features:
 
             straight paper path (won't jam).
             paper saving tear-off capability (no need to waste a sheet to
                get a current printout).
             programmable preferences (you don't even need a computer)
             letter quality 360dpi output
             epson lq2500 emulation built-in
             card slot for additional memory / font upgrades
             printer ribbons easily found (there are three or four sources
                for alps ribbons in every computer shopper).
             fast 180 cps output
             this printer has not even been used in the last two years (three
                years old) because i have a laser printer at work and use that
                instead.
             originally $399.
 
             i'll even throw in two ribbons (may need simple reinkings tho).
