 
 as the title says. i would like to sell my star lv2010 9 pin printer.
 its a narrow colum dot matrix, supports both parallel and serial
 interfacing, prints at 200 characters per second, has a 16k buffer, 
 and is very dependable...
 
 drop some mail if your interested in it. $55 plus shipping get the
 printer, and 6 extra srink-wraped ribbons, parallel connection
 cable, power cord, manual, and one sheet of paper (smile)...
