 greetings:
 
 here is a list of items for the 3b1 which i am selling:
 
 dbase iii - full dbase iii multiuser development/runtime for 3b1!
 microsoft basic interpreter - gives 2.5 megabytes ram available!
 microsoft word - full featured mouse-based multiuser word-processor.
 microsoft multiplan - nice multiuser spreadsheet program. 
 gss-chart - nice graphical program for creating business charts.
 lpi-c - a robust c compiler.  i'll throw in lpi-debug:single-step,alter vars.
 at&t electronic mail - very nice office-based front end to mail.
 
 i'll take $500 or best offer for the whole bunch.  i bought all of these
 new in 1985, and paid over $2,000 for these excellent programs.
 
 i'd rather sell them together, but don't hesitate to make me an offer for one.
 
 i'd consider possible trades.  i'm interested in the following 3b1 hardware:
 
 ethernet card with or without software
 tape backup
 external expansion unit
 upgraded p5.1 motherboard (or just info on who can do the p5.1 upgrades)
 icus 2nd hard drive upgrade kit
 at&t 513bct, 610, 615, or 4415 terminals with the unixpc-style keyboard
 
 make me an offer.

 ps:  i can get unix pcs with 40m drives and 1m motherboards loaded with 3.51m,
 cnews, smail, trn, rn, elm, nethack, gzip, hdb, and a couple other things
 for about $550 each plus shipping.  let me know if you're interested.
 
 pps:  priam d519 150m hard drives (exactly same as maxtor 2190, but faster)
 are on sale for $280 thru a vendor in la (number not handy, write for info)
 this is a very good price for these drives, the largest, fastest hds
 available for the unix pc.  (note, to fully use the entire 150m, you'll
 need the p5.1 motherboard upgrade [who does these?], and a wd2010)
