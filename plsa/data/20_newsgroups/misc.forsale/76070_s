    these games require a sony 1450 laserdisc player.  the
 nice thing about this player is that you can also watch
 normal laserdisc movies on it as well.  i have one which i
 will sell for $600 by itself, $550 with a purchase of one
 complete system or $500 if you buy both systems.
  
     i currently run this into my entertainment center.  i have
 it housed in a pc computer case with with its own fan, and 
 power supply.  i run the audio into my stereo system, and the
 laserdisc runs directly into the t.v..  i have made a mount for
 the joysticks and the buttons.  first person who buys both
 games will get it all, otherwise you have to do it yourself.
  
     if you would prefer to have it all housed in a normal
 arcade cabinet this can be done as well.  the graphics will
 go nicely along the sides and front of the cabinet.
  
     everything works perfectly.  the laserdisc player has an
 rs-232 port which you can use to develop your own multimedia
 type applications.  the laserdiscs have been stored in a safe
 place and have no scratches on them.
  
     if you are interested please email me.
  
     thanks,
