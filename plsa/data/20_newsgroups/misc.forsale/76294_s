 hey!!! i've just upgraded my laptop to a windows-capable one, so i 
 don't need my dos word processor anymore.  it's a great word 
 processor.  easy-to-use, undemanding on the system, and
 best of all, it has a wysiwyg editing mode.  this is something
 word perfect doesn't have!!  and all i'm asking is $65 + shipping.
 it even comes with several hundred dollars of free utilities!!!
 
 $65 for a full-featured wysiwyg word processor!!!  perfect for
 a laptop, or a lower powered machine!
 
 check this out:
 ca> it has: 
 ca> - wysiwyg-mode editing (word perfect still trying to do
 ca> this!) 
 ca> - graphics-importing, scaling, and resizing (comes
 ca> with free art!)

 ca> great!).  comes with 30 typefaces.  supports  subscripts and
 ca> superscripts, too! 
 ca> - grammatik iv: the grammar and style
 ca> checker.  comes with a quick  reference card for easy use.
 ca> it really helped my punctuation and usage!

 ca> thesaurus: th dictionary and thesuarus pack is published by

 ca> can't trust them with your words, who can you trust?

 ca> library.  perfect for importing into pfs:write documents.
 ca>  
 ca> i bought this product 1 year ago for $129. its easy to use
 ca> and turns out great-looking documents, even on a dot-matrix 
 ca> printer.  so if you  want wysiwyg editing for your dos-computer 
 ca> now, pfs:write is here!  
 ca>  
 ca> i'm looking to get $65.  it comes with full
 ca> documentation, registration cards, the box (its still in
 ca> good condition), both 5 1/4" and 3 1/2" disks for pfs:write
 ca> and grammatik, and the clickart on a 3 1/2" disk. the
 ca> utilities pfs:write comes with are worth $300 alone, so $65
 ca> for a full-featured wp is a real bargain.  buyer pays
 ca> shipping.
