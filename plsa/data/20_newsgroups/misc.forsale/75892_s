 $1.50 for one book, $3.00 for more than one book, or free if you order 
 a large enough amount of stuff.  i am willing to haggle.
 
 i have thousands and thousands of other comics, so please let me know what 
 you've been looking for, and maybe i can help.  some titles i have posted
 here don't list every issue i have of that title, i tried to save space.
