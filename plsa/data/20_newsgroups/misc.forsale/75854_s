 waxworks by horrorsoft/accolade (5.25")		   $30
 
 by the same folks who brought you elvira i & ii.  i played
 elvira i & ii, and think that horrorsoft has finally made
 a very playable game with waxworks.  the look and feel is
 roughly the same as in the elvira games, though the real time
 fighting is a little easier to survive.  the first two games,
 especially elvira ii: jaws of cerberus made it very tough to
 stay alive and hit-point restoring was very difficult.  this 
 is not to say that waxworks is a walk in the park, but it is
 quite fair, in that there is always some weapon to be found
 that is quite effective, or hint given as to the proper fighting
 strategy.  in one of the four wax works to be explored, there is 
 no fighting at all (well almost none), though all four contain
 moderately challanging puzzles.
 
 the really interesting thing about this game is that it is really 
 broken up into four seperate rpgs, one for each of the four exhibits
 you must enter.  in starting each one, your character is transported
 with no objects to use, and experience level 1.  one exhibits traps
 you inside a multi-level ancient egyptian pyramid which you must 
 escape by fighting, mapping and puzzle solving.  another exhibit
 traps you in a mine that has been taken over by creeping plant vines
 and pods, while the local humans have been transformed into plant
 zombies.  this is a single level maze that requires you to rescue
 some humans, kill the head plant alien, and figuere out how to kill
 the very tuff plant zombies that are always showing up.  this is
 perhaps the most horrifying exhibit.  another exhibit puts you into
 jack the ripper england where you appear by the corpse of a fresh ripper
 victim, and of course the police think you are responsible.  you must
 avoid police and angry mobs to unravel the mystery of the ripper and 
 meet him face to face - but first get a disquise.  the last exhibit
 pus you in a graveyard where most of the challenge is in learning to 
 stop the almost indestructible zombies.  
 
 over all the vga graphics and music are very effective in setting a 
 creepy tone for the game, as was the case for the elvira games, though
 gameplay is much improved and makes for a much more enjoyable game.
 i heartily recommend it for rpg and horror fans.
