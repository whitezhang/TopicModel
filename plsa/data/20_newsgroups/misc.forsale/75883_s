 my company maintains a 20,000+ mailing list which is regularly rented for
 one time use by the major software companies.  the method you are using to
 "seed" your junk mail, isn't really effective.  bulk mailers regulary 
 either send their databases to be "cleaned" by the ncoa, which if you've
 moved recently, will revert back to the original "xxx cool", and in large
 mailings, there will likely be a dupe of you, and they'll pick the first, and use the
 others for future mailings.
  
 btw, our list is currently one of the hottest lists for actual buyers of
 a ms windows utility product in the $100 range, and is available through
 direct media in ct., at $0.10 per name.  please let your direct mail
 marketing rep. know about this..  thanks.
