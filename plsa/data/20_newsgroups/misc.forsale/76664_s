 
 
 recently i got a case of hot shots '93 cards.  unfortunately i had
 not planned on keeping all of them.  i sort of got stuck with the
 case.  (i'm not going to mention any names, though.)
 
 so, i am trying to sell off most or all (minus a set for myself).
 
 if you have any interest in a set, a box, or any singles, please let
 me know.
 
 the set has 250 cards.  each card features a great looking woman in
 various stages of dress.  some nude, semi-nude, lingerie, dressed.
 99 percent are gorgeous, i feel.
 
 there are 4 subsets:
 
 girl, girl, girls   1 through 9
 promo cards   251 through 259 (also numbered 1 of 9 through 9 of 9)
 emperor's all-stars   269 through 277
 stripping empress   260 through 268
 
 also, i am supposed to be getting some holograms soon as well.
 
 oh, and lastly, i have a very few error cards and a few cards
 that were originally intended to be used as card #1, but the
 company changed their mind.  none of these cards are easy to get.
 
 anyway, if you have some interest in any of these cards, please
 drop me a line, as i am most eager to sell a bunch off.
 
 oh, and if you are interested, i also have 1 set of hot shots '92
 left, and about 2 sets of california dreaming cards as well.
 
 and lastly, i have promo cards for all of the cards i have
 mentioned, and holograms as well.  not a lot, though.
