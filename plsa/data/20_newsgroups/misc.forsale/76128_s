 all,
 
 finally cleaned out the storage room and have the following items
 for sale:
 
              c-64 computer
              2-1542 disk drives
              1351 mouse
              all cables
              lots of software (mostly games)
 
 the computer and drives work (hooked it to the tv to test)
 except for sound-evidently the sound chip is gone. when geos
 was loaded, the mouse would not respond, so assume it is bad.
 could be used for the games, or for spare parts.
 
 if interested, would accept any reasonable offers.
 
 send replies to ihlpl!rsbrd or call (708) 979-8816.
