 for sale:  precision drafting machine, bruning ogp-0180.  solid
 older model with spring-loaded counter balance; clamps on table.  without
 scales.  for right handed person.  $60/make offer, includes ups/parcel post 
 postage.
 
 i'm guessing that it's from the 1940s or 1950s, a period well known for 
 excellent drafting machine construction! :-)
 it's built with real metal parts, not cheap modern plastic, and it's painted 
 the typical office grey popular in that period.  it's smooth working, and 
 each of the two "arms" on it measures roughly 24".  it has a dual clamp to 
 enable you to clamp it on the edge or corner of a table.
