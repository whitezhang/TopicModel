 i am not a company, thus this is not a commercial sale.  
 
 i purchased 256 t-shirts last fall for a fund raiser that fell through. 
 we didn't have the time to sell the shirts.  i have about 175 shirts
 left and i am willing to sell them to you for $5.25 a piece (more than a
 dollar discount of what you would have paid the supplier for the shirts,
 even in bulk)  (that's $918.75 for 175 shirts)  these shirts are jim
 morris t-shirts.  they are all 100% cotton and most have more than 4
 colors.  (they are clean and neatly folded in a box.  if any happen to
 be damaged i will refund your money for each damaged shirt or replace
 it, your option.)  you could sell them for at least $8 to $15 a piece
 (the higher number is for the nicer shirts) to raise money for a school
 event or a organization.  i realize it is a big investment, but it could
 pay off big.
 
 i would be willing to sell the shirts in lots of 50 but only at $5.50 a
 shirt.  i will pay shipping, but prefer local buyers and will give them
 more bargaining power.
 
 please help me.  i do not have the time to sell these shirts and i need
 the money.  i am taking a big loss by selling this cheap.  i will give
 you jim morris' phone number so that you can varify the prices.
 
 all prices are negotiable.

 please email tf26@andrew.cmu.edu and tell all of the clubs in the area
 about this deal.  once they're gone, they're gone (cause i am not a
 business.)
