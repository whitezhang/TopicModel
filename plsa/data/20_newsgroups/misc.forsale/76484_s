 
 wanted:
  
 cannon's xapshot digital camera.  i'd be interested in any other
 makes, but the xapshot is the only one i'm familiar with.
 i need one with a composite output and approx. 50 pictures per
 disk capability.
  
 if you have one for sale, or if you know of a cheap place to order one,
 please leave me email at lgibb@nyx.cs.du.edu
  
 thanks
