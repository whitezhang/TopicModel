 hi,
 i am one those uncles that try to please my nephews whenever possible,
 so.. they have asked me to find them some nitendo games, no, it is
 not for the super nitendo.. it is for whatever model came prior to
 that.
 
 since they are overseas, i will first ask them if they already have the
 games you would have to offer me. please send me a list, or whatever and
 the price you are asking so i can send to my nephews and find out what
 they have and what they want.. so bare with me, i will respond, but it
 will take me a while. 
 
 thanks,
 walter

 please respond directly.
