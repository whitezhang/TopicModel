 
 	i've got 2 foot switches for sale.  they appear to be designed
 for studio use (ie: they're very well built) - 1" in diameter, 6'
 cord.  i'd like $15, but i'd also like to sell them, so make me an
 offer.
 
 	also i just bought a new ibanez guitar so i need to sell one
 of my others.  it's a kramer with passive emg pickups (2 single, one
 double).  these pickups sound great and are whisper-quiet.  i'd like
 to get $250 for it.
