 i installed dos 6 last week, and had nothing but trouble afterwards.
 windows apps are hitting protection faults more than a kid can do 
 to a pinata, and it does not seem to like to work with ndos (norton 
 dos 7.0).  other probs include:
 
 set pcplus=d:\pcplus for procomm plus no longer works.
 many of the little utilities to written for dos no longer works
 	either. (mostly shareware)
 
 i now have uninstalled dos 6 , and dos 5 works just fine.
 are there any apps that dos 6 will be able to run that dos 5 wont?
