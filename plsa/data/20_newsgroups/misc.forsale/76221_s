 i'm both.  i've made some $4k worth of pc products purchasing
 decisions for one company i'm affiliated with in the past 6 months
 alone.  (in a delicious bit of irony, an interesting fraction went to
 suppliers that i suspect got my mailing address from these people.)
 more is in the pipeline right now.
 
 if they wanted to discuss these sorts of things, upfront is the
 way to do it.

 and who issues that "vip code"?  (that policy implementation in the
 running for this week's "silly twit" award.)  btw - it turns out that
 i have several vip codes.  here's the one i'm using for these sorts of
 things: "6".  (if you want one, send me mail and i'll put you in touch
 with the folks who do the application interview; if you qualify....)
