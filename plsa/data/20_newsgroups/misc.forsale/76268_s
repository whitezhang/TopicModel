 i participated in a promotion by a company called visual images.
 i attempted to cancel my order before the package arrived. i was
 not able to stop them and now i have a package which i do not need.
 
 nishika 3d camera, wide angle flesh, film, carring case, instruction
 tapes, and some jewelrys.
 
 3 vacation vouchers to bahama, cancun, las vegas, orlando.
 
 i paid $697 for the promotion package, and the vacation vouchers
 came as gift. i really want to sell them, so make me an offer for
 the whole package. if you are participating in a award, $697 is how
 much you would end up paying. and i strongly believe that you would
 get the same award as i do. if you are interested in those items,
 you could get them from me for a cheaper price.
 
 let me know, and make me an offer. no flames please, i have got enough.
 
 you could reach me at koutd@hirama.hiram.edu
