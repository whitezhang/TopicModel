 the front covers should be available from sony.  check with a local car
 stereo shop.  you will probably (definitely) have to provide the units 
 serial number and hopefully you had registered the warranty card.  i 
 don't know the cost, but replacements have to be available to people
 who damage the face cover, so it stands to reason that it can be replaced.
 
 as to deterring theft:
 
 when i worked for a stereo shop, we referred the customer to a sony 800
 number.  we would not sell the face, nor did we have them available.  most
 people who came in asking for the face cover (or a pullout sleave for that
 matter) would look very disheartened to find that they acquired a deck
 they couldn't use.  if theft occurs with these decks, notify sony.  serial
 numbers do catch theives.
 
 just a thought,
 michael
