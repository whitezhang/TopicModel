 it is my impression that net etiquette does not allow companies to
 use the net to directly advertise their products.
 
 in addition to improper etiquette, this product is a mailing list
 used for generating junk mail.  
 
 am i correct in assuming this is improper, and if so, what can be 
 done to penalize such an improper use?
