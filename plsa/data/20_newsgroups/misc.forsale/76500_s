 i recently purchased an ibm monochrome vga monitor from mike damico. the
 monitor arrived but it was missing it's power cable. mike's address is
 apparently not a proper address because mail can't reach it. if anyone
 knows how to contact mike and could help me find him i would appreciate it.
 i am sure he just set aside the power cord as he was packing the monitor
 but it would be a lot more useful to me if i had the cord as well.
