 i have an old optonica tuner and integrated amp that i no longer
 use.  the integrated amp section does not work right now but should
 not cost much to fix.  i believe that it is just a chip.  i have 
 used it as a preamp and it works great!
 
 this is a very nice looking and well built set.  they both are low 
 profile but the amp is rather heavy.
 
 the tuner is in fine working condition and is a match to the amp.
 
 the amp is rated at 75w/ch.
 
 these peices went for about $850 new.
 
 i would like to get $150.  obo  for the pair. 
 
 if anybody has knowledge anough to fix the amp, i have had an estimate
 done that it should cost less than $50 in parts.
 
 please email me if you are interested.  i will be moving back home for
 the summer and will sell it back there if i do not do so here.
