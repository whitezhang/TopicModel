       costomer ac adapter : 6v dc power supply ( tested 9v dc)
        
        * the factory adapter was tested 12v dc (ac 110v input) at the 
          time i bought it three years ago. when using it, a lot of heat 
          was generated inside the cd machine. of course i wouldn't use 
          it to risk this baby's life. maybe that's why so many owners 
          always complain about their portable machine going kaput after 
          a short time usage. 
 
        * 9v dc factory suggested
