 i am selling my fiat 850 spyder:
 
 	this sleek little convertable has served me well through my past
 year in san diego, but i am going away for the summer and i have nowhere
 to keep it, so on the aution block it goes.
 
 	1971 fiat 850 sport
 	white body
 	white hard top (refurbished)
 	ivory convertable top (refurbished)
 	new black interior
 	
 	come with high performance exhaust system
 	larger rebuilt engine (910 instead of 805)
 	car mats
 	smog checked, registered until 1994
 
 this is the ultimate in san diego driving. i will not guarantee that
 this car will attract people to you of the opposite gender, but they
 will ask for a ride. one warning, this is a high performance italian
 sports car, if you want a boring little set of wheels this is not the
 car for you, this car requires care. it has a manual choke, a 4-speed
 manual transmision, manual throttle control, and even manual wiper
 pump. if you know how to drive then and only then can you appreciate
 this car.
 
 feel free to inquire. the price is $1750 and all inspection has to be in
 the san diego area since school keeps me here all the time.
