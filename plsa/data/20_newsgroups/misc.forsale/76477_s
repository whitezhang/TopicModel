 	heay bud, get a life in the real world.... do you still play with your atari
 with the paddles? geez man,  open your eyes on the technoledgy of today...
 
 i have been quoted a price from a local dealer friend of mine, that i could get a 
 motherboard (386dx/33 with 64k cache, with 1 meg base ram.) for $285 !!

 and pick up a computer shoppers guide...
