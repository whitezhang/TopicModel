 this drive is less than one year old.  the cartridges have all been bought
 since then.  all is in excellent condition and still under warranty.
 due to a change in system use, i now need a large, contiguous drive.
 
 offer includes:
 	sydos 44i internal drive
 	scsi adapter card and cables
 	all original documentation
 	software
 	all original packaging
 	8 cartridges totalling over 350mb (no bad sectors or defects)
 
 the installation was a breeze on my 386 clone.
 
 i will trade for something near 300mb ide, or sell for $450.
 i will also consider trading for 4 4mx9 30 pin simms at 70ns.
