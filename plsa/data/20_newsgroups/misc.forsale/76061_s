 
 	this entire dispute over a chip has deluged this newsgroup with a 
 	lot of posts that have nothing to sell.   it all harkens back to a
 	certain user's post of a month or so ago: stop posting computer
 	equipment here!!!   save it for the computer.forsale newsgroups!
 	if you don't get the computer.forsale newsgroups, then ask your
 	sysadmin. to try to subscribe to it at your location.   otherwise,
 	knock it off!
