 hello,
 	my parents are selling a 1978 22 foot searay. it is in excellent 
 condition and runs great. it has a mercruiser 198 inboard/outboard engine
 (it is actually a chevy 305). it is from the weekender class so it has a hard
 top over the driver. 
 has:
 	table
 	stove
 	water tank
 	sink
 	sleeping for 6
 	much more
 it is a good all around or fishing boat. if interested or for more info write tojmparkin@mtu.edu or call (313)681-4609
 	thanks,
 		jeremy
