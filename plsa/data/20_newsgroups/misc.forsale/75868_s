 hello,
   i am looking for the coleco tablehockey games that were popular
 in the 70's.  the games that i seek have straight slots for the
 defenseman, not the s shaped slots.  the players are attatched to
 rods operated with springs.  if you have a game(or games) that
 you would be willing to part with, please send me an e-mail
 message at u34815@uicvm.uic.edu.  price is negotiable and
 i would also cover shipping if you are out of state.  i am
 part of a league that plays on a regular basis, the cthl (the
 chicago table hockey league), and need a game to practice on.
 also, the league itself is always interested in purchasing
 games to expand itself.
                                   thank you,
                                          ken harris.
 equipment to expand it's size.
