 i'm sure that the motorola is worth it, but this kind of thing
 has always mystified me.  $400 is the price of very good, new
 dual-band, fully synthasized ht.  yes, yes, i know motorola
 hts are bullet-proof, unbreakable, plutonium-based 
 indestructable -- you can drive a tank over them and they'll
 still work.  but just how often does that come up?  why are hams
 willing (and they *are*) to spend the price of a synthaszied
 dual-bander for a 2-channel xtal rig???  note: this is not
 a flame; as i said, i'm sure this is a good deal for this rig.
 i'm just amazed that it *is* a good deal.  i would have guessed
 that a 2 channel xtal rig could never be worth as much as a dual-
 bander to a ham, no matter how durable. just shows you how wrong
 *i* can be.
