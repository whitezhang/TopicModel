 well, i'm not sure i'd go quite that far, but i agree that motorola
 gear is of better quality.  the question is how much that quality
 is worth to a ham in amateur service, not commercial service

 ok, great. but how often does that come up?  how good is
 "good enough", and how much is someone willing to pay for it?
 a good ham-quality ht is maybe $500, while a commercial
 quality one is maybe $2000. is the increased reliability and
 performance worth 4 times the price *in amateur service*?
 only the individual involved can answer that question, and each
 ham has to decide for him/herself.  if motorola quality is worth
 4 times the price to you, then more power to ya'. but i'm amazed
 that folks make that choice. for, me, given that i've got $2000 to
 spend, i'l pick the yaesu ht and a nice new hf rig every time over
 a motorola ht alone, no matter how good it is.  to me, ham-quality
 gear is "good enough". to each his own...
