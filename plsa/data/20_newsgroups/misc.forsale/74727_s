 i think the problem with small claims court is that you have to go to
 the location of the person you're taking action against.  it seems to
 me the time and money involved in travelling out there (unless this
 person is close to you) wouldn't be worth it for a small claim.
 it really depends on how much money you're out.
 
 if i am wrong about any of this, someone please correct me! ;)
