 
 	hello.  i have (4) simms for sale.  they are 1 megabyte
 	each, and are of the 3-chip variety.  these are very high
 	quality simms, and are nearly brand new.  best of all:
 	they are ***60*** nanoseconds (the fastest available!)
 
 	please make an offer.  i prefer to sell all four simms 
 	to the same person (to lessen shipping costs), but if you
 	just want one or two, please make an offer anyway.
 
 	thanks a lot: bitzm@columbia.dsu.edu
