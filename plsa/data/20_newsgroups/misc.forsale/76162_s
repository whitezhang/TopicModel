 fellow netters,
 
 i have an okidata printer i would like to sell.  a description follows:
 
 okidata 180 printer including cables for both ibm compatibles (centronics
 parallel) and commodore (rs-232 - round).  also includes power cable, manual,
 and a handful of computer paper to get you started.  this is a 9-pin printer. 
 i recently cleaned the printhead and installed a new ribbon.  a print sample 
 can be provided upon request.  this is a very dependable printer - it never
 jams or does "weird" things.  i have used it with a commodore for about 3 years
 and am now using it with my 486sx.  i use mainly wordperfect 5.1 (see next
 post) for which i got a driver (at no charge) that directly supports the 
 okidata 180 in epson fx mode. 
 
 when i got the printer, it was selling for around $200-220 new (i got mine
 from tenex brand new - for a christmas present).  i would like to get about
 $100 or so for it.  if you are interested at all in it, please give me a ring
 (e-mail) and make an offer.
