      paper focuser, etc...i also have paper & 
      chemicals, but i think these 2 are past 
      expiration date)
 
 
 everything is in great working condition.  i bought it 
 about a year ago and it has served its purpose well.  
 it hasn't been used it in a few months because i don't 
 have the time or money to keep up with it and its just 
 sitting in my bathroom taking up space i'd like to use.
 so, i'd like to sell it to someone who would use it 
 rather than it collect dust in my bathroom.

 everything (including shipping) for $300.  if you have 
 something else in mind, i'm open to suggestions.
 
 please reply to this account.
 
 thank you...
