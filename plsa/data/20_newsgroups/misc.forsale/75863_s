 hello neo-geo owners (and non-owners who couldn't resist the title;)),
 
 i was wondering if any of you out there want to trade or sell games.  i
 mean, buying them from the stores can get kinda expensive.  $184.99 is
 a little too much to be spending on each game.  but ahh, the quality...
 now i can get them for about $100, but that's still a lot.
 
 right now, i have:
 
 crossed swords
 magician lord
 baseball stars 2
 fatal fury
 nam-1975
 
 i am interested in buying more titles.  if any of you have any interesting
 trade ideas, please let me know.
 
 
 thanks
