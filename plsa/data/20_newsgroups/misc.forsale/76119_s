   sorry for any confusion i may have created.  the disk did come out of
 a vs2000 and i would like to use it in a ibm pc clone.  the reason that i
 posted to comp.sys.3b1 was because i saw the drive (xt2190) mentioned
 in a for-slae notice.  i had asked for info before but didn't receive
 any replies.
 
   thanks once again for the help.
 
 colin.
