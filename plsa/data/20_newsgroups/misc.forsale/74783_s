 i am upgrading my computer systems to fax modems, and am selling my
 2 2400/1200/300 baud usr modems without fax or error correction.
 
 one is internal ($25), the other is external ($30). 
 
 both are u.s. robotics (the highest rated modem manufacturer).
 
 add $4 shipping or pick up in the washington dc area.
 
 offers welcome.  (i would trade either for a 1x3x70ns simm.)
