 
 	a friend of mine has a complete set of aix-ps/2 1.2 software
 	and manuals for sale. (new) (all on 1.44 meg floppies)
 	including:
 
 		base os
 		development tools (including c compiler)
 		administration extensions
 		x windows / motif
 		tcp/ip 
 		pc simulator (dos merge)
 		etc. etc.....
 
 	(this software requires a ps/2 with 386 processor or higher, 
 	ample disk space and memory :-) it can coexist with dos and 
 	os/2 on the same machine, and selectively booted at startup.)
 
 	if you are interested email me your offer and i will pass
 	it along. keep in mind that the manuals and software fill 
 	up a 12x12x18 box so shipping is a consideration.
 
 	(please include this message for reference)
