 hmmm... interesting. what do you mean by walking distance? i lived in
 moscow for 21 years, and if i am 5 minutes walk to belorusskaya
 subway station, i cannot be walking distance to kremlin. unless
 1 hour of walking is what you mean. by the way, what is
 the price? i may plan a trip there (not sure yet, though) in
 late summer.
