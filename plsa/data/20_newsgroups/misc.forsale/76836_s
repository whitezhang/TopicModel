 o yamaha ypa-300 power amplifier (car audio)
   features:
         - selectable 2-mode power output:
           40w x 2-ch or 90w x 1-ch - all w/ extremely low distortion (0.1% thd)
         - low rfi circuit effectively eliminates radio frequency interference
           which might arise from dc-dc conversion
         - full protection circuitry protects amplifier from potential damaged
           caused by overload, short circuiting, dc leakage, excessive heat
           or mis-wiring.
         - input level adjustment allows you to complement your system with any
           audio component
         - gold-plated rca jack ensures a durable, optimum contact, even under
           rugged road conditions.
         - remote power links the entire system's on/off with the cassette
           receiver's ot tuner's power switch.
         - screw terminals allow simple wiring connections
         - power fuse replacement is a simple, one-step operation.
         - alternater noise reduction circuitry is effectively suppressed
           during driving.

     this is one of the nicest/cleanest amp that i have even owned.
