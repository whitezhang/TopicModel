 i have had a nikon l35aw since 1988. unfortunately it is no longer
 made. it is a p & s sealed to resist water to a depth of 12 feet. it
 is not really an underwater camera but it has been great in wet and
 dusty conditions. it takes aa batteries (hooray). it has the solid,
 heavy feel of old-style nikons and has taken all the abuse i have
 been able to give it. this includes a lot of water (rain, river and
 sea), desert and beach sand as well as being used as a weapon
 against a mugger. shouting and swinging the camera by the strap
 didn't scare the mugger away, hitting him with the flying camera
 did. this is my, "never be without a camera" camera. the current
 water-resistant (sport touch i think is the name) model is nothing
 like as solid or well sealed.
