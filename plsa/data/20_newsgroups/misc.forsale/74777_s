 
 i'm looking for a used/inexpensive audio mixer.  i need at least 
 4 channels of stereo input and 1 channel of stereo output, but i would
 prefer 8 or more input channels.  each channel needs to have at least a 
 volume control.  i'll consider buying broken equipment.  the mixer needs 
 to be fairly small (i haven't got a lot of space for it).
