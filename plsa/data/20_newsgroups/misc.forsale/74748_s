 	good point, but i was just thinking.. i wanted to sell my hp28sx
 calculator here in this newsgroup... it is called a calculator, but really
 it is a computer, albeit a small one, but it does function as one... how
 come car adds are acceptable? they cant run without computers nowadays....
 where does one draw the line? accept it, live with it, and if you care to,
 avoid it....
