 just to inform the readers of newsrc sony has just introduced a new datman,
 the tcd-d7 which is smaller and less expensive than the d3.  also, the d7
 has a coaxial jack which the d3 lacks.  oh, the d3 has always been
 available through mail-order houses for less than $700 dollars new... with
 the new model coming out, i suspect the now obsolete d3 will be selling for 
 even less.
