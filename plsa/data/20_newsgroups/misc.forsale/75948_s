 	i will be in boston (cambridge specifically) working this summer
 and am in need of a place to stay. if you have a room to sublease, or
 anything of the sort i would appreciate a mail.
 i am a 20-year old white male and am very flexible. i can adapt to a smoking
 or non-smoking environment. access to the 't' would be nice, though i will 
 have a car thus need a parking space. 
 i would need this from late may or early june until aproximately end of july.
 any responses welcome.
