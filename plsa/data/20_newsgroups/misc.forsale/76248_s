 i have a stack of records lp 33 that are from the early sixtys to mid seventys
 with groups like the beatles, cream, woodstock (triple album) etc etc. that i
 would like to get rid of.  i would be willing to sell one or all for whatever
 resonable offer.  some albums still have the original wrapper and price tag.
 i would like to get around $5 for each or you can call and make offer on the
 lot.  i could list them all but i'd be typing forever.
            call (408) 296-4444
