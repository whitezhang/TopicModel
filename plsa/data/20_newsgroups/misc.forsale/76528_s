 i have an altos 2000 system v.3 unix system for sale (i actually have two,
 but one's for me). several years ago these well-known machines sold for
 $30,000 for the base configuration. this particular one has much more than the
 base configuration, depending on what you want:
 
 - 386 16 mhz cpu.
 - 8 meg of ram.
 - fifteen (15) serial ports (or more if you want)!
 - a multidrop port for up to 256 more serial ports!
 - ethernet.
 - 5.25" floppy drive.
 - qic 24 cartridge tape drive.
 - 170 meg esdi hard drive (either micropolis or cdc, or both if you want).
 - unix system v.3 installation.
 - networking software package (tcp/ip).
 - development system software package (c compiler and libraries).
 
 i am asking only $700 (firm) for the system! if you want another ethernet or
 serial card, add $50. additional disks are $100 each (i can install a total of
 three esdi drives). i would consider a trade for a scsi dat tape drive.
 
 this box would make a great bbs system or terminal server. it was originally
 designed to service 40 active users, and up to 70 moderately active users.
 this is not a pc! it was designed to be a unix box from the start, and it's
 very fast and exceptionally reliable.
 
 it's dimensions are approximately 2.5' high (tower), 8" wide and 2" deep.
 
 i am only interested in dealing with someone local enough to come pick it up.
 shipping is way too much hassle. call if you wish, or send email.
