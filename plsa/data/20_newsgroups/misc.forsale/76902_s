 i have a powerbook 170 4/40 that is over 1 year old with no warranty but, in
 perfect condition (with original apple fax/modem), that i would consider
 selling you for around a $1000.  get back to me with what you think would be
 equitable arrangements (sp?).  have all manuals and system disks, some software
 in boxes and loaded, but threw out the mac packaging.
