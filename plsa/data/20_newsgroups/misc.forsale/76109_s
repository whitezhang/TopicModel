    i have a 24-pin printer which is an alps allegro24.  it's both a fast
 printer with lq and a very sophisticated design.  it has a straight paper
 path and the capability of auto-forwarding sheets to tear off and then back
 (a big paper saver as you never have to waste sheets to get a current
 print out).  it can also handle single sheets without removing the formfeed
 and has sophisticated preferences options (you can interactively program
 all the preferences to control the printer and get printed feedback without
 ever using a computer).  you get prompts and menus to pick your current setup
 and default set up.  this was the top of the line lq dot matrix when i bought
 it three years ago for $399.  it is also epson lq2500 compatible (besides it's
 own modes) and comes with ibm driver software (which i've never used since i
 own an amiga).  has a card slot for upgrading memory or fonts.
 
     i'll let it go for $150 including shipping prepaid.  cod orders must pay
 all shipping and cod costs.
