 i have a set of four 235-60-r14 big o tires that i had on my 1988 thunder 
 bird. we bought them and then traided the car in. they would not give me 
 anything for them so i had them taken off. we drove about 2,000 miles on 
 them. they are 40,000 mile tires. they are sporty looking low-profile, and 
 take corners realy well. if you are interested please contact me at (208)384-
 9236 or dusmadso@idbsu.idbsu.edu i am in idaho. usa
