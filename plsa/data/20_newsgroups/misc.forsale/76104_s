 i have a tektronix t921 15mhz scope for sale.  it is a nice, simple
 unit to learn on.  i used it while i was in school.  if you want one
 to play with at home, this is easy and inexpensive.  it has a nice
 handle and is quite lightweight and easy to move around.
 
 i will consider selling the probes seperately for $25 ea.  they are hp
 10017a probes suitable for this type of scope.  the probes are not
 included in the price of $99 for the scope.
 
 if you need more technical info, you will have to come look at it, as
 i am not a scope expert and what i have said is all i know.
