 reminding us that advertising is not done on internet:
 
 	   as a matter of fact d.j., it does make a difference.
 	   almost a half million new users joined the internet last year,
 	   many of them are commercial businesses. the ban on commercial
 	   use of internet is no more.
 
 jack, there is a difference between using the network for commercial
 purposes and advertising in newsgroups.  business communication is
 okay.  advertising to hundreds of thousands of users around the planet
 who have no desire to receive advertising is not okay.
 
 	   those of us who pay for internet access are constrained only
 	   by our innate good taste and no have no "administrator" to 
 	   guide(?) us.
 
 i suspect that a site which generated a large volume of material not
 in anybody's good taste would find itself getting a lot of attention
 it didn't want.  you may belong to the public library, but that
 doesn't mean you can deface the books, disorder the stacks, or disturb
 the other patrons.
 
 you're constrained by the same rules that the rest of the users (many
 academic and military, who get irritable about a network for which
 they pay with tax and grant money carrying private business
 advertising) follow.  there are secret masters here, just like
 everywhere else.  they're not as obvious as the ones on prodigy, but
 they're here.
 
 no doubt at some point the internet, like everything else, will become
 grotty enough to carry advertising.  at that time i hope it is
 confined to its own newsgroups and not on discussion groups---like
 misc.writing.
