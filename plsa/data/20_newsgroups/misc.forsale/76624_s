 i'm selling an adaptec 1640 scsi controller card.  i works with microchannel
 machines only.  the data transfer rate is very fast (i get about 3meg/sec with
 my scsi hard drive), and that's with relatively slow 100ns ram on a card.  it's
 a scsi-2 true bus mastering/dma device, and goes for around $329 bought new. 
 i'm including the new ez-scsi software for speedy win 3.1 performance and easy
 configuration.
 i'm selling it for $225, and i'll pay the cod shipping.
 
 please email me directly, and either give me your phone # with your offer, or
 i'll respond with mine.  i hope we can both benefit from the sale of this
 microchannel device; it's a great product!
