 hi,
 
 since the original buyer found out he couldn't use this modem
 for his mac (i beleive i mentioned that it's an internal in my
 former post), the modem is re-available now.  this modem is
 suprafaxmodem v.32bis.  if interested, please e-mail.
 
 thanks!
 
 ps: i am sorry i already lost those e-mails stated interested
     in this modem.  if you all are still interested, please
     e-mail me again.
