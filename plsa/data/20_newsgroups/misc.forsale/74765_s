 
 
     got a few things i want to get rid of...
 
     paradise ega480/casper ega monitor
 
     1 12 mhz '286 motherboard (dram/sipp)
     1 16 mhz '286 momboard (dram only)
 
     1 hayes "prodigy special" 2400b external modem
 
     1 1meg sipp
     1 256k sipp
 
     about 2 megs dram (i believe there's 1m of 120ns, and one of 100 or
     80ns, but not absolutely sure).
 
     also have an xt with 640k, serial board, hercules board and amber
     monitor.  the only thing this system is missing is the power supply.
 
 
     make an offer on any/all of this stuff, and thanx for contributing
     to mitch's v.32bis modem fund.

 note:  cross-posted to several forsale froups; followups redirected back to me!
 		there's a reason for that - i don't read these groups.
