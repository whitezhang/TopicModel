 sounds a little odd but i sold an amiga hand scanner to
 an elementary school teacher in south florida (miami, i
 think) but i have just recently found that i still have
 the scanner manual.  the original shipment included the
 software manual, disks, packaging, etc.
 
 basically, i have since lost the name & address of the 
 person i  sold it to...and i would like to get it to him.
 
 if that person sees this, please send me an email to:
 
 dlneal@cbda9.apgea.army.mil
 
 thanx, and sorry for taking up net space.
