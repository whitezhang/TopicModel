         **brand new** hewlett packard toner cartridge
         model number hp 92295a.
  
  
         o i am selling this toner because i recently
           bought a brother hl-10v printer and the
           toner that i am selling.  i activated the
           toner, but ended up returning the printer.
           the store, however would not take back the
           toner.  this toner has been used to print
           only three pages and is in perfect condition.
           i will protect it for shipment so that no
           toner escapes.  it comes with all original
           packaging and manuals.  the toner is compatible
           with any laser printer that uses the model
           number of the toner i am selling; just look in
           your manual to see if it will work for you.
           i will not go below $60.00.  i will pay the
           shipping to anywhere in the continental 
           united states.
  
         if you are interested, leave me email or call kirk
 peterson at (303) 494-7951 anytime.
  
         thank you!
