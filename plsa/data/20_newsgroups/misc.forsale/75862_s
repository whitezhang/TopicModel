 i don't want him nuked, i want him to be honest.  the junk mail has
 been much more interesting than the promised catalog.  if i'd known
 what i was going to get, i wouldn't have hesitated.  i wouldn't be
 surprised if there were other folks who looked at the ad and said
 "nope" but who would be very interested in the junk mail that results.
 similarly, there are people who wanted the advertised catalog who
 aren't happy with the junk they got instead.
 
 the folks buying the mailing lists would prefer an honest ad, and
 so would the people reading it.
