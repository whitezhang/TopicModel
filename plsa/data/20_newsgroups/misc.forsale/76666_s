 	ati vgawonderxl24 -  this is a great card, it supports 1024x768 256 colors, 800x600 32k colors, and 640x480 16 million colors.  i found that it also speed up windows considerably.  i'm asking $100 o.b.o. for this card.
 
 
 	i also have 2 2400 baud modems.  i have docs for both but i don't have the original boxes.  both work fine and i'd like to get $25 each or $40 for both.
