 	my friends and i have a buch of books for sale. they are not
 	being used due to change of job, loss of interest etc.
 
 	rather than letting them gather dust, we would like to pass them
 	on to others who may use them (of course at a price :-)
 
 	topics include:
 	- c/c++/other programming languages
 	- unix/dos/os2/windows/other operating system topics (general)
 	- x/motif/olit/xwin
 	- networking and digital signal processing
 	- computer graphics
 	- microprocessors and computer architecture
 	- math
 	- software engineering/algorithms/software testing
 	- databases
 	- expert systems
 
 	the list is long and rather than posting it here i will email
 	it by request.  i am going to keep the list updated and so will
 	respond to all requests (lucky me :-)
 
 	if you are interested drop me a line
