 i have a $400 credit with northwest airlines which must be used
 by nov 27, 1993. 
 
 there is a $50 charge to change the ticket, so i will sell it for
 $320.  it can be used for any northwest flight, but i don't think
 they will refund cash.
 
 please contact me at tallen@corp.hp.com  or (415)857-5878.
