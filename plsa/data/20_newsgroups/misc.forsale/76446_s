 "bare" means what it says. you get a case, a power supply, and a motherboard
 (with ram and a coprocessor). *everything* else is yours to add as you like.
 
 the case/power supply:
   
      - standard desktop case. 230watt power supply with the usual connectors.
      - room for five floppy/hard drives (three visible, two internal).
 
 the motherboard:
 
     - us-made micronics 8-slot motherboard with intel 386dx/25mhz cpu
     - 64kb sram cache
     - 4mb 80us ram using 4x1mb simms (worth $150 alone)
     - cyrix 83d87 math coprocessor (worth $90 alone)
     - norton si 6.0 rating of 26.1
     - latest version phoenix bios
 
 
 please do not post/email saying "but i can get a taiwanese superclone
 386/90 for only $9.95 including a free toaster!". i am *certain* you can
 find a cheaper brand x board without even breaking a sweat. *new* micronics
 cpus command a several-hundred dollar premium because they are us-made,
 use high-quality components, and are known to be both very reliable and
 compatible. they have been oemed in systems sold by both gateway and
 zeos at various points in the past. (check out the ads in the back pages
 of byte or pc magazine if you want to see this price differential for
 yourself.)
 
 price: $495 complete, $100 less if you don't want/need the case and
 power supply. the board is fully guaranteed. email for further details
 or for any questions.
 
 thanks!
