         -subsonic filter
         -rumble reducer
         -tape monitor
         -amazing real time spectrum analyzer with calibrtated microphone and 
          pink noise generator, calibrated and uncalibrated range adjustment,
          display is calibrated in db and can display the average energy per 
          band, or the average for the full speactrum(great for checking how 
          loud your system is)
         -the display action has two speed settings to adjust how quickly the 
          display responds to transients
  this is one of the best equilizers around.  it is very quiet, and the display
 is fascinating to watch.  it sells for $400-$450 in stores, so i will sell it
 for -$315 obo
