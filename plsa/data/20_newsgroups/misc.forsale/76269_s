 comments:
 
         purchased locally at micro center in columbus, oh 7 months ago.  all
 	original packaging, receipts, and manuals are included.   under
         warranty.   the keyboard on this machine is the best i've seen; i
 	prefer it to the keyboard on most desktop units. i typically
         get 3-4 hours of battery life.  the battery recharges in 2 hours to 
         full charge.   the machine is quite speedy; i run os/2 2.1beta
 	on it currently and will leave this operating system installed unless
 	you prefer ms-dos 5.0 (included).
    
         i'll include a padded carrying case, also made by toshiba.
 
 price/terms:
 
 	$1900 (semi-firm), certified check.    if outside of columbus, i will
 	pay for cod shipping.
