 
         smith corona typewriter for sale,
 
         model scm 70 electric.
 
 great for forms, envelopes, labels, small things, etc. that you just
 can't do with your microcomputer.
 
 built like a tank, but not big nor that heavy.  a classic compact
 electric, with padded storage bag.  no scratches, enamel paint chips
 or dents.  cloth ribbon, 2 colours.  will accept best offer near $70.
 
 (selling for a friend, so these are her instructions not mine.
 rsvp to this account, though.  make any other offers anyways,
 i'll pass them along.  a single sheet-feeder for the macintosh
 imagewriter ii would be acceptable in trade, for example.)
