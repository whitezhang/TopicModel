 
 
 since i have some free time while looking for a job i thought 
 i would offer linux on disk and tape for those who need it.
 
 
 note: i am offering this service for experienced users who 
 require no support.  simply put i am just a disk shuffler.  if 
 you think you will need support i highly recommend  
 softlanding linux system (sls) directly.  they provide an
 excellent product at a decent price with support.
 
 i am the lazy mans service, for those who don't want to spend 
 4 hours on the modem and 2 hours shuffling floppies.  and 
 those who don't need sls support and opt to go it alone.
