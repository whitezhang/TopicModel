 there are many people want to buy my kodak autofocus carousel projectors
 but i don't have lenses or remote to sell.  they prefer to buy a projector
 with all accessaries.  so i have to post another news asking for lenses
 to fit those kodak slide projectors:
 
 i am willing to give away singer caramate ii or singer caramete sp (
 w/ built-in unremovable lens, built-in casette player, speaker, new 500 hr
 bulb) try to trade for kodak projector lenses.
 
 each projector (viewer) will equal trade for 1 or 2 kodak projector lenses
 depend on the focal length.  i will pay for the shipping for singer 
 projector (viewer).
 
 since i don't need those singer projectors, if you have some 35mm slr system
 you don't need, i am willing to do the trade as well.
