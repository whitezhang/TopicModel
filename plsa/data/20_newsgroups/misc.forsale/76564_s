 i have this kit which includes the following :
 
 1)	82c84a/82c84a-5
 	chmos clock generator and driver
 	for 8086,80c88 processors
 2)	27c64/87c64
 	64k(8kx8) chmos uv erasable prom
 3)	51c259l
 	low power 64k x 4
 	chmos dynamic ram
 4)	82c59a-2
 	chmos programmable interrupt controller
 5)	82c88
 	chmos bus controller
 	fro 80c86,80c88 processors
 6)	80c88/80c88-2
 	8-bit chmos microprocessor
 7)	82c55a
 	chmos programmable peripheral interface
 8)	82c54
 	chmos programmable interval timer
 9)	82c08
 	chmos dynamic ram controller
 
 all these are chips with complete manual in a box. i don't know whether they
 still work or not, and i don't really know what they are. 
 
 so this is mainly for those who knows what this is and have use of it 
 (probably ee stuff since this used to belong to a ee student)
 
 anyone interested, please make me an offer.
