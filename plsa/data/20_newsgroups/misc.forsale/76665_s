 
 i have an 8000s i'd like to sell.  now that i'm finished with my taing,
 i don't have nearly as many appoints to miss, and i'd like to put the
 money toward a laptop.
 
 asking $200.  i bought it last christmas.  it's in great shape and
 includes (as an added bonus!) a nice, padded leather carrying case.
