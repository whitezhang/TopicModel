 
    is there anyone out there with a copy of the driver for turtle
 beach's samplevision program that allows you to use a always tech
 in-2000 scsi card to do smdi dumps between your pc and your
 peavey dpm-sp / sx / sx2 ???  
 
    this is normally only available directly from turtle beach but i
 was just wondering if there was someone who got it and couldn't
 find a use for it..
 
    if you have a copy let me know!
