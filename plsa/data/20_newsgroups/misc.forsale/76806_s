 subject: cdtv, accessories, 1084s monitor.
 
 because of the 'questionable' bids being placed for the set-up, i am
 including some 'guideline' prices in this repost. negotiable, of course.
 
 in anticipation of the arrival of my new computer system, i am
 selling my cdtv and accessories.  i am in no rush to sell this
 so if you don't have the money now, but may be able to get it in
 a few weeks, make a bid and let me know.
 
 i am now willing to sell the pieces separately, but i will wait to sell
 until they are all accounted for (at least cdtv and keyboard kit)
 i will sell the monitor separately.
 
 cdtv  (6 months old. mint condition. comes with all documentation,
       packaging, receipt, etc, all in mint condition. demo disc.)
       ----->i will start bidding at $375 for this
 
 cdtv keyboard package [keyboard, mouse, 3.5" drive] (comes with all
       documention, packaging, receipt etc. 6 months old. mint
       turns your cdtv into a full fledged amiga 500 computer!)
       ----->i will start bidding at $125 for this
 
 1084s monitor (a couple years old. very good condition. comes with
        all documentation, packaging, and receipt if i can find it.)

 software (various titles...games, demos, etc. note: i have no cdtv
