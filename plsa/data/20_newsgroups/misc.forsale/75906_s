 
 wanted:  color monitor >= 14"  suitable for use on a macintosh
 centris 610.  i am planning on purchasing one of these machines
 soon and don't want to have to pay full price for a new monitor
 when a used one will do me just as well.  if you have one you'd
 like to part with, please email me with the specs and price.
 
 thanks.
