 mind my asking why you're selling a used machine with a damaged
 keyboard for the about the same price as a brand new a4000/030
 (a4000-ec030/4 megs/120meg ide hd/hd floppy/v3.0 os - $1899)?
 
 i'd like to get an a3000 locally for something reasonable like less
 than 1k without monitor.  brand new the a3000-25mhz/50 meg hd/hd
 floppy/2.1 rom isn't running for more than $1400 or so.
 
 considering it's damaged, probabably has a real old version of the os
 i'll offer $700.  don't laugh...my a2000 isn't worth more than
 $250-$300 these days.
