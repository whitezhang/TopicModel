 i have an unopened cd called "bird-the original recordings of charlie
 parker"  it has on it, among others: miles davis, dizzy gillespie,
 red rodney, thelonious monk, and lester young.
 i would be willing to sell it to the highest bidder, or else to trade
 it for another jazz cd that i would be interested in.
