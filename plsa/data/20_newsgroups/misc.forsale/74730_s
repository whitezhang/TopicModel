 i have one round-trip ticket good for travel between usa or canada and
 europe, hawaii, latin america, or the caribbean.  it is fully transferable 
 and can be used originating here or there.
 
 i had intended  to use it to visit my grandfather who was sick, but he died 
 before i got there so i have no use for it now.
 
 i'm looking for $500 or best offer, but act fast it will be gone on april 15
 no matter what.
