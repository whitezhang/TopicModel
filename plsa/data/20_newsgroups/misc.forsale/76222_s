 oh no!  someone is provided useful information and mentioned that they
 made money in the field.  don't they know that usenet is reserved for
 uninformed speculation by people trying to sell their personal stuff
 (from houses to dead pcs) at a huge markup/trying to unload stuff they
 bought from their company at just under retail, and other
 "non-commercial" activities.

 the net is not "supposed" to be a dumping ground for free ads, but
 reserving it for tripe doesn't seem to be a significant improvement.

 so?  either they target it well enough to pay for it, in other words,
 they manage to send it to people who want the stuff (in which case it
 is junk only for the "rest" and the transaction costs are borne
 appropriately in this case) or they go bankrupt.  seems fair to me.

 you could hold your breath.  you could kill offending messages as
 they come onto your machine and refuse to send them any further,
 but not until you turn blue.
