 i was my understanding that the purpose of those removeable-front-panels
 were to make the radio useless, and thus discourage theft (that is if the 
 cover were removed by the owner and taken along whenever the car was left.)
 
 if those covers were sold for anything remarkably less than the radio 
 originally costs, or even sold at all,
 then the above discouragement wouldn't be so great.
 
 i personally would be unhappy, if i bought a radio like that, thinking that 
 removing the cover greatly depreciated the radio's value, and the covers were
 sold by the company (or other legitimate source) cheaply.
