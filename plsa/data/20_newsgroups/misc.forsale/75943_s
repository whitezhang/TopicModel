 i need some used scanners.  i'm limiting my selection to hp models
 with document feeders.  i think this means the scanjet plus and the
 scanjet iic.
 
 so...if you have one of these and want to sell it, please tell me.

 p.s.  i need only one with a mac interface; the others are for ibm-pc
 compatibles.
