 i need to sell two pairs of bladerunner in-line skates (we don't use them).
 one is size 9 and one is size 12.  they are less than a year old and were
 used very little, generally in the corridor.  they are in very good
 condition.
 
 they sell at lechmere for $99.98 (we still have the boxes, if you want
 them) and we'd like to get $85/obo for them.  please respond by
 e-mail.
