 dear fellow usenet users:
 
 	i would like to give a formal apology for posting an advertisement 
 about my printing business.  i did not intend this to be an advertisement, 
 but rather an offer for people on the usenet, many of whom use printing
 on a regular basis.  i was not aware that this is not "legal" on the usenet.
 i am only trying to put myself through college.  for those of you who
 requested information, i will write to you privately.  for those of you who 
 are having fun flooding my mailbox, i think you can grow up.  to offer advice
 is one thing, but to use profanity toward me is another.
 
 thank you,
