 
 i have a sherwood stereo receiver which i received as a gift, and would
 like to sell, as i already own a system.  it is the sherwood model rx-4010r
 it is brand new, still factory sealed.  this is a high quality surround-
 sound amp ( 160 watts, 250 watts dynamic headroom power ), very highly
 rated by consumer reports ( march, 1993 ).  has 4 audio inputs, and pre-amp
 and main-amp connection jacks for added flexibility.  includes 2-year
 factory warranty.  comes with remote. 
 
 asking $210
