 	here is your chance to have a full unix system at a small cost:
 
 	i have a full set of unix system for the at&t 6300+ for sale.
 	it is version 2.5 (the latest as far as i know) and 
 	includes all the software (1.2meg 5.25" floppies) and 
 	manuals for:
 		- base os
 		- development tools (c compilers etc...)
 		- dos merge (simultask)
 		- etc.
 
 	(i beleive the software requires a 6300+ and will not work on
 	any other machine)
 
 	i also have a few at&t 6300 and + manuals including the system 
 	programmers guide if anyone is interested.
 
 	drop me a line with your offer if you are interested.
 
 	(please include this message for reference)
