 o lotus 1-2-3 student edition for dos ...................... $10.00
      this does just about everything that standard 1-2-3
      release 2.01 could do, but not as much of it.  worksheet 
      size is limited to 64 columns by 256 rows, there is no
      translation facility (for importing data from other
      packages), and the student edition does not write files 
      that can be accessed by release 2.01.  includes manual,
      original distribution diskettes (5 1/4" - 360k), and key
      board templates.
 
 
 o subaru service manuals ................................... $10.00
      this is not a complete set, but includes sections 4, 5 
      & 6 which cover mechanical components (suspension, wheels 
      & axles, steering, brakes, pedals & control cables, heater 
      & ventilator, air conditioning), body (body & exterior, 
      doors & windows, seats, seat belts, interior, instrument 
      panel), and electrical (engine electrical system, body 
      electrical system, wiring diagram, and trouble-shooting). 
      these are the genuine subaru issue manuals.  they are for 
      model year 1986, but have plenty of good information that 
      applies to other years as well.
 
 
 o miscellaneous darkroom equipment ........................ $75.00
      solar enlarger (several objective lenses) with easel and 
      timer, negative carriers for 35mm and 2 1/4 x 3 1/4, misc.
      printing masks.  developing tanks, thermometer, trays, 
      constant-temperature bath, ground glass, mirrors, darkroom
      lamps, glassware, el-cheap-o tripods..... and (as they say)
                              much   more!
 
 
 o beautiful antique buffet ............................... $1500.00
      solid cherry (no veneer).  handmade, with very interesting
      dovetail corners in the drawers.  built (we think) around 
      1880.  not gaudy or covered with gew-gaws; a simple, elegant 
      piece of furniture, but too big (60" long, 37" tall, 24" 
      deep) for our little cape cod house.
