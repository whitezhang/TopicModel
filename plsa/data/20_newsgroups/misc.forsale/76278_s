 	rated power 20wx4, into 4 ohms from 20-20,000hz @0.5%thd
 	2 ohm stable
         short circuit and overload protected
  
 this is a great little amplifier that i picked up as a demo model at lechmere
 last spring, and never got a chance to install. it's been tested, and it 
 works great...a perfect amplifier for adding 4-speaker power to a system, or 
 for powering mids or tweets...whatever. mounted on a board, complete with a 
 rs 15 amp noise filter, with all connections made to barrier strips for easy 
 screw-type contacts. lists new in crutchfield for $129, am asking 
 			$75 o.b.o complete
 
 
 2) sony electronic crossover (model xec-500)
 	freq response 5-100,000 hz (+0,-3 db)
 	s/n ratio 105 db (a wtd.)
 	high pass x-over @flat,80,120,180 hz (12db/octave)
 	low pas x-over @50,80,120,180 hz (18db/octave)
 	1/2 din size for in-dash installation in many cars!
 
 this to,l is an exceptional unit which i found extremely useful  back in the 
 days when i had a car to put a stereo in. two sets of rca-type inputs (f/r), and three sets of outputs (f/r/sub) each output with seperate level control. 
 variable low boost control (+10 db@40 hz) for extending low bass, and seperate high and low pass crossover points make this a great unit for anybody who's 
 interested in building a sub/satellite type system 
 	
 	used with orig. box&papers $130 o.b.o
 	 
 
 both units work flawlessly, and are in excellent shape cosmtically (ie no 
 scratches, etc.) anyone who is interested, please respond to

 i'll sell the amp with th x-over for $175 or so...thanks
