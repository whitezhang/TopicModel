 
 a very good r&b group came out in 1988 called the pasadenas.  i bought their
 cassette single and fell in love with it.  i've tried to find their lp
 or cd but have had no success whatsoever.  just wondering whether anyone
 out in netland had heard of them....
 
 their song that hit the charts was called tribute...
 
 
 thanks!
