 i have the following items for sale.
 
 rabbit pip tuner
 soloflex-like gym
 scanner (800 mhz)
 cb antenna
 blazer/jimmy running boards
 
 ----
 rabbit pip (picture-in-picture) box.
 
 this device when used with a vcr tuner will allow you to
 have a second channel popped up on any corner of the screen.
 the you can press swap on the remote and the small picture
 will be swapped with the main picture.
 
 the only limitation to this box is that it is has 36 channel
 tuner. this means that the box itself cannot tune higher
 than cable channel 36. however, if your vcr tuner is capable
 of tuning higher than this, then you simply tune the vcr to the
 channel desired and then swap pictures (assuming the alternate
 picture is channel 36 or lower) and it will work fine.
 
 original cost: $149
 will sell for:  $75
