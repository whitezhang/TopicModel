 i have a urei 527a 27-band (mono) equilizer for sale.  anyone who knows
 this unit knows it's been a recording studio standard for years.  it's a
 pretty straightforward unit, with balanced ins and outs.  power supply caps
 were recently replaced, and i added xlr connectors (which can be easily
 removed if you prefer, as i mounted them on a bracket outside the case). 
 the unit is in good shape, and is sonically very clean.
 
 i'm asking $225 + ups shipping.  they're going for $250 generally.  make me
 an offer.
