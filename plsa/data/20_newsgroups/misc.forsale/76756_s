 i have the following cd's that i'd like to sell:
 
 	m.o.d.  	gross misconduct
 	metal giants	(at early metal compilation including aerosmith,				mountain, blue oyster cult, judus priest, etc.)
 	metal church 	blessings in disguise (excellent)
 	slayer 		hell awaits
 	anthrax 	among the living
 	whiplash	power and pain
 	dream theater	images and words (pull me under)
 	exodus		fabulous disaster (heavy)
 	death angel 	the ultra violence  (hard to find)
 
 all cd's are in excellent condition (no scratches or skips).   after
 checking several similar articles, it seems the going rate is $8.  hence
 cd's are $8.00 postage paid.  please e-mail me if you are interested,
 as i rarely read these groups.  i'll ship asap after receiving cash, check
 or money order.  e-mail me for my snail-mail address.
