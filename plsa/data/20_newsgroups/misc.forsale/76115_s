 	however, thad, you should note that he said that he would like to
 use it on a 'pc', not 'unix-pc'.  also note the strange cross-posting (as he
 probably did not), so it is not sure exactly what sort of machine he intends
 to mount it on.  if it *is* a pc (or clone), then the "2c" jumper would be
 the correct choice.
 
 	i've left the cross-posting in effect, since i'm not sure which
 newsgroup he would really be reading this in. :-)
 
 	don.
