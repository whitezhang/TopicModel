 #according to reports, if you don't have dos yet, and don't have any

 	imho, it seems to be worth the $40 to upgrade.  doublespace seems a bit 
 saner than stacker 2.0 (which i've replaced).  memmaker is nowhere near as 
 aggressive as qemm, but it doesn't hose my system like qemm did (at least
 it hasn't yet).  microsoft antivirus is just the latest version (or a 
 reasonably recent one) of cpav - mine was very aged, so this was quite welcome.
 
  	ms-dos 6.0 ain't the end all, be all of operating systems - but it's
 better than a sharp stick in the eye, unless you happen to be into that sort 
 of thing.  :-)
