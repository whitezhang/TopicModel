 
 hi,
 
 	i have a humminbird hdr200 depth sounder for sale. it
 has been used for 1 season on my sailboat. 
 	
 	all parts are included as well as the installation
 instructions. it is even packed in the original box it came in. there
 is no damage to the unit or the transducer. in fact, the transducer
 was mounted *inside* the hull in a piece of pipe glued to the hull.
 so it led a "sheltered" life. the transducer can be mounted either inside
 the hull as i did, or on the transom. it cannot be placed in a hole
 drilled into your hull.
 
 	it is fully waterproof and fits into a 2" hole in a bulkhead
 (that's where i had it installed) or into a standard dashboard on a
 powerboat. it reads depth to 199' and has a backlit lcd display. it has
 an adjustable shallow water alarm built in. 
 
 	i am changing out my instruments to another manufacturer that
 outputs the nmea 0183 information. this little depth sounder works fine
 and is very stable.
 
 
 	it is usually priced as low as 130$ in some catalogs, i paid 150$.
 
 
 	the first 80$ takes it, or best offer.
