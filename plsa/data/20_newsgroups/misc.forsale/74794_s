 if anyone's still interested, i have one mattel electronic game left for sale
 or trade. it's baseball (tan case) and includes a 9-volt battery and the
 original manual!  i was able to sell soccer and basketball 2 for $70.00 and
 traded the football game for a genesis cart...  so, i was happy.  i will
 entertain all offers.. cash or genesis carts...  by the way, baseball is in
 excellent condition and works perfectly..
 	
 		thanx in advance,
