 	i have a pair of akg 340s in nearly new condition for sale.  they
 have been used in my studio for mixdown monitoring.  i have the original box.
 the 340s use both an electret element and a dynamic element in each ear cup
 with built-in crossovers.  they have a very smooth frequency response and
 the electrostatic element gives clearer highs.  i am asking $200 for the
 pair.
