 	as a matter of fact d.j., it does make a difference.
 	almost a half million new users joined the internet last year,
 	many of them are commercial businesses. the ban on commercial
 	use of internet is no more.
 
 	one should have the breeding not to post commercial material
 	on an account provided by ones employer or school, unless the
 	provider of such account gives permission. (ha!)
 
 	those of us who pay for internet access are constrained only
 	by our innate good taste and no have no "administrator" to 
 	guide(?) us.
