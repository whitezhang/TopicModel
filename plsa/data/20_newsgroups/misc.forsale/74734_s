 i need to sell this pronto to get a car (my engine locked up)!
 machine runs great... only used in my house.  has been covered when
 not in use on the days i wasn't around.
 
 $2,300 including federal express second day air, or best offer, cod to
 your doorstep (within continental us)!!  i need to sell this now, so
 if you don't agree with the price, make an offer, but within reason.
 ;)
 
 thanks,
