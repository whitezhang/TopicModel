   if the relief pitcher didn't get 8 pitches, there wouldn't be enough time
 to:
 
   1) play "hit the road jack"
   2) the iron city relief pitcher commercial
   3) the announcers to detail to us exactly what drove the 
       previous one from the game
   4) a detailed biography, both personal and statistical, of the 
       new guy throwing his 8 pitches.
   5) get really cool super-slo-mo pictures for diamond vision to put up
       by said pitchers name and stats!
