 methinks you recall wrong. mitchell hit close to .300 in atlanta and 
 continued to walk alot after his promotion. he was then (i think) left
 off the playoff roster, and started the next year in the minors where
 even the braves will tell you he underperformed because he was so mad
 at going back down. 
 
 he struggled last year, no doubt, but even the braves blamed part of it
 on the demotion. i'd much rather have mitchell than say mark whiten on
 the cards.
