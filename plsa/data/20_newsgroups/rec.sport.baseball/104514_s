 boy, hats off to any cubs fan who can actually muster up the courage to put
 down braves fans.  i mean, all the braves have done is gone to two consecutive
 world series.  also, being the cubs fan that i am, i really have to hand it to
 all the braves fans out there that are capable of driving me crazy with that
 infernal cheer that they have.  
 
 however, i do have to protest anyone saying that all cubs fans are stupid.  the
 way i see it, either i'm just too stupid to acknowledge it, or that observation
 was just plain wrong.  you might have us confused with bear fans. ;)
 
 anyway, about a two weeks ago just about everyone was saying that the cubs
 would finish up last in their division.  (even behind florida?!?  sheesh!)  
 these same people were predicting the braves to clean up in their respective
 division.  well,  we're ten games into the season and these people are a little
 less vocal now.  i wonder why.
 
 well, the way i see it, the east is up for grabs, and whoever wants it most is
 going to take it, with the exception of florida.  every team seems to have
 good batting and pitching, with philly presently leading the pack.  but, i just
 have to point out, if the cubs do take the east, they'll do it without the
 benefit of a competent manager.  however, and it pains me to say it, the
 pennant is going to go to the west.
 
 just had to get that off my chest.
