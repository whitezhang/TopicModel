 subject sez it...
 
 wondering if either team are in town that weekend (5-30/5-31).
 
 i can probably get phillies tix, as the vet can hold a bunch (and
 i hope they're still in 1st but it's late may, and...).  camden
 yards is a problem - is there any way of getting in the park w/o an sro
 ticket?  any advice if there at home?
