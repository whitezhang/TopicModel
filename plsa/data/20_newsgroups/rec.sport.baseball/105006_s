 right.  so who cares which player gets credited, as long as the team
 gets more runs?  if a player helps the team get more r and rbi, but 
 doesn't score them all himself, who cares?
 
 consider:
 
 player a: single.
 player b: grounder to short; reaches on the force at 2nd.
 player c: double, b to 3rd.
 player d: sac fly.
 
 b gets a run, d gets an rbi.  are you *sure* they helped the team
 more than a and c?  think hard, now.
