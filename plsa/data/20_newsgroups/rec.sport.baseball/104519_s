 one of the chapters in palmer and thorn's 'hidden game' is titled
 'pitching is 44% of baseball,' implying that fielding is 6%.  how do
 they determine that?  beats me -- it's been a long, long time since i
 read it.
 
 one also has to separate offense into batting and baserunning, with the
 split probably somewhere around 49.5% and 0.5%.
