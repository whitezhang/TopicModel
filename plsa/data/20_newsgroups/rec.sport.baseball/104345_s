 it's not a cliche, and (unlike your comments below) it's not a tautology.
 it needn't have been true.  if every pitcher in baseball were essentially
 the same in quality (i.e. if the variance of pitching ability were much
 smaller than the variance of batting ability), then scoring runs would be
 much more important than preventing them, simply because the *ability* to
 actively prevent runs would be much weaker.

 if that's your point, you should have said so.  what you in fact said was
 "pitching and defense win championships", and later "pitching is the essence
 of baseball".  neither of which says what you are now claiming was "your 
 point", and neither of which is true.

 and you accuse sherri of mouthing cliches!?

 it's not clear to me at all that this is true.  in high-scoring games, the
 team with the better offense wins a high percentage of the time.  in low-
 scoring games, the split is essentially 50/50 regardless of team ability.

 i thought you said "pitching and defense win championships" and "pitching is
 the essence of baseball".
