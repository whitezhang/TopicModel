 am i supposed to take that as a compliment or a put down? just wondering.
 i do this as a service to the entire baseball world on usenet, especially
 for those in the east coast who can't get final scores for west coast games
 in their newspapers or late tv newscasts. this is helpful to fans in other
 countries who either receive only weekly scores or updates by the week. also,
 many have requested for this kind of service previously but it was only
 available through bbs's or some pay news services. by the way, mine is free
 of charge and has no copyright restrictions.

 >and use that.
 
 remember i only post final scores and the updated standings once a day to the
 rec.sport.baseball newsgroup. other than that, everything is done through
 private e-mail. currently, there are 986 people on my mailing list that
 branches off into other mailing lists available for many others. and the list
 grows by an average of 35 people a day.
 
 if people on usenet really don't want to see the postings i do to
 rec.sport.baseball on a daily basis, please just let me know. if the response
 is overwhelming against the posts, i won't do it anymore. 
 
 thanks for your time.
