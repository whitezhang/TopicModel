 batting 4th for the giants behind will clark.  barry is such an awesome and
 consistent hitter -- definitely the best in the national league.  imho, to 
 have williams, a streaky hitter (and not really a clutch hitter) batting
 4th ahead of bonds is simply an injustice to the giants and fans of the
 giants.
