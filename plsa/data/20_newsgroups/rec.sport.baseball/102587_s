 add mike trombley in there somewhere, since they need five people.  mark
 guthrie will remain in the bullpen as the long lefty.

 pags and terry jorgenson will platoon at third, with reboulet as the
 backup infielder.  pags looked pretty miserable yesterday for a guy who
 lead the league in da in 1991, muffing what should be routine grounders
 (heck, muffing a grounder *i* would probably have gotten to).  jorgenson
 did nothing exceptional that i noticed.  leius missed a ball i *think*
 gagne would have reached; we will certainly miss gag's glove this season.

 he looked pretty good there.  contrary to what the mediots have been saying,
 he looked reasonable at first.  he isn't mid-80s hrbek, but then neither is
 the pretty big guy himself any more (note:  i'm used to seeing the twins
 1b looking kinda big on the field, but not that big!).  if he hits vaguely
 like last year, he's a perfectly good first baseman.
 
 note:  much of this posting is from personal observation yesterday in a game
 where the regulars were mostly pulled after several innings.  winfield may
 have big holes in his defensive game that didn't show up (he didn't have to
 pick any bad throws, for example), but i'll take what i saw so far.
