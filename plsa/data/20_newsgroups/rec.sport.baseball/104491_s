 no, currently there's no room for him in the rotation.  key is having
 a most impressive april.  abbott is pitching well.  perez is back.
 wickman has pitched his way into the rotation, and is holding his spot
 with an outstanding performance his last time out.  and kamieniecki
 isn't doing too poorly himself.
 
 if the yankees find themselves in need of a starter, militello will
 get another chance.  until then, he'll have to wait in line.
