 let's be careful here.  if players' performance was completely random
 in (clutch-no clutch), then you would still expect some players to be
 good in the clutch every year and some to be not-so-good every year.
 with two years worth of data, you'd have 1/4 of the players good each
 year, 1/4 bad each year, and 1/2 would have one good and one bad year.
 we have 96 players for 5 years ('84-'88).  just flipping a coin, you'd
 expect 3 players to be good all 5 years and 3 to be bad every year.
 this is what we actually get--
 
 no. of good years    0    1    2    3    4    5
 clutch performers    4   10   37   24   18    3
 coin flip (random)   3   15   30   30   15    3
 
 essentially the distribution of clutch performers by number of years
 of good performance is the same as what you would get if the process
 leading to deviations from non-clutch performance was completely random.
 if there was anything to clutch hitting (at least in this definition)
 that had any predictive capability, you expect to see the number of
 players at the ends to be much larger than that predicted by flipping
 a coin.  further, if you limit yourself to players who were a lot above
 or below average in clutch situations (say, 1 standard deviation from 
 the mean) more than one year, the random explanation still looks good.
 in the four years ('84-'87) that i looked at the data from elias, there
 were 79 (29) players with a minimum of 25 (50) at bats in clutch 
 situations that were 1 sigma from the mean two different years.  of
 those 79 (29) players, 38 (14) of them changed sign between the two
 years.  in other words, they were great clutch hitters one year and
 really horrible the other year.  if it was just a random process, 
 you'd expect those numbers to be 39.5 (14.5).  
 
 everything that's been measured about clutch hitting over a period
 of years that could be used to predict any ability with any 
 proposed definition has looked like a random process (with the 
 caveat that there may be something related to platoon advantage
 that could be dragged out of the data--e.g., john lowenstein 
 probably never had a "clutch" ab against a left-handed pitcher,
 but he might well have had some in blowouts, so that there would
 be a bias since his clutch abs would be more geared to his 
 platoon advantage).  this is not a subject that has been glanced
 at casually.  a lot of people have put a lot of effort into 
 studying it and every one of them, with the exception of the
 elias study, has been unable to find anything that would allow
 you to predict how someone will do in clutch situations better
 than flipping a coin.  (self-serving plug follows:  some of the
 flaws in the elias study are discussed in my paper in the forth-
 coming sabr book, _the perfect game_, by taylor publishing.  the
 authors are supposed to get a slice of the advance, so go bug
 your local bookstores now, and maybe i can get enough to take my
 wife to dinner once.:-)
