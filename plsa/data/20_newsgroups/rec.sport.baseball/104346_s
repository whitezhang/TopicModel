 uh, right.  you also forgot that you can't get an rbi (barring a hr) with
 nobody on base.  what fraction of all runs come on solo hr?
 
 most runs are scored because there happened to be players on base when the
 batter did something good.  i use the phrase "happened to be" advisedly.
 lots of people have tried to figure out who the players are who have the
 most ability to "turn it up a notch" in clutch/rbi/whatever situations, and
 what they've found is that there is no evidence that *anyone* has such an
 ability to any measurable extent.  there are no clutch hitters.  people who
 tend to do things that *would* cause an rbi if there were somebody on base
 end up getting rbis proportional to how many of their teammates obliged by
 being in position.  
 
 >my mistake.
 
 i agree.
