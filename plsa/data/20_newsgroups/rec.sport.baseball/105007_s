 i have lived in the boston area for 15 years now.  they have been talking
 about a new boston garden (hockey/basketball) since i've lived here.  one
 day the "last hurdle" has been overcome, and the next day there's a new
 hurdle.  fans have been grumbling about foxboro stadium (or whatever it's
 called this year) for nearly as long, but there are only preliminary
 proposals for a new stadium.  local politics prevents anything from being
 done in a timely fashion.  there will not be a new ballpark in my
 lifetime.
