 a lot of teams carry 3 catchers on their 25 man roster,
 but the 3rd catcher is seldom ever used.  he is only
 insurance in case of extra innings or the 2nd catcher
 is injured during a game.     so to free up this roster
 spot for an extra pinch hitter or reliever, why not
 invoke a catcher re-substitution rule:
 
 if the last roster catcher on a team is
 injured during a game, the team is permitted
 to substitute in his place for defensive purposes
 a catcher who has previously been yanked from
 the game.   
 
 given this rule, a team wouldn't need 3 roster
 catchers.  the 3rd catcher could be playing
 in aaa or be a non-roster bullpen catcher.
