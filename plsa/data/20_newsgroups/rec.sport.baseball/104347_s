 geez, dal must have slipped something into ted's drink sometime.  comparing
 prince to pagnozzi offensively is laughable.  prince has never hit well in
 the minors and he's now 27 years old, i think.  pagnozzi was not a bad hitter
 in the minors.  (i'll bring in the numbers tomorrow assuming i don't have
 another brain cramp and forget.)  he had a very good year at louisville 
 before coming up to the majors.  as i recall, the hype on pagnozzi coming up
 in the organization was good hit, decent fielding.  when he got to the 
 majors and didn't hit as well as expected (not as much playing time?), he 
 became exhibit 312 in nichols' law of catcher defense and got the reputation

 no power, less-than-league-average walks, peak year when he turned 28, 
 now declining.  if ted is going to invoke pagnozzi as a model for prince,
 given that prince has underperformed pagnozzi in the minors, it's not
 a rosy picture.
 
 btw, i'm still unhappy with moving zeile, who had the same reputation 
 coming up in the cardinal organization as pagnozzi, except that he was
 a much, much better hitter, to 3rd where he could be an average hitter
 and a below average fielder instead of a well-above average hitter
 as an average (or below average) fielding catcher.
