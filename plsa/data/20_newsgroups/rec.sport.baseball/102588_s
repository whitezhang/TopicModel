 i've been locked in a small closet chained to a lab bench for the last week or
 two without access to really important information.  i saw the 3.5 million
 shoulder back on the dl--how long is he out for (i.e. how many millions/inning
 will he get this year?)  nothing personal against higuera mind you, just
 wondering how bud can keep coffing up money for him when he lets current
 big producers go over a relative pittance. (please realize the term 
 "relative pittance" can only be used with sarcasm when discussing baseball
 salaries.)
 
 additional questions:  i did'nt get to see bones pitch this spring--how is
 he looking and where is he going to fit in the rotation?
 
 how is surhoff shaping up defensively at third?
 
 are they going to build a new stadium?  when?
 
 tom
