 i'd be willing to make two wagers:
 1) snow doesn't win roy.
 2) mattingly is out of baseball within five years.
 
 i'm skeptical of the first, because i don't think snow is that good a
 player, and he is on a losing team.
 
 i'm skeptical of the second because of his back.  mattingly is 32 this
 year, and how many players play until they are 40?  not too many, and
 most of them didn't have chronic back problems when they were 32.
 
 could be wrong on either or both, but i think that's the smart way to
 bet...
