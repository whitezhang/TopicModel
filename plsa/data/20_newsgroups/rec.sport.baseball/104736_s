 well, it looks like, just as doug trumped tim, beating him to the net
 with his defensive analyses, so tim has gotten in ahead of me.
 
 the way i was doing it was a little different. being me, of course, i
 used equivalent averages to work out how many runs a player was worth,
 and i calculated both rate of performance (fielding equivalent
 average) and total performance (fielding equivalent runs). but i
 compared, not to the average player, but the replacement player, and
 here's why: because the positional adjustment comes built in to the
 system. in the al of 1992, the average ss is 32.9 runs above
 replacement (rar); cf, 31.6; 2b, 28.8; 3b, 26.3; lf, 26.0; rf, 24.6;
 1b, 16.9. we may quibble with the exact numbers, but the order looks
 substantially right.
 
 in the equivalent average, i have always set league average to .235. i
 had decided in hitting that the replacement level batter has an eqa of
 .180; the name of that replacement level hitter, often as not, is
 "billy ripken". i decided to let the replacement level fielder be the
 same distance from .235 as .180, but in the opposite direction as i
 have set it up; that makes for an eqa of .280. (yes, i can add. runs
 are proportional to eqa squared; the difference between 180 squared
 and 235 squared equals the difference to 279 squared, and i rounded
 off for simplicity). an all-replacement fielding team would have:
 randy milligan at first (.282), willie randolph (.269) at second, leo
 gomez (.279) at third, walt weiss (.269) at short, kevin bass (.271)
 in left, hojo (.257) in center, and eric anthony (.277) in right. ugh.
 
 so, the total number of rar for a player is the sum of his batting and
 fielding rar. i can rate them by total rar, or rar per some number of
 batting outs, like 400. an average player has a total rar of about 55,
 30 batting, 25 fielding.

 notable entries in a per-400 batting out rating, nl: top 7 are bonds,
 177, lf; sandberg, 130, 2b; van slyke, 114, cf; grace, 107, 1b;
 larkin, 102, ss; justice, 99, rf; sheffield, 99, 3b. one at each
 position measured! mcgriff, despite +85 batting rar, fifth in league,
 finishes out of the top 20 due to a -13 in fielding. last by position: 
 galarraga 39, stillwell -10, hansen 30, belliard 30 (blauser gad a 69,
 3rd in league), may 43, dascenzo 34, anthony 38.
 
 in the al, much-maligned rickey henderson was worth 120, second only
 to frank thomas' 124; ventura edges edgar at third, 116-111; grebeck
 rates a potent 102!; griffey edges puckett as top cf, 93-90; listach
 nudges out lofton among rookies, 82-80. and alomar clearly outpoints
 baerga, 97-73. last by position: segui 10, sojo 29, palmer 22, lewis
 31, polonia 40, cuyler 26, v. hayes 39.
 
 all for now.
