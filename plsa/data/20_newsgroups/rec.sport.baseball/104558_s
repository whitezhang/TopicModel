 in a philadelphia inquirer a few days ago, it was reported that there were
 two (2) plans for a new phillies stadium:  the already-mentioned 30th
 street station proposal, and a location near broad street and race street,
 i think.  i can't remember the exact details, but the stadium would be
 build practically downtown.  there is a small lot that could be used,
 according to the paper.  the 30th street plan has run into some trouble,
 because amtrak does not want to reroute some of its lines in order to
 accomodate the stadium.  i don't have an opinion just yet, just letting
 everyone know that there are really two options being discussed right now.
 neither of these plans will be put into effect very soon, however, because
 nobody wants to pay for it :-)
