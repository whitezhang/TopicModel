 one last infield fly question that has always puzzled me and hasn't
 yet been addressed.  i believe the rule also does *not* deal with this
 situation:
 
 if infield fly is declared and the ball is caught, runners can tag up
 and advance at their own risk, as on any fly ball.
 
 however, if the infield fly is *not* caught, at what point can a
 runner legally leave his base w/o fear of being doubled off for
 advancing too early?  when the
 ball hits the ground?  when a fielder first touches the ball after it
 hits the ground?
 
 enlightenment would be appreciated.
