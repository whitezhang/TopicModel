 	usually one or two teams changes their logo or a minor
 uniform change per season, but the past few seasons have been
 incredible.
 	any thoughts on the new (old) reds uniforms.  i
 remember seeing a pete rose rookie card, and unless i miss my
 guess he was wearing the exact same duds.  
 	the mets (how about doc's performance today?!!!!!) have
 reinserted the mets patch on the shoulder, and changed the mets
 insgnia on the front of the jersey.  to my knowledge it is the
 first time that has been changed since 1962, and it reminds me
 a little of the dodger logo.  
 	many teams have opted for a return to a previous style
 of uniform, or at least uniforms that look more traditional.
 (phillies, reds, expos, white sox, padres, etc.) and the once
 bright colors have been altered to gray.  the trend has also
 seen the newer baseball fields resembling the parks of the
 early years, as opposed to the cookie-cutter saucer stadiums
 construcrted throughout the sixties.
 	with salaries now reaching unbelievable highs, no one
 in the comissioner's office, and inter-league play on the
 horizon, it's nice to see that baseball at least looks like it
 was meant to be.
