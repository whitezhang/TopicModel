 i don't think that it is "obvious" that "lots" of people are willing
 to pay the price.  i'm sure someone out there in net-land has some
 facts about trends in attendance regarding percentage of capacity
 sold.  but even if the trends are relatively flat, you have to consider
 what is happening on a team-by-team basis.
 
 when the tv money dries up, franchises will be seeking to supplant the
 lost revenues from alternative sources.  one of the best sources may
 be ticket sales.
 
 example 1:	the dodgers
 
 	the dodgers can count on a strong base of season ticket sales
 	and *probably* believe that they have the ability to raise
 	prices without hindering revenues.  i certainly think that is
 	true.
 
 example 2:	the padres
 
 	they will be lucky to average 10,000 fans a game this year.
 	if they raise prices, less.  if they want to increase their
 	overall revenue base, the best thing they can do is put a
 	winning team on the field.  but given that won't happen (it
 	won't), they can probably make more money by lowering ticket
 	prices and running frequent promotions.  will they do that?
 	i have no idea.  but they won't increase prices, because it
 	won't work *for them*.

 the only strange powers at work here are the forces of the market place.
 each team's market is somewhat different, and each owner is going to
 be faced with a unique set of circumstances about how to deal with those
 market forces.  as a buiness manager, i would never *want* to lower my
 prices, but sometimes that strategy is necessary, and sometimes it works.
 you have to consider everything if you want continued success.
