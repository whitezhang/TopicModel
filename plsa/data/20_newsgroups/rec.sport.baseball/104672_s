 i need a little help from a texas rangers expert.
 
 i was at yankee stadium sunday (12-2 texas rout) with my kids.  we
 wandered out to the outfield during rangers batting practice and
 i caught a ball tossed into the stands (actually wrestled some guy
 a bit, i might add) by #62 on the rangers.  who is he?  looked like
 a bullpen assistant type, youngish i think.  he was not in the
 roster listed in the yankee scorecard.  any ideas?
 
 please e-mail as i haven't been reading r.s.b regularly.
 
 thanks.
 - bob
