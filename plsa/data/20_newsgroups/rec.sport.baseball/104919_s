 actually, gaetti's first year with california was 1991.  his .632 da wasn't
 out of line with his career averages, and his .616 was actually below average
 in 1988.  but check out the last three years at the metrodome.
 
 1990
 gaetti  .655
 al avg  .604
 1991
 pags    .744
 leius   .653
 al avg  .620
 1992
 leius   .680
 al avg  .603
 
 for the last three years, the highest das in either league have been posted
 by minnesota players -- three different ones, including one (pags) who was
 mediocre to horrible elsewhere.  that doesn't *prove* a park effect is at
 work, any more than san diego's horrible infield numbers prove a park effect
 is at work.  but it looks like a strong possibility to me.

 and it might even be a nice play to thrid base.
