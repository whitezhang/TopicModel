 to really speed up the game umps need to start calling strikes the way
 they used to.  i'm talking about making the strike zone start at the
 knees and go up to the top of the letters.  forget this "the strike zone
 is in the general area of the groin".  a lot less 3-and-2 counts and a
 quicker game.
