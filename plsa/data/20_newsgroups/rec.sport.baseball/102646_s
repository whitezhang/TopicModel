 you're right: thomas, gonzalez, sheffield, and griffey don't even begin
 to compare with ripken, boggs, and gwynn, so no wonder alomar gets so
 much attention.
 
 sandberg got no attention his rookie year because his rookie year was
 terrible.  so was his sophomore year.
 
 national league pitchers are "much better pitchers"?  that certainly explains
 sheffield's 1993, hm?  are you confusing "have era's that are 0.40 lower
 because they don't face dh's" with "much better"?
