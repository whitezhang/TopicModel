 these people were very silly.  any team that gets to the world series
 can win the world series, and anybody who ever expects a sweep is
 crazy.  if you put the best team in baseball in the series against
 the worst team in baseball, the worst team would win at least a game
 most of the time and very well could win the series, though the odds
 would certainly be against them.
