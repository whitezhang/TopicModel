 was it just me, or did it look like hirschbeck pointed to
 the 3b umpire before calling that strike?  i thought that's
 why gant was asking for the appeal to the 1st base umpire;
 he thought hirschbeck had gotten checked-swing help from the wrong
 umpire.

 after hirschbeck called for the pitch, but before the pitch was thrown,
 cox came onto the field.  it was obvious that he was trying to get time
 called before the pitch, but no one was watching.

 your listing pretty much agreed with what i saw, with the aforementioned
 addendums.  perhaps it appeared differently at the ballpark.  personally,
 i was amazed that gant didn't get ejected.  but that's why cox did;
 it's called protecting your players.
 
 and to those people who would have thrown everyone out of the game,
 all i can say is that you'd be making baseball history.  even in
 the worst baseball brawls, usually only the major instigators are
 ejected, not everyone who comes onto the field.  and i'd have to 
 say that those brawls are considerably more threatening to the game
  than what the braves did fri. night.
 
 anyhow, that's my last two cents on the subject, barring
 outrageous postings.  i will try to keep my eyes open
 for more incidents involving hirschbeck. i think there will
 be some with other teams as well.  i hope not.
