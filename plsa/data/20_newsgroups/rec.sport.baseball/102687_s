 um, surely you didn't intend to compare the '93 reds with the
 29 philidelphia a's.  the yankees were finishing 2nd to
 a team that was as good as the 26-28 yankees, while the
 yankees had aged some from their peak years.  ruth and gehrig
 couldn't play every position simultaneously.
 
 imo, given the various ages of the braves and reds this season,
 that the braves will be closer to their peak, while the reds
 have slightly passed their peak.
 
 also, if you're going to compare braves and yankees, a more appropriate
 comparison to the '93 braves might be the '23 yankees.  
 after falling short two years in a row in exciting world series,
  both teams won/will win the series this year, despite the
 heroics of some old fart on the other team.
