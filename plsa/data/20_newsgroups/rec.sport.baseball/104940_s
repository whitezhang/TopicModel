 stats did a little study in the 1993 scoreboard book entitled "can
 you hit sacrifice flies on purpose?"  a summary of the findings:
 
 over the 5 year period, sac-fly type fly balls were produced 17.6
 percent of the time in situations where a sac fly was useful, and 
 17.7 percent of the time when a sac fly wasn't useful.
 
 they looked at the leaders in sac flies, and found that the leaders
 in sac flies - in other words, the guys you would expect to be good
 at it it - hit sac fly type fly balls only 3% more often when they
 needed to - a difference way too small to be the result of a skill.
 essentially, the players who hit a lot of sac flies seem to do
 so because they hit hit sac fly type flies often, with and without
 a runner on third.
 
 stats concludes "so it appears conclusive that hitters cannot hit
 sacrifice flies on purpose - even if they practice in the batting
 cage."
