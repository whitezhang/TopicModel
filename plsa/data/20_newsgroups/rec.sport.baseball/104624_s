 only joking !!!!! but try to lighten up will ya ? the season's only just 
 started and everyone's apoplectic. if all you statheads out there are trying to
 justify how morris is doing at the moment, just remember that we're talking
 about a very small sample size. there is a helluva long way to go, so sit back
 and enjoy the ride.
