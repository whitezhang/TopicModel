 another word (offense) makes them my pick for last too.
 (well, there's also my policy of never picking a buck rodgers' team for last)

 the 1961 angels were  1/2 game out of 7th. the athletics and 
 expansion senators finished tied for last. 
 the 1962 colt 45's finshed 8th - ahead of the cubs (the mets were last).
 the 1969 royals finshed 4th - ahead of the white sox (the pilots in last).
 the 1977 mariners finished 6th - ahead of the athletics(in last).
 
 apparently being an expansion team with a poor a's or chicago 
 team around is a `good thing'

 this may be an appropriate comparison.
 the 1929-31 yankees finshed 2nd, 3rd and 2nd finshing 
 18, 16 and 13-1/2 games out of first. 
 in 1933,'34 and '35 they also finished second ( though they were only
 7, 7 and 3 games out).
 even great teams can lose - that's why they play the season.
 (on the other hand... i'm still picking the braves to go all the way)

 predictions for '93: marlins: 70 wins, rockies: 50 wins
 and....rockies fans will claim that the offense is adequate.
