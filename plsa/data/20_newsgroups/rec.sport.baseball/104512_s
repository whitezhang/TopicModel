 maybe because baseball is the only business where those who are
 responsible for the fiscal aspects of the game preach gloom and doom. 
 these allegedly intelligent people seem to predict bad times, losing
 money, bankruptcies at an alarming rate, and there's going to be an
 increased degradation of the product they produce.  could you imagine
 ibm, with all their problems, promoting themselves the way major league
 baseball does?  their stock would plummet to unthinkable depths (not
 that they are too far from it now :-).  what would happen at gm?  where
 would gm be if they admitted to cutting corners and producing an
 inferior product because of alleged labor problems? i think it shows a
 lack of confidence for the people who run the game.

 forget it.  word has it three divisions with a wild card is just about
 a done deal.  it has to be decided soon since negotiations with the
 networks also have to begin soon.
