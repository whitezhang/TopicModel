 ok, the mets and o's are good examples, but what about the '90 reds?  do you
 really think that anyone expected them to sweep the a's?  i know people who
 didn't even think they'd win a game, let alone win the series.  we proved 
 them wrong, though, didn't we?
 
 as for this year, ignore their record now.  they've had a rocky start, and
 that has nothing to do with colorado.  they shall rise again.  the hunt for
 a reds' october continues. (with all due respect to wlw)  bye.
