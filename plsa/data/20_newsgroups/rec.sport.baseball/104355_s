 	i wondered the same thing.  but giving joe the benefit of the 
 	doubt, i'd say he was thinking that lankford is hurt enough that
 	he didn't trust his ability to bat effectively but he wants his
 	speed on the bases so pinch run him.  alicea i was completely
 	confused about.  maybe he had a good record hitting against that
 	particular pitcher?  i don't know.  anybody got an idea?

 	well, so far i haven't seen much to say whiten shouldn't be playing
 	but it is too bad that gilkey is the odd man out when they play 
 	jordan ahead of him.  that i don't quite understand.

 	yup, i looked for this on the replay too.  if i'm joe torre, i'm
 	going to have a talk with bucky after the game on that one.  he's
 	got lankford at third with todd zeile i believe - a hot hitter - 
 	coming up - there's no reason to risk giving lankford the go sign 
 	in that situation unless he was sure the ball is going to the stands.  
 	it's his job to watch the play develop - he should have known larkin 
 	was there to back up a bad throw.  that seemed inexcusable in my book.  
 	btw, i saw dent do the same thing last year with zeile rounding third 
 	and going into a sure out at home in a critical situation.  on the 
 	replay, there's dent waving him around.  it looks like this might be a 
 	serious problem.  the card's weren't good base runners at all last year 
 	and i wonder how much of the fault lies in the base coaching.
