 npr this morning had an interview with linda mccarthy (name possibly
 garbled by me), an official historian for the cia.  she has won an emmy
 for research on moe berg for a tv documentary (which i know from nothing
 but which sounds good).  she said that among other things, berg was the 
 principal spy for the oss (cia's wwii precursor) spying on axis atomic
 programs, because of his physics background and language skills.  she said
 that during the war he met with heisenberg in switzerland, and had 
 instructions to shoot heisenberg if the germans were close to us in bomb
 research (he concluded they were two years behind, and didn't shoot him).
 (i have heard elsewhere that heisenberg deliberately misled the nazi bomb
 program, but i don't know how reliable this is.)  unfortunately, npr didn't
 mention any kind of a book she's writing -- i'd certainly buy it.
 
 (in case you're wondering about baseball relevance, berg was a longtime
 mlb backup catcher.  he was a member of an mlb all-star team that toured
 japan in 1934, presumably not because of his baseball prowess but because
 he was one of the few americans, much less mlb players, who spoke japanese.
 photos he took of tokyo on that trip were later used to plan bombing raids,
 according to mccarthy.)
