 the o's just lost to the rangers a few minutes ago i was not too happy about
 the pitching of rick sutcliffe (6 runs in 6 innings, 5 in the 3?) this puts
 me in remembering the 1990 o's season. after '89 we didn't do much over
 winter and we wound up in 5th. now i know that mussina, mcdonald, and rhodes
 are better pitching prospects than ballard and milacki but are any other
 oriole fans scared out there?

 p.s. other scores as of now.
 cincy over montreal, 2-1 i think
 florida is leading la 6-3 in the 8th!
 braves vs. cubs, 1-0 in the 8th. futility of cubs batting haunting them.
 yanks beat the tribe i believe.
