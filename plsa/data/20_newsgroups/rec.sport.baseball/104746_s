 pitchers are required to pitch (or feint or attempt a pick-off)
 within 20 seconds after receiving the ball, not 15.
 
 pitchers are required to pitch their warm-up throws within a
 one minute time frame, beginning after each half inning ends,
 not two minutes.
 
 and the reason why a reliever should be allowed warm-ups is
 simple: different mound, different catcher.
