 indeed, you have struck right at the heart of our disagreement. to 
 rebut my opinion, you have made an analogy with a game of chance.
 your hypothesis assumes that the lotto players have no impact on
 the selection of the numbers, and hence their ability to win.
 
 well, that's certainly true in lotto.  but it has absolutely
 nothing to do with the sport of baseball.  when you start down
 the wrong path, you finish down the wrong path.
 
 
 
 
 
 i repeat.  i do not think that statistical analysis of prior clutch
 hitting performance is an accurate predictor of future clutch hitting
 performance.
 
 i do, however, think that analysis of prior clutch hitting performance
 may, for some players, indicate a deficiency in their game that indeed
 will provide a basis for projecting their particular future performance.
 and i think chris sabo is such a player.
