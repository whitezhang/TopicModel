 last night, boston red sox win its 11 games of 14 games by beating seattle
 5-2.  roger clemson pitch not so dominate.  he walked at least 6 man in
 first 6 inns.  but valetin and greenwell hit homeruns and red sox prevail.
 
 i think that game is must win for red sox in seattle, considering darwin will
 faced seattle ace randy johnson tonight.
