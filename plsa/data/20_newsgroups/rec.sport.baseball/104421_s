 i meant to comment on this at the time.
 
 there's just no way baserunning could be that important - if it was,
 runs created wouldn't be nearly as accurate as it is.  
 
 runs created is usually about 90-95% accurate on a team level, and
 there's a lot more than baserunning that has to account for the
 remaining percent.
