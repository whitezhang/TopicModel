 not bad. we had a similar situation. slowpitch softball, bases loaded,
 weakest hitter at the plate. he hits a line drive over the third
 baseman's head that hooked and hooked and finally landed ten feet in
 foul ground, almost hitting the fence down that side of the field.
 but the umpire called fair ball! i was coaching third, yelling at evrybody 
 to move up a base. the ump's position: "it was still fair when it
 passed third base". 
 why the other team didn't immediately protest i'll never know; we
 certainly weren't going to argue about it, since every body did manage
 to advance one base safely.
 
 there was also the time when a batted ball ricocheted off my (runner
 from second base) leg, fielded by the ss, steps on second to force the
 runner from first, and throw to first in time for what the umpire
 called a triple play; protest removed when we won the game anyway.
