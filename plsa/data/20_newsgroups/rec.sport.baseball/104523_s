 roberts was long gone -- he was probably an oriole in 1964.  or maybe a
 colt .45.  the 3rd starter was art mahaffey, the previous year's ace.
 dennis bennett was the 4th starter.
 
 they were indeed 6.5 up with 12 to go, but they won their final two
 games after the horrid 10-loss streak.  the final game victory
 (bunning's 19th win, if memory serves) kept the reds from tying for the
 title; they and the phils were both 1 game behind the cards, with the
 giants(?) another game back.  the mets couldn't hold an early lead
 against the cards that final sunday, or there would have been a 3-way
 tie.  too bad they couldn't have saved some of the 15 or so runs they
 scored on saturday when they crushed st. louis.
