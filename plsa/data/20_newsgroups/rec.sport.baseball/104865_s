 a) dominican
 b) not all that light-hitting.  .304 lifetime, .315 or so in 1966-73
 when he did most of his playing.  
 c) professional pinch-hitter after that.  yes, that also gives you

 brock, coleman, and wilson were hot-dog basestealers (also lonnie smith);
 that seems to be a special class.  cfs like pettis and wilson also get 
 more of a break, especially if they actually *do* field well.  and brock
 wasn't all that bad a hitter either, not until the end there when he 
 spoiled his ifetime .300 ba.
 
 and again, i suspect thatthe problem is lessening over time.  but if
 you look at the history of the last three decades, there seems to 
 be a clear race-based pattern by which utility players and platoon
 players and lesser talents stayed in the ml far longer if they were
 white.
 
 >cesar cedeno. 
 
 light hitting?  199 hr, .793 lifetime ops mainly with *houston*?
 also latin, btw.
