 currently, he's all over.  he played 2nd when deshields was out.  he was
 shifted to third when delino came back.  and today, he played ss for a cold
 wil cordero.  
 
 his natural positions seem to be in the middle infield, but they will seemingly
 find a spot for himm somewhere as long as his bat is hot.
