 i hesitate to make assumptions about other people when they write, but
 neither of you two *sound* as though you have kids, and you may not have
 spouses either.
 
 consider a night game starting at 7:05 pm est.  (it was 7:35 last year,
 but cleveland showed what i thought was good sense in pushing it back.)
 i go, and i'm into it until 11 pm minimum.  extra innings could put me
 well past midnight.  even without extra innings, if the score is beyond
 2-1 i can't see my family that night at all.  if the next day is a workday,
 i may have to bag that as well.  further, the later the game goes, the
 colder it gets on the shore of lake erie.
 
 all that stuff enters into my consideration of even going to a game.  if
 you say you don't care about whether the game is sped up, impo you are 
 saying you don't care where the time goes, and that the game is for people
 who don't have families and don't have to get up for work the next day.
