 please pardon my ignorance if this is well known, but what is the current

 maybe we could limit the number of throws to first that the pitcher can make,
 and award a balk if he exceeds it.  i'd have another question:  who would 
 operate the pitch clock?  one of the umpires?  add another one to the crew?

 i'm not sure i like this idea.  i think it would severely diminish the 
 number of stolen bases and limit the availability of such neat strategic
 ploys as the hit and run and the squeeze play (one of my personal favorites).

 ahhh!  i suppose i should read the whole article before i hit the 'f' key,
 eh?  obviously, from what i wrote above, i like this idea.

 it may also increase the number of wild throws to the bag, since the 
 pitcher knows he doesn't have very many chances to pick off the runner,
 so he may hurry too much.  i'd rather see runs scored as the result of 
 sound hitting and sound baseball strategy rather than on the sloppiness
 that could result from this kind of rule.  so, i suppose there are some
 disadvantages to that idea too.

 i remember in little league, if when up to bat we stepped out of the batter's
 box, even for a moment, we were automatically out.  that may be a little 
 harsh for the majors, but seriously, how about putting a limit on the 
 batters being able to step out, take several dozen practice swings, pound
 their shoes, scratch their balls, etc.?  maybe forcing them to stay in the
 batter's box wouldn't be such a bad idea.  that could save a few minutes.
