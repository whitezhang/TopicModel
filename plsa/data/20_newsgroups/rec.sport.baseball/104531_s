 this just in...
 
 nolan ryan hurt his right knee in the 4th inning of the rangers-orioles
 game last night.  he'll be having arthoscopic surgery that will, at best,
 keep him on the dl for two to five weeks.
 
 just when i had almost convinced myself that the rangers' rotation would
 stay healthy this year...
