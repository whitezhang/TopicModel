 i grew up listening to harry carey call the cardinals' games and
 really liked him--then. but, as i recall, he was fired because
 he was too critical (read: honest) when he was announcing. he
 dared to point out the cards' miscues and such. at least, this is
 what i remember from when i was a kid.
