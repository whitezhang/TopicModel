 
 	amazingly, pitchers, no matter how good their mechanics, are
 not machines.  cy young winners don't pitch in a vaccuum, unaware
 of how their offenses are doing.
 
 	the braves' pitching staff is already showing signs of
 cracking under the strain of knowing they're not going to get many
 (if any) runs.  unfortunately, the braves' pitchers were so bad for so
 long that the organization put so much stress (and i mean *stress*)
 on pitching that they completely ignored hitting.
 
 	the braves right now are looking woefully similar to the braves of
 the mid-seventies.  heaven help us.
