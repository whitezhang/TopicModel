 i didn't say that pitcher's fear of throwing strikes to guys like
 mcgwire, bonds, and frank thomas was rational.  
 i just said that it exists.

 i don't know alex cole's batting style at all.   some questions:
 how tall is he?
 does he go into a crouch like rickey hederson/pete rose?
 does he foul off a lot of pitches like brett butler?
 does he take 1 or 2 strikes in each at bat?
 
 it could be the cole has a good batting "eye".
 look above, i said that *many* high obp guys draw their walks because
 pitchers are afraid to throw a strike to them, not "all" high obp guys.
