 well, i don't want shorter games *per se*, but i would like for them to stop
 *wasting* so much time during games. the gant incident is a perfect example.
 when a guy comes to the plate, he should be up there to hit, not show off
 (or show up the umpire, which is clearly what gant was doing). i feel like
 writing a fan letter to hirschbeck.

 for purposes of action, nothing is more useful than narrowness of thought
 combined with energy of will.
