 this is a fine strategy if you expect to run away with the division.
 but the giants are going to need every break they can get, if they
 want too hold that lead.  i don't think they can afford to be
 lackadaisical, and say "well it has worked pretty well so far, and
 while we might be able to improve the results, we don't think it is
 worth the risk".
