 maybe i can help you. he's a major league coach with the rockies.
 so above prediction is doubly wrong.
 
 my prediction: the red sox-cubs series and vikings-broncos superbore will
 occur at the end of the world.
 
 and one rockie will finish in the top 10 of an offensive catagory this 
 year.
 
 and no rockie starter will have an era below 3.50.
 
 and the rangers fade will not begin until...august. they'll give way
 to the angels. but still challenge to the end.
 
 really. not making any of this up. if i am, may god strike me down *zzzzzzt*
