 so what will happen when the tv contract runs out, considering networks
 have been losing money on it?  either ticket prices will go up, or someones
 salary will be cut, or perhaps the local community or merchindise could make
 up the difference.  baseball is probably facing a dramatic drop in income
 very soon, and someone will suffer (probably the fans from higher ticket
 prices, but definitely someone).
