 	no way -- gotta be walter johnson.  all were with washington.
 carlton spent too long in st. louis to collect less than 700 there.
 
 >with the rangers, hough was there for a long time.
 
 	i'd also guess hough due to his length of tenure though i suspect 
 bobby witt wasn't far behind.  maybe even jenkins snuck in close....

 	fingers had to have achieved 100 with either mil or with sd so, yes,
 i'd go with that guess.  otherwise i was thinking that reardon has a better
 chance of having 100 with min along with (i would think) easily reaching 100 
 with mon.
 
 >don't know about the homers/steals dept.
 
 	gotta be willie mays...i am fairly sure he had over 300 steals in his
 career.

 	hmmm...leary is a really good point.  i'd forgotten about him.  well,
 if nothing else, there are plenty of ex-met pitchers in the category of
 "could have lost to all teams" -- koosman, leary, torrez, ryan, seaver....
 i guess the best three guesses would be leary, ryan, and either seaver or
 koosman.
