 of course a run scored is just as important as a run prevented.
 just as a penny saved is a penny earned.  enough with the cliches.
 my point is that if the braves starters are able to live up to
 their potential, they won't need much offensive support.
 i realize this is a big if.  this staff leaves the '92 bosox in the dust.
 there is no legitimate comparison.  two cy young winners, and three other
 pitchers that most any team in the league would kill to have as their first
 or second starter.  it seems to me that when quality pitchers take the
 mound, the other teams score less runs.  the team that scores the most 
 runs wins.  this puts the team with the better pitching at the advantage
 (providing they can stop the opposing team from scoring runs).  a low 
 scoring game would clearly benefit the braves.  they should have many 
 low scoring games due to their excellent pitching and below average hitting.
 on the flip side, if you had a starting lineup of great offensive players,
 i would be arguing that this team would not need great pitchers.
 they would have an advantage because they could simply outscore their
 opponent.  the name of the games is to win.  even ray knight knows that
 you do this by putting more runs up on the scoreboard.
 all i'm trying to say is that if you assemble the quality pitchers
 like the braves have, the offense doesn't need to be as strong.
