 the fan is an okay sports radio station, but doesn't come close to
 the ultimate in sports radio, 610 wip in philadelphia.  the signal
 might not be as powerful, but then again only stations in new york
 feel "obligated" to pollute everyone else's airwaves with a bunch of
 hoodlum mets fans complaining 24 hours a day.  wip took two of your
 best sports jockeys too, jody macdonald and steve fredericks.  610
 wip is rockin with sports talk from 5:30 am till midnight, check it
 out anytime your within a few hours of philadelphia.  if i'm not
 mistaken, wip has the highest sports talk ratings in the nation?

 p.s the only nice thing about the fan is that they talk sports all
 night.  hopefully 610 will begin to do that somewhat soon
