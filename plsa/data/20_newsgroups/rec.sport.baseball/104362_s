 	what's the difference between nolan ryan and yount?  both have hung
 around for years, and continue to post great stats.  why shouldn't dave kingman
 get into the hall?  or murray, evens, reardon, and others?  what the hell do
 you have to do?  ask an opposing pitcher whether he thinks that winfield should
 be in the hall...  god.  pretty soon you'll be saying that cal ripken doesn't
 deserve to be in the hall.  then, i'll flame you. :-)
