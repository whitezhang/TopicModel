 so what does that have to do with rbi's?  the team with the most rbi's
 doesn't necessarily win the game.
 
 yes, runs are the most important statistice -- for a *team*.  (so why does
 every newspaper rank team offense by batting average?)
 
 but for an individual player, runs and rbis are context-dependent, and tell
 us very little about the player himself, and more about his teammates and
 position in the batting order.
