 you're right about the signal being strong. i live in west philadelphia,
 and i can get fan almost perfectly. it's a sports fans dream (especially
 if that person is from ny and wants to hear about his teams while he's
 away at school). as for lupica & berman, it's turned out to be lupica,
 then berman. neither of them wanted to work a full four hour show, so ed
 coleman and dave sims' old four-hour slot was broken down into two
 seperate two-hour show - lupica from 10-12, and berman from 12-2. and they
 both happen to suck in comparison to eddie and dave.  come back, guys!

 like i said, i live in philly, so i can hear fan and/or wip whenever i
 want. but i cannot stand wip. and it isn't because i loathe the philly
 sports teams - the phillies are my favorite nl team (yanks are favorite
 al), and the eagles aren't too bad either. there are two big problems:
 
 	1)total emphasis on the home teams, especially the eagles. unlike
 	  the fan hosts, who can at least answer a question about an
 	  out-of-town team if a caller asks, the wip hosts seem
  	  to have no clue about any team that doesn't play on
 	  broad street. also, fans periodic sports updates (every 20
 	  minutes) gives sports news and scores from around the
 	  country. it's very rare to hear an out-of-town score
 	  being reported on wip.
 
 	2)the hosts. with the exception of jody macdonald, who i miss
 	  from his days at fan, none of the hosts really seems to have
 	  both a broad knowledge of the sport or a good on-air presence.
 	  the worst is gary cobb, who seems to have been hired solely
 	  on the basis that he used to play for the eagles.
 
 anyway, that's my two cents on the whole fan vs wip battle.
