 i've only ever seen this called once.  back around 1979-1980.  i think
 that steve carlton was pitching.  on the other hand, i am not sure how
 much effect this would have.  it seems that most of the time lost is
 when there are runners on base and the rule does not cover this.
 
 
 i have wondered why a pitcher is given 8 pitches when he enters the
 game.  let's be serious.  the relief pitcher has normally been
 throwing out in the bullpen for a few minutes.  does he really need 8
 more pitches?
