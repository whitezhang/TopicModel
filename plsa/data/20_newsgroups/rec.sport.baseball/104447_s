 kevin mitchell's sacrifice fly in the eighth off brett saberhagen plated 
 pitch runner cesar hernandez to give the reds a 2-3 come-from-behind victory over 
 new york. hernandez ran for pinch-hitter cecil espy, who got the inning started 
 with a solid single to right, moved to second on "bob" kelly's infield sneaker
 down the third-base line, and to third on jeff branson's well-placed bunt--a 
 rare show of excellent execution by the recently hapless reds offense.
 
 cincinnati trailed 2-0 after starter tim pugh blinked in the fifth.  he had only 
 given up one hit in the first four innings, a fourth-inning lead-off double
 by vince coleman.  coleman was left stranded at third by bobby bonilla after
 joe orselak popped to short.  orselak was pinch-hitting for eddie murray who 
 argued plate umpire kellogg's inside strike by "drawing the line" (really, he
 should know better than that).  murray, and later manager jeff torborg ended up getting
 tossed.
 
 the mets' fifth started with a howard johnson's first-pitch homer.  pugh must 
 have been slightly shaken, as he was popped on the next pitch by jeff kent's
 single, then a ryan thompson liner to left was (surprise) misplayed by mitchell
 and turned into a rbi triple. catcher hundley's grounder to the drawn-in branson
 failed to bring thompson in, then the play of the game occured:
 
 saberhagen was due up, so reds pitching coach larry rothschild met with the infield
 to discuss the possibility of a suicide squeeze.  they called it perfectly:
 thompson was hung out to dry after pugh's first-pitch pitch out and the threat ended.
 (isn't the national league great??)
 
 the reds picked up 2 runs in the seventh to knot up the game.  after barry larkin's
 ground out, mitchell, chris sabo, and randy milligan got back-to-back-to-back
 singles--the third scoring mitchell.  reggie sanders then plated sabo with a long
 fly to center.  a double by oliver might have scored runner dan wilson, but
 third base coach dave bristol threw up the stop sign too late--wilson himself was
 hung out to dry killing the reds rally.
 
 rob dibble came on in the ninth and pitched shakily.  with two outs and a runner
 on second bonilla came to the plate and all i could think of was the sunday game
 in late august last year when bonilla's three-run dinger slapped a loss on
 dibble and spelled the beginning of the end for cinci's season.  bonilla ended
 up walking, and hojo flied out to left to give the reds their first win in a 
 week, and earned dibble his third save in as many opportunities.  the win went
 to steve foster (1-2) who got in what must be an ego-boosting two perfect innings
 work, striking out three.  saberhagen (2-1) got the loss--though i'm a bit
 surprised he even pitched in the eighth.  i'll take it, though.
 
 the reds are now 3-9, still the worst team in baseball with the royals victory
 today.  the mets are 6-5.
