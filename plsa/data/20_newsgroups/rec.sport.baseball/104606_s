 while we're on the multipurpose subject, let's not forget shea, which
 was designed to accommodate both the mets & jets.  it was the first
 stadium (i think) to have the box seats on rollers so they could be
 oriented at right angles for baseball & in parallel for football.
 
 of course, with the jets gone to jersey (and a truly good football
 stadium), the mets are saddled with a multipurpose stadium where,
 because it's circular, the seats are almost always too far from the
 action.  the mets announcers--kiner & murphy in particular--have
 always hyped it as "beautiful shea
 stadium," a tipoff to how unbeautiful it truly is.
