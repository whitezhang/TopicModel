 back in september i was listening to wip, and i remember the morning
 guys were talking with mayor ed rendell.  the topic of conversation
 was a new ball park for the phillies.  the location for this new park
 was suggested to be near 30th st station.  at the time, the mayor was
 optimisitic that in the future this could become a reality.  has
 there been any new news on this subject or is it still a pipe dream?
 i know the city of philadelphia has other projects ahead, such as the
 new convention center and the upcoming spectrum ii.  but it would be
 nice to see this a reality.  it is planned that the phillies leave
 the vet and leave it solely to the eagles (and if that's the case,
 the eagles should make the vet a grass stadium, but that's another
 story).  i want to see that day!
 
 comments?
