 >(sounds pretty pathetic to me)
 
 well, maybe it will be.  banks is a 24 year-old prospect who "hasn't 
 matured as quickly as they would have liked.  mahomes is a 22 year-old 
 who is very highly touted.  tapani and erickson are also young, and 
 have looked very good this spring.  the last spot was between jim 
 deshaies, formerly of houston and s.d. and mike trombley.  deshaies 
 hasn't looked very good this spring, so i believe that the spot has 
 gone to trombley, although they hadn't wanted 3 starters this unproven. 
 i personally believe very highly in mahomes and trombley.

 >2.  who is playing short and third?
 
 well, scott leius is the shortstop.  he played mostly 3b last year, but 
 was a ss in the minors, and moved back after gagne left to k.c.  3b is 
 split (maybe) between pagliarulo, who has had a great spring, and terry 
 jorgenson, a good looking kid who has languished in portland for 3 
 years.  i'm not sure how the time will be divided, but they seem to be 
 happy with what they have here.  i like jorgenson, but i fear they 
 might give too much time to pags.
  
 >3.  how's winfield doing?
 
 sorry, can't help you here.
