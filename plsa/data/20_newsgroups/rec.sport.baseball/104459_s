 hey valentine, i don't see boston with any world series rings on their
 fingers.  damn, morris now has three and probably the hall of fame in his 
 future.  therefore, i would have to say toronto easily made the best 
 signing.  and don't tell me boston will win this year.  they won't 
 even be in the top 4 in the division, more like 6th.
