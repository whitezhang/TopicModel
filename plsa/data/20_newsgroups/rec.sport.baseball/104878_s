 i suspect that splits such as these are the result of positioning.  an
 outfielder who is fast and gets a good jump would be expected to catch a
 lot of balls, preventing both singles and doubles, and also cut off more
 uncatchable balls, turinging doubles into singles.  however, a fielder
 who plays shallow will catch more short flies and fewer long flies; this
 means that he will allow fewer singles but more doubles.
 
 has anyone seen these players' positioning?  do butler and felix play
 deep, and lankford, martinez, and wilson shallow, or is this a park
 effect?  i thought butler liked to play shallow.
