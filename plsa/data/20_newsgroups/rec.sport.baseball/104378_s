 frankly, no.  offense and defense are equally important.  but the
 pitcher is 80% of the defense.  the primary role of every other player
 is on offense.  even shortstops are a bigger part of the offensive
 game than of the defensive game.  (they might not do much with their
 part of the offense, but that's another issue.)
 
 that being said, i think both smith and yount deserve the hof.  they
 hit pretty well in addition to their defense.
