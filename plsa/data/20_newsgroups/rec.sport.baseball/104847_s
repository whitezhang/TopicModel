 you could be right.  then again, you could be wrong.  this claim is completely
 unverifiable and untestable.  i'd wager most of the braves fans on the net
 could name more than 3 players from their 1988 season.
 
 you could give away tickets to braves games.  however, my dad and i were able
 to get great seats from scalper for face value, which isn't exactly the sign
 of a hot ticket...

 this is *precisely* why they were considered america's team.  even
 (especially?) when they were bad, you could see most of the braves games on
 cable.  you could do that for the cubs as well, but the braves had better
 camerawork, better announcers (what would you rather listen to -- harry discuss
 the game, or skip and pete discuss motoball?), and teams that weren't *too*
 much worse.  because of tbs, the braves had a lot of fans outside of georgia.
 at home in kentucky, even though we were much closer to cincinnati there was
 as many braves fans as reds fans, even in 1990.  you could actually watch the
 braves play -- you had to go to cincinnati to watch the reds.  i can go
 anywhere in america and watch the braves.
     
 >	i'll consider toronto america's team before the braves
 
 why?  i'd guess that braves fans are more widely distributed than toronto
 fans.
