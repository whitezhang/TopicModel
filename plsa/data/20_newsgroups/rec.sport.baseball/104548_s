  hmmm...what about walks and sb? baerga got clobbered by alomar in obp and
 beat him in slg by a lesser margin. even putting aside any other factors,
 a player with a 51 point edge in obp is more productive than a player with
 a 28 point edge in slg. the issue has been studied before, and i doubt you
 could come up with any convincing argument the other way.
  people see the batting average and the hr, but they don't really know  
 their value is worth unless they've studied the issue closely. the fact is that
 baerga ate up a lot more outs than alomar; while baerga was making outs,
 alomar was drawing walks and being on base for carter, winfield et.al.
