 i wish i hadn't sold my copy of jewish baseball stars.  it's a short shelf
 (i.e., the one on top of the toilet tank) special.  the writing in that 
 books is so astonishingly awful -- every sportswriting cliche taken to
 the nth degree and then mangled -- that it's funny.
 
 rusinow is the author, i think.
