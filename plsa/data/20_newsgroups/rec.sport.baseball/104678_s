 the *real* way to speed up ballgames is for each home park owner to offer the
 following schedule of bonuses to players on *both* teams:
 
    for all players who participated in the game, offer $500 for each 10
    minutes less than 3 hours the game took (i.e. if the game only took 2.5
    hours, each player gets a bonus of $1500).
 
    for all pitchers throwing 3 or more full innings in the game, extrapolate
    the number of pitches or attempted pickoffs to the number they would have
    thrown in a full 9 innings, and offer $500 for each number less than 120.
    (if the pitcher throws a complete game with 100 pitches and 5 throws to
    first he would get $7500).
 
 i suspect you could finance this the same way presidential campaigns are
 paid for. offer each fan a checkoff on his or her ticket that says "i want
 5% of the price of this ticket to go towards fast game bonuses"...
