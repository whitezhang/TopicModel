      hi, baseball fans! so what do you say? don't you think he deserves it?
 i
  
 mean, heck, if dave winfield (ho-hum) is seriously being considered for it,
 as
 
 is lee smith (ha), then why don't we give dave kingman a chance? or darrell
 
 evans! yeah, yeah! after the hall of fame takes in them, it can take in
 eddie
 
 murray and jeff reardon.
 
      well, in any case, i am sick and tired (mostly sick) of everybody
 giving
 
 hall of fame consideration to players that are by today's standards,
 marginal.
 
 honestly, ozzie smith and robin yount don't belong there. they're both
 
 shortstops that just hung around for a long time. big deal.
 
      let's be a little more selective, huh? stop handing out these honors
 so
 
 liberally. save them for the guys who really deserve it. face it, if
 something
 
 isn't done, there will be little prestige in the hall of fame anymore. when
 
 certain individuals believe that steve garvey or jack morris are potential
 
 candidates, the absurdity is apparent. gee, can these guys even compare to
 
 the more likely future hall of famers like kirby puckett or nolan ryan?
 
 
                                  Ñ steve
