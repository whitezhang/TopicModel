 i haven't seen enough royals' games to judge his tactics, so you may have
 a point here.  but:

 imo, the royals don't have a chance to win the pennant even if mcrae
 suddenly began channeling for john mcgraw.  ok, they have some decent
 pitchers.  but when your offense consists of bums like gagne and lind
 and mcreynolds and mcrae and an over-the-hill brett, you're not going
 to finish .500 unless mcgraw brings christy mathewson back with him.
 
 i'd say it is hard to evaluate a manager when all of his hitters suck.
