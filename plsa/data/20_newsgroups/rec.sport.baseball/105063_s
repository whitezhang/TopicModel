 to take this to its, er, "logical" conclusion, it is impossible to
 ascertain whether or not i am a better hitter than roberto alomar,
 or a better pitcher than juan guzman, or a better center fielder than
 devon white.  after all, if i were on the blue jays, can you really
 prove that they wouldn't have won the world series in both 1991 and
 1992?
 
 while i thank you, mister maynard, for your faith in my atheletic
 prowess, i can assure you that your faith is misplaced.
