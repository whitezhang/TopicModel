 >>(look at all that teal!!!!  bleah!!!!!!!!!)
 
 indeed, if the color teal on a team's uniforms is any indication of the
 future, the marlins are in dire trouble! refer to the san jose sharks for
 proof... but i have hope for the marlins. i was a sometime member of the
 rene lachemann fan club at the oakland coliseum, and have a deep respect
 for the guy. he's a gem. and, of course, walt weiss gives that franchise
 class. but yeah... whoever designed those uniforms was guilty of a paucity
 of style and imagination. ugghhh!
