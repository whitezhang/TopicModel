 their phone number is 1-800-377-9777. the last catalog shows three 
 oaks jerseys: 36 home, 42 home, 39 home - they're each $165.00.  all their
 merchandise is handmade and is an authentic replica.  i own a couple -
 and they are excellent. they also have wool caps and jackets.  you should
 call to get on their mailing list even if you can't afford their prices.
