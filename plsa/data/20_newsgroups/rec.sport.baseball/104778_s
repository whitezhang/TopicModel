 not to mention that lankford had been hurt two nights before running
 into the outfield wall. this being the reason he was available to pinch-
 anything.  his ribs were the problem so he could run but not hit.
 torre is no white rat but give him credit for what he is , a pretty darn
 good manager. with the exception of the felix fiasco, but i'm not sure  
 who's brainchild that was.
