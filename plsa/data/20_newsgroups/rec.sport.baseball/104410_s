 there is no team, repeat, no team, that is america's team.  this is a diverse
 country with 26 mlb teams (+2 up north) and there is no one team that is
 america's.  who would the other teams belong to?
 
 and how does it happen?  well, teams receive this monicker through success
 (cowboys), national exposure (cubs), or both (braves).  it spreas aby
 successful advertising campaigns.  harry caray, ted turner, amd other dupe
 people into thinking that their representative teams are "hip" so that people
 will watch them on tv and buy their products.  arrogant local fans adapt the
 monicker and think that "their" team is the one that america idolize
 
 it comes down to dollars and egos.
