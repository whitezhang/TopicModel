 	i agree.  however, i have to object.  growing up in the early
 1980's and playing 2 years of mario mendoza-esque little league, i was
 told that since my hitting, well, sucked, i would do best to either
 "walk, or take one in the face for the team".  i did both.  and, my
 yankee fan father would say, "bat like oscar gamble".  so i did.  and my
 career obp was about .550.
 	not only was oscar a fun guy to watch, but he had some pretty 
 cool baseball cards and helped me become one of the best little league
 players in history.
