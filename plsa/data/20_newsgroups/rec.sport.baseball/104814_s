 	dummy hoy, a late 19th-century baseball player, was deaf.  in
 order for him to be able to find out whether the pitch was a ball or
 strike, the umpires developed hand signals.  this also helped to relieve
 the stress on umpires' vocal cords, so they didn't have to shout "strike!!!"
 or "ball!!!!!" 350 times a game...
 	heard about this one from the only worthwhile baseball book
 john thorn has ever authored, "a century of baseball lore" :-)
