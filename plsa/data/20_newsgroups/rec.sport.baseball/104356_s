 are you for real?  how many gold gloves does ozzie smith have?  if a
 guy hung around and hit 30 homers a year for 15 years, wouldn't he
 be a given for the hall?  is defense not just as important?  and if
 robin yount couldn't hit, why would he have stuck around long enough
 to get 3,000 hits?  are you saying 3,000 hits is a fluke?  3,000
 hits is no big deal?

 well, based on your argument, nolan ryan doesn't deserve the hall of
 fame.  he is just a right hander who stuck around for a long time
 and could throw hard.  very few 20 game winning seasons, lots of
 losing seasons, lots of walks.  no cy young awards.  how does nolan
 ryan compare to a guy like steve carlton who dominated 5 or 6 major
 league seasons, won 7 divisons, 2 world series, and won half of his
 teams games in 1972?  he doesn't compare.  not even close.
 
 kirby puckett hasn't done it long enough for me.  give me 5 more
 seasons like he's been having, then i'll think about it.
