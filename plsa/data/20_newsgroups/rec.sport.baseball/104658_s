   ah, so you finally found a use for that super slo-mo and frame advance
 other than scrutinizing "sorority babes in heat". congrats!

   trust me, you'd have a helluva time manipulating them. besides, if you
 converted the film to video you'd have all kinds of artifacts because of the
 difference in frame rate (unless you're an expert at doing 3/2 pulldown for
 a laserdisc company or something).

   hey, no fair! what about 'fettucine' alfredo griffin? the guy practically
 has to pivot the bat around along with his body.

   daulton doesn't strike me as all that strange. he's a little bit quiet at 
 the plate but, like franco, gets the bat through the hitting zone on a level
 plane. the first time i watched julio franco, i didn't think *anyone* could
 hit like that. now i marvel at how easy he makes it look; every time he makes
 contact, it's *solid*. he's got good power to all fields and rarely is he
 caught not ready for a pitch. 
 
   i wonder if phil plantier had a severe bout with hemorrhoids and had to
 practice his swing while 'on the throne'? :-) sure looks like it :-) 
 
   how 'bout one to add to your list: travis fryman? the guy plants his front
 foot and seems to swing *across* his body. he generates a lot of power, but
 i keep thinking he could generate even more if he could get a better pivot
 out of his hips. 
 
 >gary's list of "i'd give dave kirsch's kidneys to have a swing like that."
 
   well, they're already spoken for (by several people), but .. 
 
   i'd add robbie alomar's name to the list, among others. i really like dean
 palmer's swing, for some twisted reason, as well as pedro munoz's swing.

   a thought about may: it looks like they've taught him to turn on the ball.
 imho, he's going to fall in love with his newfound power and start pulling
 off the ball to the point that he's going to see *lots* of sinkers/sliders
 low and away. unless he adjusts quickly and starts rifling doubles to left 
 and left-center, imho you're going to see a good number of weak grounders to 
 the right side of the infield in the next month.
