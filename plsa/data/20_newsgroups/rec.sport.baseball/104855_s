 
 the phillies have won two games back to back in extra innings.  last
 night's game was hard fought.  the game in chicago should have been a
 blow out.  all in all these two games show a different phillies team.
 in past seasons they tended to always be on the short end of 1 run
 games.  i don't know how many times i saw them losing by only 1 run.
 if they were able to win most of those, they might have been more of
 a contending team.  they are 3-0 so far in extra innings.  and of
 course, they are 10-3.
