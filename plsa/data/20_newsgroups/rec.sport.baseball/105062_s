 yes, the stance is new.  don baylor was his batting coach at st. louis last
 year, and now, as his manager, is continuing to work with him.  maybe andres
 has a "weak" left eye and the open stance gives him a better look at the
 ball.  or maybe it is simply improving his mechanics - i dunno.  but the
 change seems to have enabled him to hit the ball as well as 5 years ago.  his
 selectivity has not changed.
