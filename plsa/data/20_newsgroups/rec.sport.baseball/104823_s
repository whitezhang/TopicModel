 |yes but alfredo has at least two!! (1988 dodgers and 1992 blue jays).

 	warren, i agree with your premise... but... the babe won on
 two teams. that's right, he was part of the red sox dynasty of the
 1910s. and everyone knows that the yankee dynsaty wouldn't have
 happened without thier famous bullpen catcher whose name escapes me at
 the moment.
