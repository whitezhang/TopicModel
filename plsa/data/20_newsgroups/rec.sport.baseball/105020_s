 henderson is the best leadoff hitter of all-time, arguably. winfield has  
 meant more to his team than henderson. unlike daryll, henderson tries  
 hard. he is an amazing centerfielder. rickey is very good, maybe better  
 than winfield, i was angry at the dissing of winfield. though winfield has  
 been better than henderson lately. check the numbers, winfield may  
 surprise you. he will have 3000 basehits, and should have 500 homeruns  
 when he retires(wishful thiniking if he plays to 45)
