 i hear ya!  then again, we must remember that we are indeed cub fans, and
 that the cubs will eventually blow it.  after all, the cubs are the easiest
 team in the national league to root for.  no pressure.  you know they will
 lose eventually.  oh well, i suppose we must have faith.  after all, they
 do look pretty good, and they don't even have sandberg back yet.  
 
 cubs in '93!!!!!
