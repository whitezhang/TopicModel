 i don't actually have the answer to this one.
 
 bosio, after walking the first two batters, retired 27-straight for a
 "back-end" perfect game.
 
 how many other games - including extra inning games - have seen a pitcher
 retire 27 straight, excluding official perfect games?
 
 the only other instance of this i know about for sure is the famous ernie
 shore game, which counts as a perfect one according to those goons in
 cooperstown. shore came into the game when boston pitcher babe ruth got
 thrown out for arguing over the first-batter walk; shore picked him off and
 retired 26 straight after that.
