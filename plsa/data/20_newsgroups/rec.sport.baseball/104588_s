 
 since someone brought up sports radio, howabout sportswriting???
 
 (anyone give an opinion) 
 
 which city do you think has the best sports coverage in terms of
 print media? 
 
 (these are general questions) 
 
 is the washington post better than the philadelphia inquier or the ny
 times?  
 
 howabout the philadelphia daily news compared to the new york daily
 news?
