 well, yeah. on the other hand, for the first few years of his career he
 looked like herb washington. dan gladden doesn't seem to suck defensively,
 either.

 yeah, and how many of the white guys played one year into a long career?
 it's actually not an uncommon phenomenon, and how long a guy hangs around
