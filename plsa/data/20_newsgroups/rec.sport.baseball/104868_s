 my father is a huge tiger fan, and i am a loyal blue jay fan, who endured the collapse of 87, the heartbreak of 85.  
 
 i don't have the stat book, so let's throw them out.
 
 first of all, morris in his heyday (81-88) vs clemens (86-present).
 
 how many cy youngs does morris have?
 
 how many cy youngs does clemens have?
 
 ballparks and such... fenway average pitchers park.  detroit, hugh hitters
 paradise.   
 
 morris is a great team pitcher, sort of in the doug drabek mold.  
 if morris's team needs a well pitched game, as in minn in 91, morris
 snaps the ball, and throw for ks.  otherwise, he just tries to get people out.
 
 as for clemens, in the elias stat book of 1992, i believe
 that clemens has the best lifetime record for his team, as compared to
 when he doesn't pitch.  how bad would the red sox have been last year
 without him?  can you say 92 phillies?
 
 i believe clemens is the better pitcher because of more power, and hsi
 great tenacity.  morris is among the guttiest pitchers i;ve ever seen,
 but clemens is in a class with seaver, carlton, etc.
