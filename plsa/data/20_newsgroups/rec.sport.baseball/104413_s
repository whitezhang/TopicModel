 	is this the book by bob klapisch (spelling?), "the
 worst team money can buy"?  if it is, i wouldn't give the book,
 or anything in it any value whatsoever.  klapisch wrote the
 book to make money (obviously) and sensational literature is
 going to sell a lot better than what he usually writes for the
 papers.  i'm not calling him a liar, but if there was any proof
 that a met player had raped a little girl before a game (let
 alone doing it on a regular basis) they would be in jail, not
 shea.
 	for those people who do not know what the press is like
 in new york, it is probably more cut-throat than in just about
 any other part of the u.s.  keith hernandez said it very well on
 espn a couple of days ago, they would much rather mention a
 clubhouse fight, than a two-run homer in the ninth to win a
 game.  i do not read klapisch's news columns regularly, but i
 do know that he has been accused before as being an instigator
 that enjoys (hopefully for only professional reasons) to drumb
 up a news story, even if there isn't one there.  now as far as
 the confrontation with bobby bonilla a few days ago, i almost
 totally blame bonilla.  no matter what a member of the press
 does, and no matter how much of a putrid individual he might
 be, that does not give a ballplayer the right to threaten a
 journalist.  
 	personally, i always thought that a beat writer that
 always follows a club around should report the news, but not be
 looking to degrade a team.  i don't know whether to blame
 klapisch, because that may be the only way to keep a job in new
 york.
