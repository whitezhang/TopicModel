 joe torre has to be the worst manager in baseball.
 
 for anyone who didn't see sunday's game,
 
 with a right hander pitching he decides to bench lankform, a left handed
 hitter and play jordan and gilkey, both right handers.
 
 later, in the ninth inning with the bases loaded and two outs he puts
 lankford, a 300 hitter with power in as a pinch runner and uses luis
 alicea, a 250 hitter with no power as a pinch hitter.  what the hell
 is he thinking.
 
 earlier in the game in an interview about acquiring mark whiten he commented
 how fortunate the cardinals were to get whiten and that whiten would be a
 regular even though this meant that gilkey would be hurt, but torre said
 he liked gilkey coming off the bench.  gilkey hit over 300 last year,
 what does he have to do to start, the guy would be starting on most every
 team in the league.
 
 furthermore, in sundays game when lankford was thrown out at the plate, 
 the replay showed bucky dent the third base coach looking down the line
 and waving lankford home, 
 
 i can't take this anymore
