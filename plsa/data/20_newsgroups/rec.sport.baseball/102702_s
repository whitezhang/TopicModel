 jason, i am going to a yankee game wed night at cleveland stadium. i am so  
 happy.
 
 
 but cleveland is a very bad team who lost severalrs. they were an up and  
 coming team, now they are just a sad excuse for a better average.
 
 
 
 abbot will not win the cy.!!!!!! melido perez will. as bold a prediction  
 as they come., well herot be in last place by the end of the season. mike  
 lurie speaks, and the world listens.
