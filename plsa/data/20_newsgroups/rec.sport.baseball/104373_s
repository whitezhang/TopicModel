     that's because lankford had a minor injury from a couple of games
 before that
     and was day-to-day... only available as a pinchrunner.

      see above.

     at the beginning of the interview torre also said lankford is the
 one outfield
     guy who's "in there no matter what".
     my guess is jordan will eventually end up being odd man out due to low
     on base percentage.  whiten was a great acquisition... decent offense
     and great defense in rightfield.  but don't worry, gilkey will be
 starting        
     as soon as jordan or whiten displays an extended period of low offensive
     output.
