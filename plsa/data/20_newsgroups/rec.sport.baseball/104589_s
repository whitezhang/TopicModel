 not necessarily.  it could mean that, or it could mean that he just hit
 a lot better at home than he did on the road (see frank thomas' home/road
 splits in '91 for an example).  i would guess that some of alomar's split
 is due to the skydome, but most of it is probably due just to coincidence.
 there's no way to be sure, of course, but the only hitters the skydome
 seems to regularly help a lot are right handed home run hitters, and
 alomar is not a home run hitter.

 only because of t&p's bogus fielding stats, which rate alomar as the worst
 defensive second baseman in the league.  on a career basis, i think t&p's
 fielding stats may mean something, but on a seasonal basis it comes up
 with ridiculous results like this.  alomar may not be the god of fielding
 the media says he is, but he sure isn't the worst in baseball.
 
 offensively, t&p rate alomar much higher last year.
 
 regarding the a vs. b argument, i'll just say they're both very good players
 with different strengths and a bright future.
