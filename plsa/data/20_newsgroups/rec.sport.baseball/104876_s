 i didn't mean that it would necessarily help him improve at that
 specific deficiency.  i meant that if having bonds bat behind him
 gives williams (possibly unfounded) confidence, that might translate
 into more hitting productivity.  but you're right -- if williams'
 biggest problem is more physical than mental, that's less likely
 to make a difference.
