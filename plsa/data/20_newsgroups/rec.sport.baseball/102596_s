 let's look at the effects of inflation on 1930's superstars' salaries.
 
 i read once that the babe made $80,000 one year and that was about as good 
 as it got for him.
 
 let's assume he made that in 1928 (i'm not sure of the figures, but i know
 i'm in the ballpark--pun intended). :-)
 
 today, assuming a 4% yearly inflation rate, which is an understatement if
 not accurate, his measly $80,000 salary would be worth.
 
 fv = $80,000 x (1+4%)^(1993-1928)
    = $80,000 x (1.04)^65
    = just over $1,000,000.
 
 assuming inflation is average of around 5%.
 
 fv = $80,000 x (1+5%)^65
    = almost 2,000,000.
 
 (i didn't crunch these numbers beforehand).
 
 these numbers might lead one to believe that today's players are slightly 
 overpaid.  the babe appears to have made then what today's average to above
 average players make now.  perfectly accurate salary, year of salary, and 
 average inflation rate would make this analysis more accurate, but i don`t 
 think i'm off by much.
