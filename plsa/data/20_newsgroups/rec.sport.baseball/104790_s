 didn't mike schmidt also do this at least three times?  i can 
 remember twice in wrigley field alone...he did it the same day
 kong did it in a 23-22 shootout, and he swatted four there one
 day in april '76 (the month he set the april record with 11 hr's.
 anybody remember any of this?  (i was just a kid)
