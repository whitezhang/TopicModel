 but,
  they faced the phillies -- a team that got off to an 8-1 start.

   to be honest, i think the city of houston loves the new owner.  he has
 brought baseball back to houston with key acquisitions -- players that
 were from the houston area and wanted to play for the astros.  i don't
 think that too many people are fearful that mclane will meddle in the team
 as he has already admitted that he doesn't know a whole lot about baseball.
 mclane is a businessman, and doesn't like excuses.  he makes a valid point
 that injuries shouldn't be an excuse to this club.  look at the depth of the
 bench this season.. canadele can play 7 positions; bass and james are solid
 outfielders and can hit well too; uribe is nice to have as well..  the
 pitching staff has 6 legitimate starters.  we're dealing with a young
 houston team, so injuries shouldn't play a big role.  the only threat is
 the bullpen -- if jonesy goes out, we may be in trouble but with the
 type of starters we have this season, there is less pressure on the pen.
