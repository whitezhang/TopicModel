 and michael jackson, jack nicholson, and bill cosby wouldn't be 
 making near as much money if they weren't entertainers. so what's
 your point?

 will they?  you can't usually take away one of the team's best
 players and still expect them to win.  or do you think the 
 pirates will continue to win without barry bonds.

 the reason the latter often happens is that many of these folks
 start making the real big salaries late in their career, when they

 fell apart after making his first million because he put most
 of that million up his nose.)
