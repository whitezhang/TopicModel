 i definitely do.  that's why i don't like going to see games played
 on artificial turf :-)

 well, your idea of "interesting" differs from mine.  i think
 batting practice is interesting, for example, and make a special
 effort to get to the game very early in order to see it.  i think the
 delaying tactics of batters, pitchers, catchers, and managers are
 interesting because they're attempts to gain advantage through control
 of the flow and timing of the game.  of course, the umpires can, and
 should, intervene when these tactics get out of hand.  as ryan robbins
 has pointed out, there are rules that cover this.
 
 one of the more fascinating things about baseball, i think, is its
 open-endedness with regard to time.  you never know if the game is going
 to zip right by and be over in less than two hours, or if it's going to
 go on until four in the morning.  likewise, some games are action-packed,
 and some games are slow and lazy.  that's fine by me.  those folks who
 want constant action should watch the games on tv so they can channel-
 surf and cater to their short attention spans.
