 me, too... rbi are a worthless stat. of course, so is stolen bases because 
 sometimes runners are in front of a player that would otherwise run. and of
 course pitchers pitch differently with different people on different bases,
 so batting average, slugging and obp out, too.  hmmm... i guess homers would
 not count then, either.
 my point? rbi might not be a perfect stat but nothing is. and no stat (or lack
 of) can tell me there are no clutch hitters. maybe no stat can tell me,
 either, but some people are... i just know it!!! 8)
