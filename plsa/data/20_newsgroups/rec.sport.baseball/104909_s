 if i remember correctly (which is always in doubt), horner's signing
 with the braves was contingent on starting in atlanta.  i think
 he could have gone back to arizona st. for one more year if he hadn't
 signed.  anyhow, the braves did try to send him to richmond once;
 it lead to a week-long walkout.  methinks horner had no work ethic
 before he was drafted, and minor league play wouldn't have helped.
 but his raw talent would have gotten him into the ml, and it did
 keep him there for a while, until he started falling on his wrists.
