 as i have read this net the last few days, i am continually amazed at the 
 pronouncements of baseball prowess by many individuals.  especially when it 
 comes down to saying that the bosox haven't a prayer.  as a long time red sox
 fan, i will simply say:  the impossible dream year - 1967 for those of you
 with short memories. short lives, or both.  
 
 to be a red sox fan is to continually be the subject of abuse and criticism
 from those who only follow 'the hot team'.  this statement is supported based
 on the increased number of 'brave woofers' out on the net.  a true fan of a 
 team, any team, will follow that team through the good years as well as the lean
 years, and be amply rewarded when the time is right.  
 
 yeah, so what if buckner let a roller go through his legs in `86.  who cares if
 clemens told cooley to go piss up a rope and promptly earned a quick shower.  the
 fact is, they were one of the best teams in the league those years and the fans
 supported them.  now that it appears that they are on lean times, the number of 
 detracters come from all over.  so what!  let them play and we will see what 
 happens come september.  the red sox may not be that good, but they are certainly 
 not that bad, either and they do have a chance to win the world series, after all,
 remember the `69 mets?  who would have given them a chance to even make it that
 far, let alone beat baltimore.
 
 let's face it, baseball is a wonderful game and is far more unpredictable than football
 and basketball.  because of this, one can never say with absolute certainity what
 the outcome will be over the course of 162 games.
