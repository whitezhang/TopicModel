 bob, i think that stark does this sort of thing as a joke, not as a
 serious prediction.  i don't really see why we should shoot him for
 that.  the guys who ought to be shot are the ones who keep claiming
 how great the royals' chances are in the al west, since all evidence
 indicates that they aren't joking and actually believe it.
