 i tell you, steve stone is like a prophet.
 he must be making a ton in the boradcoast booth because
 i can't understand why he's not actually back in the game itself.
 
 the other day he called sosa's homerun against the sox and
 claimed the game would be going into extra innings when the
 score was 8-3 in the 5th.
 
 so yesterday he notices that sosa's ahead in the count against
 maddux and says, "this is a fastball situation and sosa will be
 looking for it.  but this is also the spot where maddux throws
 the straight change."   sure enough. sosa gets ahead on it and pops
 it up to the infield.
 
 stoney for cubs manager!
