 ac>(though i'd prefer to see texas.)
    hi tony.i think that i might be able to help you out!the rangers are
    here in toronto thursday july 8th through sunday july 11th and
    tickets should not be hard to find if you order them far enough in
    advance.although i don't have a ticket broker's telephone number off
    hand if you give me a couple of days i will be able to get a hold a=
    of a couple.the blue jays ticket info # is (416)341-1111 or if you
    want to order by credit card,call (416) 341-1234.if you let me
    know,when you want the tickets i can save you a possible long
    distance call.if all else fails i might be able to pull a few strings
    and get you a pair.let me know whats happening.
