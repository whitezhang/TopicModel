 foolish me.  and here i thought it had something to do with the 
 fact that they were hitting against wakefield, who had no "kncukle"
 to his ball that day, and otto, who has no stuff.  i wonder if 
 reggie gave the same pep talk and instruction to the rest of the
 lineup, who also suddenly came alive those two games.
