 i'm confused.  how is it hal mcrae's fault that he can't win with a team 
 whose best offensive player is phil hiatt?  i mean, let's be real.  kansas
 city will have to get outstanding years from their entire staff just to end
 up near .500; they have less offense than any other team in baseball, even
 if you count the expansion teams.
