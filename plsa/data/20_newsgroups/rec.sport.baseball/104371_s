 the new york talk shows are just awful in this regard.  people are constantly
 calling wfan and wabc with (stuff like) "i was thinking, why don't the yankees
 trade kaminicki and silvestri to seattle for ken griffey jr and randy johnson,
 that would really help the team"  or "do you think the yankees can get roger 
 clemens?".  the show hosts are pretty good about handling these guys, but it's
 still annoying.
 
 the best one was at the end of one show, a caller started out with "i was 
 thinking, why don't the yankees trade for..." and then the host hung up on
 him.  i cheered!
