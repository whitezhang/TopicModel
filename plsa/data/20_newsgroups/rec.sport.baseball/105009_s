 and the fan caught it.

 yes, i think he should have done more to get out of the way.  as much
 as fans want to catch a ball, they really should be aware that winning
 the game is more important.  as a dodger fan, he has to be aware that
 this is the home stadium, and that entails helping the home team win
 in any way possible.  as soon as the ball was hit that far, his first
 instinct should be to root for darryl to catch it, not to try to catch
 it himself, particularly when he is sitting that close.
 
 i enjoy the attitude of the wrigley fans, where they are against 
 visiting team home runs so much, they actually throw them back on the
 field.
 
 now, this has nothing to do with whether darryl could have caught it or
 not.  sure, he probably screwed up, but the fan should realize his
 first responsibility is to get out of the way and help the team win.
