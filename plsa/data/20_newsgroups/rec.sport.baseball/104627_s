 i agree with nick.  what's the big deal about long games?  if you want
 to watch baseball, there's that much more baseball to watch.  and yes,
 baseball includes the space between plays as well as the plays themselves.
 
 i suspect that a lot of the complaining about long games, especially when
 it's coming from tv people, has to something to do with advertising.
 probably time "wasted" in the middle of an inning, say by a batter
 stepping out of the box to fiddle with his gloves, or by a pitcher
 walking around behind the mound trying to collect his thoughts, could
 otherwise be sold as advertising time.
