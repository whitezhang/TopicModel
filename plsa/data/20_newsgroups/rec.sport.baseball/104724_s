 
  i am looking for a source of american league baseball stats for
 individual players in the same format as printed in newspapers, ie. i do
 not want to provide a list of players and get back nice printed reports
 for $35 a week.
 
 does anyone know of such statistics availability and an idea of the
 cost?
