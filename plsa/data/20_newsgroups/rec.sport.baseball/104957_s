 there are several reasons for this difference.  the main reason is that
 good hitters in their prime (such as frank thomas and danny tartabull)
 are rarely regular dh's, even if they can't field; it's more commonly a
 place to put aging veterans.
 
 another use of the dh slot is to help a player come back from injury
 slowly, getting his bat in the lineup without forcing him to play in the
 field.  i would expect such players to hit worse as dh's than they did
 during the rest of the season.
 
 a third factor is that most player who split time between dh and first
 or the outfield don't hit as well as dh's for some reason.  reggie
 jackson was a good example; in five years as a rf/dh for the angels, he
 hit like the old reggie when he was in right.
 
 the second and third factors will be lost if players are considered by
 their primary position only; a player who plays 90 games in right and 60
 at dh will count only in the right fielders' averages.

 this makes sense; you might also look at it another way.  although the
 *average* offensive performance of a dh may be lower than for a left
 fielder, the *replacement-level* offensive performance is certainly
 lower; if you are a left fielder but can't hit well enough to keep a job
 anywhere, then you certainly can't hit well enough to keep a job at dh.
