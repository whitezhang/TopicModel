 well, obp is the most important offensive statistic, and by a big margin.
 50 points of obp is worth considerably more than 50 points of slugging.
 that being said, i still think baerga was very slightly better last year,
 but i think this is as close to a wash as you're likely to find.
 
 i personally don't care much for alomar's defense.  i don't think he's
 nearly as good as people make him out to be, and he can't turn the dp
 to save his life.  he comes across the bag improperly, and his release
 is slow.  considering the high leverage of the dp, this is a shortcoming
 i can't overlook.  in the long term, i'd move alomar to another position.
 
 if the jays could trade a hot devon white for something, i'll be alomar
 could be a hell of a cf.  in the long run, i think i'd rather have jeff
 kent at 2b and alomar in cf than alomar/white.
