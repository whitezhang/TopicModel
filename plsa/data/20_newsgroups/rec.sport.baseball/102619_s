   well, it really isn't this cut and dry, but as a jay fan the thing i feared
 worst has happened. the yanks sent down williams g and are going to start
 williams b in cf.
   i also believe they kept wickman and millitello in their rotation, which is
 much nicer than that kaminiecki and mike witt combo i thought they'd throw
 out their to the slaughterhouse because of their "experience". granted, witt
 "might" be good, but i think that they used rationale to keep the youngsters
 up and not given the job to witt because he was a good pitcher and has
 experience.
   the yanks are showing that they are taking positive strides forwards; the
 jays with the loss of dave stewart are looking at gigantic holes in their
 pitching staff.
   the orioles should also be there in the end.....
