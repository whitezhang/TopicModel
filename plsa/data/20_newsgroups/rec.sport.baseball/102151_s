 hell, the orioles' opening day game could easily be the largest in history
 if we had a stadium with 80,000 seats. but unfortunely the yards (a
 definitely excellent ballpark) only holds like 45,000 with 275 sro spots.
 ticket sales for the entire year is moving fast. bleacher seats are almost
 gone for every game this year. it's a extremely likelyhood that the o's
 could sell out every game this year (especially if we lead the division for
 most of the year like '89). 
 	on another front, the sale of the orioles to anyone is likely to be
 forced upon eli jacobs who is major debt apparently. maybe we can get an
 owner willing to spend on a proven rightfielder free agent in the winter.
 	fernando has made the o's as the fifth starter. the o's pitching
 staff looks pretty good. sutcliffe, mussina, mcdonald, rhodes, and fernando.
 	baltimore is my pick for the victors in a very competitive al east.

  second to last day of the season - gregg (the true wild thing) olson
 uncorks a wild pitch allowing the blue jays to tie. blue jays win in the
 11th and ends the baby birds' miracle season of '89.
