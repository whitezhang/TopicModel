 i don't know why you guys keep bickering about morris. the stats show he
 is a mediocre pitcher at best (this year is another case), he just happened
 to win 21 games. i saw many of his games last year, he did pitch some good
 games. but this crap about being a clutch pitcher is nonsense, he was 
 constantly giving up go ahead runs in the 6-8th innings (the clutch innings)
 and the jays would somehow scrape a win for him. another major factor in
 his 21 wins, is that cito 'i dont realize i have a bullpen' gaston would
 leave morris in for ever, therefore giving him many more chances to win
 games (i believe this is the major reason he won 21 games last year).
