 i am finding the volume of stuff on rec.sport.baseball
 overwhelming -- ca. 200 posts/day.  an effect of this is
 that a backlog builds up, and many posts get dumped from
 my system.  i could probably fix that--but don't have the
 time to read them all in any event.  my guess is that mine
 is a common problem.  i have some ideas that would help:
 
 1.  each person generally post no more than one article/day.
 2.  limit the extent to which previous posts are reproduced
     in posts.
 3.  don't post mindless `woofs,' or `anti-woofs,' e.g. "the
     jays are best!"  or  "the jays suck."
 4.  don't respond to mindless posts, e.g.  "jack morris is
     a better pitcher than frank viola because he's won a 
     world series."  i know that you can use the `n' key to
     get by these posts, but they bump interesting posts from
     my disk.
 5.  use the goddamn shift key etc it makes your posts easier
     to read
