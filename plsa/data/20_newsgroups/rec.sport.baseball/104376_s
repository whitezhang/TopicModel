         remember - it's still early. look for his offense to tail off, and his
 defense to improve (hopefully). he has that rep because i heard that either
 last year, or over the last 5 years, or something like that - he has the third
 highest fielding percentage among major league shortstops - behind c.r. and
 tony (i'm not gonna help this sorry mets team at all) fernandez. i do agree
 though that he has not looked all that impressive in the field thus far.
