      but good ones can collapse somewhat, then come back the next year.
 burleigh grimes went from 20+ wins and an era of 3 or so in '24 to 13-19 and
 an era around 4 in '25.  he pitched well for several more years.  carlton
 won 13 and lost 20 the year after his 27-10 record. (source: bill james
 historical baseball abstract.)
      and let's not forget john tudor, who started 1-5 and finished 21-6 in
 1985.  he had a pretty bad era when you take busch stadium into account at
 the start of the season.

      if i recall, he had a 4.50 era in the 1st half and a 3.50 era in the
 2nd half of last year.  
      hmmm, 21 runs in 11 innings.  suppose he starts 30 more games, and winds
 up w/200 innings pitched.  if he allows 4 runs a game in the next 189
 innings, he'll have a 4.75 era or so at the end of the year. (i think i have
 his totals right.) this is going to be hard to come back from.

      my 1st hunch is that morris is very gutsy, and that he may be pitching
 through an injury and not telling anyone.  my 2nd guess is that he will be
 banished to the bullpen the remainder of the season after a few more starts.
 (perhaps when stewart comes off the dl?  or will danny cox, who went 3 or 4
 scoreless innings against the tribe today, start for morris?  he looks like
 a really good one.  gaston is scrambling to find starters, i'd imagine.
 luckily, the jays have a very good offense.)
      i don't think they would dare release him before the end of the year.
 he'll just be replaced by stewart or cox.
