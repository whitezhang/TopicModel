 might? you'd have to have no sense of humor at all not to! my favorite
 stuff are the zero heros, players who haven't hit homers in a long time, 
 the lgtgah (who is that named after, i can't remember), and the box score
 line of the week. incidentally, i just found out that the column has been
 moved to sundays. i get my dad to send it to me up here in boston every 
 week. great stuff!
