 
 i'm no kingman fan.  just thought i'd point out that he's the
 only player in history to have five three-hr games.  joe carter
 has four.  eddie murray three.  mccovey and gehrig also three.
 ruth, mays, foxx and dawson two each.
 
 i don't think reggie's ws game counts, else i believe he would 
 also have had two.
