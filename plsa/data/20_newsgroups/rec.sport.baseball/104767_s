 disclaimer -- this is for fun.
 
 in my computerized baseball game, i keep track of a category called
 "stolen hits", defined as a play made that "an average fielder would not
 make with average effort."  using the 1992 defensive averages posted
 by sherri nichols (thanks sherri!), i've figured out some defensive stats
 for the leftfielders. hits stolen have been redefined as "plays kevin
 bass would not have made."
 
 ok, i realize that's unfair.  kevin's probably the victim of pitching staff,
 fluke shots, and a monster park factor.  but let's put it this way:  if we
 replaced every leftfielder in the league with someone with kevin's 49.4% out
 making ability, how many extra hits would go by?
 
 to try and correlate it to reality a little more, i've calculated net
 hits stolen, based on the number of outs made compared to what a league
 average fielder would make.  by the same method i've calculated net extra 
 bases (doubles and triples let by).
 
 finally, i throw all this into a a formula i call defensive contribution, or
 dcon :->.  basically, it represents the defensive contribution of a player.
 i add this number to ops to get dops (defense + onbase plus slug), which
 should represent the player's total contribution to the team.  so don't
 take it too seriously.  the formula for dcon appears at the end of this
 article.
 
 the short version -- definition of terms
 hs -- hits stolen -- extra outs compared to kurt stillwell
 nhs -- net hits stolen -- extra outs compared to average fielder
 ndp -- net double plays -- extra double plays turned compared to avg fielder
 neb -- net extra bases --  extra bases prevented compared to avg. fielder
 dcon -- defensive contribution -- bases and hits prevented, as a rate.
 dops -- dcon + ops -- quick & dirty measure of player's total contribution.

 more discussion --
 
 dcon formula:  ((nhs + ndp)/pa) + ((nhs + ndp + neb)/ab)
 why such a bizzare formula?  basically, it's designed to be added into the
 ops, with the idea that "a run prevented is as important as a run scored".
 the extra outs are factored into obp, while the extra bases removed are 
 factored into slg.  that's why i used pa and ab as the divisors.
