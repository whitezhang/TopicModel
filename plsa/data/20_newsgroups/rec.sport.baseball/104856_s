 there are very few disciplines where 100% certainty is necessary to
 state something as fact.  baseball is not one of them.
 
 therefore i can say that i know clemens was better than morris last
 year, and larkin was better than griffin.  no, i can't ascertain this.
 i can't prove it.  but i'm not required to do so.
 
 and since you obviously feel that such threads are meaningless,
 why don't you simply stay out of them?
