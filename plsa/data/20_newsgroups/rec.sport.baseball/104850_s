 so that's what happened to denny mclain.  sad.
 
 for those of you who are interested, another baseball pariah,
 pete rose, has a weekday radio show on the sports and
 entertainment national radio network.  i think it's 3-5 pm
 locally, 6-8 pm on the east coast.
 
 and actually, his on-air monologues about the baseball
 business sounds a lot more reasonable and articulate
 than what i hear from the ray knights of the world.

    stodgy things
      argument by an inept speaker.
      ignorant sermonizing.
      a drinking bout without hors d'oeuvres.
      a dried-up sword sheath held together by threads.
      questioning by a boy favorite about one's other affairs.
