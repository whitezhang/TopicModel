 because a small advantage in fielding ability comes nowhere near
 making up for the large difference in hitting.  their average
 seasons, using their combined average 656 (ab + bb) per 162 games:
 
          years  ab  h  r  2b 3b hr rbi tb  bb  avg  obp  slg  ops
 santo    14.10 577 160 81 26  5 24  94 268 79 .277 .366 .464 .830
 robinson 17.55 607 162 70 27  4 15  77 243 49 .267 .325 .401 .726
 
 fielding, we have, per 162 games at third,
 
          years   p    a   dp   e   pct
 santo    13.15  149  348  30  24  .954
 robinson 17.72  152  350  35  15  .971
 
 even if robinson's extra 3 putouts, 2 assists, and 5 dps are taken to mean
 he was responsible for 10 more outs in the field, that doesn't make up
 for the extra 28 outs he made at the plate, not to mention the fewer
 total bases.  the difference of .104 in ops should be decreased by about
 .025 to account for wrigley, but a .079 difference is still considerable.
 the thorn & palmer ratings are
 
            adjusted      adjusted    stolen   fielding  total
            production  batting runs base runs   runs    rating
 santo         123          284        -14       137      41.7
 robinson      105           52         -5       151      19.8 (26.3)
 usual disclaimers about t&p's fr apply, but they really shouldn't be
 way off the mark in this comparison.  at least it's better than fielding
 percentage: carney lansford has a .966 , 10th best all-time, but -225 fr,
 dead last of all time.  also, since this total rating compares players
 to league average instead of replacement level, robinson should be
 awarded an extra 6.5 or so for playing 653 more games.  he had a great
 career, but i would prefer santo's plus 4 years of a replacement level 3bman.
 
 but i would knock traynor off the list and replace him by stan hack.
 that's a similar story, hack's far better hitting outweighs traynor's
 superior fielding.  graig nettles and buddy bell would also be better
 choices (imho of course, though some recent net discussion supports
 this point of view.)

 shouldn't that be right field?
