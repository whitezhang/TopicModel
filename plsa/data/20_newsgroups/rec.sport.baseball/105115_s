 well, there were 27 outs in a row with no hits or walks in between, but
 really, he only retired 26 batters in a row.  the first out of the game
 was the front end of a double play.  still counts as a back-end perfect
 game in my book, though. 
 
 congrats to chris bosio.  too bad the brewers couldn't hold on to him.
