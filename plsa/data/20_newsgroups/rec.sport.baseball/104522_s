 i've been saying that for at least 2 years now and even the a's conditioning
 guru told jose he was carrying too much weight and losing some would help
 his back.although i don't for one second believe jose used steroids,his
 back problems are very similar to problems alot of steroid users experience
 because they are simply carrying too much weight on their frame(see jeff
 bregel ex 49er as a textbook example), and imho jose is too big for his
 frame.

 i can't imagine how to estimate bat speed, but its pretty obvious that
 jose is missing fastballs he used to hit, likely due to his back.

 i don't know, he had an even more open stance when he first came up with
 the a's, and had no problems with it then. it might be that pre-back
 problems, he was quick enough to cover up any deficiencies the stance
 caused, but now he's lost just enough bat speed that the stance hurts
 him. the old saying if you're hot its a trigger mechanism, if you're
 cold, its a hitch.

 the biggest problem imho is he never has found a stance he's comfortable
 with for more than a few months. he changes his stance so much, he loses
 track of where the strike zone is. in wednesday's night game, he was 
 clearly mad at strike calls on both corners that looked pretty good to
 me. i think he no longer knows where the strike zone really is because
 he's changed his stance so much.
 
 i'm also a bit concerned that because he's got palmer and gonzalez hitting
 all the homeruns, he'll become competitive, swing even harder and screw
 himself up even worse. larussa always said that canseco's famous batting
 practice homer shows did him more harm than good as they encouraged
 bad hitting habits.
