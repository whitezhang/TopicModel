 i am trying to think how to respond to this without involving personal feeling
 or perceptions and i can not without having stats to back up my points.
 however, i think you approached this the wrong way. i believe all of the
 people mentioned here deserve the hall of fame more than dave kingman does. i
 feel they were all much better players. i am not saying i fell they deserve to
 go but that they would deserve it more. 
 
 imho 
 dave kingman - definately not. they guy only had a couple of years were he
 could hit with atleast a respectable averag. the rest of his career i do not
 think he was very feared by pitchers. i also do not think he did a lot for the
 game. i mean really i am a met fan - he was a met for part of his career and i
 still would not back him for the hall of fame.
 
 dave winfield - i think so. he is feared by pitchers, he has had several
 season where he hit for a respectable average and his production numbers are
 (in my opinion - without stats) better than kingman's (probably by quite a
 bit). i also perceive him to be a leader, maybe not as much as some other
 people but none the less a leader. i think he has made substantial
 contributions to the game of baseball and to society. examples of this are
 some of the charitable things he has done (i know some of this from when he
 was with the yankees). i think he the type of player that kids can look up to
 and while this is definately not the only criteria for the hall of fame i
 think it deserves some consideration.
 
 lee smith - maybe, i would have to see his stats again but he definately would
 deserve to go before the likes of kingman.
 
 darrell evans - no.
 
 eddie murray - maybe, he has had a very good career, he is a leader (although
 a silent one), he is a good role model. are the stats good enough? i am not
 sure - but i would once again believe they are much better than kingman's both
 the average as well as the power numbers (but not as good as winfield's). just
 think, eddie did not have as much publicity for most of his great years.
 
 jeff reardon - my guess is no, but it kind of depends on his numbers. off the
 top of my head i would take lee smith first.

 well, i strongly disagree here. both of these guys deserve it for sure. i
 talked about leadership above, both of these guys are leaders and have been
 instumental in leading their teams to the post season. robin does have very
 good offensive numbers both average and power and ozzie has okay numbers
 offensively. the difference with ozzie is that if you gave him a home run for
 every run he saved by making an incredible play at shortstop - he would have
 shattered aaron's home run mark by now. how many of those great plays saved
 games? how many of those great plays motivated his team to rally and win a
 game? while i believe both of these guys have numbers, baseball is about more
 than numbers (or at least winning at baseball is about more than numbers).
 both of these guys are proven stars and belong in the hall of fame. as does
 george brett who also belongs in this class of player.

 steve garvey - i am not sure, probably not but i guess i could see someone
 making a case for him. 
 
 jack morris - once again not my first choice but i can see why someone might
 bring up his name.
 
 kirby puckett - probably. the only reason i do not say definately is he still
 has time left in his career. if he continues doing what he has been then my
 probably will turn into a definately.
 
 nolan ryan - is there really any doubt? i think i heard something about him
 having some 53 records (maybe they were not all good - i don't know i did not
 hear any of them just the number). he has the numbers, he has the
 contributions to the game and community and he is a great role model. i would
 not say that he is the best pitcher to ever pitch the game (probably not even
 top 20) but he would be the first pitcher i would put in the hall of fame
 because of his accomplishments (no-hitters, strikeouts, respectable numbers -
 even with some weaker teams) you can go on and on. i really hope he gets all
 the possible votes.
 
 so in summing up i have 3 groups, those that belong, those that probably do
 but i am not sure and those that i lean towards saying don't belong at least
 not without my seeing stats and possibly hearing reasons why they should go.
 
 yes -  winfield, yount, brett(not in your mail), o. smith, puckett and ryan
 maybe - murray and l. smith
 no - reardon, garvey, morris, evans and definately kingman
 
 as i said i do not have the stats around so i do not have numbers to back this
 up - these are entirely my opinions based on my perceptions.
