 um, what?  eddie murray was a superb first baseman for a *long* time.
 
 winfield as produced consistently for almsot 20 years, and excellently
 on several occasions.  
 
 dave kingman's *best* year was like darryl strawberry's *typical*
 year with the mets.  
 
 darrell evans, too, did a whole lot more than just hit homers, which 
 *is* all that kong did.

 whom are you talking about?  yes, eddie murray is marginal, but that's
 because he's 38 years old.  he wasn't marginal for a *long* time.

 not.  
 
 smith has hung around for a long time and fielded the position better 
 than anyone else ever has.
 
 yount stopped being a shortstop about a decade ago, in case you hadn't 
 noticed.
 
 one of his two mvp awards was as a centerfielder.

 like whom?  there are many players in the hall who aren't anywhere near
 as goos as the guys you're running down.

 that's already the case, by some standards.  but the *bad* players in the 
 hall are all from the 20's and 30's.  recent picks have generally been
 excellent.
 
 >certain individuals believe that steve garvey or jack morris are potential

 >the more likely future hall of famers like kirby puckett or nolan ryan?
 
 no, but who cares?  was stan musial anywhere near as good as babe ruth?
 not really.  but he obviously belongs there.
 
 the hall has generally had about the top 1% of major leaguers.  as 
 more players come through the game, more will be in that top 1%.  
 
 and, yes, it's pretty easy to argue that smith,. yount, evans, winfield,
 etc. are in the top 1%.  dave kingman on the other hand, was a liability
 throughout most of his career.
 
 of course, garvey *hasn't* gotten a lot of hof press, so i don't know
 what you mean.  
 
 as for ryan, is his w-l better than morris'?  that's what a lot of voters
 tend to look at.  and morris *was* awfully good for a decade, and doesn't
 lead mlb history in walks allowed, either.
