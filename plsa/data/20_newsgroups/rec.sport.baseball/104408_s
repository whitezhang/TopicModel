 why?  do you suppose he's immune to the ravages of time?  he's 37.  
 in a few years he'll be 40.  he doesn't get to as many grounders as
 he used to, and will get to fewer still as his legs go, as they do
 on every human so far.
 
 remember: willie mays was a defensive liability at he end of his
 career too.  ditto mickey mantle.  ditto just about everyone else who 
 played into their late 30's.
