 a-hem. two words: russell davis. playing in the cavern at albany (aa) last
 year (375/410/385 down the alleys and to center), davis went .285/.355/.483
 with 22 homers. there aren't any small parks on the road in the eastern
 league, either. he's 23(!) and his mle was .258/.308/.416, 17 hr. i have no
 fielding statistics, but from seeing him a number of times last year i'd say
 that he's not brooks robinson, but neither is he howard johnson. unless they
 think they can win the pennant *this year* (which seems possible) and need
 boggs to do it, i think they're making the same sort of mistake with davis
 that boston made with boggs, leaving him in the minors for two or three
 years after he'd shown that he was a good hitter.

 hrm? they still have him on the roster (16 ab through the first two weeks).
 they've just never figured out what to do with him. i suspect that he hits
 enough (especially vs. lefties) to be a reasonable shortstop. one rumor
 running around during spring training was that they wanted to convert
 silvestri to be a catcher(!) because "his body type was wrong for a
 shortstop".  you'd think that somebody in the same *division*, who plays
 baltimore about a dozen times a year, would know better.

 if one of our guys went down, i just doubled it. no confusion there. it
 didn't require a rhodes scholar. if two of my teammates went down, four of
 yours would. i had to protect my guys.
