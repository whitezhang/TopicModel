 just curious if anyone has started to standout early in the season in the
 bb ddd this year. i expect the phillies staff, while getting the wins,
 would have to rank up there. luis gonzalez and derrick may are among
 the early league leaders, and all 6 of their bombs have come at the
 phils' expense. neither of them have exactly been know for their tater
 prowess in the past. 
 
 how have the rockies been early? i know mile high has produced a ton of 
 runs, but is it the launching pad everyone expected yet? 
 
 a concerned fan of the bb ddd,
