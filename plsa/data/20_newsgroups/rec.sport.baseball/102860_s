 
 i was watching the dodgers/marlins game yesterday and a couple of
 things impressed me.  
 
 first is that the way the sun was shining in miami, it had a summer
 atmosphere in early spring for baseball.  in comparison wrigley field
 in early april still has a wintry look to it with the dead ivy and
 bundled up fans.  
 
 the second and most important was the fans.  i like these guys/gals!
 i will admit i am a football fan first but i still enjoy baseball.
 it was interesting because most of these fans are only accustomed to
 the miami dolphins.  the way they were cheering, i thought it was the
 afc playoffs.  of course opening day may have a lot to do with it,
 but i really got feeling of electricity that i think is lacking with
 a lot of baseball fans in other cities.  
 
 baseball certainly needs a charge and i hope these two expansion
 teams bring back some excitement.  we'll find out friday how denver
 bronco fans respond. 
 
 phillies are 2-0! (i better say it now before my opportunity passes
 by)
