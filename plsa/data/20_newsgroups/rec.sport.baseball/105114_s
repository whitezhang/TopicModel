   	i saw that quote flashed on the screen yesterday also, and what enraged
 me more than anything was not that george was speaking up agai and complaining
 to the media instead of to the proper people, it was that the idiot reporter
 provided george with an outlet and an opportunity to create trouble.  this is a
 supreme example of how the media can truly control situations.  the local beat
 reporters should know better and should stop trying to one-up each other with
 quotes from the boss.  if they just ignored him, he'd really simply go away,
 and problems would be avoided.  what that reporter did was potentially to open
 up the floodgates again--asshole.
