 how about matt nokes 2 run single against ron darling.  was that a hit or what?  
 while watching the game yesterday they flashed up something regarding the

 mark connor's fault that the bullpen is so horrible!!  here we go again!! 
 george sticking his non-baseball nose in the baseball business.  shut up
 george, just spend the money, get the players and leave buck and the coaches
 and players alone.
