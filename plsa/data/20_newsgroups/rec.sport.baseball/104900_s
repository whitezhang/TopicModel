 	the runner can leave his base at any time.  if the ball is caught,
 he's got to tag up.  if it isn't caught, he _doesn't_ have to tag up at
 all.  so, if he's feeling lucky, your runner at second can sprint for glory
 as soon as the ball is popped up.  if it isn't caught, he's probably scored
 a run.  if it is, he's probably headed for aaa.  
 
 	the only effect the infield fly has is to make the batter out,
 thereby removing the force on the runners on base.  all other rules apply,
 as if you were standing second with first open and the ball is popped up.
