 i didn't mean to offend or anything, i'm just quoting stanky himself on
 the subject. i remember one time last year he was being interviewed by
 espn, and the interviewer (can't remember who), asked stanky if he was
 jewish because he (the interviewer) was jewish and wanted to see more
 jewish ballplayers. to which stanky replied, "i'm polish, not jewish."
 
 so maybe that wasn't the most pc thing for stanky to say, and maybe i was
 a little naive when i posted it. i think we should just devote this
 subject to finding actual jewish ballplayers (i myself am jewish and the
 only ones i ever knew until now were koufax, greenberg, and blomberg).
