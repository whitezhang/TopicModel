 i know there's been a lot of talk about jack morris' horrible start,
 but what about dennis martinez.  last i checked he's 0-3 with 6+ era.
 is the ageless wonder finally showing his age?  does he usually start
 off the season so slowly?  i know he plans to start tonight.   i hope
 he comes around....
 
 i would appreciate any feedback concerning outlook on rest of dennis
 martinez's season...
 
 thanks in advance,
 
 mike
