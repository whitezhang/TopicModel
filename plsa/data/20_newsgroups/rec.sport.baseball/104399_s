 
 i made a mistake on the posted article [been fighting food
 poisoning for last 24 hours...]
 
 the second paragraph should state the following...
 
 "doctors cleared sandberg to swing a padded bat at a ball
 on a tee and to catch a ball in his gloved hand."
 
 sorry for the error, didn't know it until after posting.
