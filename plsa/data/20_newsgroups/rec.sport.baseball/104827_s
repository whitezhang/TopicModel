 i don't really mind the length of games either.  if they want to speed
 the games up in sensible ways, that's fine with me too.  however, what
 i object to is the assertion by baseball people (whitey herzog, buck
 rodgers are who i've heard say this) that games are too long because
 hitters are taking too many pitches, and that the strike zone needs to
 be expanded.
