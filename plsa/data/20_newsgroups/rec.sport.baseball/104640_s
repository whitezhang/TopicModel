 someone on the minor league mailing list probably does.

 i do, but i don't have time to type the whole thing in (i don't mind looking
 up specific date ranges or individual games when i can, but there are
 limits). 
 
 besides, this stuff is easy to find. baseball america puts out a book called
 the directory. it's $10(us). has every team's data and schedule in it. if i
 were to type in the whole scheudle, i'd just be spending a lot of time
 infringing on their copyright.
 
 folks who are interested in the minors should check out my minor league list
 (see the signature), and folks who are tracking down team schedules should
 chec out the ba directory. you can order it from 800-845-2726. i find it
 indispenable.
