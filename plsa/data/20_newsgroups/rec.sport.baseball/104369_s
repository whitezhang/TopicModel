 	strictly from memory, i think the phillies were something like
 	ten games up with 12 to go, lost 10 in a row, and 11 of last 12
 	to lose to the cardinals. seems impossible, but thats how i
 	remember it. i also felt at the time that johnny callison of
 	the phillies lost the mvp as a by-product of their swoon.

 	p.s. in 1964, a single team out of 8 won the pennant; no divisions.
