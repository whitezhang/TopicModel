 while i enjoy the trend towards the more classic style of uniform - 
 and i disagree with the person who wants a return to the non-gray road 
 uniforms - it should be remembered that one of the, if not the reason 
 for the redesigning of uniforms, especially hats (re: the new road all 
 green a's caps and the cardinal navy blue road cap), is the marketing 
 money to be made in sales of new merchandise.
