 	hello, my friends and i are running the homewood fantasy baseball
 league (pure fantasy baseball teams). unfortunely, we are running the league
 using earl weaver baseball ii with the comm. disk ii and we need the stats
 for the 1992 season. (preferably the 1992 major league stat disk) we have
 the '92 total stats but ewb2 needs the split stats otherwise we have 200
 inning games because the comm. disk turns total stats into vs. l's stats
 unless you know both right and left -handed stats.
 
 	so, if anyone has the ewb2 '92 stat disk please e-mail me!
