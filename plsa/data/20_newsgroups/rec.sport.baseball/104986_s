 oh no, i wasn't confused -- i understood that it was your personal
 opinion.  but i thought we were discussing the need to shorten
 games.  the arguments which declare this need seem to hinge on
 the assertion that long games bore people and otherwise discourage
 them from going to the ballpark.  i'd like to see if the increased
 length of games has negatively affected attendance.  if it has, then
 there *is* a problem, and something should be done about it.  if it
 hasn't, then there *isn't* a problem, and there's no need to monkey
 with things as they are.
