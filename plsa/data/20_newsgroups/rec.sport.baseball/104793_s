 just a few lines about my favorite team sweeping the dodgers (one of 
 my least favorite) in la (sweet!).  also the mets (my other least 
 favorite team) loss to the rockies made this this a great day and a 
 great start to the weekend as the cardinals are on the espn tonight.
 
 big lee smith is having a great start and the cardinals seem to be
 hitting in the clutch even though they have had a few games with lots
 of hits and not many runs.  hopefully with the coaches stress on
 situational hitting in spring training, the runners lob will be lower
 this year (probably due to the high strikeout numbers by jose and
 lankford and zeile's off year).
 
 i don't know why all the fuss about the fillies.  the media and all the 
 filly fans on r.s.b forget who is right behind them in the standings.  
 give the wild thing a week or two before he starts blowing some games 
 and we'll see who is in first then.  i believe the cardinal pitching 
 staff is more complete than the filly staff and that will make the
 difference.
 
 on a side note, a few years ago (5-6), a comment was made by some 
 baseball player or manager about the dodger defense.  he was asked 
 where to hit the ball against the dodgers and he replied "fair."  i 
 remember it being in the "they said it" section of sports illustrated.
 i would like to know who said it and what issue it was in.
 
 go redbirds!!
