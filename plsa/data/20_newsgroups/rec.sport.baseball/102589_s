 i should be so lucky: the account number must have been rejected! :-)

 to be accurate, it is "big bang ben" macdonald.

 i hope not.  to think that i would inadvertantly give any pleasure to
 mulroney _really_ ruins my day.  ps: matthew wall: a marvellous ending
 to the section on the expos.

 realizing the taterific importance of this work, john palmer and i
 concluded that we might be able to pool some resources. i have not yet
 gone through the archives that jonathan sent to me; when i do, i will
 send out an "official" introduction to the deep drive derby.
 
 however, i wonder if we need to rename the project, now that the
 principal investigator and research archive have changed. send your
 suggestions for a rename of the study to me, at the address given
 above.
 
 and, just think:  it's opening day.  soon, the balls will be flying
 out (no, get your minds out of the gutter) of the ball parks, and
 helpless bystanders will be injured by balls reentering the
 atmosphere. (and you thought that meteorite showers were made of
 rocks!)
 
 who will be the stars this year? can anyone hope to combat brad
 arnsberg's record start to last year?
 
 the season is young, the balls newly rubbed in mud, the hot dogs
 starting to boil for the rest of the year. play ball (and take cover).
 
 and may all your sliders hang.
 
 vince.
