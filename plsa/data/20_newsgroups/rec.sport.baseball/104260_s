 
 after reading my local paper today, i found out that the phillies
 started the 1964 season at 10-2.  i am not as old as 1964, but i've
 heard many talk about the serious choke job the phillies did that
 season. they were ahead of the cardinals by 15 games that season in
 mid-august.  they managed to lose a bunch from then on and the
 cardinals took the division.  15!!! games ahead and lost it.... i
 hope this season is much different.
