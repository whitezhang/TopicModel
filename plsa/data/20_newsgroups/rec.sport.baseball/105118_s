 sorry, i still don't buy it.  you're certainly right that the runner is
 not out merely for running out of the baseline: he must interfere with
 the play.  but the argument here is over what constitutes interference.
 you certainly cannot infer from what you've quoted that the batter-runner
 must be hit by the ball to be guilty of interference: you haven't posted
 a definition of interference at all.
 
 imo this calls for one of the "approved ruling[s]" that go in small print
 in the rulebook.  something like:
 
 approved ruling:
 if in the judgement of the umpire the runner, by running to the left
 of the allowed path, caused the fielder to make a bad throw, blocks the
 vision of the fielder receiving the throw, or otherwise impedes the
 defensive team's making a play on him, the batter-runner shall be
 judeged guilty of interference.
 
 or
 
 approved ruling:
 the runner cannot be judged guilty of interference in the unless he makes
 contact with a fielder or is hit by the thrown ball.
 
 --
 in the absence of such an approved ruling i claim that this is a poor
 rules trivia question--since it cannot be authoritatively answered.
