 check your facts....andre dawson's career slugging pct is in the .480's
 so is winny's i would like to see your facts. winny has probably done  
 better than 129 points above with a carrer slg of 480. check on more  
 important stats. defense, and heart. batting average. rbi's
 
 peak, and career, especially career, winny ranks in the top 15 outfielders  
 of all time. you are using bs to make your standings. and i would like to  
 know where you are getting your numbers from.
