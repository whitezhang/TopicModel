 i did not write that!  in fact, those statements were a rebuttal to
 an earlier posting that i made, and this was culled from my *strong*
 rebuttal to those statements.  please!  slander.  shame.

 "after the game, it's no big deal" ????   after the employees leave
 the workplace, it doesn't matter what they say about the boss or the
 company?  puhlease.

 first, it's ross porter.  second, i am really tired of seeing the kind
 of response that indicates that all i do is parrot what some media
 person says or writes.  i have a brain.  if i choose to characterize
 something in a certain fashion, it's because that is what i believe
 to be accurate.  it is not just because some unnamed "mediot" made
 the characterization.

 i did *not* brand darryl's response as petulant, because i never heard
 any response from darryl.  i did call him a name.  i referred to him 
 as a primadonna.  someone else concluded that i did that because i
 "hate" him.  i don't hate him.  i think he's a primadonna.  if you
 disagree, fine.  but stop putting words in my mouth.
