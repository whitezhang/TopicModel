 to all the braves doubters:
 
 don't worry.  the bats will come alive, and the braves will come around.
 the pitching is solid, and as long the braves don't have serious injuries
 to the starting rotation, they'll continue to pitch well.  heck, with
 the five starters on the braves rotation, they could even sustain an
 injury to one of the five (i hope this doesn't happen, though).
 
 the bats are there... pendleton will certainly bat over .280, justice
 is catching fire, bream, nixon, sanders, gant... well, there's too
 much offense there to be kept quiet for much longer.  right now, the
 cleveland indians have 7 players batting over .300!  but i certainly
 wouldn't their seven for our respective seven (though wouldn't the
 braves be something right now with their pitching and 7 players batting
 over .300?).
 
 the bullpen... well, it is suspect.  but when the bats come alive, the
 guys in the bullpen will be of less concern.
 
 so anyway, i believe the braves will be tough to beat this season.  i'm
 not saying the braves have automatically won the division, but i'm optim-
 istic about their season (though it's awful painful to watch them at
 times right now).
 
 go braves!!!
