 sounds like darryl being darryl, tommy spending too much time on
 slim fast and needs a pasta fix, and the media being their usual
 "charming" selves.  sounds like a new york-like story to me!!  :-)
 
 i saw the replay and am wondering what the big deal is?  i didn't
 realize the folks in la were making a big to do about it.  i think
 stawberry, lasorda and the various media types should sit and watch
 the replay then apologize to the fan.

 darryl has not gotten off to a good start, he has to blame someone.

 as long as the fan doesn't interfere with the play i see no problems.
