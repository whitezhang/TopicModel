   alomar fans left rbi fans and runs off this list because they are dependant
 on the team. (to a large extent). if frank thomas hit first, he'd lose a lot
 of rbi's; and anyways how many 2nd place hitters have you known to drive
 in 100 runs? doesn't happen that often.....very unlikely with devon white's
 ~.300 obp in front of you...
