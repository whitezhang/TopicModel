 	can't we just stick this guy in the faq and stop responding to him,
 guys? the last several flame-wars with him have been pretty much identical.
 could someone just collect all the articles from this one, and simply
 re-post the entire block whenever he tries to start one? it'd be simpler.
 roger apparently is one of those embarassing specimens who enjoys flames.
 why give him what he wants?
 
 	oh, roger.. you're dull.. very dull... you should get a new act.
