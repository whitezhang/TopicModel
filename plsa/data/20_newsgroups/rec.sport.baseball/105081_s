 i'll post my guesses to some of these and other trivia questions posted.
 
 for most career k's with one team, if it's not ryan, perhaps steve carlton.
 with the rangers, hough was there for a long time.
 
 in the 100 saves department...maybe lee smith(he should have at least
 a hundred with the cubbies, maybe enough with either the rsox or cards.)
 then maybe, gossage?(nyy and sd), fingers (mil, oak)
 
 don't know about the homers/steals dept.
 
 in some other article,(mets trivia), it could be tim leary in at least
 the losing to all teams, maybe beating all of 'em too.  probably seaver
 and koosman fit too.
 
 and in randy johnson's no-hitter, i think it was scott bradley, the
 other half of the old mariner catching platoon, who was behind the plate
 that night.
