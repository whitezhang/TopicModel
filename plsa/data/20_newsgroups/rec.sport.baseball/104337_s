 rogers is the "one-batter lefty" in the bullpen.  dusty has also said he
 trusts rogers to get the final out in a ballgame where beck is
 unavailable, so you might see a couple of saves for kevin.  then again, if
 any of the regular rotation falters, rogers is a possible candidate to
 start, though this would appear less likely now that dave burba did well
 in an emergency start.
