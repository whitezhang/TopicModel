 there's a strong possibility that the bucs have absolutely no other catching  
 prospects in the minors at this point -- at least nobody ready for any serious  
 aaa/majors duty.  the main reason they might have stayed with prince could be  
 just age, especially if spanky was creeping toward his mid-30s or something.
  
 all things considered, though, i'd be a lot more comfortable with spanky behind  
 the plate than prince.  isn't there decent backup backstop out there looking  
 for work?
