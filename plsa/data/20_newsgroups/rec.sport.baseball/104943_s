 highlight/low lights of the series:
 ------------------------------------
 jim deshaies continues to be the surprise of not only the twins, but of
 the american league as well.  going into today's game, deshaies was 3-0
 with a 1.74 era.  deshaies allowed 2 earned runs in 6 2/3 innings, meaning
 his era will climb slightly.  deshaies, who came to mn via a trade with
 philadelphia which sent david west there, continues to make andy macphail
 look like a true genius.
 
 willie banks has put together two solid starts for the twins, going 6.1 innings
 on monday while coasting on solid twins hitting.  deshaies and banks now 
 combine for 6 of the twins eight victories, while tapani/mahomes/erickson are
 0-5.
 
 wednesday's game marked the first opposing left-handed starting pitcher for the
 twins this year (rickey bones).  the twins teed off against both him and 
 subsequent relief, including a grand slam by kent hrbek which pushed the lead
 to 7-3.  the twins pitching staff could not hold the lead, though, allowing
 4 walks in the 7th inning, 2 of which scored and coming with bases loaded.
 tapani gave up one walk before being relieved, guthrie two walks, and mike
 hartley one walk before the inning was over.  this tied the game at 7-7, and
 the brew crew rocked mike hartley for 3 runs in the top of the tenth to win
 it.
 
 aguilera continues to be shaky against the brew crew.  6 of 20 career blown
 saves have come against the brew crew, and today's game was shaky as well.
 coming into the ninth with a 5-2 lead, aguilera gave up a solo hr to vaughn,
 then hits to darryl hamilton and dickie thon before finally retiring the
 side.  once again, the tying run made it to second base on aggie.
 weak hearted twins fans are advised not to watch aggie in the ninth.
 
 general news
 -------------------------------------
 pedro munoz continues to improve as an outfielder, playing in left field on
 tuesday's game.  he continues to bat weakly against right handed pitching,
 though, which has limited his playing time.  gene larkin and jt bruett(former
 gopher) have been playing right field, as both can bat left handed.
 
 the twins begin a three game series with the detroit tigers tomorrow.  starting
 pitching is tentatively scheduled as erickson, mahomes, banks.  the detroit
 tigers have had two 20 run games in the last ten days, and should provide 
 quite a challenge to the young mn pitching staff.
 
 the twins have 9 hr's this year, three each from puckett, hrbek, and winfield,
 the third, fourth, and fifth batters, respectively.
 
 brian harper pegged 4 of the first 6 baserunners attempting to steal second
 this year, and shows much improvement in this category.
 
 jim deshaies has three pick-offs and one balk this year.  some say he 
 has the best 1st base move in baseball.  this move has enabled him to pitch
 out of some tight early jams, and has certainly contributed to his 4-0 
 start.  watch to see if umpiring crews began calling the balk more tightly
 in response to opposing team complaints about his leg kicking behind the
 rubber on the pick-off move.
