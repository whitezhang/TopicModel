 hey folks,
 
 saw the giants play ball at the 'stick saturday, april 17.  it was the game
 where pendelton broke up the scoreless tie in the ninth with a two-out,
 two-run homer to right to win it.  (it wasn't the game where the fans 
 threw the give-away "fotoballs" onto the field in response to the homer --
 too bad, huh?)
 
 well, the 'stick is still cold.  the saturday game ended at 5:45pm, and it
 was cold then.  i can't imagine night games in april at the 'stick.  the
 wind kicked up a little, too, and i got this idea.
 
 at most games, there's a pile of hot dog wrappers and cups and trash on
 the field a lot of the time.  i propose a kid's clean-up corps composed
 mainly of 10-12 year old kids who would love nothing better than to run
 out on the field in the fifth inning (when the guy in the toro smooths
 the infield) and grab the trash.
 
 it might not be glamorous, but at that age i probably would have given
 anything to be on the field with the ballplayers.  everybody wins here!
 
 whaddaya think?
