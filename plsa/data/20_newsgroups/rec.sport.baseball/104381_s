 the other jewish hof'er is rod carew (who converted).  
 
 lowenstein is jewish, as well as montana's only representative to the
 major leagues.
 
 undeserving cy young award winner steve stone is jewish.  between stone,
 koufax, ken holtzman (? might have the wrong pitcher, i'm thinking of the
 one who threw a no-hitter in both the al and nl), and big ed reulbach,
 that's quite a starting rotation.  moe berg can catch.  harry steinfeldt,
 the 3b in the tinkers-evers-chance infield.
 
 is stanky jewish?  or is that just a "dave cohen" kinda misinterpretation?
 whatever, doesn't look like he stuck around the majors too long.
