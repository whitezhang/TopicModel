 the tater that jack morris served to griffey the younger in his first
 at-bat this year went 394 feet, if i remember right (i'll have to check
 my scorecard at home).  i think that's the longest so far in the kingdome
 through the first stand (five games) there.  a weak showing, despite some
 promising taterball candidates ... ben mcdonald, rich delucia, and the
 rest of the mariner bullpen ... making appearances.
 
 anyone have the tape-measure value for omar vizquel's grand slam in the
 skydome?
