 i remember a post from last year indicating that a "pitch clock" was tried
 in one of the minor leagues some time back and did not work.  i don't remember
 why they said that it did not work.  anyone remember this?
 
 jody mcdonnel on wip in phil. has been saying that a pitch clock was
 inevitable.  how would a pitch clock work on throws to first?
 
 another pair of suggestions:
 1. remove the balk rule.  it is the runners responsibility to stay "safe"
    no matter what the pitcher does.
 
 2. if a pitcher throws to an occupied base more than x time (x = 3 to 5)
    without successfully picking off the runner, the runner advances a base
    as if walked.
 
 the no-balk seems to give the pitcher the advantage.  the base-walk allows
 the runner to "challenge" pitcher to throw over to the base.

 i too, find myself surfing when i know that it will be enough time between
 each pitch to allow the batter to adjust his "jewlery".
