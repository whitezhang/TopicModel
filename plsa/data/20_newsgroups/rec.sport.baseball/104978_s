 i agree with the flavor of this post, but disagree with one specific
 argument.  that "has great hands" means nothing.  it seems to me that
 a first-baseman's defensive value is not entirely (or even primarily)
 from his ability to field grounders or catch popups.  how many such
 chances does he get during a game?  many fewer than he gets chances
 to catch throws from 2b,ss,3b and p (i mean the total of these is
 much higher than grounder/popup totals).  this implies to me that there
 is value in catching these throws well, even if they are high, up-the-line
 or in the dirt.  "good hands" are needed for such plays, and thus have
 value.  i don't have any numbers for the relative number of occurences
 of these plays, but i'd guess that the values of these abilities are
 similar.  it's just like: you don't judge catcher's defense primarily
 on how they field bunts and popups. (but not as marked i suppose).
