 let's see... april 15th... less than 30 at bats.... and you claim that he 
 hasn't done too much so far!
 
 cut this guy some slack. danny will produce this year. it's scary to think
 just how much he'll produce if he were to stay healthy all year.
 
 the yanks have a lot going for them this year: good starting rotation, good
 bullpen, good defense and a good lineup. also, i like buck showalter. frank
 howard on 1st is also a good move. everything sounds good so far. 
 
 if the yanks stay healthy, they have a good chance at winning the pennant. this 
 is the most fun i've had watching the yanks since "78!
