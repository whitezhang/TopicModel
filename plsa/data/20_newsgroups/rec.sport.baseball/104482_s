 how do you know this? did lasorda say, before the game, "here's the
 lineup i'm using.  i'm batting strawman fourth because the primadonna
 insists on batting cleanup"?
 
 if this is true (note that i don't think it is), lasorda should be
 fired for at least two reasons:
 
          1) publicly humiliating his players;
          2) knuckling under to his players wishes.
 
 however, i think that the more likely explanation is that lasorda
 wanted strawberry to bat fourth, and that you hate strawberry.
