 wait a minute.  if i read the rules right. a stike is any portion of the ball 
 over any portion of the plate.
 
 
 given that the ball is ~ 2.9 "" in diameter.  this sez that the zone width
 is ~= 17 + (2 * 2.9)  or 22.8 "" . while this is still less than the 23 "
 number given.  i can forgive any ump for misjudging .2" on an object moving
 at 85 to 100 miles per hour many times not in a straight line.
 
 i think the umpires union has a great grasp of the rules!!!
