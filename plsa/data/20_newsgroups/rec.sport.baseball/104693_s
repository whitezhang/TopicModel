 i'm from dallas, and you have alot of nerve saying that wfan has a bunch of 
 hoodlum mets fans.  during the football season, the local cowboy station here 
 had the wip on several times for simultanious broadcasts.  i have never heard  
 a bigger bunch of low intellect, bed wetting ,obnoxious, woofing, cranial 
 deformed, assholes in my entire life!  the iq of the average eagles fan must 
 be in the 10-15 range at best, and they have been known to be big droolers.
