 he's been playing horrible defense. baylor said after wednesday's game that
 he wanted to shake up the lineup a little, because bichette has been
 having a rough time defensively and jerald clark has not been hitting.
 he was true to his word; i went to thursday's game and gerald young
 was in right and daryl boston (who has a very hot bat) was in left.
 baylor was careful to say though that he didn't necessarily mean for
 these changes to be permanent but he wanted to give these other two
 a shot while clark and bichette were not playing well.
 
 in defense of bichette, it looks like right field in mile high stadium
 is a bitch to play. some of the visiting outfielders have been having
 some problems too (although bobby bonilla made a great catch crashing into
 the wall to rob daryl boston of an extra base hit in thursday's game)
