 according to the defensive average stats posted by sherri, baerga had the
 highest percentage of dps turned in the league, while alomar had the worst.
 however, alomar had a higher defensive average.  so who would be better?
 
 using alomar's opportunities (469 groundballs, 73 possible double plays)
 alomar had 332 groundouts and turned 18 dps.
 baerga would have had (with same da & dp%) 328 groundouts and 35 dps.
 
 using baerga's opportunites (545 groundballs, 99 possible double plays).
 alomar would have had (with the same da & dp%) 386 groundouts and 25 dps.
 baerga had 381 groundouts and 47 dps.
 
 baerga looks better, though it's possible his dp% would be lower with a 
 different ss.
 
 will baerga consistently turn twice as many double plays, however?  alomar
 has established a high level of defense, baerga has not.  i would bet on
 alomar to be better next year, but last year baerga was just as good overall.
