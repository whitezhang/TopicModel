 the events i saw were:
 1)  called strike by hirschbeck
 2)  shocked-looking gant asks for appeal to first
 3)  no appeal to first
 4)  gant steps out of batters box.
 5)  hirschbeck *immediately* orders gant back in.  [bad move]
 6)  gant ignores hirschbeck and walks off. [bad move]
 7)  hirschbeck yells at gant.  gant is silent.
 8)  hirschbeck calls for the pitch.
 9)  pitch is called a strike.
 10)  cox argues (couldn't see when he came on the field)
 11)  cox is ejected, players everywhere
 12)  play finally resumes.
 
 gant shouldn't have ignored hirschbeck.  not returning made the strike
 call fairly likely.  although i suspect an argument might have gotten
 gant tossed altogether.  but if hirschbeck had let gant step out, the
 whole incident probably would have been avoided.
