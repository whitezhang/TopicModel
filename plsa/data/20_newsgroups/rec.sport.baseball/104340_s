 does any one out there listen to wfan?  for those of you who do
 not know what i am talking about, it is an all sports radio
 staion in new york.  on a clear night the signal reaches up and
 down the east coast.  in particular, i want to know how len
 berman and mike lupica's show is.  i go to school in virginia
 so i can't listen when there are on during the day.  just
 wondering.

 ps.  did any one see steve sommers on 48 hours last night.  the
 chief was on too, doing rangers round up.  it was pretty neat
 shmoozing s p o r t s on tv.
