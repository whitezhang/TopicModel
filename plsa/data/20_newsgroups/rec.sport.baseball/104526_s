 just wondering.  a friend and i were talking the other day, and
 we were (for some reason) trying to come up with names of jewish
 baseball players, past and present.  we weren't able to come up
 with much, except for sandy koufax, (somebody) stankowitz, and
 maybe john lowenstein.  can anyone come up with any more.  i know
 it sounds pretty lame to be racking our brains over this, but
 humor us.  thanks for your help.
 
 thanks.
 bobby
