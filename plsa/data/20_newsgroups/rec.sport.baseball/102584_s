 there's a lot of whining about how much players are overpaid.  i thought
 i'd put together an underpaid team that could win a pennant.  i splurged
 and let four of the players earn as much as half a million dollars; the
 highest-paid player is frank thomas, at $900k.  i cut some players, like
 kenny lofton, chris hoiles, keith mitchell, tim wakefield, and a bunch
 of pitchers, all of whom could have arguably made the team better at a
 cost of $1 million for the lot of them.  the total team salary is 
 $7,781,500, averaging slightly over $300k a player.  if that's too steep,
 you can dump thomas and bagwell, replacing them with paul sorrento and
 a minimum wager to save a bit over a million dollars, and still have one
 of the best teams in the majors.
