 i don't know if you could call him rushed, but "big" ben mcdonald didn't
 much time at all in the minors. of course that was because the balls used
 in aaa had seams too large and gave mcdonald blisters forcing him to go
 on the dl several times. he's done most of his learning here in the majors.
 of course gregg "wild thing" olson and mike "deserved a cy young" mussina
 didn't spend much time in the minors either. i read somewhere that pitchers
 are less likely to need that much time in the minors anyway so maybe that
 has something to do with it.
 let's go o's! why not?
