 excellent point.  i hope to god that ted simmons doesn't get the weird
 idea of trading for the guy.  and if he does, he had better not
 include jeff king in the deal.  oh god--what if he traded zane smith
 and jeff king for vaughn and greg blosser?  it would be worse than the
 nichols curse!
 
 hmm, i guess that doesn't sound sincere enough.  oh well, at least i
 tried...
