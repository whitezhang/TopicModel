 oh, yes.  definitely.  therefore morris is better than clemens.
 
 don't give me that shit.  if boston had alomar, olerud, henke, and
 ward while toronto had rivera, jack clark, jeff reardon, things would
 have looked a little different last fall.  give credit where credit is
 due.  this lavishing of praise on morris makes me sick.

 i'm willing to bet they don't finish sixth.  i'm also willing to bet
 they don't finish first.  and if you give me 3-2 odds, i'm willing to
 bet that they finish ahead of the blue jays.
