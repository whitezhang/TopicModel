 according to the atlanta paper, bream will be the full-time first baseman
 with klesko used as a late-inning defensive replacement if bream is lifted
 for a pinch-runner. he'd have to hit a homer in his first ab (or win the
 game or do some other amazing thing) to be rewarded with a start so he could
 even attempt to push hunter or bream out of the lineup.
