 	you want a study? look at matt williams the year after
 	mitchell was gone. look no further. not a scientific
 	study, but it'll show the truth for matt. besides, bonds
 	_wants_ to bat 5th

 	if you want an actual analysis of batting order, look up
 	"analysis of baseball batting order by monte carlo simulation"
 	by freeze, _journal of the operations research scoiety
 	of america_, no.22, 1975
