 i couldn't agree more.  the jays have a lot of power in their line-up. 
 so far pitching has been the biggest problem.  maybe we can get acker back? :-)

 one incident that sticks out in my mind was when derek bell ran back out on
 to the feild after the jays had won the division and all the players were
 back in the clubhouse.  bell ran around the field with his arms in the air,
 waving a big towel over his head.  he looked like a big jerk, especially
 when you consider he did not contribute much to the team over the whole
 season.  the next day, winfield and carter somehow got the keys to bell's
 jeep and brought it out on to the feild before the game started.  the stadium
 announcer said that there was going to be a draw later in the game for bell's
 jeep.  bell really freaked out. i don't think bell was to popular after that.
 
 i think that jackson might be trying a little too hard right now.  he's known
 for being a great outfielder,  and he's not the only blue jay who has been
 booting balls and playing generally awful.
