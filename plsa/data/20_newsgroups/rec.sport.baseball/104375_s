 actually, for the padres this year so far it's 23%.  they are 5th in
 the league in hrs, and all have been solo shots.
 
 pythagorean projection puts them at .360 winning percentage
 or 58-104.  need some pitching help, fast!
 
 good news, though, is that hurst has been throwing curveballs
 w/o any pain.  threw 80 pitches yesterday.  should be back
 in a couple of weeks.  maybe we can trade him to the yankees
 for militello.
