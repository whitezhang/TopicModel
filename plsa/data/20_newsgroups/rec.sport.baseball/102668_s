 yes.  but this is *irrelevant*.  you're talking about averages, when we
 have lots of information about this player in particular to base our
 decisions on.
 
 i might as well say "we know that very, very few people are more than 7 feet
 tall, so chances are that manute bol is really only 6 foot 4."

 why isn't lopez likely to hit that well?  he hit that well last year (after
 adjusting his stats for park and league and such); he hit better (on an
 absolute scale) than olson or berryhill did.  by a lot.
 
 as for rushing...  if there really is a qualitative difference between the
 minors and the majors that requires a period of adjustment (and i don't
 believe there is), then wouldn't you rather waste lopez's 22-year old good
 season than his 23-year old very good season or his 24-year-old excellent
 season?  the sooner you get him acclimated, the more of his prime you get to
 use.

 the point was not that 17 ab is a significant sample, but rather that he
 hadn't done anything in spring training to cause even a blockhead manager
 to question whether his minor league numbers were for real, or to send him
 down "until he gets warmed up".
 
 >ok.  most players are not ready for the bigs at age 22 
 
 most players are *never* ready for the bigs.  what does this have to do
 with javy lopez?
 
 >most players 
 >benefit, rather than being stagnant or hurt, by playing at aaa.
 
 see above.

 but i could apply the same reasoning to frank thomas or barry bonds.  most
 players aren't that good, so they probably won't be that good this year
 either.
 
 >now.  the braves have two catchers who have demonstrated solid

 and demonstrated inabilities to hit their way out of a soap bubble.
 
 >not superstars mind you, but solid, experienced veterans.
 
 not superstars, not stars, not even good players.  maybe average, if we're
 being charitable.
 
 >the braves have a very solid lineup with two big bats in the

 >at third and one of the better hitting shortstops.  
 
 ummm.  justice is a very fine hitter.  pendleton might have another big year
 in his bat, but he might also spend the season in hamstring hell.  gant is a
 big question mark.  the bream/hunter platoon is decent (not excellent) and
 has rotten obp or slg (depending on who's in).  blauser is a very valuable
 bat... for a shortstop.
 
 
 >the center
 >field platoon will probably hit .300.  however good lopez'
 >bat *might* be (given the above) it won't be so much better than
 >what they have to offset the differential in experience and 
 >defensive ability.  
 
 wanna bet?  the difference between lopez's bat and olson/berryhill could be
 20 or 30 runs over the course of the season.  given a choice between a player
 with experience and a player who can play, i'll take the latter every time.
 
 >the kid *will* improve playing at aaa, 
 
 just like keith mitchell did?
 
 >i am just so surprised i have to spell all of this out.  my 
 >goodness.  do you believe the other poster who thinks lopez
 >is being held down because of his future earning potential?
 
 that was me, and you so far your only counter-proposal is that they
 really don't understand how good lopez is, or overvalue experience,
 or some combination of the two.  i think my interpretation was more
 flattering to the organization.
