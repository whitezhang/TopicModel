 actually, they're pretty worthless, if you want to evaluate players
 with stats.  rbis and runs scored should be banned; all they do is
 confuse victims of mediot brainwashing like yourself.

 uh, so?
 
 you've just explained why we use obp and slg to evaluate players.
 precisely because the team that scores more runs wins the game.
 traditional baseball stats have gotten way too far away from methods
 which enable fans to see who contributes to those runs scored - that's
 where obp, slg, runs created, linear weights, etc. come in.  these
 simplify matters so that we can more easily measure a player's
 offensive contribution to the team's runs scored.
 
 thank you for making our case.  have a nice day.
