 =>
 =>just about sums it up.............
 
 sure, like ron gant wasn't completely out of line.
 
 if i were hirschbeck, i would have ejected, in order, ron gant, every single
 last brave who came onto the field, and possibly bobby cox, depending on the
 language he used.  since cox was the only brave rung up, i suspect i would
 have thrown him out too.
 
 you simply cannot show up an umpire like ron gant did.  it is disrespectful
 of not only the home plate umpire, but of the dignity of the game.
