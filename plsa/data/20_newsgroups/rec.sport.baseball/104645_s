 well then given your definition of "best" is it not conceivable that
 alfredo griffin could bring something to a team that that team needs
 to win while larkin might not have that something the team needs?
 would griffin then be better than larkin?

 no, i am not trying to define the quality of an individual, at least not
 for the purpose of ranking them.  toronto won with olerud.  they might
 have won with fielder.  they might not have won with thomas.  detroit
 might have won with thomas.  chicago might have won with fielder.  you
 can't rank these individuals.  you can only look at who might contribute
 more to the team effort, which is winning the ws.  thomas could not
 have contributed to that goal any more than olerud so i cannot say that
 olerud is less of a player.
