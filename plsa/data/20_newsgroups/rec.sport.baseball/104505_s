        in terms of peak, and i repeat peak years, winfield has done it  
 all. he has batted in the 340's for a season, drove in 100 and more runs  
 many times in a row before his injury. consistently hit at or near 300  
 while knocking in 35 home runs. have you even looked at dave winfield's  
 slugging percentage for three or 4 of his best seasons. i still think that  
 dave was one of the better of all time, but obviously not the best. he was  
 one of the best athletes evr to play baseball. he hit line drives that hit  
 the scoreboard in left-center field, a feat np one has done in the new  
 stadium. heck, only 2 or 3 other people have hit it over that green fence  
 since it has been remodeled. he could field, had a bullet arm, and his  
 hitting was comparable in many seasons to gary sheffields, and barry bonds  
 of last season. he is older now, and slowing down, takes more of an  
 uppercut to lift the ball out of the park, but he will always be my hero,  
 and my idol. there is nothing that could make me happier than george  
 inviting dave back to the bronx to play his last year of ball with the  
 yankees. of course, he will most likely refuse the offer, but who knows?  
 for 3 million dollars, he'll play. heck they are giving gallego 2.5  
 million this year, having dave as their dh, while leaving him time to play  
 the field when tartabull is injured, or nokes and mass are traded, should  
 give the yanks the inspiration and leadership that will sweep in a new age  
 of yankee domination.
