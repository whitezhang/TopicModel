     the bowler is john burkett, who went to 4-0 last night.  he is
 a bargain pickup on my roto team, i got him at a minimum of $5.

      this is not really true.  excluding last season, the giants
 has been a better 2nd half team.  in 1991, they had a hot august
 to pull to within a few games of the braves and dodgers before
 fading in september.
      the giants may go back to earth, but not as fast as last
 season for two reasons:
 (1)   barry bonds
 (2)   roger craig is no longer the manager.  dusty can manage
       his pitching staffs much better than craig.
