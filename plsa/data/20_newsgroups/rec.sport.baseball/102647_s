 only if you persist in believing that peter gammons is more knowledgable about
 baseball than the average mailbox.  okay, i'm overstating.  still, the man 
 actually had the gall to say that one out of every six pitchers in the nl this
 year did not pitch in the majors last year.
 
 huh?
 
 imo, this expansion will not see the explosive jump in offense that the 
 other expansion drafts had, since the talent was diluted over both leagues.
 in gammons' defense, because the talent drain came from the al as well, some
 increase will be seen.  he also gets credit for mentioning that the 1969 jump
 in offense was due also to the rules changes after the 1968 season.  he's still
 full of it...
