 i believe he was well out of baseball by the time he died.

 uh, he also has been charged with chasing his wife in a car, and smashing it
 into a tree, as well as carrying a loaded firearm in his car. and the 
 speeding reported was over 100 mph; reckless driving.

 i don't know what you were reading or watching, but i sure saw a lot about 
 that, and about dykstra's poker games. most of the writing was along the lines
 of how incredibly stupid and selfish it was, and how he'd hurt the team by
 wracking himself and the catcher up, etc. espn raised questions about his
 judgement, etc. the print media here in the sf area questioned why disciplinary
 action wouldn't be taken against dykstra, and one article pointed out that if
 lenny wanted to kill himself, there were ways that wouldn't endanger other
 people's lives. then there was dykstra himself being quoted on how stupid it
 was, etc.
