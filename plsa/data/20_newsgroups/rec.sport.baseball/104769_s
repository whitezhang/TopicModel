 actually, according to the da information posted by sherri, boggs is superior
 defensively to have.  here's their defensive averages for the last five
 years: [compared to average at 3b, al]
 
             1988        1989        1990        1991        1992
 boggs     .643[+2]    .659[+47]   .550[-54]   .653[+33]   .634[+32]
 hayes     -------     .601[-40]   .622[+18]   .606[-14]   .574[-28]
 
 if hayes is a defensive standout at third, he's done a good job in disguising
 it.  to put it another way, compared to an average third baseman last year:
 
 boggs converted 11 more grounders into outs, turned 2 more double plays, and
 prevented 11 doubles.
 
 hayes let 12 more grounders go by for hits, turned 6 more double plays, and
 prevented 4 doubles.
