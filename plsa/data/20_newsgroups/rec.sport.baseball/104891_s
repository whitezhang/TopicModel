 well, we agree on the last part.:-)  one of the basic things you need to 
 have in a statistic to be able to predict a player's performance on it
 in the future is for there to be a correlation from year to year.  a 
 player's batting average is correlated fairly well from year to year.
 a player's ability to walk or infielder's defensive average are correlated
 better.  that is to say, given their past performance in those statistics
 we can have a pretty good handle on how they'll do next year.  put in 
 some simple information about aging and you can do even better.  one of 
 the basic problems with something like "clutch" batting average - overall
 batting average is that the correlation from year to year is almost zero. 
 adding to the sample size doesn't seem to help much.  as a counterexample to 
 what you showed, consider the following two players from 1984-1987:
 
                non-clutch                      clutch
                ab      h       ba              ab      h       ba
  
 maldonado      1060    260     .245            254     78      .307
 lemon          1643    457     .278            256     57      .223
 
 if you had had these two players in 1988, by your logic, in those "clutch"
 situations, you'd bat maldonado for lemon in a blink of an eye.  well, in 
 1988, maldonado hit .267 in "non-clutch" and .190 in "clutch", while lemon
 hit .254 in "non-clutch" and .313 in "clutch".  before you accuse me of 
 completely cooking the data, there were 96 players who had 25+ "clutch"
 at bats every year from 1984-1988 (according to elias).  as a simple
 measure of clutchness, let's just look at clutch ba-non-clutch ba. if you use 
 '84-'87 to predict '88 for those 96 players, you'd find that 27 of the
 96 were below league average in that measure both in '84-87 and in '88,
 26 were above league average in both periods and the other 43 were 
 above in one and below in the other.  if you were just flipping coins,
 you'd expect to get 24 above/below in both and 48 that switched.  the
 difference between the observed results and the coin flip experiment
 is not statisically significant.
 
 btw, correlating players' _overall_ batting average from '84-'87 with
 '88 gives a correlation coefficient of 0.59, which is significant at
 something better than the 99.9% confidence level.  correlating their
 (clutch-non-clutch ba) for the same period gives a correlation of 
 0.088, significant at no level of any interest.

 actually, it's technically incorrect to say that we can't predict future
 clutch performance.  it's more correct to say that we can't predict
 future clutch performance with any skill.
