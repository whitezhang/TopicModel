 this is certainly not the case.  there is no significant *ability* toi
 perform in the clutch, but clutch performance certainly happens every
 time there is a game-winning hit.  the "clutch pitching" quoted above is
 something which happened, not a claim that any particular player should
 be expected to be a clutch pitcher.

 simple statistics tell me that there is a 2% chance an average clutch
 hitter would have this large a split (the average decrease is 7 points,
 standard deviation about 30).  there will be such hitters in any league,
 just as there will be hitters who hit poorly on tuesdays.
 
 and there is only a very weak correlation (.01 in my best study) between
 clutch hitting in the last four years and clutch hitting this year,
 probably because most of the clutch data is determinaed by luck rather
 than any ability.  *based only on this data*, i don't see any reason to
 pinch-hit for sabo, or any other player who had been a poor clutch
 hitter in the past.
 
 but there are many other factors involved in a decision to pinch-hit.
 does the pinch-hitter give you a platoon advantage?  (any portion of
 sabo's clutch split that results from his platoon split is certainly a
 real ability, even if it has nothing to do with clutch hitting.)  do you
 have a singles hitter at the plate when you need a home run?  do you
 have a curveball pitcher facing a batter who has trouble with curves?
