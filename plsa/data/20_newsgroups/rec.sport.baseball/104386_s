 and thus, we come to one of the true beauties of baseball; these things, along
 with many others will never be separated. almost *everything* in baseball is
 situational and interdependent. this is what allows us to carry on all the
 arguments that we have. if everything could be explained and balanced on a
 statistical basis, none of the wonder and mystery would be left. why we might
 have to resort to just going out the ballyard and enjoy the game itself.
