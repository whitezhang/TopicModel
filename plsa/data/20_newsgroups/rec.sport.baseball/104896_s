 well, my question still hasn't been answered: if spanky was bad enough to
 release this year, why did he get so much playing time last year?  yes, i know
 he was part of a platoon, and that's why he got more playing time than
 slaught, but that doesn't answer the question.  if slaught was so obviously
 better this year, wasn't this also obvious last year, and shouldn't he
 have been taking away some of spanky's playing time against righties?
