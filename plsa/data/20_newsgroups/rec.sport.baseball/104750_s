 attendance in 1992 was down. by .3%. from an all-time record in 1991.
 in people terms, attendance was down by 310,000 from 1991 to 1992. two
 franchises, the dodgers and mets, were down by 1,100,000 from 1991 to 1992.
 had either of them not been entirely awful, mlb would have set another
 attendance record in 1992.

 fortran, "the infantile disorder", by now nearly 20 years old, is hopelessly
 inadequate for whatever computer application you have in mind today:  it is
 now too clumsy, too risky, and too expensive to use.
