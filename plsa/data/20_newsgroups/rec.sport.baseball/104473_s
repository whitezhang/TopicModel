 let's try weeks! it is april 18th today and i just finished reading posts
 regarding the cleveland indians boating tragedy. needless to say, i don't want
 to read partial linescores of games played 3 weeks ago.
 
 as charles mentioned (i excluded the quote): join a mailing list if you want to
 woof (i consider entering 4th inning scores as woofing). thank you. now to
 plug on and read the rest of the posts about spring training...
