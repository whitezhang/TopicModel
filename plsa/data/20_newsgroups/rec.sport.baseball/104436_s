 today, frank viola and rest of pitcher staff of boston red sox shutout chicago
 white sox 4-0.  it is red sox 9th win of this season.
 
 so far, red sox won all the games roger and frank v. pitched (6-0) and 3-3
 when other three starters were pitching.  tomorrow, dopson will pitch again
 (have a good first start and rocky second start).  i wonder that bosox can
 play over 500 ball without roger and frank v.
