 like a single a hitter up there.  who swings on 3-1 count with maddux 
 pitching and your teams down by a run, and you haven't touched the ball all 
 day.  i also think too much is made of that lefty-righty thing.  watching
 the cubs games i get the feeling steve stone knows a lot more about what
 the cubs should be doing than lefebre does.  harry said it best when he
 stated after another terrible vizcaino at bat-- we can't wait til
 sandberg returns!
