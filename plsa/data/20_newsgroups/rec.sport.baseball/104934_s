 	do you remember game 7 of the 1988 nlcs, after the dodgers defeated
 the mets, and ugh-a-dugh foo-boo fat stomach tom lasorda came running out
 on to the field in celebration?  yuck!!!!!!
 	he undulated.  his arms flew up and down, keeping time with his
 rolling set of 9 stomachs, which flew all around the cozy confines of
 chavez ravine.  he oozed, like a white gastropod.  he ran.  it was a 
 disgusting sight.  not only couldn't i watch my mets in the series, i had
 to watch fat stomach lasorda roll around dodger....
 	blargh!

 	"if you like short, fat men, who grunt, curse, and spit a lot,
 whitey's certainly your man" - former wfan host pete franklin, on the white
 rat ...
 	but it's true, this emphasis on the appearance of ballplayers in
 tight uniforms only works if the player actually has an extraodinary 
 physique.  looking at charlie hough's scrawny torso through those tight
 white shirts just sort of makes me decide, "hmmm, i don't want to eat lunch
 today...or tomorrow...or anytime soon...".
 	when al harazin first became mets' gm, he was asked if he intended
 to help redesign the mets' uniforms and change their image.  in particular,
 they asked him about the orange and blue racing stripe that runs down the 
 sides the uniforms.  he said that he's very much in favor of keeping them
 because "they're sleek and they're sexy".
 	sid fernandez, in a tight-fitting uniform, with a sleek racing
 stripe to denote speed and potencty.  mmmmmmmm...lard.
 	kevin mcreynolds, diving after a fly ball.  mmmmmmmm...man o' war, baby!
 	pat howell....well, never mind.  nothing could be tight on him. 
 they don't make uniform sizes *that* small ... :-)
