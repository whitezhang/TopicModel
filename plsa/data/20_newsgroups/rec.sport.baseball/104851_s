 2 simple reasons:
 
 (1)   batting williams ahead of bonds will create a left(clark), 
       right(williams), left(bonds) situation in the middle of the
       batting order.  this makes it tougher for opposing manager
       to change pitchers.
 
 (2)   having bonds batting behind williams means that matt will get
       more good pitches to hit.  this is important since he struggles
       so much with breaking balls.  opposing pitchers don't want to
       walk williams to get to bonds.
