    good question!  i kind of wondered about this myself.  just one
 thought i had on it  -  the babe himself was in "pride of the
 yankees", which made me think
 
 a) that version may be closer to the truth, and 
 b) the babe must have been a pretty good gut to be in the movie even
 though some of the scenes didn't make him look completely flattering.
