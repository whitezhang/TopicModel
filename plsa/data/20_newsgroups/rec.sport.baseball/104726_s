 for an expansion team?  i'm pretty sure i would go with the rings, as long
 as their salaries and ages weren't too high.  i would want the fans to be 
 able to identify the players.  i would like a championship attitude in the 
 clubhouse.
 
 as for larkin and griffin?  salaries aside, i would have to consider which
 player is likeliest to contribute to a ws victory.  past performance, age and
 attitude would all be integral to my decision.  i certainly wouldn't just
 haul out my copy of gillete and pick larkin, as many others would.  and,
 unlike many others who post to this group, i hardly consider myself quali-
 fied to make those kinds of decisions.

 i have never been able to believe it about myself, to tell you the truth.
 it's like banging your head against a stone wall.
