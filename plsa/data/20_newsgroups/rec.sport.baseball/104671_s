 not an astute observation -- this is a straw-bullpen.  the lefties,
 stanton & mercker are strong, and wohlers is down learning a new pitch.
 the bullpen is fine, probably superior.

 also false.  gant, nixon, justice, hunter, blauser present a decent enough
 offense.  everyone is slumping (except blauser), not just pendleton.
 
 btw, what is the story with brian hunter?  is he in the dog house?
