 	the defenition of the underdog is a team that has no talent and comes
 out of nowhere to contend.  the '69 mets and '89 orioles are prime examples,
 not the cubs.  i root for the cubs, because i feel sorry for them, but 
 basically they are dogs.  the pirates today are a great example of an underdog.
 if the rockies and marlins compete, they will be underdogs.  the north stars
 trip to the stanley cup finals was a good example of an underdog's journey. 
 the cubs have a good team this year, and play in a weak division, they are much
 less than america's team.
