 it depends.  if you can get your old veterans cheap, and if they can perform
 at a higher level than your young talent can *now*, why not the talent 
 develop in the minors while giving the fans some familiar names to cheer.
 if the veterans are gone in a year or two -- that should be just about right.

 open question -- which was more important to the expansion clubs, the expansion
 draft or the regular draft.  (they've had one of each, i think.)
