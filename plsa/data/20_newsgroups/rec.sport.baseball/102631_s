 i am participating in an nl-league that uses standard rotisserie rules
 except that the following catagories are used:
 
 for position players:
 	lowest batting average
 	strike-outs
 	caught-stealing
 	errors
 
 for pitchers:
 	losses
 	blown saves
 	higest era
 	'taters allowed
 
 this is the fifth year that i've participated in this blowtisserie
 league.  last year i won the pennant due primarily to the fact that
 i had terrible pitching.  i would like to lower my batting average
 which is rather high because i do have jose offerman (who made up
 for this by helping me lock first place in errors).  anyway,
 someone offered:
 
 andres gallaraga for bud black
 
 i can afford to give up bud black because i still have kyle abbott.
 however, i am afraid of andres actually doing well this season.
 should i make the trade or not?
 
 your comments will be appreciated.
