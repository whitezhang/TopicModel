 is it just me, or does bichette look totally lost in the outfield?  he 
 misplayed martinez fly-out into a double against the expos, misplayed
 alou's single into a triple (alou tagged out at 3rd after over-sliding 
 the bag) and now he misplays another out into a 3 run triple...add in his
 wonderful batting average and we have one heck of a player!
