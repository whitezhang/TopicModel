 tom prince is a 28 year old no-hit catcher.  think of him as a young dann
 bilardello.  i can't begin to fathom why the pirates have been so afraid of
 losing this guy, who's been in aaa most of the last 5 seasons.  the pirates
 released kirk gibson last year because prince was out of options, then
 eventually sent prince down anyway, and he cleared waivers without a peep.
 he's another year older, and still can't hit; why do they think he wouldn't
 clear waivers now?  why would they care?
