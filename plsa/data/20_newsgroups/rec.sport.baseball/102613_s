 do you mean juan berenguer?  he was traded for mark davis in the middle
 of last season.  exchanged one stiff for another, as berenguer hadn't
 come back from his injury in 91.  i think he's retired now.
 
 anyhow, as middle relief, marvin ain't that bad.  he at least can
 pitch a couple of innings or do mop-up work.  i don't know much
 about mcmichael (was he the mexican league guy?), but
 everybody else in the pen is a 1 inning man, except maybe
 mercker.
