 so what is your definition of "interfering with the fielder taking the throw"?
 
 the rule book certainly doesn't have a definiton or clarification, so it's
 possible to interpret the rule as saying that if the catcher has to alter
 his throw to avoid hitting the batter-runner, then again we have interference.
 you know, it seems that there is no way to apply this rule justly--if the
 catcher (or the pitcher, say rob dibble, for example) throws toward first
 and hits the runner running inside the baseline, the fielder takes the chance
 of being ejected.  therefore he probably would throw around the runner or
 (your scenario) above him.
 
 you should note that in our american legion league, (which uses mlb rules) we
 interpret the rule to say in this very circumstance there is interference
 per rule 7.09.
