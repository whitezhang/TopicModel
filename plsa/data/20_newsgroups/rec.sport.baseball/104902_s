 i saw the replay several times too.  no question about it.  daryl missed
 the ball, *then* the fan caught it.  daryl is so tall that he had the
 first shot at the ball.  daryl's just whining again.  i think it shows a
 lack of class when tommy, daryl and the dodgers blame a single fan for
 losing the game.  what about the pitcher who threw up the gopher ball?
 what about the pitchers that gave up 6 runs up to that point?  sorry, tommy.
 if it were a 2-1 game and daryl was 5 feet 2 inches tall, then maybe -
 just maybe - you'd have an argument.
