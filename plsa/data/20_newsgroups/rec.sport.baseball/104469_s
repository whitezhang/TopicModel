 i meant argument instead of agreement.
 also, i think i should add a coouple of ted's positive achievements
 - smiley trade was good for the pirates. but i think ted could have gotten
 someone better than neagle. cummings seems to be pretty good.
 - the cole trade was excellent. but simmons has botched it up now.
 -this year's draft seems to have gone well for the pirates. but then they
 lost 2 high picks in the bonds fiasco.
 
 oh well, i should give up trying to prove that simmons is not a total
 idiot.
