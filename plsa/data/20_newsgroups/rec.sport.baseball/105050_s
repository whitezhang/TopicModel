 quite honestly, this one is ridiculous.  consider the following
 scenario: runner on third. as the pitcher starts to throw home, the
 runner takes off for home and the batter squares around to bunt for
 the suicide squeeze. the pitcher, seeing this, does not throw home,
 but stops in mid action and puts the runner in a run down.  it is the
 balk rule that prevents this from happening.  
 
 believe it or not, this actually happened to me once in an oba
 (ontario baseball association) game in milton, ontario.  i was the
 batter and to my amazement, the umpire missed it.  in the 12 years
 that i played ball, this was worst piece of umpiring i ever saw.
