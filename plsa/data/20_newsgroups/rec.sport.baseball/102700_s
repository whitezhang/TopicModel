 i would assume that the words (i saw the picture) indicated that those 
 seats will not be available for baseball games.  if you look at the picture 
 of the diamond in the stadium, in relation to the areas marked "not for 
 baseball", those seats just look terrible for watching baseball.   now, if 
 they should happen to reach the post-season, i would imagine that they 
 would consider opening some of those seats up, but that is surely a worry 
 of the future.
