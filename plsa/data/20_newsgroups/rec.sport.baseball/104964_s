 yes, but
 
 	(a) we were talking about peak level, not career averages
 and
 	(b) clemente was the best fielding rf of all time, as far
 	    as anyone can tell
 
 i did a quick scan last night, looking for players with a peak comparable
 to or better than winfield.  in my quick-n-dirty subjective judgement, you
 could make good cases for ruth, aaron, ott, robinson, clemente, kaline, 
 maris, klein, jackson, waner, and probably a few others.  this is not a
 knock on winfield, but a comment on his consistency: all of those other
 players had awesome stretches and very good stretches, while winfield has
 been more uniformly excellent.  hall of fame?  absolutely.  top-10 peak?
 i'm not so sure.  top 10 total career value?  yes, almost certainly.
