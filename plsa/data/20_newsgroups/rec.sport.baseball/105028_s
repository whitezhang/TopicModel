 well, i'm finally about to key in the official rules for the archives, but
 before i do, i will ask again...
 
 does anybody have the official mlb rules in electronic format?
 
 just trying to save myself a ton of work...no, they don't scan well because
 of the ridiculous format they're printed in.
 
 thanks
