 
 since roger is a canadian who probably knows nothing about baseball
 i am gonna try to explain it to him in terms of hockey...
 
 according to his logic...
 i can say that since 1988...bob errey is better than wayne gretzky
 
 hey...errey contributed to 2 cups while good old wayne has won nothing...
 (i think the kings should trade gretzky for errey....what do you think roger?)
