 i agree and disagree.  john is saying that the batters efforts will result
 in 4 more wins then losses.  while you are probably correct that 400%
 does not mean 4 more wins then losses, it means something.  i would
 rather have a player who increased my teams chances of winning by 1% in
 each of 400 pas then i would a player who increased my chances of winning
 by .5% in each of 400 pas.  thus, there appears to me to be an obvious
 positive association between john's statistic and winning games.  thus,
 before you disregard this stat, it appears to me that further study must
 go into what sort of relationship there is.

 the only problem here is an insistance that these number mean exactly
 how many wins the team has.  first, we are using averages over many
 seasons and applying them to one game.  second, remember some players
 performance take away from the chance of you winning.  that is a
 player who gets an out gets a "negative probability" in most cases.
 thus, i'm not sure in any given game when you add up all the numbers
 for a team who won that they will add up to 1 in that game.  sometimes,
 they will add up to more then one sometime, less than one.  also,
 the pitchers' bad performances (giving up 6 runs) may have given
 them a large negative percentage for that game.  also, any batter that
 pulled an 0-4 night would give large negatives.

 no, but really only because you have a smaller sample size.  i would
 think however, that the number of runs you score in the first inning
 would be just as good as a prediction as how many runs you score 
 in the last inning.  and, realize something else a closer usually
 comes in in a close situation, not a blow out.  it is hard to argue
 that any runs that a closer gives up in a game have equal importance
 to those given up in the first inning.  look, a closer giving up runs
 often means a team will lose many games.  on, the other hand a starter
 who gives up runs often still leaves his team a chance to win.  the
 offence has many more outs to do something about.  but, i am not
 saying all late inning situations are equally important either.  if
 i am down 8 runs in the ninth, it really does not matter how many
 runs my pitcher gives up in the ninth.

 no, but why would you assume that the teams probability of winning would
 be 0 before the possesion in which the free throws were made.  look,
 if you are down 1 point with 5 seconds left, there is a fairly high
 probability that you will win the game if you are in possesion of the
 ball.  and, do not forget that somebody elses missed shots, turnovers,
 fouls, bad defense, etc. caused a "negative chance" that the team
 would win.
  
 from reading all of the discussion on this statistic, i feel that those
 who critisize it to a certain extent are doing so out of an agenda.
 at first look this statistic valadates clutchness.  but, it really
 does not.  cluthness revolves around the idea that certain players
 in crucial situation elevate their performance and others performance
 goes down.  i've never seen convincing proof that this really happens.
 so, if you assume there is no clutchness, then that means that except
 for a lot of noice, this statistic has a positive association to
 player performance.  there is a way to get rid of the noice if you
 do not believe in clutchness.  certainly, we could find out what
 the average value of a home run is for example.  we may find for
 instance, that a home run increases your chance of winning by 15%
 on average while a strikeout decreases your chance of winning by 5%.
 i bet if this were done we would find that this statistic was just
 as good as other statistics we have for predicting wins and losses.
 
 how do we evaluate relief pitchers?  say john and sam have the
 exact same pitching statistics (runs, earned runs, k's, bb's,
 etc.)  both had exceptional numbers.  john, however only pitched
 in closer situations, while sam was a mop up man.  who was more
 valuble to their team?  probably john.  who was the better 
 pitcher?  they were probably about the same.
