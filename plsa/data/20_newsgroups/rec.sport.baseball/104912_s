 
 i've been a giants season ticket holder for years and never really complained
 about the old ballyard place. sure, it's been cold, the food lines were long,
 and the hired hands were surly, but this was all part of the giants mystique.
 or so i thought.
 
 i went to tuesday's game (3 - 1 giants over the marlins) and the 'stick was 
 a much different place. nothing short of a dome will eliminate the wind, but 
 everything is a lot better. the lines are a lot shorter, the bathrooms are
 clean and have running water, and the hired hands were very polite. 
 
 the new foghorn (lights up and blows after each homerun) and the wooden fence
 are very nice, as are the new bleachers. the bleachers start right at the top
 of the fence and give a great view, and they've got beer stands at the
 bottome of the bleachers. the only complaint is that the electronic 
 old-fashioned scoreboard looks electronic - could be better.
 
 these things should have been done a long time ago, but it took a real 
 businessman (ex - safeway president peter magowan) to figure it out. just 
 like he used to tell his checkers, "if the customers don't come back, i don't
 need as many checkers". this isn't a knock on bob lurie - he was a competent
 businessman but he didn't deal much with the general public.
 
 i'll give an example of how the level of service has changed. the onion 
 dispenser jammed as i was using it. an attendant came over, apoligized for
 the problem and proceeded to fix the machine. after he was done, he cleaned
 the machine and said he was glad to be able to help. in the old days, there
 was no attendant and the folks at the concession stands would say "go to
 the stand 100 feet away - they might be able to help".
 
 all in all, it was a fun day
