 tim belcher pitched a dandy three-hit shut-out tonight as cincinnati won 
 their second straight 5-0.  pittsburgh lefty randy tomlin was hit early and 
 often by the heavily right-unbalanced reds line-up, which managed some
 recently rare power with their bats.
 
 belcher (1-1) was solid throughout and in fact seemed to get stronger as the
 game progressed.  early on he had several three-ball counts, but even those
 were few and far between later on as he allowed only one base-on-balls while
 striking out nine.  in a post game interview he said his change-up was working
 for him--i should say so:  all nine of his strikeouts were apparently on 
 breaking balls.
 
 tomlin (0-1), on the other hand was in trouble early, giving up a second-pitch
 double to lead-off batter bip roberts.  bobby kelly followed with a single and 
 barry larkin scored roberts with a sharp single to right.  the big guys
 (mitchell, sabo, milligan) were unable to get anything after that--in fact
 they all struck out--but kelly managed a score anyway due to a double-steal
 and a tomlin wild pitch.
 
 in fact, it appeared that tomlin was going to recover nicely from his shaky
 start-- he retired 9 of the next 11 batters to get to the fourth behind only
 2-0.  randy milligan, though, had different ideas as his line-shot was
 poorly played by orlando merced and turned into a triple.  milligan would 
 later score on reggie sanders' sacrifice fly, giving cinci the 3-0 lead 
 after 4.
 
 the fifth inning spelled loss for tomlin when roberts led off with his second
 double of the game, and one batter later larkin smacked a double down the 
 left field line, chasing tomlin.  barry later would score the final run on
 tom prince's two-base passed ball.  
 
 the pirates managed their only threat of the day in the bottom half of the
 fifth when merced and kevin young hit back-to-back singles (the second 
 being of the "bunt" variety), but carlos garcia struck out, prince fit a 
 foul fly, and pinch-hitter lonnie smith "k'd" to end any pittsburgh hope.
 
 pittsburgh pitchers backed tomlin up well, though:  relievers blas minor,
 moeller (sp?), and nagel gave up only two hits in their four-plus innings
 work.
 
 barry larkin left the game in the seventh when the grounder he (mis)played 
 bruised his right thumb.  he was taken to the hospital for "precautionary
 x-rays".  let's hope he's ok.
 
 cincinnati is now 4-9, still the worst record in the majors, but with the
 two wins they may be looking at  moving out of the cellar!
 pittsburgh is now 7-6.
