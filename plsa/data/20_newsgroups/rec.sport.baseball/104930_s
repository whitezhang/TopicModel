 um, the header said *career.*  hodapp managed about 3000 pa in his
 nine years in the majors.
 
 as for his "consistently over .300," make that "three years in a row, 
 preceded by a part-time year, plus his last year, with boston."  hodapp
 only qualified for the batting title five times.  
 
 was he injured?  he retired right around his 28th birthday.
 
 anyway, hodapp put up flashy numbers the year *everybody* put up
 flashy numbers.  that was his only really good year with a bat; 
 his other .300 years were marred by a lack of power and an inability
 to draw walks.  only 163 of those 3000 pa were bases on balls, which
 does not describe a feared hitter.  
 
 on the other hand, he was part of the long line of famous cleveland 2b:
 wambsganss, riggs stephenson, etc.
