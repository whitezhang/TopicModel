 no argument at all with murphy.  he scared the hell out of me when he came in
 last year.  on the other hand, the club though enough of boever to put him into
 an awful lot of games (he may have led the league in appearances - he did at
 least at some point).  he seemed to be a very viable setup guy - but i guess
 that's not considered that crucial by the club.  i can just remember two years
 ago so well, though...

 i'm not that concerned.  those guys have been relatively consistent over the
 years and they have no good reasons to decline (no injuries, not old, ...).
 i expect them to come through just fine.  it's those guys that have not
 been consistently good that are the worrisome part, even if they are coming
 through right now.

 this sounds like their old road unis.  pretty dull.  buttons or pullovers?
 i'll check through my uniform book to see if they've always had some orange.

 well, we'll see.  i've got a astros pullover shirt with the "astros stripes"
 across the shoulders and i have trouble making myself wear it in public.  i
 can see why they might want that to change.  gee, if they eliminate the
 orange, will they reupholster the seats in the astros stripes section (what
 used to be the gold and yellow levels - i don't know those numbers they use
 now).
 
 i saw a pinstripe version of an astros cap and i actually thought it looked 
 good!
