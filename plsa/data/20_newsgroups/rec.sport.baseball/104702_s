 this comes up periodically, and i just don't get it. take, for example, mark
 mcgwire. he walked 90 times in 1993. if that's not a potential great example
 of what you're talking about then i don't know what is. now let's look at
 what happens when mcgwire doesn't walk:
   75% of the time he made an out.
   10% of the time he hit a single.
   5% of the time he hit a double.
   10% of the time he hit a homer.
 now, you're pitching against mcgwire. would you trade 20 walks for 2 homers,
 1 double, 2 singles, and 15 outs? i would. why give him the base when you
 can get him out 3 times out of 4?
 then there are guys like alex cole, who has a career .363 obp even
 though he's never had a batting average over .300 (he did hit .300 in
 227 ab in 1990) or hit a single home run. yep, that's right, he's
 *never* hit a homer in 916 ab's through the end of 1992. who'd be
 afraid to throw a strike to him?
