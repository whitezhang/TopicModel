 	the only problem is, dave kingman was *always* taking off.
 rosh hashana, yom kippur, easter, the day elvis died (8/16), the entire
 spring training month of ramadan, purim, the 4th of july (both games 
 that day), my birthday (ok, during the world series, he never had to 
 play there), memorial day (both games that day), ...
 	guys, help me out here.  i've run fresh out of holidays that 
 coincide with the baseball season and i'm trying to catalogue all the
 days in his career that dave kingman (or at least his bat) went awol.
 	a complete religious calendar detailing every holiday in every
 extant religion in the western hemisphere would be appreciated.  only
 then can we truly be certain that dave kingman observed every holiday
 ever conceived...
 	:-), of course ...not!
