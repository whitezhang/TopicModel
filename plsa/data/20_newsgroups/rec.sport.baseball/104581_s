 i don't have a history handy, but i don't recall that the preponderance
 of roy's come from winning teams.  in fact, i think team performance is
 generally irrelevant, as almost always the most deserving candidate wins.
 am i wrong?
 
 and he is not necessarily on a losing team.  while the angels' staff
 is still very weak, their everyday lineup is doing quite well, thank
 you.  snow is playing great.  salmon is learning to make the adjustments.
 easley appears fine, but even if he's not flora is ready to come up.
 between gonzales and gruber they'll manage the hot corner.  polonia
 and curtis are steady and heady.  even myers and orton are contributing.
 
 personally, i think they can finish over .500 which makes them a 
 winning team.
