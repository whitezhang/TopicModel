 	oh, lighten up.  what depresses me is that they might actually 
 finish last, which i believe hasn't happened since their second season in 
 1970.  never mind that gubizca is 0-2 with a 16.50 era, gardner at 7.50,
 our main recent acquisitions (lind, mcreynolds, jose) are averaging .210,
 david cone is 0-2 (about how he was doing in kc before joining the mets 
 several years ago), our hitting sucks, and our pitching has collapsed, 
 and we've won one game at home; they've won more games in their first ten
 games than last year, and brian mcrae is actually batting over the 
 mendoza line!
 
 rich.
