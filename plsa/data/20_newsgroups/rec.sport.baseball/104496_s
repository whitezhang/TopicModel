 the dodgers have been shopping harris to other teams in their
 quest for more left-handed pitching.  so far, no takers.
 personally, i think harris is a defensive liability, and he
 has also led the team in past years for hitting into double
 plays, or at least been among the leaders.
  
 sharperson showed last year that if given a chance to play
 every day, he can get the job done.  if sharpy played just
 one base every day, say third, he'd also improve defensively.
  
 wallach has helped tremendously on defense, as has reed.
 the improved defense is quite noticeable and is having an
 effect on the pitching staff.  both astacio and martinez
 were bailed out in recent starts by great defensive plays.
 martinez pitched into the ninth in a game that might
 have seen him lifted in the third in past years.
  
 astacio lasted 7 innings the other day under similar circumstances.
 the dodgers are turning double plays, and keeping more balls
 in the infield than last year.  and piazza has also been great
 on defense.  he has thrown out 10 of 14 batters trying to
 steal and has at least one pick off at first.
  
 wallach, clearly, has contributed to the over all improvement on
 defense.  but his offense is awful and he has cost the dodgers
 some runs.  but i don't think he is as bad as his current average.
 i suspect he will come out of this slump much as davis and straw
 seem to have come out of theirs.
