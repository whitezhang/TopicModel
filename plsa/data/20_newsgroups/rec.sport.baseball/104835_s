 did anyone happen to see peter gammons on espn last night?  he addressed
 this exact issue, and dismissed it rather quickly.  according to gammons,
 advanced scouts are reporting that morris' fastball and slider still have
 the same zip and that his problems this year are due to his sudden inability
 to keep the ball hidden during his release.  guzman and stottlemyre have
 gone through similar stretches that have been cleared up succinctly by a
 little work with the pitching coach.  gammons looks to see morris back in
 top form within the month.
 
 i, on the other hand, still have my doubts.  morris' era last year was
 rather high for a pitcher who won 20 games.  his showing in the series was
 not surprising.  although i'm not convinced that he's washed up, i have my
 doubts as to whether or not he can ever regain the form he had for the
 twins in '91.
