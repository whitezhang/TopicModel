 	i believe si had an in-depth article on moe a while ago. i remember
 	that the article revealed some new facts regarding the secretive
 	moe. my si subscription expired this past february, the second of
 	two years that i received same. therefore my guess is that the
 	article appeared sometime in 1991-92. 
 
 	can anyone else be more definitive as to a date of the si article ?
