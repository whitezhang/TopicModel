 up to this point, i really thought this had been written by a 
 pro-sdcn, anti-mediot poster blessed with a certain talent for
 sarcasm and biting remarks.  somebody like me, for instance.
 the lurid overstatements were obviously intended to humiliate the
 original poster.

 but then the scales were lifted from my eyes.  looks like robert is
 really being serious.  oh, well.
 
 i compare the performance of the 1992 phillies with the 1987 edition,
 which had outstanding run producers at every position except ss, yet
 finished at a frustrating sub-.500 level.  the 1987 folks didn't 
 ever amount to anything, and neither will the 1992 squad, imho.
 
 any other parallels with previous years' teams for this year's
 editions (in the style of 1993 braves = 1971 orioles)?
