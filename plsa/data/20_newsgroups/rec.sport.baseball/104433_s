 were they palying football or baseball in detroit on saturday?  from looking
 at the school, some people may think it was football.  between two games this
 week, the tigers scored 40 runs!!!!  the offense can carry them, i hope the
 pitching will hold out.  i was at camden yards yesterday, everytime i looked
 up the score was getting higher.  what a great site it was to see the tigers
 kicking butt while enjoying a game at camden yards.  go tigers and go tony
 phillips!!!!!!!!
