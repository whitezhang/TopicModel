 without opening this up for a sabermetric flame war, i would like to
 question the notion that "sitting a rested player down" has any real
 effect on his long-term performance.  sure, if a man is tired and needs
 real rest, then taking a break might be a constructive act.  perhaps if
 a man is mentally "strained", then sitting him down might help to the
 extent that that helps him relax.  but i would like to suggest that
 in the long run, players do slump, and benching is probably irrelevant.
