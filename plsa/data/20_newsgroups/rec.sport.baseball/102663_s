      it depends on which uniforms you are talking about.  for the last
 couple of years i believe toronto and pittsburgh has used the same uniforms,
 or at least very similar.  the home jerseys had the team nick name
 (blue jays or pirates), but the road jerseys had the name of the city
 (toronto or pittsburgh).  i believe this is the way most teams design
 their uniforms.
