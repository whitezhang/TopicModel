 i know.  you have this fucked up idea that anybody who prefers alomar
 to baerga must be a jay-lover and indian-hater.  sorry, you got that
 one wrong!  i hate the jays and don't care one way or the other about
 the indians.  but objectively, alomar had the better offensive year
 last year, so i have to pick him.
 
 you admit t&p as a reliable(?), objective source?  then you will note
 that they rated alomar as the better offensive player, chosing baerga
 over alomar only because of his defense.
 
 that's a joke!  (alomar might not be a gold-glover, but he's certainly
 no worse than baerga defensively.)
