 i don't personally, but clay just posted it.  yes, we do.  
 
 unfortunately, it shows that lopez wasn't as good an example as nieves would
 have been, since his last year numbers were out of line with the previous
 years (which i didn't have access to).
 
 the point remains, though; knowing a guy's minor league history is as good
 as knowing his major league history, if you know how to read it.

 the mle is not a *projection*, it's an *equivalence*.  it's a "this is how
 well he hit *last* year, in major league terms" rating.  so, in essence, he
 has *already* reached it.  i would guess (bob?  clay?) that essentially half
 of all players surpass their previous mles in their rookie seasons.  maybe
 more than half, since all of these players are young and improving.

 did they?  offerman may have been the difference between 4th or 5th place
 and last place, but no more.

 sure; they didn't have anyone better.  i suppose they might have gutted the
 farm system to acquire jay bell or spike owen or somebody if they were really
 in contention.

 if you'd read what i wrote, you'd be less amazed.  nowhere do i claim to put
 any credence in spring training.  quite the contrary; i said that lopez hadn't
 done anything that even the bozos who *do* put credence in spring training
 could interpret as "failure".  just because i think spring training numbers
 are meaningless doesn't mean that bobby cox does; it's just a case of ruling
 out one possible explanation for sending lopez down.

 keith mitchell did very very well at aa, aaa, and the majors over a season,
 then did very, very poorly for a year in aaa.
