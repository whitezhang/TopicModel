 just to add to this vein, consider that range of a first baseman is not
 the only important thing.  he is imo the best fielder of bad throws from
 the other infielders.  i have seen him scoop balls out of the dirt, catch
 balls off a large bounce, take down balls over his head, wide, etc. ad
 infinitum.  *and* he gets the out, much of the time.  some of the things
 he does to save his infielders of errors are amazing.  you have to give
 mattingly credit for being able to do all of that while keeping his foot
 near the bag (yes, i am sure he gets a few calls because he is mattingly :-)
