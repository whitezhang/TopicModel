 last year my nine year old son fell in love with baseball and now
 likes to play and to follow the professionals.  i would like to buy
 him a board game so he can catch a glimpse of and practise a little of
 the managerial stragegy.  i am not looking for a computer game or any
 type of game where manual dexterity determines the winner.  i am after
 something that he and his friends can spread out over a table on a
 rainy day and spend some thoughtful time over.
 
 i would appreciate the names of any recommended games.  i don't follow
 this newsgroup, so e-mail responses would be ideal.
