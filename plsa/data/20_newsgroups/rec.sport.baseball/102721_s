 i tend to agree that players are not hurt by early play in the big leagues.
 the braves organization is a fertile ground to test this hypothesis, as they
 had little talent on their roster for some time.  steve avery, for example,
 was rushed to the majors, and he fared very poorly during his initial campaign.
 his subsequent pitching has not been affected by his 5+ era during his rookie
 year.  bill james pointed out that it was relatively unusual to struggle so
 and then rebound.
 
 bob horner was also rushed to the majors (out of arizona state directly) had
 good numbers immediately.
 
 i am not certain of the ages of people like pete smith, craig mcmurty, and
 derek lilliquist.  the braves pitching staffs were so bad when they came up
 that they might have been rushed.  lilliquist and smith struggled, but it
 didn't hurt ps and dl may have been overhyped.  i seem to recall cm pitching
 well initially, though i don't have stats handy.
