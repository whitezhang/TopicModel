 
 i personally will never forget mike schmidt's home run against the
 expos in 1980 that decided the nl east.  it was also his career high
 48th. 
 
 another home run that i thought was totally incredible was in the
 1986 alcs.  the ca angles had the boston red sox *1* strike away from
 the pennant until don baylor hit a two strike pitch for a home run.
 that was the most incredible turn of events i have ever seen in
 baseball.  the sox later took the pennant away only to have the same
 thing done to them in the ws against the mets.  speaking of the mets,
 isn't it strange how the nlcs that year with the astros almost
 mirrored the 1980 nlcs with the phillies??  the astros have been
 painfully close twice i must admit.
