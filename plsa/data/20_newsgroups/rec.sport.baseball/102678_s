 i believe we are down to two:  the 15-day and the 60-day.  (i don't remember 
 a 30-day, but rather a 21-day.  anyways, it's gone now.)  the period length 
 is a minimum, not a maximum.  you can keep a guy on the 15-day for as long 
 as you want, if he's still certified as injured.  the player must be 
 periodically re-evaluated to determine if he's still injured (thus you 
 cannot park a player on the dl who maybe is out of options and you do not 
 wish to expose to waivers).  if you get someone qualified for the 60-day 
 that reduces the frequency of re-evaluations.  there is no longer, i 
 believe, any limit to the number of players you can place on the dl.  when 
 there was, you often had to choose and juggle your injured players between 
 the lists.
