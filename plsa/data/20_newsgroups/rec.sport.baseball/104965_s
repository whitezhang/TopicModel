 i watched the final inning of bosio's no-hitter with several people at
 work. after vizquel made that barehanded grab of the chopper up the
 middle, someone remarked that if he had fielded it with his glove, he
 wouldn't have had time to throw riles out. yet, the throw beat riles
 by about two steps. i wonder how many others who watched the final out
 think vizquel had no choice but to make the play with his bare hand.
 does anybody think vizquel was wrong to field the ball barehanded? and
 if he failed to field it cleanly, would it (or should it) have been an
 error or a hit? (judging from bosio's grimace when the ball bounced
 past him, he must have thought it would go through for a hit.) whether
 vizquel was right or wrong, he certainly made one hell of a play.
