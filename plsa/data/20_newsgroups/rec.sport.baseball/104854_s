 total baseball, which also tries to evaluate a player's total offensive
 and defensive contributions, gives barry bonds a total player rating of
 9.0 for 1992. only one other player since ruth attained that mark: cal
 ripken for his 1984 season. rounding out the top five offensive players
 in the nl last season: sheffield, 5.9; sandberg, 5.8; van slyke, 5.3; and
 larkin, 4.7.
 
 the top 5 offensive players in the al in 1992 were: e. martinez, 4.8;
 ventura, 4.8; anderson, 4.5; r. henderson, 4.4; and thomas, 4.4
 
 in short, total baseball says bonds enjoyed one of the best seasons
 ever in the game's history -- better than any year had by mantle,
 mays, williams, etc. (if you disagree, don't flame me; flame the
 writers of total baseball.) also, martinez and ventura are neck and
 neck, so given the shortcomings of any statistical analysis, which one
 had the better year can be considered a toss-up. thus, total baseball
 supports your choices of bonds and ventura as the mvps of 1992.
