 enjoy some of these thoughts.  the predictions were made on the

 you all know how things turned out.  the orioles, red sox, and yankees
 all disappeared.  the jays and tigers continued at essentially the
 expected pace.  the brewers and indians cranked in the second half.
 
 the rangers predictably took a dive.  that shouldn't have surprised
 anybody.  meanwhile, as predicted, the mariners dropped behind the
 angels and royals.  they clearly didn't deserve the 22-33 record in
 june.  the white sox and a's upped their game a bit, while the twins
 dropped off a little.  but for the most part things were as expected.
 
 okay, so there were a few blatant errors.  but for a predictive
 calculation, i thought this did pretty well.

 hm.  pete smith made the rotation instead of mercker.  and bielecki
 wasn't released until the end of the year.  i won't comment on the

 right on blauser.  wrong on bream and mitchell.  a bit early on
 lonnie, as with bielecki.  didn't pick sanders.  (did anybody? :-)

 three of them went, right?  showalter is still around (and likely to

 so i got my predictions for gooden and saberhagen reversed.  :-)  i
 was at least *close*, and was right about jefferies.  (though i don't
 know.  has wfan criticized the jefferies trade?)

 close.  no cigar.

 sometimes us statheads get lucky.  grace *didn't* hit behind dawson
 the entire season, but he also finished with only 79 rbis.

 nope.  he slowed down, and the injury finished him off.  didn't
 even reach 50.  but a ballsy prediction, nonetheless.

 the orioles finished seven games out.  none of them won 20 (though
 mussina might have had a chance, with better relief and more starts).

 except for the brewers (who you probably forgot), you were right!  the
 rest of the division was thoroughly mediocre.  the yankees and indians
 "led" with 76 wins, the red sox "trailed" with 73 wins.  none were
 horrible, but four were five or more games below .500.

 he had 211 ip, but didn't win the cy young.  maddux surprised all.

 i don't think i want to wait that long.  but they won 89 games last
 year, and they were fifth in the league in era.  not a bad start.

 looks like it.  he wasn't bad last year, just too consistent to be an
 ace.  so far this year looks like more of the same.

 i honestly can't say.  did they get rid of him?  their bb totals were
 down last year.

 current plans seem to be to use quantrill in long relief.  he has a
 rubber arm and unusual delivery.  he might be decent in that role.

 belle hit 34 hr last year, walking 52 times (but five of those were
 intentional!).  okay, so i exaggerate.  but i *might* have been right.
