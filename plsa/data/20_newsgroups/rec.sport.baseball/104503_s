 does anyone know where billy taylor is?  richmond or syracuse?  he was taken
 by the jays in the rule v draft, but not kept on the roster.  baseball weekly
 said that he was demoted to syracuse, but a toronto paper indicated that
 the braves took him back.  is there an atlanta fan, or anyone reading this,
 who knows?   
 
 thanks
