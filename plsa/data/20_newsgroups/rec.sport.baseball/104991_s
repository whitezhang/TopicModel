 in this morning's paper (or was it on the radio?), vizquel was quoted as
 saying that he could have fielded the ball with his glove and still
 easily thrown out riles, that he barehanded it instead so as to make the
 final play more memorable.  seems a litle cocky to me, but he made it
 work so he's entitled.
