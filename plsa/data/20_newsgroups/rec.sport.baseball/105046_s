 minor point:  shea stadium was designed as a multi-purpose stadium but
 not with the jets in mind as the tennant.  the new york football giants
 had moved to yankee stadium (from the polo grounds) in 1958 and was
 having problem with stadium management (the city did not own yankee
 stadium until 1972).  the idea was to get the giants to move into shea.
 when a deal was worked out between the giants and the yankees the
 new afl franchise, the new york titans, approached the city about using
 the new stadium.  the titans were playing in downing stadium (where the
 cosmos played soccer in the 70s).  because shea stadium was tied into
 the world's fair anyway, the city thought it would be a novel idea to
 promote the new franchise and the world's fair (like they were doing
 with the mets).  so the deal was worked out.

 i'm under the impression that when murph says it, he means it!  as a
 regular goer to shea, it is not a bad place since they've cleaned and
 renovated the place.  remember, this is its 30th year!
