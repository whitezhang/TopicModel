   the roar at michigan and trumbull should be loader than ever this year.  with
 mike illitch at the head and ernie harwell back at the booth, the tiger bats
 will bang this summer.  already they have scored 20 runs in two games and with
 fielder, tettleton, and deer i think they can win the division.  no pitching!
 bull!  gully, moore, wells, and krueger make up a decent staff that will keep
 the team into many games.  then there is henneman to close it out.  watch out
 boston, toronto, and baltimore - the motor city kittys are back.
