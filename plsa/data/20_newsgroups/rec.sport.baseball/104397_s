 
 hi all you ryno fans (and those interested...)
 todays chicago tribune had this written in it today in regards to
 ryne sandberg...
 
 "ryne sandberg is ahead of schedule in his recovery from a broken
 left hand and could be back in the lineup by may 1, manager jim
 lefebvre said friday.
 doctors cleared sandberg to swing a padded bat at a ball in his 
 gloved hand.
 '' i'm not surprised his rehabilitation has been moved up,'' said
 lefebvre.  '' he's a fast healer, and he doesn't like being on the 
 disabled list.  he's been running since he was hurt [march 5] and
 is in the best shape of his life.  may 1 is his target date for
 getting back in the lineup."
 
 hold on to your hats cub fans...more later as information
 presents itself.
