 
 the red sox usually have 2 catchers.  i don't think they have a backup now,
 but they used to use randy kutcher as a backup catcher, as well as a middle
 infielder and outfielder.  you don't need a good 3rd catcher, just a
 competent one, so you can afford to lose a little catching ability and pick
 a player who can be of use elsewhere on the field.
