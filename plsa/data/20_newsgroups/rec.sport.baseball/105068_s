 this is a phenomenon known around work as ready-fire-aim. i am astounded at
 the number of times people post strong opinions about things they not only
 don't understand but publicly admit to not understanding. in fact, there's a
 plausible argument that saves are a more rational stat than wins.
 
 for the record, there are two ways that a reliever can get a save:
 he must finish the game and either
 1. have entered the game with the tying run on base, at bat, or on deck.
 2. have pitched at least three innings effectively.
 a pitcher may not get a win and a save in the same game.

 but this is an argument that *wins* is a dumb stat, not saves.

 this again doesn't support your claim about saves at the beginning of your
 post.
