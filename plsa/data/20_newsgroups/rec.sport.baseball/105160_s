 good question.  it's my impression, not backed by evidence, that general
 south-of-the-borderness seems to exempt one from the hiring-firing effect
 i was talking about.  
 
 back in the 20's there were some attempts to hire black cuban ballplayers; 
 they were rejected by the commissioner and others.

 well, what *did* i mean to say?  aside from some short-lived exceptions
 such as japanese internment in ww ii, only blacks were affected by laws
 regarding: slavery, jim crow, miscegenation, military service, etc.  if
 my claim of exclusivity is not 100% airtight, that is, if you can come
 up with this or that exception, fine -- have a cookie.  but compared to
 this list, no other racial group put up with a legal onslaught worth
 discussing at length.
