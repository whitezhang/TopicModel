 for the second straight game, california scored a ton of late runs to crush
 the brewhas. it was six runs in the 8th for a 12-5 win monday and five in
 the 8th and six in the 9th for a 12-2 win yesterday. jamie navarro pitched
 seven strong innings, but orosco, austin, manzanillo and lloyd all took part
 in the mockery of a bullpen yesterday. how's this for numbers? maldanado has
 pitched three scoreless innings and navarro's era is 0.75. the next lowest
 on the staff is wegman at 5.14. ouch!
 
 it doesn't look much better for the hitters. hamilton is batting .481, while
 thon is hitting .458 and has seven rbi. the next highest is three. the next
 best hitter is jaha at .267 and then vaughn, who has the team's only hr, at
 .238. another ouch. looking at the stats, it's not hard to see why the team
 is 2-5. in fact, 2-5 doesn't sound bad when you're averaging three runs/game
 and giving up 6.6/game. 
 
 still, it's early and things will undoubtedly get better. the offense should
 come around, but the bullpen is a major worry. fetters, plesac and austin gave
 the brewers great middle relief last year. lloyd, maldanado, manzanillo, 
 fetters, austin and orosco will have to pick up the pace for the team to be
 successful. milwaukee won a number of games last year when middle relief either
 held small leads or kept small deficits in place. the starters will be okay,
 the defense will be alright and the hitting will come around, but the bullpen
 is a big question mark.
 
 in other news, nilsson and doran were reactivated yesterday, while william
 suero was sent down and tim mcintosh was picked up by montreal. today's game
 with california was cancelled.
