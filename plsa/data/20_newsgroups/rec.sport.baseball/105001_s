 imho this is the most untrustworthy, silly stat, by today's rules, in all 
 of baseball.  my understanding is to qualify as a save a pitcher cannot 
 pitch more than three innings and the potential tying run must at least 
 appear in the on-deck circle.  also, the lead a pitcher enters with cannot 
 excede three runs.
 
 i believe that the official scorers must assert more of their authority in 
 determining winners/savers/etc.  for instance, a pitcher can come in in the 
 ninth with a lead, blow the lead, fall behind, have his team come back in 
 the next half inning and earn the win.  has this pitcher earned a win, no 
 way.
 
 i guy could pitch five strong innings of middle relief and see his 
 teammates rally to tie the score.  assume he came in to start the fourth 
 and left after the eighth.  his teammate holds the opposition scoreless in 
 the ninth and they score a run in the bottom of the ninth to win.  the 
 third pitcher earns the win and the middle reliever gets no "stat" 
 satisfaction.
