 hrm. sandy alomar, 24 year old rookie: 132 games, .290/.326/.418. threw
 out a few baserunners. benito santiago, 22 year old rookie: 146 games,
 .300/.324/.467. he threw out a few baserunners, too. ivan rodriguez,
 *20* year old rookies: 88 games, .264/.276/.354. didn't exactly suck
 behind the plate.

 true. which only makes it more important to realize when you have one of the
 few. lopez' season last year, adjusted to major league equivalencies, was
 .306/.330/.472, 15 hrs. how bad does he have to be behind the plate for that
 to not be better than olson's .238/.316/.328?

 i would not admire hitting against [ryne] duren, because if he ever hit you
 in the head you might be in the past tense.
