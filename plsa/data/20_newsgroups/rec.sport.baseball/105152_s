 matt's problem is really more ability than attitude.  it isn't that he's
 got it in his mind that he wants to swing away, but rather that he's
 (still) a total sucker for the curve ball.  it looked for a while in
 1990 that he was getting better but it's still his weak point.
 
 as to whether it does him any good to have bonds behind him, the 
 net.stat.mavens will probably tell you there's no reason that it
 should, but if he thinks it will, it might be a self-fulfilling
 prophecy.
 
 as to whether the giants' lineup is optimal:  who knows?  batting bonds,
 the team's best hitter, fifth does seem to be odd, but the #1 and #2
 hitters aren't exactly messrs. oba, so they aren't giving much up
 there.  and although clark isn't the overall offensive force that bonds
 is, he seems better suited to the #3 spot.  assuming, of course, that
 he starts hitting one of these days...
