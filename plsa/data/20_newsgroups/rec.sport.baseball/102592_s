 i thought bill james' latest book completely and totally sucked.  i bought
 it, but will not purchase anything of his ever again without thoroughly
 looking at it first.  what tripe.
 
 the book is inconsistent, and filled with selective analysis.  james
 claims to be looking forward, and then makes some absolutely bizarre
 statements of value.  not only that, but i got the impression he
 probably glanced at the book for about an hour before he put his name
 on it. 
 
 to say i was disappointed is a grand understatement.
