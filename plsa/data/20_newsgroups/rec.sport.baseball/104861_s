 i like the clark-williams-bonds order.
 pitchers can only walk clark with 2 outs (unlike last year).
 
 williams is getting better pitches to hit with bonds looming
 in the on-deck circle.  since matt has a terrible batting eye,
 this helps the giants a lot.
 
 when bonds gets on base all by himself, he can try to steal 2nd
 and then be driven in with a single by thompson, manwaring, or clayton.
 
 if you bat bonds before the other sluggers, then you don't want
 him to run because a "caught stealing" could take you out of a
 big inning.
 
 also bonds is less in need of protection behind him because he
 is such a good base stealer (a walk is a potential double).
 
 the only draw back is when clark and williams are clogging up the 
 bases infront of bonds... and i think that's a problem the 
 giants will be glad to see especially if robby thompson gets hot.
