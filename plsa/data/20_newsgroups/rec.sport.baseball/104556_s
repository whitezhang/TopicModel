 i was *hoping* somebody would mention clutch.  clutch?  baerga?  the
 two words simply do not go together.  with runners in scoring
 position, baerga batted .308/.366/.418 last year.  this doesn't quite
 *suck*, but most batters hit *better* in this situation.
 
 alomar?  he hit .354/.439/.517 with runners in scoring position!
 
 the difference?  alomar had 68 rbis in 147 such ab.  baerga had 81
 rbis in 182 such ab.  baerga got 25% more chances, yet succeeded only
 20% more times.
 
 frankly, i don't believe in clutch.  but if i did, my vote would
 go to alomar for mvp (let alone "best 2b in the al").
