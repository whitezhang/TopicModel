 isn't stark that idiot who writes in baseball america?   twice a month he
 writes a "who woulda thunk it" article which is really the same piece
 every time.   "who would have thought that [buddy biancalana] would have
 more home runs than [the colorado rockies, babe ruth, omar vizquel and
 nolan ryan] combined!"   he's an idiot, if it's the same guy.
