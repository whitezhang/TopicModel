 i agree, lumberjack (except that they're in 2nd)!  they are going places -
 san diego, los angeles, san francisco, cincinnati, denver, atlanta, miami,
 philadelphia, new york, montreal, pittsburgh, chicago, st. louis...and
 points in between.  :-)
 
 but,
 they're 0-3 at home!
 
 i'm just not used to an overly enthusiastic houston fan.  i really shouldn't
 discourage it, so hang in there, lumberjack!  (but, get ahold of that shift
 key, will ya?)
 
 obbase:  apparently the new owner (drayton mclain (sp?)) doesn't particularly
 like excuses.  an item in our paper (the austin american-statesman - "if you
 read it here, it was somewhere else first") said that he wouldn't take 
 injuries as an excuse for losing because that possibility should have been
 accounted for.  uh, oh.  i don't want an owner that'll keep everybody on
 edge - i'd never gotten that feeling about him, but who knows?  does 
 anybody down there in the houston area have a feel for how meddling of an
 owner mclain is going to be?
