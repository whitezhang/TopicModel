 that's the trouble: *what* peak years?  he wavers between excellent and
 very good, with no real bell-shaped pattern in there.  1979 was a fine
 year; 78 and 80 were merely really good.  with the yankees, 84 (i think)
 was the best; that was the one with the .340 ba.  
 
 of course, 1992 wasn't bad, either.  he's been in the bigs since 1973,
 with a one-year intermission for surgery.  though he doesn't have the
 mix of skills that pete rose did, he's like pete rose in one way: he's 
 not a natural hitter.  winfield's swing used to be the ugliest thing
 in new york, and that includes the gulf+western building.  but his sheer
 athletic prowess and physical size made up for a lot.  
 
 fascinating player to watch, even now.  not obviously great in any one
 way; but able to do quite a few things in surprising ways and at surprising
 levels.
