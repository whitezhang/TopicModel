 >>otis nixon.
 
 stole 300 bases.  (ok, he's still light-hitting, but baseball managers don't
 think so, they think he, like omar moreno before him, is a perfect leadoff
 man.  awesome defense.)
 
 >>darnell coles
 
 he's still around because of his 1986, when he hit 20 hr.
 
 >>henry cotto
 
 hasn't played 10+ years in the bigs.  wasn't a full-time major-leaguer
 until 1988.
 
 >manny mota.
 
 consistent .300 hitter.
 
 >billy hatcher
 
 we'll see if he's still around in 1994 for his tenth year.
 
 >herm winningham.
 
 same goes for herm.
 
 >lonnie smith (not light hitting, but a horror in the field)
 
 doesn't count then.
 
 >gary redus
 
 redus is hardly light-hitting, plus he stole 300 bases.  close to
 800 ops career against lhp.
 
 >dion james
 
 we'll see if he's still around in 1995 to qualify.
 
 >daryl boston
 
 slugged .416 to .440 for three straight years in one of the worst hitters'
 parks in the nl.  he's going to be one of colorado's better players this
 year.  plus, to make ten you have to count all the time he spent in denver
 and buffalo and hawaii while with the white sox.
 
 >vince coleman (yeah, he's finally started to have a decent obp)
 
 coleman, assuming he makes it to 1994, was never perceived as being
 weak offensively, though of course he was.  led nl in sb his first six
 years in the majors.
 
 >cecil espy
 
 we'll see if he's still around in 1997.
 
 >willie wilson
 
 wilson has always been overrated, but hit .300 five times in a six-year
 stretch and led the league in triples five times.  but we can count him
 if he's still playing in 1994, though it'll be because he's otis nixon
 deluxe with slightly worse defense.
 
 >gary pettis
 
 okay, if he's in the league this year, he can count, though he's also
 in the majors because of otis nixon syndrome.
 
 >milt thompson
 
 he's not spectacular, but he's neither light-hitting nor a ten-year man.
 
 >gary varsho
 
 halfway there, and unlikely to make it 3/4 of the way there.

 brock suffered from otis nixon disease, but he wasn't perceived as
 light-hitting.  neither was curt flood.  cesar cedeno was *not* light-
 hitting.

 he'll have to steal a lot more bases.
