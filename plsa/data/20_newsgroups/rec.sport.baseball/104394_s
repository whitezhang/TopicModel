 well sherri, i'd agree with you except that most 'kiddies' have more sense than
 to spew their obscenities in front of a group of adults..
 
 i try to edit this newsgroup and feed it to one of the local elementary schools,
 they have a group of students that just love baseball and are learning to use
 computers, but i'm telling you, it's gotten to the point that i don't even edit
 the files anymore, just read them and throw out the trash...  and thanks to all
 you people that think it's wonderful to include a swear word or two in your
 signature files, that's really nice...  i have to read the whole article and
 then toss it out because of the .sig.  don't get me wrong, i know all the words you
 do, (and i've even made up some of my own!) or i wouldn't be able to edit them out ;^)
 but this just doesn't seem to be the place, a public forum, to spew foul language,
 sorry..
 
 thanks to all you people that keep in mind, there might be some decent, young
 people, interested in baseball and computers reading this newsgroup..  they enjoy
 your articles.
