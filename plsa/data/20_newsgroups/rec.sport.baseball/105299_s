 i guess that nobody noticed that the calls during the world series (and, in
 fact all year) have been pretty much consistently correct.  remember: the rule
 says it's a strike if any part of the ball passes through the strike zone.
 
 i would certainly agree that  high strikes are not called (who could argue
 this point?) but all in all i think in and out is called pretty well.
