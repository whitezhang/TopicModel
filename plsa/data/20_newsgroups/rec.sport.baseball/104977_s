 	yeah, maybe that is more likely.  but from the mariners-tigers 
 series, it seems like every time there are base runners, the pitchers 
 seem to purposely pitch around him or give him a free pass.  the 
 funny thing was that griffey was struggling up until the last game of the
 four game series if i remember correctly.
