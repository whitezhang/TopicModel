 i'm not sure i understand this question. when the if rule is invoked,
 the batter is automatically out. this relieves the runners from being
 forced to advance to the next base if the ball is not caught. other
 than that, isn't it just the same as any situation in which a runner on
 a base is not forced to the next base on a dropped fly ball? that is,
 if the ball is caught he can tag up and run (or decide to stay), and
 if the ball is dropped he can have left the base at any time.
