 not totally true.  for the past year or two, the ap has been getting box
 scores from stats, inc.  the ap representative in the press box is actually
 a stats reporter ($25 dollars a game, but free parking.  and anybody can
 do it.)  the box is downloaded to stats in chicago, some quick error 
 checking is done, and then stats sends it to the ap.  i'm not sure where
 the appreveiations come in hear.  i don't think it is at stats's.  it may
 just be a space correction by the ap sports editor that day. 
 
 while i'm mentioning stats reporters, they are always looking for new
 people.  especially if you live in cleveland or pittsburgh, you're road
 to getting into the press box may be real short.  for more info, call 
 stats (708) 676-3322, and ask about the reporter network.  it's a fun
 way to get paid for watching baseball games.
