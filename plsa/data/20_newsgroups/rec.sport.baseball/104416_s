 i wouldn't give baserunning that much value.
 
 the above effect is clear, but there are other effects as well.  if
 olerud hits a double, any runner on first will score; if alomar legs an
 extra base onto a hit in the gap, the runner on first may need to hold
 at third.  thus olerud's doubles have more advancement value than
 alomar's.  (of course, alomar is more likely to score after hitting a
 double.)
 
 another reason not to give too much extra value to baserunning is that
 the runs created formulas work for very fast and very slow teams.  no
 team in the 1950's ran much, but some teams certainly had faster players
 than others.  still, the current runs created formulas work just as well
 in the 1950's for all teams.  
 
 bill james gives the 1955-1958 senators as an example.  they used harmon
 killebrew regularly as a pinch runner, and in 1957, stole 13 bases with
 38 times caught stealing.  yet they scored slightly more runs than
 predicted by runs created.
