 tim wallach can be explained with the rabbitball.  deion can be explained
 as "learning how to play the game".  i'm not betting that deion will be able
 to play as well as last year, but i think the odds of deion playing as well
 or better than he did last year are better than the odds of otis nixon
 doing the same thing.  when you factor in defense, otis was more valuable last
 year.  but i'm not convinced he'll be more valuable this year, and especially
 next year.
