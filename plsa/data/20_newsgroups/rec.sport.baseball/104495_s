 whatever you say.  i think it's just 12 games into the season myself, so
 i'm going to wait a bit before calling names.

 i expect that dave otto will be a really bad pitcher, and i have no
 idea why simmons ever wanted him.  on the other hand, i expect him to
 release otto if he doesn't turn things around pretty fast.  (btw,
 otto's game score for that 0 ip stinker was only 22, which points out
 a problem with the method since otto's performance was infinitely bad,
 and excruciatingly prolonged.)

 i think merced's rookie year was a bit flukey, but aren't you willing to
 give him some more at bats (and tomlin a few more starts) before acting
 so gloomy?

 no he didn't.  walk is a time bomb.  he has no stuff whatsoever, and when
 the league finally realizes this, it won't be pretty at all.

 don't be so fast.  doughty is the guy who signed steve buechele, which
 was a move that threatened to bury kevin young in the minors.
 meanwhile, i'm not sure whether doughty or simmons signed martin as a
 six-year free agent before the 1992 season.
 
 >9) rookie pitchers: worse than expected, especially cooke.
 
 twice through the rotation, and you've given up?  yikes.
 
 >10) slaught: how come he wasn't given a contract extension last year?

 but so has his age, at least in baseball terms.  the useful half-life
 of a 34- year-old injury-prone catcher can't be much longer than a year.
 
 >11) lonnie smith!! well, eric davis was signed for a comparable amount.
 
 but he wanted to be a dodger, and felt he had something to prove after his
 disastrous 1992.  i don't think there was any chance for the bucs to sign
 him.

 he certainly wasn't last year.

 hey, that's the "skates smith" package deal.  anybody who acquires
 lonnie for his defense or base-running (particularly at this stage) is
 a real weirdo.

 if that's the goal of the team ownership, than i don't see why sauer
 gets a zero for making his boss happy.  i don't know what he has or
 hasn't said about revenue sharing, so i can't comment there.

 it's annoying, but since leyland seems to have been pushing for them
 to retain jeff king, it was probably unavoidable.  meanwhile, i think
 bigger accomplishments of simmons' tenure were getting some value for
 john smiley, not trading real prospects for veterans down the stretch
 last year, drafting well in 1992, letting the rookies show something
 in 1993.  foley, smith, and candelaria were acquired to be replacement
 parts, which means that even if fail it hasn't done serious damage to
 the bucs' future.

 does this mean that the bucs lost the initial arbitration case?  i
 never heard the outcome of this.  when will the final verdict be in on
 this?
 
 >now, if this doesnt convince anyone that simmons and sauer are idiots,
 >nothing else will.
 
 i'm not sure who was the idiot in this case, so i don't know who to
 blame.  it might have been doug danforth, after all.  in fact, i
 *seriously* suspect it was doug danforth, who has shown his
 willingness to call the shots at exactly those moments when the gun is
 pointed at his feet.
 
 (btw--i've wondered whether my latest posts have been getting
 off-site, so if somebody known to impersonate e.e. cummings can see
 this, would he drop me a short note?)
