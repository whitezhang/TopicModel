 lou wanted morris all along.  the idiot.  giving the man $40 million
 to play with is like giving a five year old a loaded uzi with the
 safety off.  the only question is how many shots he will get off
 before somebody is wise enough to take it away.

 i don't see why people expect boston to finish sixth.  the bottom four
 teams last year were essentially tied.  boston, in seventh place, had
 73 wins.  the yankees and indians, tied for fourth place, had 76 wins.
 
 now i should think it is obvious that the red sox improved more than
 the indians or tigers.  basically, the red sox are stronger this year
 at 1b, dh, ss, lf, and rf.  they have healthier starting pitchers (so
 far, at least) and better relievers.  i see no reason why they
 shouldn't win ~85 games.  meanwhile, the indians are in shambles and
 the tigers *still* have no pitching.  they will win some 20-3
 blowouts, but they will lose an awful lot of 7-5 games too.
 
 *maybe* the sox will play poorly, win 78 games, and finish fifth.
 but i think third or fourth place is more likely.
 
 cheers,
