 clemens is going on his normal four days' rest (last pitched saturday). 
 hesketh only pitched one inning yesterday afternoon, his first outing
 since an aborted 1-1/3 inning start 6 days before, so he should be plenty
 rested to go in his expected turn this saturday, as the 5th starter.  not
 that this is a good thing, of course.  i'd like to see a well-managed
 four-man rotation with this team...
