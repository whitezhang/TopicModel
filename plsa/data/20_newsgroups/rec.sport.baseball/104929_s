 not if you've scored four runs, you don't!  why strain even the best pitching
 staff?  why not make it easier for them?  
 
 in the 2-1 game, the best pitching staff in the world can't compensate
 for a blown call, a bad hop, a gust of wind.  winning close is the 
 wrong way to win; both keeping opposing runs down and scoring a lot 
 yourself are insurance against the "shit happens" aspect of baseball.
 
 not every great teamhas even *good* pitching.  the big red machine of
 the 70's was league-average in pitching.  but somehow, rose-morgan-bench-
 perez-etc. managed to win 100 games more than once, peaking at 108.
