 this was (my opinion) the stupidest thing in the hidden game. the
 argument was
 
 1) defense, or runs allowed, is 50% of the game.
 2) unearned runs amount to 12% of the runs allowed; earned runs, 88%.
 
 3) since unearned runs are the result of fielding, not pitching, and
 earned runs are the product of pitching, not fielding, fielding is 12%
 of defense and pitching is 88% of defense.
 4) caombining with #1, pitching is 44% of the game, fielding 6%.
 
 pete is usually sharper than that. my own feel is that fielding is in
 the 25-33% of defense range; call it 30-70 between fielding and
 pitching.

 i'd give baserunning a little more credit than that, maybe 45-5, or
 even 40-10. give a team of roberto alomar and a team of john oleruds
 identical batting stats (which wouldn't be that unreasonable), and
 even if you don't let roberto steal a single base, they'll score a lot
 more than the oleruds by going first-to-third more often. (no offense,
 gordon).
