 but why would you want to use rbi?   rbi is an attempt to measure is some
 combination of clutch hitting and power hitting.  if you believe in
 clutch hitting, then look at how the guy hit with risp.  if you want to
 see how good of a slugger he is, then look at his slugging average.  
 
 in terms of evaluating players, rbi totals are better than nothing.  but
 why use them when so many better stats are out there?
