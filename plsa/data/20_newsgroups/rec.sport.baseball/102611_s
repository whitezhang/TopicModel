 greetings baseballers, 
 
 	i have a choice of two more or less identical conferences to
 attend, one in 
 denver, and one in dallas, both may 24-28. could some kind rockies
 or rangers 
 (they do play in the dallas area, right?) fans please let me know if
 there 
 are home dates for that week. i'd love to catch a game. 
 
 thanks, 
 shawn
