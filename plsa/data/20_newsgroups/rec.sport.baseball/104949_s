 	viola has only played in the nl with the mets -- not possible for him
 to have defeated or lost to every team.  ditto for tanana who was mentioned
 in a previous post.

 	i don't remember if seaver managed to get a win against the white sox
 in his brief sojourn with boston so i'd say the other pitcher to defeat every
 team is either mike torrez (he bounced around enough for a long enough period
 of time) or koosman as mentioned.  i would also guess that if one of these
 two did not manage to beat every team he did manage to lose to every team.
