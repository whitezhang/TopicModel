 	this is the crux of the argument (to me at least).  both the
 sdcn and the non-sdcn camps seem to agree on the fact that a catcher's
 defense is basically nonmeasurable at present.  you can talk about how
 important calling a game is, or framing the pitches, or blocking balls
 in the dirt.  but there is little or no way to tell exactly how various
 catcher's rank in "defense".  
 
 	looking at lopez specifically; is there any reason to suspect
 that he is a bad defensive catcher other then the fact that the braves
 (or the media) has labeled him a bad defensive catcher?  as far as i
 can tell he doesn't have any particular problem in his mechanics
 (such as sasser).  he might be a little rough around the edges in blocking
 the ball, or framing the pitch to get a good call but all he needs to
 clear that up is playing and practice time.  i can't see how repetitions
 at aaa are any better then reps in the majors!  
 
 	all we're left with is the calling the game aspect.  olsen  and
 berryhill at always given credit for calling good games and helping
 the pitchering staff.  but this is a reputation that is given to almost
 all veteran catchers.  how is catching at aaa going to help lopez learn
 the major league pitching staff?  the only way any catcher is going to
 learn tom glavine's pitches is to catch tom glavine.  similarly, i wouldn't
 be supprised if the pitcher's claimed to prefer pitching to olsen over
 pitching to lopez because they are used to pitching to olsen.  but 
 given time they will say they are comfortable with lopez.
 
 	now, since lopez can't learn how to handle the major league
 pitcher's while he's in aaa and since he doesn't have any glaring
 problem in his mechanics, what is he going to learn in aaa that he
 can't learn just as well while in the majors?
