 i think there is another formula for era.  i heard something about it last 
 year.  im not sure what it is, but im gonna give it a stab.  it allows for
 a pitcher to pitch more than 9 innings at a time and not benefit, cuz it
 uses outs recorded instead of innings pitched...
 
         era = (er*27)/outs recorded
 
 like i said, im not sure this is exactly it, but im pretty sure they changed
 it to something of the sort.
