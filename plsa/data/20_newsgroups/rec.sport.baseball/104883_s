 in the majors for parts of 6 seasons, total playing time
 approx 4.5 seasons.
 
 just looking at his hitting record, he's had 2 seasons of ops
 greater than .800, which is pretty good for an of.  his
 1988 season is pretty decent for a rookie 2b.  the move to
 third base explains a lot of his 1989.  when he returned as an of,
 he began hitting again.  and of course, last year he slumped.
 
 but no learning curve?  he has obviously improved his batting eye
 over the years, as well as his sb/cs ratio.  as to his fielding,
 he was an infielder when he was drafted, a 2bman as he came
 up through the braves system, and then the braves put him through
 2 position changes in the space of a year.  he's an adequate of,
 although not great, and at least some of your perception of his
 fielding is colored by watching him learn to play the of at the
 ml level.  (i know you're another long-term braves fan :)
 
 about playing 3b...imo, that's the 2nd most difficult position
 to field, after catcher.  at ss or 2b, you need more range and 
 speed, but at 3b, you've got to have quick reflexes and have 
 a gun for an arm.  there are no second chances at 3b, even when
 playing sandlot softball!  granted, i'd still put my best
 overall infielder at ss, but that's because he gets more
 chances, not because the job is harder.  it still amazes me
 that so many teams have tried to convert other position players
 to 3b.  but maybe that's because the supply of "natural" 3b is
 scarce.
 
 finally, gant is a player who puts pressure on himself to
 perform well, and works hard to improve.  you don't get
 those amazingly huge arms on that relatively small body without a
 lot of weight work.  now, whether he's been overdoing it these
 days may be a valid question, as is the question of whether
 he tries too hard to make something happen during each at-bat.
 but frankly, if a player is going to not live up to potential,
 i'd much rather they fail by trying too hard, than by not
 trying hard enough.  you might be able to teach relaxation
 to an adult; but at that age i don't believe you can teach
 hustle.
 
 all that said, i don't think i'd sign gant to another long-term
 contract.  he's 28 now, and i think he's free-agent eligible
 in 2 years, when he'll be 30.  given his career curve and
 limitations, i wouldn't expect him to last much past 35
 as a ml ballplayer.  he might surprise me here, but atlanta's
 got some talent on the farm, and i'd rather take my chances
 down the road with nieves et al.
