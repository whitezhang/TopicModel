 there is a great book out called "they also served" which is about the 
 ballplayers during wwii.  there is some info on berg in there.  it also has 
 info on pete gray (one armed outfielder) and other players of the era.  because
 of the draft many players during the war were those who were exempt from the
 draft for medical reasons.  there are some very interesting stories in the
 book. it is very well written and i would suggest reading it to anyone with an 
 interest in baseball.
