 and not the only quality mariner pitcher.  i logged on expecting to see
 at least one congratulatory note for chris bosio's no hitter, but nary
 a peep.  
 
 so i'll take this opportunity to note that the red feet are now 11-5 and
 slinking out of town without having scored a run in the last two games
 or even a hit in last night's gem.  
 
 not that we m's fans can compare our suffering to those of the followers
 of new england's long-running tragedy, but only one winning season in
 history is something of a burden to bear.  so we'll take our joys when
 we can get 'em.  
 
 the mariners now have two no-hit pitchers on the staff and not
 coincidentally those pitchers beat the red sox in back to back games.
