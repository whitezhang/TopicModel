 bleagh! this was a terrific trade.  snow will certainly be better than
 mattingly in the future, but that they'll be about the same now is a
 defensible opinion.  abbott is one of the few truly great pitchers in
 the game today.
 
 >2.  wade boggs.
 
 i'm not sure about this one.  i think that it's good, in that a
 pre-1992 boggs kicks hayes/meulens/whoevers' ass, and that a 1992
 boggs still isn't all that shabby.  it's bad, though, that the
 yankees expect a pre-1992 boggs, and will probably get a 1992 boggs.
 however, i'd still play boggs over hayes or bam bam.
 
 >3.  spike owen.
 
 you have my full agreement here.  he's not all that much better than
 velarde, and silvestri is just about a lock to be better than him.
 however, i do enjoy the fact that "spike" is not a nickname.
 not that this helps the yankees.
 
 >4.  danny tartabull.
 
 i strongly disagree.  i'd much much rather have a hundred games of
 tartabull and sixty games of dion james than 162 games of james.
 
 
 bob vesterman.
