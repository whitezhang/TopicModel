 the best home run i have *ever* seen came off, believe it or not,
 roger clemens (sorry, val) a couple of years ago. he threw a ball to
 incaviglia which was literally at inky's neck, and he absolutely 
 hammered the crap out of it. after the swing, clemens nonchalantly
 motioned for a new ball--he didn't even turn around to look, or
 even get upset. the ball hit the lights in the left-field standard,
 some 70 or so feet about the green monster (over 100 feet above the
 ground total!)
 
 truly an amazing shot.
