 can anybody figure out why some box score abbreviations make
 absolutely no sense?  (at least in the local gannett rag that finds its way
 to my door.)  i must have stared at "cleman" in the mets' box for a
 good 30 seconds this morning wondering who the hell it was.  wouldn't
 it make more sense to use "colemn"?
