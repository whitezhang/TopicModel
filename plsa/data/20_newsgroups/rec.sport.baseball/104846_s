 your list of jewish ballplayers includes levi samuel meyerle (son of
 jacob and margaret meyerle). although that sounds like a jewish name,
 meyerle's "surviving relatives" say he wasn't jewish, according to
 "nineteenth century stars," published by sabr in 1989. incidentally,
 "long levi" (he was 6-foot-1) batted .492 in the first season of the
 national association, the first pro league. needless to say, he hasn't
 been topped yet. (of course, the na is not considered a "major" league
 by officialdom.) over five seasons, meyerle hit .368 in the na. he also
 played for the first three seasons of the nl, hitting .329.
