 clemens struggled with his control, but was also the "beneficiary"
 of some pretty shoddy umpiring. but to be fair, most of the walks were
 early in the game, and he adjusted. he was also helped by (dare i say
 it?) some pretty good defense by the sox, including rivera playing
 at second, not his normal position.
 
 actually, clemens is pretty lucky that he got the win, considering the sox
 almost gave up the lead in the bottom of the 7th on mo's error catching
 a throw-over.

 must win? in april?
 they've already won 4 more games so far than anyone thought they would at this 
 point of the season... i hope people aren't getting too caught up
 in this streak; it's been fun, but teams have 11-3 streaks all the time,
 and it is only when they are at the start of the season that they get
 so much attention.
