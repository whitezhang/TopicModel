   while atlanta has the undisputed best starting rotation, i feel that their
 relief staff may be suspect.  they don't have a real closer -- although
 mike stanton (4 saves) has been used in that role.  didn't stanton start off
 great last year and then falter?  despite this, your point is well taken.
 atlanta doesn't seem to have the same personality as a ny team, thus is 
 unlikely to self-destruct.  for houston to take 'em, atlanta needs to
 suffer some injuries, particularly to their starting rotation.

   from what i understand, boever and murphy were considered expendable by the
 club.  houston felt that their positions could be filled by a number of
 players..  art  doug jones is the key to houston's success.  he must have
 another great year for houston to challenge in the nl west.

       right!  a strong rotation will take the pressure off of the troubling
       bullpen.

       the unsuspected strength of the lower part of the order has saved the
       club so far.  biggio and finley just aren't doing their job of getting
       on base.  instead of filling his role as an rbi man, bagwell has had to
       assume biggio and finley's job.  biggio concerns me, since he usually
       starts the season very strong.

      on a side note, are you at all concerned with the rumors concerning
 next year's uniform?  there is talk that their road uniform will be
 (blech..) traditional grey, with the word "houston" written across the
 chest.  if i'm not mistaken, their home uniforms may totally eliminate
 the color orange (shiver..).  mclane's favorite color is red, so...
      i'm really upset.. the current unforms are dull and the new ones sound
 horrible.  i'd like to see the uniform of the mid-1980s return.  they
 may not have been pretty, but houston had established a long precident of
 wearing the ugliest uniforms in baseball -- and i liked it.
