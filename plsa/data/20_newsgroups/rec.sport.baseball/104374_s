 he evidentally got hit in the elbow by a fernando pitch.  his arm swelled
 from the elbow to the wrist (or something like that).  they took x-rays
 of the arm and there is nothing damaged.  he missed the last game with the
 orioles, but he is suppose to be ready for the next game.
 
 hope this helps.
