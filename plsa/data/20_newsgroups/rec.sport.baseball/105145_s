 of course you can.  you just have to be careful about what conclusions
 you draw.

 huh?  the 20's and 30's were the *worst* decades for great pitching.  grove,
 vance, dean, and not a whole lot else.  
 
 as for the best all-around hitters, stat-wise, ruth, gehrig, foxx, greenberg,
 hornsby, cobb, etc. all played before the 40's.  stat-wise, the 60's were 
 a graveyard for hitters.

 so?  sheffield also has better shoes.  more time between pitches.  you can
 run the comparison, but there are *lots* of things to take into account.

 well, can we compare them or can't we?

 why?  we can compare players to the *standard* of their era; and we can
 keep in mind era-to-era differences without throwing up our hands in
 despair.
 
 >way there is reasonable basis for comparison.
 
 you haven't shown us what's *un*reasonable about the mantle-sheffield
 comparison that you yourself did.
