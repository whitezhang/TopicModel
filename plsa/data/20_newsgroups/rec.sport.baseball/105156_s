 
 o.k.  it would be a shame for cards fans on the net
 to go through the 1993 championship season without a 
 mailing list to talk on so i would be willing to look
 at starting one.
 
 except there's one little problem...
 
 i don't know the first thing about how to do it or 
 what it requires in terms of resources or time.  so
 if some kind soul could e-mail me the particulars of
 getting starting and managing a mail list, i'd see
 if it would be feasible for me to start a cards mailing 
 list.
 
 thanks in advance,
