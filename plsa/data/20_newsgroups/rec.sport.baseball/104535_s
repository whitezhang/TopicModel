 	no, no no. the ack man is apparently an alien life-form, much
 like the pod people from planet mars, who can take on any form (the
 ability remains the same, however). the ack-people have been spotted on
 many teams to date, but it appears that the orioles staff (mentioned
 above) and the expos bullpen (barnes, walton, fassero, gardiner and
 rojas) have been the prime target. apparently john wetteland was roughed
 up by the ack-people during spring training due to the fact that his
 system rejected the takeover, and has been on the dl ever since. contact
 the authorities! this evil plot must be stopped! (the ack-people can
 keep jack morris and juan guzman, though. i enjoy watching toronto fans
 suffer too much to want these guys returned to normal ;-)
