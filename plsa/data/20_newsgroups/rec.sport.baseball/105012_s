      the giants always hit maddux well, but it was interesting that maddux
 did not pitch around bonds to get to clayton last night.  he threw 2 straight
 fastballs over the plate to bonds in the 1st last night, got away with the
 first one, but bonds hit the second one out of the park.  then in the 3rd,
 when clark was at third base with one out, maddux did not intentionally
 walk bonds, and bonds dropped a single to left-center.

      the braves announcers pointed out that mcgee as a leadoff hitter has
 not scored a run yet.  he will always hit around .300, but i'm concerning
 about his on-base percentage.  the key in the lineup is matt williams, he
 has to stay hot so that bonds can hit with runners on base.

      the pitching gets a set back as bud black is placed on the dl.  burba
 has done a superb job filling in so far, he looks like a different pitcher
 from last year.  however, swift is terrible in both of his starts.  with
 burba moving into the rotation, mike jackson is the only right-handed
 reliever aside from rod beck, he'll get a lot of actions.  i also hope that
 dusty can manage his bullpen better than roger craig, especially on beck.
 i was concerned when beck was used for 3 straight days earlier this week.

      so far so good!
