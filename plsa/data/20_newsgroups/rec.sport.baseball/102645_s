 ok all you trivia buffs, i have a good one for you.
 
 1.  prior to the foul bunt rule what is the record for the most foul balls
 by 1 batter during one at bat?
 
 2.  total pitches?
 
 3.  who was the batter?
 
 4.  who was the pitcher?
 
 5.  same as 1-4 except after the foul bunt rule.
 
 associated data would be nice too (such as date, location, teams, etc.)
