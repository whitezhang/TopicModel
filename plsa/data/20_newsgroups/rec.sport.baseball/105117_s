 velarde hasn't been to columbus, if i recall, for about three
 years.  granted, he hasn't been a full time player but
 when he does play i've always thought he had a good bat.
 he might be demoralized about not playing full time, but
 he hasn't been shuttled around.  i think he's been in new york
 ever since he had 34 hits in 100 ab back in 1989, or 90, i
 believe.  
 i don't think he is gold glove calibre, but he doesn't boot
 it around either.  i think if velarde is given a chance,
 he could become extremely productive.  i don't have any stats
 to back this up, and i don't know if his defense would
 cost any games, but i think he could help - and he has
 this year.  he has 3 hr already.  same goes for
 jim leyrtiz.  he has a big mouth, but he does get
 the job done when he concentrates.  i think the situation
 with leyritz is that he believes he is a potential
 super-star, and he gets pissed about not playing.  i
 think he might have realized something when the marlins
 or rockies didn't select him.
 the yanks need to worry about the bullpen right now.
 kamieniecki and wickman/militello in the bullpen?
 ouch.  i'm praying that the bp will return to last year's
 form....
