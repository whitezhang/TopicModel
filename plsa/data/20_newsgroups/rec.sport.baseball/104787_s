   or you may be posting this way too early and be eating your words by
   mid-season. c'mon, the phillies haven't proved anything yet. atlanta
   was similar to the phils 2 years ago. they sucked. they started having
   a good year, but didn't get any respect until they actually won the
   division. (which is how it should be) so until the phils at least   
   have a good year, not just a good 2 weeks, they won't get any respect
   either. btw, atlanta's .188 ba is actually a compliment to how good
   the braves really are. their record is 6-3. can you imagine the phils
   record if they were batting .188? hahahaha. and atlanta's hitting will
   improve dramatically.  
   no, i'm not a braves fan. just defending a good team. 
   orin.
