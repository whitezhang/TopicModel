 geez.  everyone comes up with clark, williams, thompson.  these guys
 were all up in 1987.  that's ancient history.  so in the last 6 years,
 noone, right?  beck doesn't count.  i said 2 solid years.

 let's see what he does w/o the help of a pitchout every other pitch.
 as i remember, even bob brenly had a good throwout percentage under
 roger craig, who loved to sacrifice the count for runners being thrown
 out.  of course, he suffered from 3 ball 1 strike homers a lot too.
 i am not a big fan of manwaring.
