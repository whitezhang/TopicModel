 hey!!! all you yankee fans who've been knocking my prediction of baltimore.
 you flooded my mailbox with cries of "militello's good, militello's good."
 
 where is he??!! i noticed he got skipped over after that oh so strong first
 outing.  he's not by any chance in columbus  now, is he?  please don't tell
 me you're relying on this guy to be the *fourth*, not the fifth, but the 
 *fourth* starter on this brittle pitching staff.  
 
 as for the o's, it's still early.
 
 
 see y'all at the ballyard
 go braves
