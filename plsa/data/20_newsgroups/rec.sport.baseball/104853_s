 	john smoltz, tom glavine, german jiminez, dale murphy, bruce sutter,
 pete smith, rick mahler, jim acker, jim "break on through" morrison, ron
 gant, andres thomas, gerald perry, ozzie "the aeneid" virgil, lonnie smith,
 jerry royster.
 	how'm i doing so far?

 	on the other hand , ii like the braves *much* more than the
 cubs.  and all i can name is ron santo, ernie banks, and don kessinger
 from 1969, my favorite cubbie season.

 	right.  i've watched enough braves' games to know a great deal
 of their players.  i like many of their players.  the only cubs games i
 get to see while living in new york are those against the mets, and they
 put me to sleep because, face it, watching guys like rick sutcliffe and
 luis salazar doesn't put me at the edge of my chair.u
 
 >	i'll consider toronto america's team before the braves
 
 	actually, i notice a lot of anti-toronto sentiment here in the
 states.  partly because of some of that post-series arrogance (thanks
 in part to "upside-down flag" dork posts), partly because roberto alomar
 is about as exciting as swiss cheese, and partly because, living in 
 baltimore during the winters, i've become so fond of o's fans (especially
 those who call in to rex barney's radio show) that i have to side against
 their most hated rivals.

 	sorry, but mets is spelled with an "m" and a "t".... =)
