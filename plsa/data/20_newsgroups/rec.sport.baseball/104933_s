 stankiewicz?  i doubt it.
 
 koufax was one of two jewish hofs: the other is hank greenberg.
 
 other good players: buddy myer, johnny kling, norm and larry sherry,
 ken holtzman, saul rogovin, ed reulbach.  
 
 there have been over 150 jewish major leaguers.  a few years ago there
 was an article about someone who keeps track of this in spy magazine;
 the article was entitled "jews on first," of course.
 
 there have also been at least two books on the subject.
