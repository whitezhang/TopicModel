 gee, i never knew valentine made a comment about how viola signing
 with boston was gonna bring a world series title to boston.  i don't
 think valentine ever said boston will win this year.  boy, talk about
 sensitive, insecure toronto fans.  :)

 viola is younger, and is left handed (how many left handed starters does
 toronto have?
