 	this list brings to mind possible the worst trade since babe for
 	nono nannette, i.e., milt pappas for frank robinson, i think in
 	1965 ?. robinson proceeded to win the triple crown in 1966 and
 	may have beaten out yaz in '67 but was injured on a slide into 
 	second when he collided with the mighty al weis (chisox).
