 the phillies salvaged their weekend series against the chicago cubs
 by beating them 11-10 in a wild one at wrigley field sunday
 afternoon.  it was the phils only win in the three game series, and
 was the first time the phillies have lost a series in the young
 season.   the phils jumped to a 6-0 lead in the game thanks to 2
 john kruk 2-run homers and two wes chamberlain homers.  however danny
 jackson, and the phillies middle relief was unable to hold the lead.
 mitch williams entered the game with the phillies leading 8-4,
 however candy maldonado hit a ninth inning homerun to tie it.  in
 the 11th, dave hollins hit a three-run shot, his first of the year
 to push the phils ahead to stay.  however, in a shaky bottom of the
 11th the cubs scored 2 runs and had the tying runner on base when
 the cubs pinch hit randy myers for bob scanlan (they were out of
 position players) and myers bunted into a double play to end the
 game.
 
 the phils bring their league leading 9-3 record back to action
 tuesday, wednesday, and thursday against the padres.
