 er..yes.  if manny lee was on your team last year, your team would have been
 the toronto blue jays.

 again.  if manny lee was on your team last year your team would not have been
 the albuquerque leftturns.  it would have been the toronto blue jays.

 that's the whole point isn't it?  clemens didn't get a ring but morris did.

 exactly.  and morris was part of the team.  would the jays have won with 
 clemens?  we will never know.  but we do know that the jays won with morris.

 in baseball could have had a better year than morris had last year.
