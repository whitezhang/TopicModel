 my dad has always blamed the phillies collapse in '64 on me...  on sept 21,  1964,  the phillies had something like a 9 game lead with 12 to play.  i was born on sept 21,  1964.  the phils proceeded to lose something like 10 straight while the cards won 10 straight (does anyone know hte exact numbers?),  and a pennant was blown.  to this day my dad likes to remind me that it all began when i was born!
