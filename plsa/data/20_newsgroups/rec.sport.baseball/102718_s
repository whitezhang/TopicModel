 did anyone notice the words "not for baseball" printed on the picture
 of joe robbie stadium in the opening day season preview section in usa
 today? any reason given for this?
 
 also, i just noticed something looking at the nolan ryan timeline in
 the preview. on 8/22/89, rickey henderson became nolan's 5000th strikeout.
 on 6/11/90 he pitched his 6th no-hitter against oakland. i believe the
 last out in the game was made by rickey henderson. and on 5/1/91, nolan
 pitched his 7th no-hitter on the same day a certain someone stole his
 939th base, which overshadowed it. it seems that nolan is having a lot of
 publicity at rickey's expense. imo, rickey deserves it, and it seems as
 most of the net agrees with me from what i've seen on it lately. they are
 both great players, but imo, nolan has outclassed rickey, both in playing
 and more importantly, in attitude. just my thoughts.
