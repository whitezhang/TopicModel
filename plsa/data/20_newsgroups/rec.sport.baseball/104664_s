 this is true, but the main thing the commish i.e. selig needs to do
 is to suspend bobby cox.  you *cannot* allow a team to come out at
 the ump as the braves did.  i usually rip umps, but in this case,
 the players were dead wrong.  cox should go for 5 games.  if i
 had ever umped a game where that happened, i'd have ejected every
 player that came out.  only cox and gant would have been spared, and
 then cox would have gone in the ensuing argument.
