 beware.  the original poster looks to be from louisville, and chances are  
 louisville gets the edition of the nytimes that is printed in chicago for the  
 midwest.  this edition has boxscores only on monday (and sunday) and an  
 extremely skimpy sports section (few game summaries, mostly just color  
 stories).
