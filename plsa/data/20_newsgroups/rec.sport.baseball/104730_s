   i really think that this is the key point.  when i saw the incident on
 baseball tonight sunday, i couldn't believe how far away from the plate
 gant went.  then he casually leaned against his bat.  i don't blame the 
 umpire at all for telling the pitcher to pitch.
 
   the worst part of the whole incident was the braves coming out onto the
 field.  what were they going to do, attack the umpire?  the only people
 who should've been out there were cox and maybe the coaches, but no players.
 i agree with the person who posted before that cox should be suspended for
 having no control over his team.
