 sorry len, this is exactly how he suffered from being rushed to the bigs.
 being overweight and having no work ethic, leading to being injury prone with
 nothing to loose, might have been corrected in richmond.  (did you intend a 
 smiley after your comment?)
 
 this brings back the long suffering memories of pre-chop braves fans who
 kept being promised the bob horner - dale murphy back to back power slam.  who
 could stop that?  guess we'll never know.
 
 p.s. - rocky fans (are there any yet?)  is dale getting any playing time out
 there?  i plan to be at the game on june 28th, they'll have to play him then.
