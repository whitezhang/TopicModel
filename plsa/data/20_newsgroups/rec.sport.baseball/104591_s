 i happen to be a big fan of jayson stark.  he is a baseball writer for the 
 philadelphia inquirer.  every tuesday he writes a "week in review" column.  
 he writes about unusual situations that occured during the week.  unusual
 stats.  he has a section called "kinerisms of the week" which are stupid
 lines by mets brodcaster ralph kiner.  every year he has the lgtgah contest.
 that stands for "last guy to get a hit."  he also writes for baseball 
 america.  that column is sort of a highlights of "week in review."  if you 
 can, check his column out sometime.  he might make you laugh.
