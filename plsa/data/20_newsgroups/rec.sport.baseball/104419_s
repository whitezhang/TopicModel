 mr. hernandez Ñ-
   
    i apologize for the misunderstanding.  i explained that i know that it
 is essential for some fans to get scores here, for they cannot get them
 elsewhere.  i have no problem with what you do, posting scores after the
 games have been completed.  however, like i said earlier, i don't think it
 is a necessity to post scores during the middle of games, like some others
 have come to practice.
