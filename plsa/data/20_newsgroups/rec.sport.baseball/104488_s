 well, i agree that viola is a better signing.  however, why does
 everyone say that you want lefthanded starters?  i understand lefthanded
 spot relievers, even though they usually face more righthanded batters
 than lefthanded batters.  i just don't understand why people insist
 on lefthanded starters, unless there is a park effect (e.g., yankee stadium).
 most batters in mlb are righthanded, so righthanded starters will have
 the platoon advantage more often than lefthanded starters.
 i guess one argument for lefty starters is that certain teams
 may be more vulnerable to lhp's than rhp's.  however, this is probably
 only a factor in the postseason, because teams seldom juggle their starters
 for this reason during the regular season.
 
 i think you just want the best starters you can get, regardless of
 whether they are lefties or righties.  lefthanded starters tend to have
 higher era's than righthanded starters, precisely because managers
 go out of their way to start inferior lefties (or perhaps because of
 the platoon advantage).
 
 am i missing something here?
