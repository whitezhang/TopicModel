 i am interested in uncovering statistics on boston red sox players from
 march 1992 - present.  i want to look at changes in batting average, hits,
 multi-hit games, runs, stolen bases, and on base % during
 every game.  where can
 i find this information?  do any sports magazines log this info or do i
 have to go directly to the ball club?
 thanks for the info.  kip
