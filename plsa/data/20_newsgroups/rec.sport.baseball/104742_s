 okay, i think we all agree that singles hitters should take a
 strike or two and try to get on base any way they can.
 
 so the "no power/impatient" guys have no excuse.
 the "no power/patient" guys are doing the right thing.
 
 now the "impatient/power" guys (how could you leave out the big cat?).
 would these guys have a better slugging percentage if they took
 more pitches?   perhaps, but i doubt it.  if you tell joe carter
 to go up there and take a few pitches, he will draw more walks, but
 he also won't hit as many frozen ropes into the bleachers because
 he is more likely to hold back on a pitch that he used to drive.
 
 the "patient/power" guys?   joe morgan had a small strike zone and
 rickey henderson has "a strike zone the size of hitler's heart" 
 so they get their walks based on the small zone.
 
 look at the other 5 guys: thomas, bonds, mcgwire, ruth and williams.  wow!
 a lot of pitchers would rather nibble at the corners and maybe
 walk these guys that to throw a clear strike to them.
 the pitchers would do better (in my opinion) by just coming after
 them with a good fastball for a strike on the first pitch, but pitchers
 would rather nibble, go 2-0 or 3-1 and then get hurt.
