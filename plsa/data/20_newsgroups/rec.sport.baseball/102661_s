 depends on what you mean by "for a living".  1974 was the year he led the
 league in pinch-hit at bats with 50, but he'd been getting a lot of ph abs
 earlier than that, and was never a full-time player.  20-35 ph abs early in
 his career, 15-20 a year just before going to the dodgers, and 30-50 in the
 peak years.
 
 we're talking about a guy with a 20-year career as an outfielder, a .300+
 career batting average, and 1130 or so career hits.
