 first, a longer game in no way suggests "more baseball to watch," unless
 you include watching the grass grow as baseball.  the lengthier games
 are so because of batters stepping out of the box, pitchers taking
 longer between pitches and excessive trips to the mound by managers
 and pitching coaches.
 
 and while it's true that the gaps between plays can be interesting, this
 is only true when they don't become extra-long.  quickly-pitched games
 can grab and hold your attention much better.
 
 bring back the two-hour baseball game!  (and the three and a half hour
 golf game with it!)
