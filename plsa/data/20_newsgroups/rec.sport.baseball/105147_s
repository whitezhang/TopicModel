 interesting article, craig.  it's amazing how hard it is to get baseball
 teams to understand how to properly market their teams and treat their
 customers.  no other business could ever get away with the 19th century 
 attitudes that most current owners display in running their clubs.  i guess the
 owners look at baseball's high growth rate and ask why it's necessary
 to bring 20th century business practices into the game, but they don't
 realize how much more growth the game is capable of and how much they
 pay in terms of long-term popularity by not doing better by the game
 and its fans.
