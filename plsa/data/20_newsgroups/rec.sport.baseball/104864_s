 the answer is - they're stupid.  seriously, i think you're right
 on the money; i've never understood the preoccupation with making
 sure a rotation has left-handed starters.  the only time it makes
 sense to me is when you have an unbalanced schedule and your main
 rival(s) is loaded with lefthanded hitters.  other than that, i think
 you're completely right.
