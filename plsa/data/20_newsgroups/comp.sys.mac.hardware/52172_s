  this is a pet peeve of mine. i wish companies would put power switches on the
  front of the equipment! if my apple monitor had the switch on the front, i
  would happily power it off at night. almost every piece of computer equipment
  i own/use has the switch on the back (including external hard drives and
  modems--why?). i hope front-mounted switches become the norm, and soon.
