 hello,
 
 we need the code for decompression of quicktime jpeg pict files, as they
 don't conform to usual jpeg compressors, which are available in source.
 the code should be in c pascal or modula. the code will be used on several
 platforms to view pictures over isdn. perhaps a special hardware will be
 put around it (much less then a mac! perhaps only a dsp with some support
 chips)
 if the code is not available, perhaps the algorithm is available to
 decompress
 them.
