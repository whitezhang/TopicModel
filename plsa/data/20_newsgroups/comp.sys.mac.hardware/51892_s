 {send follow ups to comp.sys.mac.advocacy. sorry about the header but the 
 pnews here does not let one easily change the headers and i gave up after a 
 year of trying. this sheet is also available by ftp on sumex-aim.stanford.edu 
 (36.44.0.6) in the info-mac/report as mac-ibm-compare177.txt.}
 mac & ibm info-version 1.7.7
 
 the reason for this general data sheet is to consolidate and condense the 
 information out there, so that people in both camps can be clear and accurate 
 about what they are saying about their machines.  since computer technology 
 is always changing there are always going to be points in which the sheet will 
 be lacking or incorrect on information.  so, please just don't say the sheet 
 is incomplete or incorrect but also give me clear and concise information to 
 make the needed corrections.  all prices are in us dollars.
 to keep this data sheet organized please provide, if possible, article 
 citations for the information provided or corrected and keep the opinions to 
 a minimum.  as this is a general data sheet, keep the info provided simple so 
 i can understand what is being talked about and can explain it to others. 
 finally, keep the information relevant to the section corrected {for example, 
 os code in rom is software contained in hardware, so no more of the 'but it 
 is supported in os disk software' data for the hardware section, please}. 
 thank you.
 note:  for proper reading off line this document should be in 9 point monaco.

 the cpus
  note: i am only showing motorola & intel cpus used in mac and most ibm/pc 
 clone machines. for example, since apple never used the motorola 68008 and 
 68010 in the mac these chips are not listed. years only appear with dead cpus 
 and indicate first to last year used as a cpu.
 cache note:  both ibm and mac use caches external to the cpus. these external 
 caches increase the speed of the cpu but are not a part of it.  in most of 
 the present macs there are external caches built-in while with ibm they are 
 optional {though machines are generally sold with them installed}.  since 
 there are many different external caches {cpu-mac and ibm; scsi, video, disk 
 and static ram-mac}, each having a different effect on cpu performance, and 
 they are machine {32kb static ram cache in iici, iifx, and iivx}, seller 
 {cache card installed in some iicis} or expansion {iici cache cards go up to 
 128kb} dependent, i have decided to leave them out of the list.

 ***the 040 has 2 clocks, an internal processor clock [pclk] that is 2x freq of 
 external bus clock [bclk] which is the one used to rate the chips 
 (bradley lamont; motorola 68040 data book).  some compilers produce programs 
 sensitive to the pclk and so they act as if the 68040 was a clock doubler 
 chip, but this very compiler and program dependent.  compliers maybe written 
 to allow programs to take consitant advantage of the 68040's pclk in the 
 future.  as it is now, studies such as one in a byte article {which showed 
 040/25 ~486/50 and roughly ~486dx2/50} are very dependent on the machine, os, 
 and programs tested and as such are not representative of general performance.

 cpus comparison list
 as a general rule of thumb motorola chips are faster than intel chips at the 
 same frequency {030/25 ~= 386/33; 040/25 ~= 486dx/50}, but intel has chips at 
 higher frequencies than motorola, so this evens out.  the macintosh bible 4th 
 ed. supports the comparisons between intel and motorola chips for the 68020 
 and above.
 
 <=80186    ~ 68000 {16-bit vs 16/24/32-bit chip [data path/address 
 lines/data & address registers].  the 4mb limit on the 68000 macs brings it 
 down to the 80186 and lower chips, otherwise it would compare to the 80286.}
 
 286        ~ 68020 {hardware segmenting vs. 68020's 32-bit alu and these chips 
 come have no usable built-in mmu unlike their successors [80386, 68030].  the 
 hardware segmenting's protected mode is used by os/2 1.0 => and windows 3.x. 
 the use of the hardware segmenting and their 16-bit nature put the 286 between 
 the 60000 and 68030 in features and the lc's 16-bit data path strenghthens the 
 286 ~ 68020 comparison.}
 
 386       ~ 68030 {two 32-bit chips with mmus, and protected memory.  a/ux 3.0 
 is at present the only mac os to use the 68030's protected memory feature for 
 apps.  system 7.x uses this feature to protect a ram disk created by the 
 memory control panel but this is supported only on powerbooks and quadras.  
 the color classic and lcii 16-bit hardware data paths makes the 68030s in them 
 comparative to 386sxs.}
 
 486sx   ~ 68lc040 {same as 486 and 68040 without the fpu; used as a low cost 
 solution for people who do not need the fpu.  only with programs sensitive to  
 pclk & pipelining does the 68lc040 behave like 486dx2 - fpu or a '486dx2sx'.}
 
 486     ~ 68040 {two 32-bit microprocessors with built-in fpu, mmu, 8k 
 internal cache (which is implemented as two 4k caches in the 68040 and one in 
 the 486).  only with programs sensitive to pclk & pipelining does the 68040 
 behave like a 486dx2.}
 
 pentium   ~ 68060 {both are planned to be superscalar but both have heat 
 problems.  these chips may flounder against the cheaper (pc week 3/08/93; 
 4/12/93; pc mag 4/27/93:110), earlier released (pc week 12/7/92; macweek 
 12/14/92; pc week 2/08/93), less leat producing {160 degrees f for pentium
 (pc mag 4/27/93:118)}, and partly ported to powerpc chips.} 
 
 powerpc   = powerpc {this cpu line is planned to run programs from dos, 
 windows 3.x, os/2 and mac os on top of poweropen-a/ux 4.0 [unix] and later 
 pink [taligent os] by using emulators or, if necessary, the oses themselves in 
 a 'shell' a.k. how softpc or os/2 does dos.}
 
 hardware 
 {in an effort to remove the 'reconfiguring the system almost every time you 
 add something' requirement for add-in cards, drivers, video, and operating 
 systems in the ibm world, intel, microsoft and 12 other hardware and software 
 developers are working out 'plug and play' standards (pc week 03/08/93).}
 color support/display
  mac: 30.24 mhz pixel clock standard.  all present macs support the use of 
 32-bit color through 32-bit color quickdraw in rom.  32-bit color quickdraw 
 allows an almost transparent capability to display and edit x-bit images in y-
 bit color and retain all the colors of y-bit color [where x and y 
 independently are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32] regardless of monitor resolution {63 
 dpi [12" color] to 94 dpi [palettebook]} or monitor type {including 
 autosynchronous vga, mcga and svga monitors with ranges including 66.7 hz 
 vertically and 35 khz horizontally and only a hardware video adaptor (macuser 
 aug 1992: 158-176).  older machines that supported color {se/30, ii, iix, and 
 iicx} had only 8-bit color in rom and needed a software patch to use 32-bit 
 color (macuser special 1993:28-29).  
 to keep costs down and speed up most macs have only 8 or 16 bit display 
 capability built-in, but most of those can be expanded to display 24-bit 
 color.    presently quickdraw is optimized for 72 dpi display; quickdraw qx 
 will change this.
 in addition, quickdraw allows, in macs with a nubus slot, more then one 
 monitor to be used in any combination, from two monitors showing the same 
 thing to multiple monitors acting as one large large monitor with any degree 
 of overlap of the pictures.
 vram: video ram.  standard for present non-powerbook mac's handling of 
  built-in video {from a 32-bit color palette}. vram provided runs a 8-bit
  color 640x480 display; expandable to 16-bit color or a 8-bit 832x624 display. 
 sound output:  standard in all macs since the 128k.  stereo sound became 
  standard with the se/30.
 
 ibm:  even though pcs have rom bios definitions of how the operating system 
 interacts with the video hardware (nan zou), the use of drivers bypassing 
 bios, video hareware inconsitancies {see super vga below} and nonstanderzation
 of clone bios have left resolution of video display hardware, os and program 
 interaction up to the os and video hardware in question (faisal nameer 
 jawdat). in addition, ibm and clone makers never bothered to provide a 
 standard hardware mechanism for software to determine what display mode is 
 actually present (matt healy) nor a standardized screen-drawing toolbox {like 
 mac's qd}. as a result the os must be very well written to detect some modes, 
 especially with some third party cards or to use them consitantly {at present 
 things are so dependent on the interaction of the program, os, print driver 
 and monitor card that editing 32-bit pictures regardless of color mode, os, 
 and monitor type/card combination as one can do on the mac is impossible with 
 an ibm.  for example, one cannot edit a 32-bit color picture done on a os/2 
 486 with a svga monitor on a 386 with vga {18-bit color palette} and dos 5.0 
 and still have all the colors one started out with}.
 later ibm machines will have integrated graphics accelerators, faster 
 processors, and modular upgradeability and may have built-in sound cards, cd 
 rom, and ethernet (pc week 12/14/92).  
 mda: monocrome display adapter
  original character-mapped video mode, no graphics, 80x25 text.
 cga: color graphics array
  320x200 4 colors or 640x200 b/w, 16 color palette, bad for the eyes.
 ega:  enhanced graphics array
  640x350 16 colors from 64 color palette [and some lower res]; some versions 
  could run at 256 colors, bearable on the eyes.
 vga:  video graphics array*
  320x200 at 256 colors, 640x480 at 16 colors, and some others, these two are 
  the most commonly used.  all modes have a 256k clut, from a 
  18 to 24-bit {ibm} or a 32-bit {mac} color palette.  25.175 mhz pixel clock
  (mel martinez).  monitors use analog input, incompatible with ttl signals
  from ega/cga etc. 
 mcga:  multi-color graphics array*
  subset of vga that provides all the features of mda & cga, but lacks some ega 
  and vga modes, like vga 640x480x16 (dictionary of computer terms-dct).  
  common on the initial ps/1 implementation from ibm and some ps/2 models.
 svga:  super vga*
  this is not a standard in the way the others were, but instead was a 'catch 
  all' category for a group of video cards.  as such, with each manufacturer 
  using their own implementation scheme, svga was chaos with people debating
  as to what is svga and what is not.  in an effort to make svga more of a 
  standard vesa was established and is used in the newer units, but things
  are still a mess.  video is either 512k [~1990] or 1m [today], resolution
  of 800x600 and 1024x768 at 16 and 256 colors are common, newer ones [since 
  1990] have the sierra hicolor ramdac, giving 15-bit 32,768 colors at 800x600, 
  some of the very newer ones [~6/92] can do 24 bits per pixel [usually 
  at 640x480].  speedwise, too much variation, some very slow [western digital 
  paradise based, for example], some very fast [s3 86c911 based, for example], 
  some are so-so [like tseng et4000, a very popular chipset].  some limiting 
  factors overcome by 40mhz vl bus & 386's linear address mapping were: 
  8.33 mhz isa bus, at architecture where the cpu looks at the card through a 
  64k "window", etc.
 other non-svga standards: 
 8514/a:
  ibm's own standard, interlacing graphics accelerator with graphics functions 
  like linedraw, polygon fill, etc. in hardware. some clone implementations 
  from ati are the fastest video available today, though some clone models do 
  not have interlacing. 
 tms34010/34020: high end graphics co-processors, usually >$1000, some
  do 24-bit, speeds up vector-oriented graphics like cad.
 xga:  extended graphics array
  newer and faster than 8514/a, only available for mca bus-based ps/2s, clones 
  are coming out soon.  emulates vga, ega, and cga (dct).  max resolution at 
  1024x768x8b, same as 8514/a, also some 16 bpp modes.
 xga-2
  accelerates graphics functions up to 20 times faster than standard vga in
  windows and os/2, including line draws, bit and pixel-block transfers, area
  fills, masking and x/y addressing. has an intelligent way to detect and co-
  exist with other xga-2 cards, so multiple desktops like on the mac may not be 
  far away.  since this is an architecture, its resolution and color depth 
  isn't fixed {ibm implements only 16-bit [65,536] color, while other 
  companies can have 24-bit color through ibm technical licenses}. refresh 
  rates up to 75 hz, ensures flicker free, rock solid images to reduce visual 
  discomfort, and is vga compatible. up to 1280x1024 on os/2.
 *some monitor types usable by mac-see mac section above for specific details.
 
 expansion
 both mac & ibm
 scsi: only external device expansion interface common to both mac and ibm.
  allows the use of any device: hard drive, printer, scanner, nubus card 
  expansion {mac plus only}, some monitors, and cd-rom.  
  main problem:  there are a lot of external devices which are internal 
  terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the scsi port 
  {a scsi chain is supposed to be terminated only at the begining and at the 
  end.  any other set up causes problems for either mac or ibm}. 
 scsi-1:  7 devices per scsi controller.  8-bit asynchronous {~1.5mb/s ave}
  and synchronous {5mb/s max} transfers.  difference is due to scsi-1 software
  drivers.  "fast scsi-1" is a misname for 8-bit scsi-2 in scsi-1 mode
  {see scsi-2 for details}.
 scsi-2: 10 devices per scsi controller in scsi-2 mode.  scsi-2 is fully
  scsi-1 compliant and 8-bit scsi-2 tends to be implemented as a very fast
  scsi-1 since it does not require the different controller interfaces in  
  hardware and software that 16 and 32-bit scsi-2 do.  transfer speeds are
  4-6mb/s with 10mb/s burst {8-bit}, 8-12mb/s with 20mb/s burst {16-bit}, and
  15-20mb/s with 40mb/s burst {32-bit/wide and fast}.  since 8-bit scsi-2 can
  use scsi-1 software drivers and hardware at 8-bit scsi-2 speeds and as such
  is limited to 7 devices sometimes it is mistakenly called "fast scsi-1". 
  16-bit fast scsi-2 requires a scsi-2 software driver and scsi-2 electronics
  but can still use the scsi-1 ports.  wide 16-bit and 32-bit scsi-2 require a
  different scsi port, electronics, and software driver from scsi-1 {which
  makes them more expensive than other scsi interfaces}.
 mac scsi: asynchronous scsi-1 built-in standard since the plus.  even though 
  apple developed some specifications for scsi controlers, the os scsi manager
  needs to be rewritten to take full advantage of the features of both scsi
  interfaces.  as a result present scsi-2 macs use 8-bit scsi-2 as a fast 
  asynchronous scsi-1.  presently quadras are the only macs with a scsi-2
  controller chip built-in (digital review, oct 21, 1991 v8 n33 p8(1)) 
  though they lack some other parts of the hardware, like the wide scsi-2 port 
  interface.  since other macs require a nubus card to use scsi-2, older nubus 
  macs had a bottleneck due to the speed of the nubus and cpu.  rumor-some
  cyclone macs {june} will come with a wide & fast scsi-2 port standard 
  and have a rewritten os scsi manager.
 ibm scsi:  scsi-1 is not too wide spread yet, generally not bundled with 
  systems, except as add-on {eisa and vesa local bus adapters avalable}.
  like the mac, 8-bit scsi-2 is used as a very fast scsi-1 by most controllers
  out there.  unlike the mac, ibm has no exact scsi controller specifications
  which results in added incompatibilities for scsi.
 
 mac
 memory expansion: with a few exceptions the mac has used non-parity 30-pin 
  8-bit simm memory expansion since the plus.  while 32-pin 9-bit parity simms
  could be used in these macs, only special iicis could make use of the parity 
  feature {by convension both simm types are called 32-pin simms}.  the iifx 
  used 64-pin parity simms.  the lc iii, c610/650 and q800 all use a new 
  72-pin simm that is accessable by 32-bits at a time and is used in ibms.
  the mac does a complete memory check at startup by writing/reading every
  memory location; if something is seriously wrong with a simm the mac will
  not boot and give a sound chord indicating what the problem is.
  since macs made before feb 15, 1993 managed memory baced on data path, simms 
  had to be installed in pairs {16-bit} or in sets of 4 {32-bit}.  the centris 
  650 and quadra 800 eliminate this with a new memory management setup that 
  allows memory to be upgraded one simm at a time.  if the simms are the same 
  size are used then the memory is 'interleaved' across the two simms resulting 
  in a 10-15% performance boost on ram access (macworld apr 93: 108-109).
 printers, adbs, and modems: built-in interfaces standard.
 monitor interface and sound input: built-in on most present macs. 
 pds: available in se & all present non-powerbook macs. 16-bit {se, 
  portable, lc, lc ii, classic line} and 32-bit.  operates at cpu's mhz.  
  maximum through put: data path in bytes*cpu's mhz {q700/900 & c650: 
  4 * 25mhz = 100mb/s; q800 & q950: 4 * 33mhz = 132mb/s}. standardized with
  the lc and 040 bus designs.  with an adapter one nubus card can be used in 
  iisi and c610.  problem: some cards have timing dependency which slows 
  through put down.
 nubus mac ii: 32-bit, 10 mhz bus clock, 1-to-1 transaction/bus cycle ratio,
  and contiguous, hand-shake transactions at ~10-20mb/s; theoretical peak:
  40mb/s.  built-in on all modular macs except the lc series, c610, and 
  performa 400.  the se/30 could be adapted to use this and there was even a 
  mac plus scsi nubus.  supports every possible expansion from cpu to ethernet 
  to dma.
 nubus 90: nubus mac ii back compatable. 20mhz bus clock, avg throughput:
  ~30mb/s; burst mode: 80mb/s.  future card designs will be 7" instead of the 
  old 12".
 quickring:  a peer-to-peer bus used in parallel with nubus 90.  apple's 
  vlbus - "architecture is identical to that of vlbus" (byte 10/92:128).
  burst mode: 350mb/s (byte 10/92:128). in development.
 cpu expansion: handled either through the pds or the nubus.  unlike pds,  
  nubus cpu cards {example-radius rocket} allow use of multiple processors at 
  the same time.  this is like having two or more macs in the same box able to 
  dual task or joinly process depending on the card or software involved {each 
  nubus card needs its own memory but most nubus cards of this type come with 
  8mb ram simms on the card standard}.
 
 ibm
 memory expansion:  parity simms, non-parity simms {some newer models do a mac-
 like simm memory check}, or a dozen or so different types of memory boards.
 
 hd interfaces {limited to hard drives by design or lack of development}: 
 mfm:  modified frequency modulation, rll:  run length limited
  only used with smaller [² 60mb] hard drives.
 ide:  integrated device electronics 
  asynchronous {~5mb/s max} and synchronous {8.3mb/s max} transfer.
  currently the most common standard, and is mainly used for medium sized 
  drives. can have more than one hard drive. 
 esdi:  enhanced small device interface
  ~1.25mb/s throughput. generally considered better interface than scsi-1 in
  many ways but not common enough for practical consideration.  outside of
  hard drives, device choices are very limited compared to scsi-1. 
 
 bus interfaces
 {new 'plug and play' isa and eisa compatable cards may have problems working 
 with old cards (infoworld; pc week 03/08/93; vaporware 4/93).}
 isa
  8 & 16-bit interfaces common. has 24-bit data path limit {which produces a
  16mb limit for which there are software workarounds} (pc mag 4/27/93:105).
  1.5 mb/s (byte 3/93:132).  uses edge-triggered interrupts, can't share them,
  hence comes the irq conflict.  limited busmastering capabilities, some cards
  aren't bandwidth limited {com  ports, lpt ports, game ports, midi card, etc.}
  while others are {video and disk controllers}.  dominant factor, but it's
  showing its age.  most isa motherboard designs are 16-bit
  (pc world feb 1993: 144-5)}.  
 mca {micro channel}
  ibm's 16 and 32-bit bus; "allows use of more than one cpu in a computer" 
  (dct) and anything can talk to anything, as fast as the two components 
  involved can handle it. never took off because it was incompatible with isa 
  and eisa.  planned to be bus interface of ibm powerpc 601 (carl jabido).
 eisa {nubus mac ii is closest mac equivalent}
  32-bit, 8.33 mhz, burst mode: 33mb/s.  it also has the ability to 
  self-configure cards like mca and allows multiple bus masters, sharable 
  interrupt and dma channels and multiple cpu use.
 vesa local bus: vlb {sometimes mistakenly refereed to as pds}
  local bus standard. runs at cpu clock rate,  burst modes: ~130 mb/s{32-bit}
  250 mb/s{64-bit} (byte 10/92:128).  limited to three slots but allows bus 
  mastering and will coexist with either isa or eisa. consitered ideal for 
  video and disk i/o.  dell has filled a claim that this violates one of
  their patents (mel martinez).
 quickring: apple's faster {350 mb/s burst} version of vlb architecture
  (byte 10/92:132).  might show up in some ibm and powerpc machines
  (byte 10/92:132-133). in development.
 pci
  intel's version of local bus that is intended to totally replace 
  isa/eisa/mca.  in development.
 
 oses {assumes full installation [print drivers, fonts, multifinder, etc.]
 and multiple application use.}
 mac
 512k to 1mb of os and hardware commands have been put into rom.  this allows 
 apple to control its machine by putting key hooks for the mac os {quickdraw, 
 menu commands, print, mouse, scsi & sound drivers, etc} in rom, which require 
 clone makers to use the rom chip or read rom on to disks {which requires 
 access to the proper mac since different macs have slightly different rom 
 chips; plus vs classic for example.}  with key hooks for the os support 
 interface in rom, programers do not have to worry as much whether the disk os 
 has the necessary hardware commands or that those commands are consitant and 
 therefore can write smaller programs.  this also allows apple greater control 
 over hardware-software standards and that the disk os can be smaller and, with 
 some of the tookbox command code in rom, with lower ram requirements then a 
 totally disk based os.  macs use masked rom which is as fast as dram (jon 
 wtte).
 6.0.7: single program usage base requirements: 1 mb and dd floppy, 
  cooperatively-multitasking base requirements: 2mb and hd floppy.  
  features a gui, cooperative-multitasker [multifinder], standard program 
  interface, & standard stereo sound support [snd]. network receiving part of 
  appleshare software is bundled with the os. has a 8mb ram barrier and is a 
  24-bit os. some third party products allow 14mb of virtual memory as long as 
  real ram is below 8mb.
 6.0.8: 6.0.7 with 7.0.0 print drivers.
 6.0.8l:  system 6 for some macs that require system 7.0.x.
 7.0.x: base requirements: 2mb, 40mb hard drive, and 68000; de-facto standard 
  to run all features well: 4mb, 80mb hard drive, and 68030 {lowest present 
  non-portable mac configuration}.  using up to 10.08mb {this is everything on
  system disks} of hard disk space this has 6.0.7 features plus program linking 
  within and between computers [iac], built-in server capabilities {filesharing 
  can be used by older oses using appleshare client software and can be 
  accessed by 10 macs max; 4-5 is more speed practical, iac requires 7.x}, 
  virtual memory in machines with mmu{1.6 times real ram for least noticeable 
  iisi speed degradation}, drag and drop, quicktime & built-in truetype 
  support.  supports sound input [aiff and snd formats] for most present 
  machines.  can access up to 1gb of true ram and 4gb of virtual memory and is 
  both a 24 and 32-bit os.  to use real ram beyond 8mb it must be in 32-bit 
  mode and on older machines requires the 'mode 32' extension.  apple's last 
  'free' os.
 7.1.0: 7.0.1 with worldscript support, speedier, and less ram usage than 
  7.0.dot (macweek 8/24/92; 9/14/92; pc week 9/7/92). to run in 32-bit mode 
  on older machines it requires the 'mode 32' or '32-bit enabler' extension. 
  marks the start of apple saling its mac os instead of allowing free upgrades
  {bundled with new machines, $49 for 7.0.x upgrades, $99 otherwise}.
  [the installer has a bug that when upgrading it may keep some old system 
  fonts from the previous system inside the system file.  this can eat up any 
  ram benefits and cause other problems.  apple itself recommends removing all 
  fonts from the system file.]
 a/ux 3.0 [unix]: needs 8mb ram {12-20mb suggested}, 160mb hard drive, and 
  a 68030 or 68040 equivalent to run.  this 32-bit preemptive multitasking os 
  is large due to being unix and needing translators between it and the mac 
  roms.  price: $709.
 note: sound output was supported in oses 3.2 to 6.0.5 by many formats 
 including the following:  snd, wave, asnd, fssd, qssn, smsd, soun, dc2d, and 
 dcfl.  in 6.0.7 the sound manager was optimized for the sound standards 'snd' 
 and aiff which causes some playback problems for the old formats, though most 
 still play.
 
 ibm
  machiness have little gui code, data, and hooks present in hardware for 
 programmers to work with, so most of the coding must be provided in the os.  
 since hard disks were slow the disk os code is read into ram.  in addition, 
 what little rom code there is also read into ram {a process called shadow rom}  
 this results in faster implementation since ram is faster then proms or 
 eproms.  having most of the os code on disk has the advantage of being able to 
 better optimize the code given a certain piece or collection of hardware which 
 is harder with a rom based system due to the 'patches' needed.  in addition it 
 reduces the need for and size of patches if a major revision of the hardware 
 support is needed.
 side note:  the ftc charged that microsoft formed a os trust by not providing 
 all feature documentation for its oses to developers outside ms and designing 
 its windows and dos apps to fail under os/2 ("undocumented windows") and 
 "there is deliberate code in [windows] nt beta which causes the install to 
 abort if os/2 boot manager is present" (gregory hicks, info-ibmpc digest v92 
 #201).  due to a conflict of intrest by one member the vote of the ftc 
 judicial council for action against microsoft was a tie which resulted in no 
 action.  rumors-the ftc will presue the matter, likely to the point of 
 choosing a new member or whole new council.  in addition the government has 
 turned down microsoft's copyright of "windows" which would allow it to charge 
 a fee for developers using their hooks (pc week 03/08/93).
 microsoft oses
 dos 5.0: has a 640k barrier with its own memory manager, a 1 mb barrier 
  with third party memory managers.  this 16-bit os requires that each program 
  must provide its own print drivers and be 16-bit {programs need to be dos 
  protected mode interface (dpmi) compliant and running on a 386dx [32-bit 
  protected mode] to break these barriers}.  contains the gui shell present in
  dos 4.0.
 dos 6.0: dos 5.0 with the added features of a built-in file compresion, disk 
  defragmenter, debugger for the config.sys file. it needs a $80 module for 
  networking {cost: $50 through 5/93, after that $129.99} 
  (byte april 1993:44-46).
 dos 7.0: 32-bit dos. in development (pc week 04/05/93).
 window 3.0: runs on top of dos.  breaks 640k and 1m barriers but still has to 
  deal with dos file structure.  base requirements: 1mb, floppy and 286; to
  run well 2mb, hard drive, 386sx and fast display adapter {> 8-bit}.  has the
  equivalent of mac's qd called windows gdi [graphics device interface].
  this does not have a consistent application interface {like early mac
  programs  (1984-1985)} nor a very large program base {compared to dos} and
  still tends to slow the machine down (info-ibmpc digest v92 #186) with speed
  is more dependent on the display adapter then on the cpu (bill coleman).
  window programs tend to be disk and memory hogs compared to their dos
  counterparts (byte april 1993:98-108).
 window 3.1: a faster version of window 3.0 with better memory managment. base 
  requirements 1 mb, hard drive and a 286 ;to run well 2mb, hard drive, 386sx. 
  apple plans to release its print drivers for this (pc week 12/28/92).
 windows for workgroups:  to run well: 4mb ram and 386dx (pc world feb/93:160).  
  intermediary between win 3.1 and windows nt.  it is basically windows 3.1 
  with built-in peer to peer networking support.
 windows nt:  beta release takes about 50mb of disk space [including the 
  swap file], and 12mb ram {betas are notorious for ram usage especially in 
  the interaction between debuging code and program compliers, hence the 
  reports of 24mb requirements}.  released version supposed to need 8mb ram 
  but, gates himself now recommends 16mb ram (pc week 04/15/92).
  this 32-bit os has protected mode multitasking, multithreading, symmetric 
  multiprocessing, a recoverable file system, and 32-bit gdi.  has built in
  networking that is osf dce compliant and can handle up to 4gb of ram.  even
  though some people see a july 4 release date (infoworld nov 16/92), rumor
  is that the final version will not be available before oct 1993
  (infoworld may 25/92; july 6/92; vaporware 07/92; 08/92) or 4th quarter 1993
  (pc week 09/28/92). windows upgrades will be $295, otherwise $495
  (pc week 04/15/92; 03/15/93).
 other oses
 pc-dos 6.0: ibm's version of dos 6.0.  it runs windows much faster then dos 
  6.0 due to faster file i/o and video handling (infoworld feb 1, 93).
 dr dos 6.0: same as dos 5.0 with some extras {like built-in data compression} 
  and memory management enhancements. still has 640k/1mb barrier.  a later 
  version {novell dos} of this may use a version of the mac finder and apple 
  file management system (pc week 12/14/92; infoworld dec 14/92).
 os/2 2.0: unix like features and unix like requirements; 8-16mb ram,
  60mb {uses 17-33mb} hard drive, and 386dx cpu. this 32-bit multithreaded, 
  multitasking os can address up to 4gb of ram but has to use a fast swap file 
  to use more than 16 mb ram on isa systems using dma {direct memory access}. 
  ibm plans to use taligent's oops in future versions of this 
  (infoworld oct 26/92).
 aix:  ibm's unix system, planned to be a subset of poweropen and taligent os.
 nextstep: gui unix to provide next features on ibm machines.  beta out, final 
  version to be out by may 25, 1993.
 solaris os for x86: a sunsoft port.  a 32-bit os with symmetric 
  multiprocessing and multithreading, built-in networking capabilities with 
  tools to allow remote configuring and adminstration features, and 
  communication package.  client: $795,  50 users server: $1,995, 1000s users
  server: $5,995.  developer kits-software: $495, hardware: $195.
 mac 7.1 [working name: star trek]:  apple had system 7.0 running off intel 
  chips and is looking at making a 7.1 version available for ibm 
  (computerworld nov 2/92; macweek 03/22/93). at present this is planned to run 
  on top of novell's dr dos, require a 486 or equivalent to run and that apps 
  will need to be recompiled (macweek 03/22/93).  viewed as novell's answer to 
  windows nt.  the complexity of pc hardware set ups is one reason for slow 
  progress {this seems to apple/ibm's way of leading to the powerpc line out in 
  late 1993/early 1994 and pink os in late 1994-early 1995.}
 
 powerpc
 rumor-ibm will build its powerpc 601 by late 1993 (infoworld june 8 & 15, 92; 
 macweek 7/13/92; pc week 3/15/93).  it will have microchannel bus and xga 
 video (carl b jabido), and will run native version aix and mac apps (pc week 
 3/15/93); there have been no comments on compatablity of dos or windows apps.
 apple's powerpc 601 machine {tesseract} is planned to be out jan 24, 1994 and 
 to have mc98601/50 mhz, 4/8mb ram, a 2.8-mbyte floppy drive and expected to 
 sale near lc line prices {~$2000, down from projections of ~$3000 (macuser 
 9/92:146)}
 (macweek 3/22/93).
 poweropen [a/ux 4.0]: a 32-bit preemtive multitasking os planned to run on
  powerpcs and 68030/40 macs (macweek 7/13/92).  intel compatibility uncertain
  (see mac 7.1 above).  planned base requirements:  68030, 8mb ram, 80mb hard
  drive (macweek 4/19/93). rumor-ahead of schedule; could be out by mid 1993.
  rumor-this could be the os for ibm's powerpc 601 which is due by late 1993.
 pink [taligent os]: expecting delivery in 1994 (wall street journal 1/12/92) 
  and may have some parts shipping in os/2 and aix in 1993 and mac os and 
  poweropen with the powerpcs (macweek 01/25/93).
 windows nt: possible port (macweek 04/05/93).  see ibm os section for details.
 solaris os: version of this sun microsystems inc unix os to run on the
  power pcs in 1994 (macweek 04/05/93).  one of the few oses to directly state 
  that it will run windows/dos programs.  ibm os section for details
 nextstep: possible port see ibm os section for details.
 
 os number crunching (mel park)
 mac
  arithmetic is done in a consistent numerical environment {sane or standard 
 apple numerics environment}. floating point numbers are 96 bits long when an 
 fpu is present and 80 bits otherwise. exceptions, such as dividing by zero or 
 taking the square root of a negative number, do not cause an abort but are 
 handled in a logically consistent manner. 1/0 produces the internal 
 representation for infinity (inf).  1/(1/0) produces zero. the above treatment 
 of 1/(1/0) occurs in an fpu-equipped machine even when sane is bypassed and 
 the fpu programmed directly.
 
 ibm
  floating point numbers are 80-bits with a hardware fpu, 64-bits when 
 emulated.  the way they are handled is dependent on the coding of whatever 
 compiler or assembler was used for a program. on older dos complilers 
 exceptions could cause program aborts; 1/0 and 1/(1/0) would abort to the dos 
 prompt at the point where they occured.  most present compilers handle this 
 better.  result: there is little consistent handling of numbers between dos, 
 windows and os/2 programs nor between programs for just one os.
 
 networking [includes printing]
 wysiwyg printing can be a problem with either mac of ibm machines especially 
 if one sends truetype fonts to a older style postscript printer.
 mac
 hardware: built-in localtalk network port and a built-in printer port.  
 localtalk has moderate speeds (230.4 kb/s) requires special connectors for 
 each machine ($15 and up) and can be run off of either the printer port {to 
 include very old macs} or the network port {standard today}.  built-in 
 ethernet is becoming common but many older macs require a pds or nubus card at 
 about $150-$300 for each machine.  these cards provide three connectors and 
 transceivers {thick, thin, and 10baset} for ethernet.
 the macintosh quadra family and some centris models includes ethernet 
 interface on motherboard, with transceivers available. tokenring has been a 
 network option since 1989.
 software: appletalk {the suite of protocols} standard with mac os, which can 
 use variety of media types.  appleshare client software included with the os 
 as well and can connect to file servers such as novell netware, 3com 3+open, 
 banyan vines, dec pathworks, apple's appleshare servers, system 7 file sharing 
 machines, and afp servers running on variety of unix hosts.  mactcp allows 
 typical tcp/ip communications (telnet, ftp, nfs, rlogin).  a later version 
 will have unix x/open transport interface (xti) built-in by the end of 1993 
 (macweek 04/12/93).  third-party software to connect to nfs servers.  dec 
 pathworks provides decnet support.  peer-to-peer file sharing software 
 built-in to system 7.1 (see os section).  full server software is extra. 
 printing requires connection of the printer and the printer being selected in 
 the chooser.  changing printers is by selecting a different name in the 
 chooser.  the same is true of connecting to servers.
 printing bugs:  monaco truetype font is different then the screen bitmap font.
  {quickdraw qx is suppossed to fix this and similar problems.}
 
 ibm  
 hardware: localtalk [not widely used], ethernet,  and tokenring.
 software: novell netware, banyan vines, decnet, windows/work groups, appletalk 
 protocols, and appleshare {subset of appletalk}.
 each of the ms-dos networking schemes are, in general, totally incompatible 
 with the others. once you have chosen one, you are pretty much locked-in to 
 that product line from then on.  windows/work groups is a little more 
 forgiving and removes some of this problem.  novell netware is the biggest, 
 {~80 percent of the corporate market.} and in general is more powerful and 
 offers better control/management/security than appleshare, but it's also more 
 complex to set up and manage.  this will change due to the use of the mac 
 finder and file management system by novell. (pc week 12/14/92 & 12/28/92;  
 infoworld dec 14/92; macweek 3/22/93)
 printing {very os dependent}
 dos: if it's a single user, then you plug the printer into the parallel port, 
  and don't worry about it {tweeking may be needed with poorly written 
  software}.  network printing is not controlled by the system, but is mostly 
  implemented by the actual program, therefore performance varies from one 
  software program to the next.
 windows 3.x: supports standard drivers and can do a good job of showing "jobs" 
  in the print queue, but it always lists printers as "active"... even if they 
  are not.  this becomes a problem if there are several incompatible printers 
  on the same net, because there's no way for software to reliably determine 
  which printer is active right now.  windows for workgroups is more mac-like 
  and intelligent about this.
 os/2: mac-like; the os deals with printers, with apps making calls to the os.
 printing bugs: due to poor programing some programs for all the above oses do 
 not have wysiwyg printing.  this is the fault of the programs in question and 
 not that of the os involved.
 
 price issue: this is very dynamic with mac providing more build-in features 
 than ibm and ibm being more 'get only what you need' then mac and price wars 
 by both worlds.
 the ibm machines' modualar nature prevents any kind of true hardware 
 standarization, which in turn requires oses and programs to be very complex to 
 handle all the variation in hardware.  when one adds all the standard mac 
 hardware features to an ibm {built-in input/output sound support, scsi, pds,  
 built-in monitor support, built-in networking, standard mouse interface, and 
 nubus 90 in higher machines} the mac tends to be cheaper then an equivalent 
 equipted ibm machine {especially since some ibm monitors can be used with macs 
 which cuts some more of the mac's cost (macuser aug 1992:158-176)}.
  some prices using some of the info in this sheet and macuser april 1993.
 all macs below come with a pds slot, vram, and scsi-1 built in.  except where 
 noted, monitor is extra and a built-in monitor interface is provided {no card 
 needed except for 24-bit color display}.
 ibm planned a $1,200 386slc/25mhz model with a 60mb hard drive and color vga 
 monitor {~vram} (macweek 8/17/92) {sounds like a color classic without scsi-1, 
 sound support, built-in network support, fpu socket, built-in expansion to 
 16-bit color, etc}.
 color classic:  $1,389 - 030/16mhz with 16-bit data bus {~386sx/20mhz 
 equivalent}, 4/80, fpu socket, and built-in monitor.
 lciii: $1,499 - 030/25mhz {~386dx/33mhz equivalent}, and 4/160.
 centris 610: $2,899 - 68lc040/20mhz {depending on the program ~486sx/40 or 
 ~'486dx2sx'/20[40]mhz equivalent}, 8/230, built-in ethernet, 300i cd-rom, a

 final note: since there is no comp.sys.ibm.pc.advocacy group this has been 
 posted to the closest relevent groups {comp.os.ms-windows.advocacy, 
 comp.os.os2.advocacy, and comp.sys.ibm.pc.misc}.  also since some mac vs ibm 
 articles have been showing up in comp.sys.mac.hardware i have included that 
 newsgroup in the posting. {don't site the comp.sys.mac.* faq as a reason not 
 to post to comp.sys.mac.hardware, since the faq itself does not follow 
 internet guidelines, especially the de-facto "[all] the faqs for a newgroup 
 hierarchy should be posted to all newsgroups in the hierarchy" standard.}
