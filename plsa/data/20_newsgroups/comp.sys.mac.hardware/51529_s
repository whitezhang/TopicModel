 
 my macclassic mouse died.  i dissected it and determined that it is
 the microswitch, that senses the click, that is stuck in the depressed
 mode.  this tragedy prompts the following questions:
 
 1.	is it easy to find a microswitch that i could solder into the
 	place of the old switch ?
 
 2.	i have old mice (max+, mac 512ke), can they be used with some
 	adapter ?
