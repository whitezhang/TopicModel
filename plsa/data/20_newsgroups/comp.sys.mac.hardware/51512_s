   complete q700 are best obtained from your dealer or some recent
 copy of macworld or macuser.  my foggy memory suggests that the most relevant
 comparison factors vis-a-vis a iici are as follows:
 
   25 mhz 68040
   16 mhz data path (don't recall this for sure, but it's slower
       than q 950 style machines for sure).
   ethertalk card on-board
   audio in/out
   4 mb ram on motherboard
   4 simm slots
   2 nubus slots.
   more flexible build-in video than the ci.  uses vram.
 
 in comparison, a iici with an accelerator won't give you
   audio or ethernet  or the same video options.
   with a 68040 accelerator, cpu performance can be comparable but i
   think it ends up costing more.
