 
 can someone please help me understand the current situation
 regarding simms?
 
 i have a iisi which i will probably keep for another 2 years.
 
 i would like to add more memory, ie go from 5 mb to 17 mb.
 
 i know that i will need 4 x 4mb, 80ns or faster simms.
 
 which simms, 30 pin or 72 pin?
 would the simms i get today be usable in 2 years with a 
 newer, more powerful system?
 
 any insight would be appreciated.
 
 thanks.
 
 rob
