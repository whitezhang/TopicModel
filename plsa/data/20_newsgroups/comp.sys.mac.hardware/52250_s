 a lot of the time, when you're dealing with someone who has no financial  
 interest in selling you the machine, you get a lot of opinion (as opposed  
 to factual information, etc.).  what it sounds like to me is that this guy  
 has had an experience with one flaky centris 610 and formed an  
 all-encompassing opinion on the rest of the 610's.  i've seen lots of  
 people who frustrated me to no end because they refused to believe any  
 other mac xyz would be any good, since their experience (with >one<  
 machine) with a mac xyz had been bad.  their loss, eh?
