 i'm not an expert, but having spent much too much of my life looking for
 the power switch, or the brightness control, or the de-gauss, etc., etc.,
 etc. it is my firm belief that the only reason any
 controls/switches/knobs/whatever in places where they are hard to reach is
 because the designers put them there deliberately.
 
 the real question is weather this is because of stupidity, or
 maliciousness.
