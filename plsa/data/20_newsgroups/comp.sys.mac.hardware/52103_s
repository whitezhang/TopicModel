 my recently modified quadra 700 with a socket for clock oscillators has now
 completed nearly 40 hours of error free operation at 32 mhz (with a 64 mhz
 clock oscillator). i have also tried a 55 mhz cmos clock and that works as well.
 on the more stupid side, i've discovered you can use a 40 mhz clock and make
 your q700 as slow as a centris 610. however, a 25 mhz clock which would have
 yielded a 12.5 mhz quadra 700 (who'd want one?) didn't work at all.
 
 impatiently awaiting a 66 mhz clock,
