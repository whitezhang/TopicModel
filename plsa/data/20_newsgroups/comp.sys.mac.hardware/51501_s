 the 3fgx has a maximum horizontal scan rate of 49khz, so driving it
 at 60.24khz to get 1024 x 768 on the mac is way beyond the tolerance            the 4fg is spec'ed at 57khz, so going 60.24khz is only 5-6% above
 the minimally guaranteed figure.
 
 i too doubt if the damark monitor would sync to a mac at 1024 x 768.            like most things, you get what you pay.  that's the deal.
