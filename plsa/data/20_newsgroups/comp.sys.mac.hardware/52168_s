 has anybody heard about a thing called a macwatch? i saw it on tv a
 couple of years ago, it is a watch with a reviever and a transmitter for
 your mac. the practical upshot is that your mac can page your watch and
 display a small message. my flatmate is off to the states for a week or
 two soon and i am interested in getting one. any info would be
 appreciated.
 
 thanx in advance.
 glenn.
