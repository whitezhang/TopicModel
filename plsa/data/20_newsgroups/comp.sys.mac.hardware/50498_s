 well, i saw a few posts on this and asumed that everyone is talking about 
 the new 14" display... mine does it to... kinda like when i would degauss 
 my old 13", and since the new one lacks this button, i assume that is 
 what it is doing... anyone that knows i'd appreciate the info, but it 
 doesn't worry me...
