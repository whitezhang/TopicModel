   since image writer lq was discontinued, there is no apple talk
   printer with 11"*15" continous paper printer.
 
   i would like to know is there are any possibility to connect
   an ibm compatible printer to an apple talk net directly (or 
   with a net serial hardware), and if i need any other software
   to do it.
