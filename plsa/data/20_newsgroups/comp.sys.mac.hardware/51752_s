 but the interesting comparision is how fast clock-cycle chips
 you can get - an alpha is way slow at 66 mhz, but blazes at
 200 mhz.

 but the 68040 is (or will soon be) available in 40 mhz version,
 making it "comparable" to a 486dx2-80

 i think you have that one turned around; they have faster clock
 cycles but less power behind each cycle. not to mention that the
 intel instruction stream is byte-oriented (longest intel instruction
 is 15 bytes; what an odd number :-) which makes it hard to do any
 intelligent memory subsystem.
