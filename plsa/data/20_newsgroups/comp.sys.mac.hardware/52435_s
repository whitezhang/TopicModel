 
 i used to hate it when people posted messages like this, but now that i
 am contemplating a purchase, i can see why they do.
 
 so, has anyone heard of any upcoming (within the next 6 months)
 advances in the powerbook line?  can we expect to see a powerpc
 powerbook at some point in the future (i assume an 040 would take too
 much power and generate too much heat for installation in a powerbook)?
 
 thanks for your help.
