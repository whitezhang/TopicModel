 does anyone know if a nanao 750i is compatible with any
 popular mac video cards? i have an oppurtunity to get a brand
 new one, cheap, and i am very tempted, but it will be a waste
 of time if i can't drive it using a standard video card.
 
 while i'm on the subject, what's everybody's reccomendations for
 a 21" color monitor. i've heard good things about the nec 6fg, and
 of course, there is always the reliable old macintosh 21" display,
 but what are your experiences.
