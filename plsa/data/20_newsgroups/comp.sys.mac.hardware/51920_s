 after reading reports from germany of success in accelerating a quadra
 or centris simply by changing the clock oscillator, i decided to test the
 claim. i pulled out my variable speed overdrive and the motherboard's
 50 mhz clock chip. i put a socket in the clock's place and inserted a
 64 mhz ttl clock oscillator i had left over from working on some si's.
 i can't believe it. it actually works. i'm not getting scsi timing errors
 either. this is only after a short run time but i'll keep posting results.
 did i spend all that money on the vso for nothing? if this keeps working,
 the lack of a double boot in itself will be worth the effort.
