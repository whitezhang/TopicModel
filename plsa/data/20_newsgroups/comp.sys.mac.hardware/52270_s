 my centris 610 is working perfectly.  there is one problem that i have
 noticed.  fastback ii backup utility does not work!!!  the strange thing
 is that it works with my friend's 610 most of the time, however, it never
 works with my machine.  i assume it is some sort of software problem and
 not hardware related.
