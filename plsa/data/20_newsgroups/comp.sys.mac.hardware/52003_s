 my friend has a macintosh iifx on which he is running system 6.0.7 (not enough
 memory yet to run sys7 adequately), and he noticed that when he tries to use
 multifinder on this machine, the machine will beep every few seconds
 incessantly, nonstop.
 
 now, this friend has a tendency to "install" things on his machine rather
 haphazardly, but he *did* rebuild his system from scratch and it still occurs. 
 does this problem sound familiar at all to anyone?  for all i know the problem
 is caused by something really obscure but if this is a known simple thing
 (yeah, right...) that someone is familiar with (like "system 6.0.7 multifinder
 doesn't run on a mac iifx"), or if someone here knows what he should be looking
 for, please send e-mail either to me or to him (smh@vaxf.acdnj.itt.com).
 thanx in advance.
