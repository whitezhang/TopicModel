 	i had asked everyone about problems installing a 4 meg
 simm and an 8 meg simm in my centris 610, but the folks at the
 local apple store called the folks in cupertino and found that
 you can't have simms of different speeds in one machine, even
 if they are both fast enough - ie - my 80 ns 8 meg and 60ns 4
 meg simms were incompatibable...  just thought people might
 want to know.....
