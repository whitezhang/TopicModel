 i'm planning on getting a stylewriter ii for my mac se (2.5 mb ram, hd, two
 800k floppy drives).  do any of you out there have any recommendations as
 to whether running system 6.0.8 is better or worse than switching to 7.1.
 i don't do much real work on this machine any more, but would like to keep
 it for word processing (using word 4 and don't see much advantage to going
 to word 5, since it is slower).
 
 any help or comments would be appreciated.  thanks in advance.
