 
 last week's macweek article by ric ford indicated that david ramsey's
 mac iix has been running nicely with a mac iici rom in it, offering
 clean 32-bit rom code (liberating his iix from the virtual memory
 nightmare caused by apple's 32-bit system enabler).
 
 does anyone know of a source for these roms?  is it okay for a
 remanufacturer to resell only rom chips from used machines?  i know that
 copies cannot be made, but it seems to me that it would be okay to
 resell the original used rom.  (after all, reselling a used computer
 involves the sale of the rom anyway, so what's the difference?).
 
 needless to say, i'm interested in purchasing such a rom.  what would
 be a reasonably price to offer?
