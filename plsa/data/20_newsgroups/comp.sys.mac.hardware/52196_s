    hi,
 
    i have been told by a local sales that asante has come out with this
    lciii pds ethernet adapter with an optional 68882 socket on the board.
    my question is will the fpu performance degrade will i put the 68882
    on the pds card socket instead of on the motherboard itself? intuitively,
    the math co-processor should always be placed close to the cpu, but
    i am not sure how good apple's so-called processor-direct slot is when
    it comes to throughout. does anyone know the answer to this or have
    any experience with the asante lciii ethernet adapter? thanks in advance.
 
 from what i've heard the pds slot clock is only 16mhz, to be
 compatible with the old lc style boards, while the fpu socket close to
 the cpu is clocked at 25mhz.
 
 i guess a board designed for the lciii can get a 25mhz clock from the
 extended pds socket...
