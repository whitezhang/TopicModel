 the kit is for an already existing laserwriter iintx. it is a rom
 upgrade that replaces the font rasterizer code with the more
 efficient, speedier code that first became available in adobe type
 manager 1.0.
 
 that software came out after the original ntxes and the so-called
 atm rasterizer is now standard on postscript printers.
