 no.  i recently bought an lc ii with a 14" monitor.  the monitor comes with
 the type of power cable that plugs into the switched outlet on the back of
 most larger macs.  since the lc ii doesn't have one of these outlets, there
 was an extra standard power cable included with the computer for use with
 the monitor.  but it was in the computer box, not the monitor box.  it's
 not as if the cables are particularly expensive, though.  $10-$15 at the
 most.
