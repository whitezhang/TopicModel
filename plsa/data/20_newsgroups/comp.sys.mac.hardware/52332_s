 db>the installation instructions are most informative and say, in full,
 db>"this product must be installed by an apple ........."
 
 db>so what does this do ? at first i thought it might be a nt to ntx
 db>upgrade, but i thought that required an entirely new board.
 
 sounds like you got the adobe rom upgrade for an ntx. that describes
 the kit i got when i upgraded to the 51.2 or 52.1 postscript in my ntx.
