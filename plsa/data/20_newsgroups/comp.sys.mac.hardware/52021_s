 hello out there!
 
 my mac iisi runs a radius pivot le monitor, with the pds card.
 
 as i wanted to try to switch to 32 bit adressing, i couldn't startup my mac
 anymore.
 
 1.	what is the trick to zap the pram (so i won't have to take out the
 battery next time)
 
 2.	is there any trick that could allow me to switch to 32bit?
 
 3.	what does 32bit adressing bring to me as an user? faster work?
 
 4.	any chance to have more than 8mb of adressable memory with 24bit
 adressing?
 
 thank you a lot for your answers (via mail or reply)
