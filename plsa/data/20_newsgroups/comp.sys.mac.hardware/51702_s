 i think that there do exist nubus expansion cages (i'm sure i've seen
 them advertised occassionally), but i think that the main problem is that
 they cost much more than the difference in price between say a lc and iivx
 so unless you need lots of nubus slots its not worth the bother.
 
 (of course, it may be that these extra boxes are so expensive because
 no one buys them because they are so expensive...)
 
 nubus technology isn't a special apple proprietry thing (i have this
 sneaky feeling that it is licensed from texas instruments???) so there
 is no problem building an expansion box.
 
 the difference between nubus and pds is that nubus is a clever interface
 with lots of neat toys built in to make sure that lots of cards can work
 together on the same computer. pds (processor direct slot) is just that:
 here are all the connections to the processor. you can do anything with
 this and it is as quick as it can be, but there's no cooperation. you
 may be able to get double pds slot adaptors but you try plugging 2
 video cards in, and just watch them conflict! of course, the extra 
 electronics in a nubus slot makes it appreciably more expensive, so
 guess why apple doesn't put it in it's cheaper machines?
 
 so, yah pays yer money and yah takes yah choice.
