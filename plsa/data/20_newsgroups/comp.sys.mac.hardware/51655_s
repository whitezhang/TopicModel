 hi all:
 thanks to you all who have responded
 to my request for info on various kinds of fax modem.
 i'd like to ask a few more questions.
 1.  what are the advantages of buying a global village
 teleport gold over other cheaper brands like supra, zoom etc?
 2.  i heard that both supra and zoom use the same software.
 why are there so many complaints about the incompatibility problems
 of supra?  what kind of incompatibility is it?
 3.  if i decided to buy the teleport gold, is there any
 possibility to add a voice option in the near future?
 4.  has anyone heard of a possible voice option that supra will offer
 this coming summer?
 5.  a person did mention a new at&t modem.  is it
 getting good reviews from various mac magazines?
 6.  if i want the best, fastest, most economically sound and
 possible voice option, what fax modem should i buy?
 
 sorry for posting so many questions, but i think they're necessary.
 i promise to repost any answers if they're not already posted by a responder.
 
 thanks so much in advance.
 
 regards,
 
 thian.
