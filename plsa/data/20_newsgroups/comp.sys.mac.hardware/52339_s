 well,
 
     you can always try and find a pc dealer who sells guaranteed memory.
 i work at a company growing at 40% a year, we have on order hundreds
 of computers per year.  it never fails, machines come in with bad simms.
 now for those of you who are wondering just why your pc or mac just crashed
 i can tell you i always thought it was the incompetent ass who wrote or
 designed the software.
     well, i don't think that way anymore, especially with the results i
 have gotten with replacing bad simms in my own machine and others at work.
 the moral to this story is to make sure your memory is good.  i would
 be willing to bet lots of you out there have simms with either soft
 or hard errors on them and you don't even know about it, but every once
 in awhile those bad simms just makes your life hell.
    
 i just got plain sick of dealing with peoples complaints that thier machine
 just crashed and they lost thier work.  in case your wondering, or if you
 haven't already guessed i work in an is department.  service is a do or die
 perogative in this line of work, so the moral is:  have your memory tested
 with a simm hardware tester...and no i don't mean the simple little software
 programs that you can run in your machine.  simms are complicated little
 beasts and they needs special hardware to test them effectively.
 
 if any of you are interested in getting one of these nifty little devices
 which are not cheap, write me back.  they make life a little bit easier, and
 besides they pay for themselves in a short time from the loss of productivity
 people would have to deal with when thier machine commits suicide.
