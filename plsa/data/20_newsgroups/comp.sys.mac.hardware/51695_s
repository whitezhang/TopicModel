 please drop me a note with details of your experience. the more reports 
 obtained, the more accurate the numbers i will generate.

   1) top speed achieved
   2) system configuration at top mhz setting
        a) speed rating of the cpu (the last two digits printed on cpu #)
        b) presence of additional heat sinks
        c) nubus & fpu cards used
        d) floppy drive functionality on both 800 and 1.4 m disks
   3) damage incurred during modification
   4) damage due to higher speed use
   5) average length of time the cpu is on. (i.e. 8 hours a day)
   6) unusual other modifications to the usual procedure
