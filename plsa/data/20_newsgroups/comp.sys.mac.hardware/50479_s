 i've got the official word on the laserwriter pro 600 memory
 upgrade.
 
 i just got off of the phone with the quite friendly donna rossi
 at apple customer assistance.  she tells me that those who
 purchased the laserwriter pro 600 in a 4 megabyte (300dpi, no
 greyscale) configuration should contact their original dealers
 who are supposed provide the 4-meg memory upgrade.  for those
 who don't know, the extra 4-meg will allow printing at 600dpi 
 or greyscale (at 300dpi).
 
 if the dealers have questions, they should be directed to their
 hardware support numbers and/or apple customer assistance 
 1-800-776-2333, 408-996-1010 (corporate number).
 
 regards,
 
 glenn
 
 p.s. - personally, i'm annoyed at our school bookstore.  they
 really have an obligation to provide this information to all
 of the customers who purchased the 600 in the original 
 configuration (they have the records...that's why they ask for
 things like a phone number).  when i get my upgrade completed, 
 i'm going to write apple and complain.
