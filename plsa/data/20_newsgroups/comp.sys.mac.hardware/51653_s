 
 hi there,
 
 
 i have a question regarding quadras vram. i have tried to find info on this
 but i could not get precise answers.
 
 on one hand, we have a quadra 950 with a 16" monitor, which is capable of
 32-bit color. how much vram does it have?
 on the other hand, we have a quadra 800 with a 16" monitor, which is capable
 of 8-bit color only, so it must have 512 ko of vram.
 
 i would like to take vram simms for the 950 and put them in the 800 so that
 both machines have 16-bit color capability.
 is it possible, and if yes, how many vram simms should i take from the 950?
 from the documentation i have, the quadra 800 must get 1 mo vram to have
 16-bit color, is that correct?
 
 bonus question: where do vram simms hide? from the 950 documentation, they
 seem to be *behind* the power supply. do i really have to take off the power
 supply to access the vram simms?
 
 
 thanks for your help!
