 what is the maximum rate of the 6882 fpu that apple sells directly (apple
 part no. m6775 ll/a)?  the apple literature labels the fpu for classics and
 lc iii's so i assume it will do at least 25mhz.  my question is can i put
 it in a performa 600 (68030 @ 32mhz)?  the apple price is cheap at $78
 compared to ~$135 from mail order houses.  any one know the answer to this
 one?
