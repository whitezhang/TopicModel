 thanks for the enlightening post.  is there a technical note on this?
 
 the desktop machine i was referring to was actually not a mac,
 but rather, any of various workstations that use the
 68030@25mhz, such as old suns or old nexts.  i used to own a next
 68030 cube.   
 
 but i will try rebooting without extensions to see what kind of
 a speed difference i get with my powerbook duo. i did notice an
 extreme slowdown to unusability with a mac plus after
 installing system 7 on it.  why does the os suck up so much cpu
 power? 
 
 also, you're right--software does make a huge difference.  i
 have the misfortune of using ms-works on my duo.  when editing
 relatively small (40k) files, cut or copy takes several
 seconds, often more than 6 seconds!!  this happens with power
 cycling turned off.  as usual, ms software is maggot-infested
 feces. 
 i'm getting nisus to replace it for my text editing.
