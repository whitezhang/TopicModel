 peter, i'm sure someone out there has a better/easier way to do what you want
 to do, but i'll tell you how we do it where i work. we have about 15 macs
 networked together using appletalk and phonenet connectors. to chat we use a
 program called 'broadcast'. with it we can send brief messages to all or
 selected machines within the network.
 
 hope that helps...
