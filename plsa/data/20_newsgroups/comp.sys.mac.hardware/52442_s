  
 a friend is heavily into midi and is using a quadra 900 (maybe 950) with 
 all but one nubus slot populated with arcane music hardware and a video
 card.  he reports 8 bit video is too slow for good real-time display of
 what he needs to see.  he also reports that the built-in video is even
 worse.  he's not a mac guru, and i haven't seen the system, so this is
 about all i know.
 
 i suspect that his nubus is heavily loaded, and think improvements might
 come from a switch to an accelerated pds slot video card.  does this
 sound right?  who makes a pds accelerated video card for the quadra thats
 worth looking at?  any other suggestions?  thanks in advance!
