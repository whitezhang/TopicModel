 i also returned pb memory last summer for credit, and the sales person warned
 me not to use us mail.  i did (although i did insure the shipment), and 
 apparently techworks got it.
 
 my minor grip with techworks is that they have different price lists for
 different people.  i ordered duo memory, thinking i got their "best" price
 because of my employeer.  i subsequently found out that apple was offering
 developers memory for less than techworks charged, called up to complain,
 and was told i should have said i was an apple developer and they credited
 my card for about 16% of the purchase price.   i like techworks quality
 and installation instructions (and they include powerbook tools), but 
 for out-of-ca purchases (no sales tax) chip merchant seems to be a bit less.
