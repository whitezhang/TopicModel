 how about some numbers here? some kind of benchmark?
 if you want, let me start it - 486dx2-66 - 32 specint92, 16 specfp92 .

 numbers? pentium @66mhz - 65 specint92, 57 specfp92 .
 	 powerpc @66mhz - 50 specint92, 80 specfp92 . (note this is the 601)
         (alpha @150mhz  - 74 specint92,126 specfp92 - just for comparison)

 not in a clock-doubled system. there isn't a doubling in performance, but
 it _is_ quite significant. maybe about a 70% increase in performance.
 
 besides, for 0 wait state performance, you'd need a cache anyway. i mean,
 who uses a processor that runs at the speed of 80ns simms? note that this
 memory speed corresponds to a clock speed of 12.5 mhz.

 numbers?
