 i recently upgraded to system 7.1 and now i also upgraded my
 deskwriter drivers from 2.2 to 3.1.  i got the software from sumex,
 but it is not clear to me where to install what.
 
 can someone tell me which of the files that come with dw-3.1 go where
 and for what purpose?  what can be left out, for instance, if
 you don't want to do background printing?
 
 thanks,
 
 	tom
