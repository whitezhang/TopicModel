 i'm considering buying one of these to offload the internal video
 in my iici and to get 24 bit color capability on my 13" monitor. what's
 the deal on them?
 
 1) do they come with varying amounts of ram? if so, what is the max
 and min? how much do i need for 640 x 480 x 24 bits?
 
 2) what bit depths are supported? one, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 24?
 
 3) are all these cards accelerated or just some? is it true that
 modern accelerated video cards are (at least in general) faster? what
 bit depths are accelerated, all or just 24 bit? i've heard that some
 applications actually run *slower* with this card if they write directly
 to the screen (or something like that). is this a frequent problem?
 how much slower is it?
 
 4) didn't i read (when system 7 first came out) that the card was
 incompatible? if so, how was this corrected (finder patch, some init,
 or other)? has it been kept compatible with 7.1? are there many other
 apps that it is incompatible with (games or important (i.e., non-
 microsloth) apps, for example)?
 
 5) if you have a strong opinion on it's value for someone in my position,
 let me know what you think a reasonable price is to pay for it.
 
 thanks a lot for you input.
