 i am boring my sister hp deskjet 500c for the weekend and i was wondering
 in their was any drivers for it available some where that would allow
 me to use it with my mac se/30.  i have a copy of macprint but i do think
 that i have a driver for the 500c.  i would be happy to get it working
 in black & white, but if there is away to get the color working that would
 be better.  any ideas someone?
 
 regards,
