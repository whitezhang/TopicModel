 i have ordered several macs from different mail order companies with absolutely zero problem. you have to dig around to find the true gray market dealers that sell macs with authentic serial numbers untouched. there are value-added dealers (nothing to do with vat, no flame please) that are very legitimate.
 
 cda unfortunately is one of those that replace the serial number with their own to prevent apple from tracing which authorized dealer sold that machine to cda.
