 
 i thnik i'll be able to pick up  a piar of mac 512k's for nothing, but
 their power supplies are dead.  anyone know where i can pick up a pair
 of refurbished ps's for cheap (preferably mail order).
 yes, i do have uses planned fior them.  one will be sold to a friend who
 just needs a terminal to connect via modem to his e-mail account.
 the other will be used by me as a net client to run my downloads and/or
 printing.
   
 also, what is the latest system software usable with these suckers?
