 ok, if i post where this comes from, will people stop sending email 
 asking where i negotiated the deal? ;-)
 
 the deal is from "international computer and networking" in ca.
 (i saw the ad int he back of macworld and macuser)...
 phone number is 310-441-9181 and the deal may have changed since
 a few weeks ago, since they change prices about every ten minutes ;-)
 
 alas, this is a funny system, it sounds like a good deal, but this is a 
 centris 650, 4mb (on the motherboard) 4mb simm, 80mb hd, no ethernet
 and no coprocessor (well, actually it's a 68lc040 instead of a 68rc040,
 'just had to say that to keep people from saying "there is no such thing
 as an '040 without a coprocessor, since the fpu is built into the chip")
 
 ok, there ya have it, but if i were you, i would wait untill the cyclones
 come out and buy a quadra 800 ;-)
