 does anyone know if there are any devices available for the mac which
 will increase the number of serial ports available for use
 simultaneously?  i would like to connect up to 8 serial devices to my
 mac for an application i am working on. i must be able to access each
 one of the independently.
 
 if such a device exists, are there are any limits to the number of
 serial devices i can use?
 
 any information is appreciated.
