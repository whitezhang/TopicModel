 >1) specs for the 68040 (esp. how it compares to the pentium)
 
 specs for the 68040 can fill a 500 page book.  some highlights are...
 32-bit address space w/ 32-bit data width.  18 32-bit integer registers 
 & 8 80-bit floating point registers.  8k copyback capable caches,
 4-way set associative.  typical 1.2 clocks/integer instruction.  5
 clocks for a floating point multiply.
 
 (interesting aside: the 68040 can multiply two 80-bit floating point
 numbers in less time than it can multiply two 32-bit integers)
 
 >2) specs for the 68060 with estimated cost, release date, etc...
 
 more of the same but with multiple instruction dispatching.  figure
 about 0.8 clocks per instruction typical (my guess).  but the motorola
 guys are pretty bright, it may be less.

 call motorola.  i'm not typing it all in.

 i'm predicting that both the 680x0 and x86 lines are reaching their
 ends.  new experimental processors have 64-bit data pathways and can
 schedule up to 8 out of 32 instructions each clock cycle.  that sort
 of trick can't really be done with cisc architectures.
 
 i finally saw some details on the 586/pentium and was not greatly
 impressed.  they've finally done some work on the fpu to get it up to
 speed, but otherwise it's only going to be a 2x speedup.  and to get
 that they're using two integer units, larger caches, and a branch
 target buffer.  yes, i know they're talking about 100mhz processors.
 big whoop.  designing a 100mhz board is difficult and really
 expensive.  priced 15ns memory chips lately?
