 try looking at the brainstorm accelerator for the plus.  i believe it is
 the best solution because of the performance and price.  why spend $800
 upgrading a computer that is only worth $300 ????
   the brainstorm accelerator is around $225.  it speeds up the internal
 clock speed to 16mhz.  that may not seem like much but it also speeds up
 scsi transfers.  i think that feature is unique to brainstorm.
 check it out.
