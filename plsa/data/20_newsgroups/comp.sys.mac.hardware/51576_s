 okay, i don't use it very much, but i would like for it to keep working
 correctly, at least as long as apple continues to make system software
 that will run on it, if slowly :-)
 
 here is the problem:  when the screen is tilted too far back, vertical
 lines appear on the screen.  they are every 10 pixels or so, and seem
 to be affected somewhat by opening windows and pulling down menus.
 it looks to a semi-technical person like there is a loose connection
 between the screen and the rest of the computer.
 
 i am open to suggestions that do not involve buying a new computer,
 or taking this one to the shop.  i would also like to not have
 to buy one of larry pina's books.  i like larry, but i'm not sure
 i feel strongly enough about the computer to buy a service manual
 for it.
 
 on a related note:  what does the monitor connector connect to?
