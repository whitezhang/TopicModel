     ah... ok. i didn't realize that you were talking about an apple
 division other than appleus. appleus, being the main division, is the
 one that contains what most people feel are the correct names and
 configurations for the majority of apple customers, and it is generally
 assumed that you are talking about appleus when you just say apple. at
 least that's how it has always been in this newsgroup. all other apple
 divisions are, apparantly, free to change names and configurations if
 they feel like it. i know that apple canada does this kind of stuff all
 the time. it's not a mistake, it's apple sweden giving a different name
 to an apple product other than what appleus calls it.
