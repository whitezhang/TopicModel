 i'm currently having trouble connecting my pb to a true blue (ibm model
 1513) vga monitor.  the display is bearly readable but all the details are
 seperated into yellow and red colors. ie. a window will have two images one
 in yellow and a ghost image in red.  the background is also a little
 greenish.  i read some time ago, before i ever thought i would hook my mac
 up to a vga screen, about an incompatability with some vga monitors due to
 the sync on green signal.  does this sound like it could be the same demon?
  i also read that there are both hardware (putting a diode on the green
 signal?) solution and a software solution to this problem.  i don't the
 details does somebody have them the can e-mail to me or post them?  i
 checked all the faq's for this and didn't find anything about it.  did i
 miss it somewhere?  this sure seems that it would be a good thing to have
 in one.  thanks for any replys.
