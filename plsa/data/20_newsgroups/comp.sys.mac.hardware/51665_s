 i've had my duo 230 for a few weeks now and suffer from both
 of the above problems. i reinstalled my system software twice
 in an effort to combat the problems - thinking they were
 system software problems. initially reinstalling the system
 seemed to help but not anymore. occasionally when i try to
 wake up the duo i get a solid screen of horizontal lines on
 the screen - it freezes.
 
 i also get the high-pitched hiss occasionally - but only at
 startup.
 
 i've called the apple hotline (800 sos-appl) three times
 already and finally they agreed something is astray after my
 duo's screen would go dim and the hard drive spun down by
 itselft and put itself to sleep. this problem only occured
 twice. apple sent me a box to ship my duo to be looked at in
 new york but the problem now is intermittent and i can't
 afford to be without my duo at this time.
 
 anyone out there with these same problems?
