 a local dealer is offering mac ii vi machines equipped with kodak multi-
 session compatible cd-rom drives for what seems like an attractive price:
 $1500. i've used many other models up to a ii ci, but this would be the
 first i could have my own mac. is it safe to buy an about-to-be discontinued
 model such as this. i'd like to yank the cd-rom drive out, put it in a
 housing and share it with my pc. is this feasible? the only info i have on
 the ii vi is that it is relatively slow (16mhz), has an 68030 chip with a
 math coprocessor. i want to add a non-apple portrait monitor and use this
 machine for hypercard stack design. is this a good buy, or would i be
 wasting my money? i would appreciate some advice. thanks!
