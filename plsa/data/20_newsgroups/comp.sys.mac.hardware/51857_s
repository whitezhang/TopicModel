 hello all,
 
 if anyone knows of a place to get the case to hold the power supply and
 motherboard of a quadra 950 please let me know.  i have tried some mail
 order places and some local stores.  both groups would prefer that i part
 with over $1000 to get just the case.  in my eyes this seems about $600-$700
 to much.  any comments?  i currently own the guts of a 950.
 
 please email me or post to this group w/ info,
 
 thanks in advance,
 andy
