 i'm trying to find some information on accelerator boards for the se. has
 anyone used any in the past, especially those from extreme systems, novy or
 macproducts? i'm looking for a board that will support extended video,
 especially radius's two-page monitor. has anyone used connectix virtual in
 conjunction with their board? any software snafus? are there any stats
 anywhere on the speed difference between a board with an fpu and one
 without? please send mail directly to me. thanks.
