 sorry, i assumed that the the various new machines with the internal
 cd-rom bay worked the same as the quadra 900.  obviously they don't.
 i can use any of three inputs by changing the radio button under
 the sound cp on my quadra 900, microphone, external, and cd-rom.  i
 always leave the microphone plugged in (even though i never use
 it).
