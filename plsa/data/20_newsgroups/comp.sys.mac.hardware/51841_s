 i have  a strange piece of equipment to unload. it is a ether+ scsi interface.
 apparently, it can be plugged into a scsi port and from there to an ethernet.
 that way you save a slot. nifty. well, i assume you people know more about it,
 so, judging by the $350 price tag new, i'll ask, say, $75? anybody interested?
