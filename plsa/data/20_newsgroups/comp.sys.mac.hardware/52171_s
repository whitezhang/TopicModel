 
  i just thought i would pass along my experience with aps. i recently ordered
  an external quantum 240. the salesperson was friendly and knowledgeable, the
  order came when promised, and the invoice was at the price quoted. 
 
  installing the drive was simple; i didn't even have to read the manual. the
  scsi address is set by a pushbutton arrangement. i daisy-chained the drive
  from my syquest (also from aps) and booted up with no problems. 
 
  i'm still going through all the shareware that comes on the drive. it's a
  pretty good assortment.
 
  the drive/fan is a bit noisier than i would like, but i think it'll be ok.
  the speed seems very good, although i haven't run any objective tests. it
  also seems to spin up pretty quickly; i can hit the power switch for it, and
  almost immediately power the mac without any problems booting from the drive.
 
  some observations: the case is plastic (good quality, though) while my older
  syquest case is metal. there is one led, which is normally green, and
  flickers red as the drive is accessed.
 
  just a data point,
  rich
