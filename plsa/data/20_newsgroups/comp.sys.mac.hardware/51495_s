 there's this old se here. it's got the older-style fans that remind
 me of a house-ventilator. a cylindrical drum instead of the bladed rotor
 i usually see. anyway, the se makes this loud buzzing noise due
 to vibration somewheres. if i remove the screws and loosen the front
 from the back, it quiets down. i can only assume that the fan housing
 from this goofy thing is touching the back of the case and vibrating
 against it. 
 
 anyway, any suggestions for where to get replacement fans and how to
 "stealth" this guy? your experiences welcome.....
