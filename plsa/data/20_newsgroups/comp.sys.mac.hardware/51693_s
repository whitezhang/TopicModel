 i have no experience with this particular hardware, but
 just about every month in macworld there is an add for
 an combined se accelerator/video board.  this item sells
 for about $1000 and comes with a 25mhz 68030/68882 pair,
 eight simm slots, and a grayscale 21" monitor.
 
 this accelerator plugs into the se's lone expansion port
 and thus no soldering.  you will however, need a long
 torx wrench to get the case open (but that's not really
 a big deal).
 
 does that sound like what you were looking for?
