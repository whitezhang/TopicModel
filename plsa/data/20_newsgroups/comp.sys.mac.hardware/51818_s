 	i'm looking for a cache card for my iisi. i can spend $250 max for it,
 	what i need is 64 kb cache with a fpu socket and a dual slot adapter.
 	or at least a passe_through connector so i can keep my graphic card.
 	i need your advice about the best card i can buy. how much performance
 	increase i should expect, does the performance increase between the
 	32 and 64 kb cache worths the price difference ?. and what's the best
 	price i can get for such a card (i really need to spare each possible
 	$). 
 	i have an ethernet card for the lc with fpu. i don't think it would
 	work for the iisi but the fpu is socketed. do you think i can take the
 	fpu out of the card and put it in the empty fpu socket ?. would it work
 	at 20 mhz ?. if not, how much should i pay for an extra fpu ?.
