 
   at work we have a small appletalk network with 3 macs and  couple of printers.
 we also have a pc that has some specialized accounting software that we would 
 like to operate from any of the macs. we have soft pc, and i have found that the
 software works just fine under it, but i would like to have all of the data
 for the program reside at one place (the pc hard disk). so my question for you
 is(actually questions)
 
  1) is there a board for the pc that will allow you to hook into an appletalk
     network?
 
  2) if #1 is possible, is there any software/hardware combination that will 
     allow me to mount the pc hard disk as a networked disk on the macs so i
     can use soft pc to run the application?
 
  3) if #1 or #2 is impossible, is there any other way to accomplish what i am
     after?
