 i am, at long last, going to replace my beloved 512ke.
 i am looking at a new lc iii and a used iici.  prices
 have yet to be worked out, so i'm just thinking right now
 about their merits and drawbacks.
 
 here's what i've thought of:
 
 the iici has much greater potential for expansion, a la nubus and
 greater memory capacity.
 
 the lc iii would be new, under warranty, newer roms (is the iici
 "32-bit clean"?), and would have sound input.  i also like the
 "pizza-box" case.
 
 performance-wise, i have read that they are almost identical, the
 lc iii being a little slower.
 
 so, which should i get?
