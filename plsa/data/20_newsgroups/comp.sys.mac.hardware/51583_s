 for a good display, you *must* get an active matrix panel and a *very*
 bright overhead projector designed to be used with an lcd panel (i.e.
 stage must not get too hot). i tried out a proxima ovation unit and liked
 it, but i needed a brighter projector (i used it with a 3m 920). it is
 also too expensive for what you get, imho. prices of active matrix panels
 are rumoured to drop substantially sometime this year (something to do
 with tarrifs being lifted i think). 
 
 in canadian dollars, the proxima ovation models ranged in price from about
 $5000 to $7000 and a good overhead projector about $1000 to $1500. for
 that kind of money, you can get a brighter image from a three beam
 projector, but sacrifice portability.
 
 oh yes, proper room lighting is extremely important, especially if you
 want your audience to have enough light to read handouts and not have that
 light wash out your display at the front of the room. tricky to get right.
