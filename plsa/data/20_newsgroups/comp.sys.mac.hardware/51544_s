 1. the mac ii is supposed to have a socket for the mc68851 pmmu chip. could
 anyone let me know where that socket is on the motherboard. i have obtained
 a pmmu chip (16 mhz) from a surplus store, and would like to install it onto
 my mac ii (circa 1987). but i cannot see the socket myself when i tried to
 install it.
 
 2. could anyone send me the pinouts for the mac ii scsi db-25 interface?
 
 
 thank you.
