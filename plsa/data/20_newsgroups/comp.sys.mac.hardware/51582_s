 i recall reading that the mac lc (and presumably the lc ii & iii) can use stand
 ard vga monitors, with appropriate cable adapters.  i am uncertain of this sinc
 e i have asked other people who say this is not so.  so can all vga monitors be
  used on the mac lc?  what are the specs needed for a pc monitor to work with a
 mac lc (horizontal nad vertical frequencies)?
