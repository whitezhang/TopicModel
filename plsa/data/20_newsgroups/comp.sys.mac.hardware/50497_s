 i am going to be getting a c650 soon, but i don;t want apple 
 to come out with the cyclones and the tempest in a month
 and have the price drop on the system i want.  i have negotiated a 
 good deal with a supplier for a c650 8/80 and i would like to jump on it,
 but, again, i don't want the price drop to smuther me.  btw, the deal
 i have is a c650 8/80 with mouse for $2295... does anyone know of a better
 deal?
 
 thanks,
