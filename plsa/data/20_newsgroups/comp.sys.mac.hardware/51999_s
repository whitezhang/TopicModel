 i have found that you should observe the following with almost all new
 equipment :
 
 check for warrany tape.  if none, carefully open unit.
 
 inspect for loose wires, jumpers, screws, and other trash.
 
 clean up these manufacturing mistakes.
 
 *now* power up the unit and check it out.
 
 i can't think of how many things i've bought that weren't okay right out of
 the box due to sloppy qc.

 ps : this goes for any manufacturer.  i'm not picking on anyone.
