 i too had a very unpleasant experience with "hardware that's shi*". it
 featured repeated lies about when things had shipped, a salesperson who
 was totally ignorant about what he was selling, a charge for duties i
 had specifically been assured were not payable and then a monitor (their
 house brand 2-page monochrome) that was the most unadulterated piece of
 junk it has ever been my misfortune to experience in the world of
 electronics.
 
 i shipped it back and they refunded my money, but it still cost me
 something over $200 for long distance charges, non-refundable taxes
 and duties and lost time.
 
 don't deal with them.
