     this is something i asked before, but i don't think i got an answer, or
 maybe i lost the answer, or maybe it's just an obvious question (:->). will 
 the gx stuff (on-line docs etc.) be available on the develop cds, or will it 
 only go out to people in the developer's program and such? just curious.
