 i recently bought a pli 21mgbyte floptical drive, and i was very happy 
 with it until i tried to use it to format a 1.4 hd diskette. i put the
 hd floppy in my superdrive to check that the floptical had formatted it
 correctly, and now my superdrive refuses to recognize any floppy (it says
 "this disk is unreadable" and asks if i want to format it) even original
 systems floppies from apple. nor will it format the disks if i try to
 ("initialization failed!")  strangely enough the floptical still reads
 both the 21 mb and 1.4 hd disks, but i cant look at my 800k floppies, and
 if i have a crash i'm screwed because the floptical can't be used as a
 start-up disk.  pli has been unresponsive.  any ideas? has this happened
 to anyone before? i was looking for an inexpensive storage solution, and
 now i am looking at an expensive repair.  help! respond to this thread, or
 email mfeldman@acs.bu.edu
