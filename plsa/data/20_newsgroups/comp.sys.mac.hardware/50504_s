 i'm having a real tough time finding out the proper adapters to use a vga
 monitor (an ibm 8513 sold w/ many ps/2's to be exact) on the mac lc iii. 
 all of the vendors i have called say that the internal video will not work
 on a true vga monitor but will work on a ibm compatible multisync like the
 sony's or the nec monitors.  i thought the vga capability of lciii was very
 attractive because it allowed you to use inexpensive vga monitors.  am i
 confused or are these vendors just not up to speed?  has anyone used an
 lciii with a non multisync vga monitor and if so where did you get your
 adapter (please be specific w/ vendor and cat #)?  i would prefer to get a
 apple monitor for these lciii's (it's unseemly to see the finder inside an
 ibm bezel) but the more money we save on monitors the more lciii's we can
 afford and the more ps/2's we can get rid of!
