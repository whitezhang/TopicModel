 hi!
 
 i am looking for a source of lithium batteries for an original mac ii.  the
 number on the battery is er 1/2 aa.  local electronic shops & computer stores
 freak when inquire.  the fastest any of them can get a battery to me is 2-3
 weeks for about $20.  anything faster and/or cheaper is welcome!
 
 please respond to me via e-mail and i will summarize to the net.
 
 note my e-mail address differs from the return address of this posting.
 
 thanks in advance for your help!
