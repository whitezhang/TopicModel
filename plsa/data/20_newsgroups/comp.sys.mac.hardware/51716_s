 anyone know what would cause my iicx to not turn on when i hit the keyboard
 switch?  the one in the back of the machine doesn't work either...
 the only way i can turn it on is to unplug the machine for a few minutes,
 then plug it back in and hit the power switch in the back immediately...
 sometimes this doesn't even work for a long time...
 
 i remember hearing about this problem a long time ago, and that a logic 
 board failure was mentioned as the source of the problem...is this true?
