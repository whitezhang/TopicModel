 i have read one report of a brave soul who rewired the 40 mhz clock and a higher
 speed clock oscillator's outputs through a double throw switch to allow different
  speeds. there was no mention of any attempts to switch speeds on the fly but
 if the si uses timing loops anything like a quadra for accessing its floppy
 drive, dynamic switching will wreak havoc. a quadra must reboot after having its
 clock speed significantly changed or it will be unable to properly access its
 floppy drive.
