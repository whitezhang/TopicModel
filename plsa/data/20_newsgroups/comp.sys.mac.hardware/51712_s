 i have a (very old) mac 512k and a mac plus, both of which 
 have the same problem.
 
 their screens blank out, sometimes after a minor physical jolt
 (such as inserting a floppy in the internal drive), sometimes 
 all by themselves (computer left to itself just goes blank).
 
 i have replaced the wires connecting the logic boards and the 
 video board, because it seemed at first that jiggling the wires
 made the screen come back on.  this worked for a while, but the
 blanking out has returned.
 
 can i do anything?  do i need a new power supply?  a new crt?
 a new computer?
 
 thanks for any advice...
