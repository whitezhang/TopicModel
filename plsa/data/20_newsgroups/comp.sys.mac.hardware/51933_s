 the si has a single expansion slot, that can be either pds or nubus, but not
 both together. the card lies parallel to and above the motherboard & hd and
 requires an adaptor slot to do this. there are nubus and pds adaptort cards.
 thus, what kind of slots you have depends on what kind of adapter card you
 have. with the exception of the radius rocket, all nubus cards i know of work
 in the si. pds slots and thus cards are mac specific, thus not all pds cards
 work in all macs.
