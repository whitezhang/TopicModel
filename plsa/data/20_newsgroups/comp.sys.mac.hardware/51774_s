 i had the same problem with my 512 a long time ago.  resoldering
 the joints on the motherboard (all of them) fixed it.  turns out
 that continuous heating and cooling caused annular (ring-shaped)
 cracks to develop in the solder, effectively cutting the video
 circuitry off.  if you're not a solder-jockey you might want to
 have someone else do it -- i took mine to an electrical engineer
 buddy -- but it was a 20-minute job, tops.
