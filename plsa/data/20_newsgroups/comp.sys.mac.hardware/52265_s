 i have done several of these upgrades (about 6 iisi's, and 1 quadra 700), and
 the best thing to use would be some sort of "heat sink compound". if possible,
 you should look for the silicon-free stuff. there's a comany who makes the stuff
 called tech spray, their address is: p.o. box 949, amarillo, tx 79105.
 
 you should be wary in using most kinds of tape; and definately don't use duct
 tape  that stuff is for ducts...
 
 when using the heat sink glue or compound, only use enough to fill the small
 space between the heat sink and the cpu.
