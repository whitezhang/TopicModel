 i was reading a review of the centris 610 in this 
 months macworld and the reviewer said that for 
 $4 you could make an adjustment on the clock speed
 of the chip and change it from 20mhz to 25mhz.  i 
 haven't heard of this before, and i don't think that
 this is the 040 chip replacement (with fpu) that i have
 seen so much talk about.  anyone have any ideas?
