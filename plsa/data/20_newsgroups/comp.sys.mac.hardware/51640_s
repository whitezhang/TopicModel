 
 i have a new 25 mhz motorola 68040 that i am willing to sell if i get
 a good enough offer.  it is still in its static free sealed package.
 
 if i don't get a good enough offer, i will use it to replace my 68lc040.
 
 any takers?  
 
 supposedly you can get one of these for $375.  however, at the moment the
 demand is higher than the supply so i think $400 is a good round number.
 i will pay shipping, of course.
 
 all offers should be send to lewallen@cis.ohio-state.edu
