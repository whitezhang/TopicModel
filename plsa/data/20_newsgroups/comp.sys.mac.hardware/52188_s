 need an extended keyboard? don't like how much space an official apple
 extended barge takes up?
  
 buy my datadesk mac-101e!!!!!!
  
 i've gotten some repetitive syndrome injury, and thus i bought an apple
 split keyboard.
  
 i don't need two keyboards, so i'm selling it....(the datadesk that is)
  
 $85 or best offer - includes ground shipping... may or may not include the
 adb cable. probably will.
