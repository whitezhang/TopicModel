 i don't know about the instrutech boards (though i plan to check them out),
 but you need to be very careful checking the monotonicity and s/n ratio of
 many of the "16 bit" boards out there. the ni boards are very clearly
 specified in terms of monotonicity, s/n ratio, accuracy, etc; and the
 nb-a2100 and nb-a2150 have all the dyynamic range and freedom from
 distortion that you'd expect from a good, true 16 bit converter. this is
 not true for the spectral innovations boards, for example.
