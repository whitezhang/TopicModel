 a friend of mine recently acquired an 8!24 gc card for his iisi
 and was wondering why it always starts up in black and white.
 i know there have been numerous reports about the worth of
 the gc, but i was wondering if anyone could elaborate a little
 more on the subject.  any replies encouraged.  thanks in ad-
 vance.
