 hat the megadrives worked perfectly on both mymac plus and my powerbook 140.  it was for this reason i assumedthe problem had something to do with the quadra.  even with thequadra, they mostly worked ok.  the problem occurred when i ejecteda cartridge from a drive: it would start popping up dialog boxessaying "this cartridge must be formatted with jasmine driveware"even though there was no cartridge in the drive.	--mark
 t to format) i have this confirmed from apple computer in sweden (i work for a apple dealer as a service tech). we had problems that quadras wanted to format a diskette or a syquest when ther was nothing in the drive. this problem was fixed sytem 7.1mikael fredriksson-------------------------------------------------email: mikael_fredriksson@macexchange.semac exchange bbspl 3813s-437 92 lindomeswedenbbs +46-31-948290 (5 lines)fax +46-31-948294fido 2:203/211
