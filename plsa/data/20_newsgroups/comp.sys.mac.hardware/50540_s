 sounds about right.
 
 if there is high demand for a product there is little incentive to
 aggresively cut prices.  once the demand fall off a bit, then is the
 time to start getting aggressive with pricing.  waiting too long can
 really hurt your business though :-)
 
 the powerbooks have sold very well up to now, if they are slowing
 down apple needs to come out with some lower priced versions (the
 only reason i own a powerbook is that i could spring for a $900 pb100,
 the rest of the lineup is way to pricey for me).  i'd bet they'll
 be coming out with more power versions too.
