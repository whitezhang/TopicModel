 what i did not get with my drive (cd300i) is the system install cd you
 listed as #1.  any ideas about how i can get one?  i bought my iivx 8/120
 from direct express in chicago (no complaints at all -- good price & good
 service).
 
 btw, i've heard that the system install cd can be used to boot the mac;
 however, my drive will not accept a cd caddy is the machine is off.  how can
 you boot with it then?
