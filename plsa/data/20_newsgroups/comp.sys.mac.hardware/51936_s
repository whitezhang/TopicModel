 what is your recommendation for a good hard-disk driver software for
 non-apple drives? i would mainly need it for a syquest removable media
 drive, but maybe for some normal drives too.
 i have heard and seen good things about silverlining, but don't know
 any competitors. it does not need to be fancy, filled with features...
 i more like it affordable.
 
 thanks
