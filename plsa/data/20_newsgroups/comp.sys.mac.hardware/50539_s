 i just got a quadra 800 8/230 and i've noticed that i can't change the
 desktop color from the beautiful gray.  i thought maybe i should reinstall
 the os using the "install me first, macintosh centris, quadra..." diskette
 because the system file on this diskette is more recent than the one on the
 hard disk.
 
 the easy install selects "macintosh cnetris system software".  does anyone
 know if i should use this or customize and use "system software for any
 macintosh"?  or does it matter?
 
 thanks in advance for any suggestions...
