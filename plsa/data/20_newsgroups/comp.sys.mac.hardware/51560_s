 i've just completed a successful upgrade of a an si to 27.5 mhz. i'm waiting
 on delivery of a 62 mhz clock for a final speed trial. definitely needed the
 heatsink. the cpu was quite hot to the touch at higher speeds until i glued
 on a 90 cent radio shack sink. 
 
 i made a call for reports of failures last week. no reports have arrived
 here. locally, in seattle there is a reported cpu damage due to the user
 slipping with the iron and putting a gash into the board -- not exactly
 a problem due to the cpu running too fast.
 
 i think it would be nice to have a poll to report top speeds and system
 configurations including pds and nubus cards which were used. i'd be happy
 to coordinate and report results
