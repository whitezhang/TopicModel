 dear netters,
 
 my sister has an apple 12" color display hooked up to an lc.
 
 problem:  there is an annoying, horizontal, ghost-like stripe that 
 precesses vertically about once per second.  it is about 1 cm high.
 she is in grave danger of going insane because of it.
 
 any ideas of what it might be and how i might cure it for her?

 ps: if i pick up the display (i thought it might be rfi from the lc) it 
 seems to get worse!
