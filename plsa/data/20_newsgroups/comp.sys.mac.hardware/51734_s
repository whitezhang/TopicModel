 i'm having exactly the same problem.  again, it's fine when i switch to 16
 colors or a smaller monitor.  my configuration is:
  
 model: centris 610 with 4 mb/80 hd, 512 vram, no cards
 monitor: mag mx15f with 16" monitor adaptor (for resolution of 832*624)
  
 i just discovered the problem a little while ago after plugging in my
 new mag monitor.  it seems to appear either when scrolling through a
 window or when using alpha or word and i enter <return>.
  
 my guess is bad vrams as well.  i really hope it isn't a design flaw.  is
 anyone at apple listening?

     try finding an init called basic color monitor.  this should clear
 up some probs with centris 610's and vga type monitors.  i know it
 exists, somewhere i have a binhexed copy, but i don't know where and
 never got around to installing it.  i have this problem on my sony 1604.
