 hi!
 a while back, there was a thread in this group about the use of the iwii
 in europe (in countries with 50 hz ac current).  the consensus at the time
 was that the iwii would not work there.  as i will be moving there this summer,
 i called apple to make sure and they told me (today) that the iwii (as bought
 in the u.s.) will definitely run on 50 hz ac current (as long as a step-down
 converter is employed if 240 v current is used).  the same info, turns out, can
 be found in the iwii manual (p. 127 in the 1989 version), but i didn't really
 trust that.  does anyone have any direct experience to the contrary?  just 
 wondering.
