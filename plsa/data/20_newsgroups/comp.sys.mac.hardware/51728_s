 readers,
 
 i have found that the cache upgrade options for the mac iisi include the
 following:	1) ae quicksilver
 		2) daystar fastcache iisi
 		3) daystar combocache iisi
 		4) logicache iisi 64k cache
 
 i'd be interested in hearing opinions on any or all of these options.
 the other alternative is to upgrade to a cpu accelerator such as the
 logicache 50 mhz. ideas, comparisions?
