 hello fellow humans, and other net creatures...
  
 if you're at all interested in this merchandise, please e-mail me:
 djk@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu
  
 i'm compacting my system and moving to a single monitor system, so i have
 two monitors and cards for sale. nothing at all is wrong with these pieces,
 i'm just wanting to conserve desk space, and get all of my info from one
 screen.
  
 i'd prefer to sell to people near austin and surrounding areas (within
 driving distance - like an hour away perhaps), but i can ship to you if you
 don't live near here. only problem is that i didn't keep the original boxes
 for the monitors, but i'm confident that my few months of full-time service
 in the shipping room will enable me to safely package the monitors and
 flip it in your direction.
  
 details:
  
 mirror full page display (monochrome) w/nubus card:
 ---------------------------------------------------
  
 **sold**
  
 sony 1304 14" color monitor:
 ----------------------------
 what's to say? it got top ratings in last year's macuser report. it's a sony,
 trinitron, arguably the best (but i'd rather not argue that point).
 it's a great monitor, in great shape, but i'm going to a bigger screen,
 and although i'd like to keep it, finances don't justify it.
  
 still selling for $599 at macland (where i bought it originally - not
 including shipping), will sell for **$475** (plus shipping). again, make an
 offer if that sounds unreasonable.
  
  
 rasterops 24si (24-bit accelerated, hardware zoom/pan, 4 meg ram):
 ------------------------------------------------------------------
 renamed the 24sx a few months after i bought it, this board is for 13"
 monitors, providing **accelerated 24-bit**, hardware zoom/pan, ntsc mode
 (you can plug it into something like the rasterops video expander and output
 ntsc), and 4 ram slots that use 1 meg or 4 meg simms for gworld ram, or a
 ram disk. software included for such functions. 4 meg of ram included (1 meg
 simms).
  
 selling for $605 at bottom line (without the ram - add $100), i'm asking
 **$525** (shipping included this time, it's just a card). original box and
 packaging. i'd actually prefer to sell the sony monitor and this card
 together, so if you want both, drop me e-mail and make a "bundled offer"
 for these items.
  
 ------------
  
 cheers.
