 a few posts back, somebody mentioned that the duo might crash if it has
 the wrong kind (non-self refreshing) of ram in it.  my duo crashes
 sometimes after sleep, and i am wondering if there is any software which
 will tell me whether or not i have the right kind of ram installed.  i
 had thought that the problem was the battery connection.
 
 thanks in advance,
