 it already happened as far as i know... i got some email about three
 weeks ago saying it was coming, and sure enough, a week after that the
 duos dropped in price.  i think the duo 210 4/80 is now around
 us$1,8xx.
 
 the educational prices have dropped, and i imagine others as well, but
 i haven't really checked around since i boycott the local necrocenter
 for reasons that extend over the past 13 years.
