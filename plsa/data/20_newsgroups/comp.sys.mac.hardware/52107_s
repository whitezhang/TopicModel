 i just ordered my subscription today.  call macweek's customer service
 dept. at (609) 461-2100 and quote some plastic.  if you forget the number,
 it's included in the statement of ownership, which is on the contents 
 page of the copy i have.  a one year subscription costs $99.00 in the u.s,
 canada, or mexico.  i was told my first issue would arrive in 4-6 weeks.
