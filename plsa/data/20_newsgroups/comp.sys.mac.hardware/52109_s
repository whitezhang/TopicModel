 hi,
 i'm having problems tying to get a sony dat drive to work.  i'm using
 retrospect 1.3ci,
 and my only luck with getting the drive to work has been with a mac iici,
 which has
 now unfortunately gone to another department.
   ideally, we want to attach it to our quadra 950 setup.  i can't seem to
 get the
 retrospect software to recognize the media at all.  when in the "devices"
 dialog,
 it can see the dat device, but comes up with, firstly, 'running', secondly
 'media failure' and then immediately 'contents unknown'.  this does not
 happen with the
 mac iici setup, which simply says 'ready'.
   i'm hoping someone else will have had similar problems but found some
 solution... i 
 know some others who have had problems with dat devices and their quadra,
 but they have
 a mac iici which they can use!
   
 the symptoms
 system software is 7.1, also didn't
 work with 7.0.1
   i have tried the following:
   turn off all extensions, except retrospect scsi (required)
   tested on a variety of machines:  quadra, iisi, and lc (at least).
   connected no other scsi devices
   tested all varieties of scsi termination etc.
   replaced the dat unit with a new one (yes!  we got that desperate!)
   read the retrospect manual (even more desperate :))
 
 replies via email would be greatly appreciated... thanks in advance. 
 i'll post any
 solutions to this group.
 
 cheers,
 matt.
