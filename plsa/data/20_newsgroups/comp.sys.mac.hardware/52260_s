 i have the logitech hand scanner for the mac.  it uses a scsi
 interface box that the standard scanner unit plugs into.  i
 have tried my friend's ibm hand scanner with the scsi box and
 it works.  see if you can get logitech to sell you the scsi
 box by itself.  warning:  most of the cost of mac handscanners
 is contained in the scsi interface box, so it could run up
 to around $200.  when i upgraded my old style scanner to
 the new gray scale model, it cost $75; they just gave me a new
 scan head and software; the box was the same.  the gray scale
 scanner + interface runs about $300; making it around $200 for
 the interface.
