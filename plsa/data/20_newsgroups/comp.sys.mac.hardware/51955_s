 can anyone tell me the procedure for hooking a personal laserwriter ntr
 serially to a mac?  the documentation says it can be done, but i'm not sure of
 the correct switch setting to use out of the given non-appletalk switch
 options.  also, will i need to install a new driver so that the chooser knows
 the printer is hooked up directly (not networked)?
 
 thanks a lot,
 ross
