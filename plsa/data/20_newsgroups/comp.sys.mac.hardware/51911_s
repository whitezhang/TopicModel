 the logitech scanman 32 is a nice unit, compact and effective it will
 bring in graphics with surprisingly good quality. note that its effective
 resolution in grey scale mode is only about 72 dpi. if you don't intend
 to magnify a graphic, it works fine. a true 256 level gray scanner would
 work better for images.
 
 i've seen the scanman go for as little as $100 used. it is a reasonable buy
 at that price. higher end hand scanners are almost as expensive as used
 flat bed scanners. here is seattle, the paper shows occasional good bargains
 in the classifieds. used color flat beds have been seen as lows as $500 lately.
 grey scale flatbeds come in around $300-$350.
