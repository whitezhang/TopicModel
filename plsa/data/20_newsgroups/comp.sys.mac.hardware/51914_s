 hi there,
 
 when i run disk first aid on my external hard drive (quantum lps 240) i get the followinf
 message: error -535: missing thread record (tarid=31015; tarblock 416)
 disk first aid is not able to fix this problem, norton utils doesn't find it at all.
 when i use norton disk editor to look at tarblock 416 i can read something like "dirreservedarea"
 
 my question: how can i get rid of this error (without reformatting of course)
