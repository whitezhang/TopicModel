 anyone have a price quote/vendor for the vx to centris 650 upgrade?
 i've been quoted a price of $2401 till august 15th after which it will
 cost $2732.  this of course doesn't include the trade-in rebate of
 $1300 for the vx board.  thus for $1101 one gets a centris 650, 8 meg
 onboard with both the fpu and ethernet.  anyone else have any info?
 this price is from the university of illinois micro-order center, are
 there any other vendors who offer similar prices?
