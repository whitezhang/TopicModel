 since the demise of the outbound company, what options would exist for me 
 if i were to buy one of their laptops? 
 
 (1) since the outbounds (2030, 2030e, etc) use mac plus roms, won't that 
 severly limit using future applications?
 
 (2) what is a reasonable price for one of their laptops? the prices i've 
 seen seem extremely high considering the limited choices now.
 
 (3) how reliable have they proven?
 
 any answers would be helpful.
