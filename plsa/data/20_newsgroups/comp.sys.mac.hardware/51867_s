 jeff,
   i have answers to both of your questions.  first, i recommend the sony
 cpd-1320 monitor.  it is a 14" trinitron vga monitor, but it is designed
 specifically for use with the lc.  it works only with macs with specific video
 capabilities which means only the lc's and anything after the ci.  all it
 takes is a mac<->vga cable (i recommend one from james engineering which is
 about $20).  these cost about $335 as compared to the much higher prices of
 comparable monitors because they are not multisynch.  i have used one for half
 a year and i love it.  
 second, i have used syex and found them to be decent.  i had a backorder on a
 supra modem which i cancelled.  they were helpful in explaining the reasons
 why there were delays and they had supra's number ready for me.  the only
 complaint was that they did not always return my calls.  
 i have been told that the cpd-1320 is selling for $339 from j&r's
 (800)221-8180.  i think syex is a little more, but i don't know.
