 	i have an ethernet card that i took out off an old lc. the card
 	is manufactured by asante. on it i can read:
 	"asante tech, inc. copyright 1991. maccon + lc rev.b".
 	the card has an fpu socket on it. it provides thin ethernet connector
 	and there's another connector on it which resembels to phone connectors.
 
 	my questions are:
 	- will this card work on any other model than lc-serie ?, given that
 	it's a pds card, will it work with the iisi pds slot ?. i think there
 	may be a probleme because the lc has 16 bit wide slots.
 
 	- what's that other conncetor on the card ?.
 
 	_ is anyone interested in it ?. i can ship it to any cee country.
