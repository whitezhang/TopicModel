 ok i want to get a color mac i don't care if it is an lc or a mac ii or
 what but i want to go to a color machine.  i'd prefer to trade my
 present mac se system plus some cash or other equipment for the color
 system as right now i'm not full of the $$$ to buy a color system
 outright.
 here's what my mac se system has...
 
 mac se 4/20 with internal 800k drive
 20 meg external
 external 800k drive
 imagewriter ii with 4 color ribbon
 
 stuff that can go with it......
 i've got 3 modems and i'd be willing to give 1 of the 9600's and the
 2400 with the system
 
 multitech multimodem ii (9600 data/fax)
 u.s. robotics sportster (9600 data)
 microcom qx/12k         (normally will connect at only 2400 as highest
 but it will do faster if connected to another microcom)
 
 the usr and the multitech are both brand-new
 
 if interested send me e-mail at dleonard@wixer.bga.com
