 well, i don't exaclty know what _should_ be done, but what i do is
 keep my cpu on and turn my monitor off when not in use.  i do this as
 much for easing power consumption as anything though.  turning off the
 monitor when not in use has the advantage of requiring less ram than
 a screen saver (but it requires more of my memory to remember to turn
 it off... pretty easy to remember to turn it on though :-)
