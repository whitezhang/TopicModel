 i guess he is right. early versions of the rasterops cards did not either,
 but they fixed it, and people with problems can get a free rom upgrade
 from rasterops.

 very easy. if you boot without the mode32 control panel, then it will
 disable (or rather not reinstall) the 32-bit clean patches. so when
 you run ok you must be in 24-bit adressing mode. check about this macintosh
 and see if you havce a 12+mb system.
