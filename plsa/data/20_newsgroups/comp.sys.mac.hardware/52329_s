 here's the story:
 
 (1)  the iisi *cannot* supply a vga output.  however...
 
 (2) some vga-type monitors can adequately deal with the video signal
 the mac uses to drive the apple 13 or 14 inch "high resolution color
 display"---i.e., apple's own 640x480 mode.
 
 so, if you wish to hook one of these monitors up to your iisi, you
 need (a) an adapter that converts from the mac db-15 connector to the
 vga-style high density db-15 connector, *but* tells the mac to use
 it's own 640x480 mode, not the vga 640x480 mode, and (b) a vga monitor
 that can deal with the higher bandwidth of the mac 640x480 mode over
 the vga 640x480 mode (which as i stated in (1) above, the iisi cannot
 produce).
 
 as far as (a) above is concerned, contact

 they can probably get you the right adapter.  remember: you do *not*
 want the run-of-the-mill mac-to-vga adapter, because it will try to
 have your iisi produce the vga mode, which it cannot (the computer
 will just fail to produce any video signal at all).  instead, you want
 an adapter that connects between the mac-style and vga-style
 connectors, but tells the mac to use the apple 640x480 mode.  sorry
 for the poor terminology available for describing this distinction.
 
 as far as (b) is concerned, make sure to get a monitor that can deal
 with a horizontal bandwidth of 35 khz and a vertical retrace rate of
 67 hz.  these are the spec's of apple's 640x480 mode.  for comparison,
 the vga-standard 640x480 mode uses a 31.5 khz horizontal bandwidth and
 a 60 hz. vertical retrace rate.
 
 the monitor will probably need to have auto-synch'ing capability, as
 the apple mode you'll be using isn't one of the set of standard modes
 in the pc compatible world.
 
 good luck!
