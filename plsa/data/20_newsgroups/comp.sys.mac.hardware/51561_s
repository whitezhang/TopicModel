 it clearly depends on the type of questions you are asking but in many
 cases it will do fine. the critical information from the neuron is in
 the firing frequency (maximum about 100 action potentials per
 seconds), and not in the amplitude of the signal or in details of the
 signal shape. so the resolution of about 0.4 % you get with an 8 bit
 convertor is more then sufficient.
 
 ac coupling does not have to be a problem either, since in many cases
 you are not interested in the dc level. my pre amplifier is ac coupled
 also. the critical point is the lowest frequency that will pass. if
 the cutoff point is to high, the action potentials will be slightly
 distorted. but even that normally does not matter since it is the
 occurrence of the spike that is important. 
 
 however, i do want to know what exactly i can expect before i start
 battling with the toolbox to get it going. as yet i have no clue were
 to start looking for the technical specifications.
