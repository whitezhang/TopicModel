 
 hi there!
 
 i wonder if anyone knows and can recommend me a good nubus display
 card for driving a 14" multisync (nec 3d)?
 the nec 3d can do horizontal refresh from 15.5 khz to 38 khz and
 vertical from 50 hz to 90 hz and can do max 1024x768 interlaced,
 though i am looking for something more like 800x600 or 832x624
 noninterlaced.
 it would be very nice to find a card which can be programmed quite
 freely within these limits and is capable to display at least
 8bits/pixel, preferably more.
 
 is there anything on the market that comes even close?
 
 
 thanks
