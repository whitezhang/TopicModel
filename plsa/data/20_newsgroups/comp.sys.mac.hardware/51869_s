 the real question here in my opinion is what motorola processors running system
 7 on a mac are comparable to what intel processors running windows on a pc?  i
 recall there being a conversation here that a 486/25 running windows benchmarks
 at about the same speed as 25mhz 030 in system 7.  i don't know if that is
 true, but i would love to hear if anyone has any technical data on this.
