 this poll was conducted to help users decide whether or not to alter their
 iisi clock oscillator. i have attempted to gather as many case histories as
 possible to find some estimate of success and risk. the number of replies
 probably shows how rare this modification is but give the impression that
 success rates may be higher than the previous 80% estimate. 24 of 24
 machines were able to run at 25 mhz when no add on boards were present.
 this is not a scientific survey but it is the best we have to work with.
 
 thanks to all who contributed to this poll. 
 
 
 issues:
 
 	speed) 25 mhz to 27.5 mhz appears to be the norm for machines without
 		add on cards. all reported machines were able to use
 		25 mhz as long as no add on cards were present. several apple
 		nubus cards were in use. no machine with the nubus adapter
 		was able to go faster than 25 mhz. one wasn't even able to
 		achieve 25 mhz with the nubus adapter in place
 	
 		at speeds of 32 and 33 mhz, the startup sound is distorted and
 		hi density floppy disk problems have been reported.
 		
 		note: unless specifically listed below, machines were not
 			tested with a higher speed clock to failure. hence,
 			the 25 mhz operational machines may well work at
 			higher speeds.
 			
 	damage) one user reported pulling out the plating of one pad. this was
 		repaired and the machine is operational. one other
 		reported pulling the pin out of the original clock oscillator
 		during desoldering. there is one second hand report of a user
 		putting a gash in the motherboard with a slipped soldering iron.
 		
 		no reports of static discharge damage.
 		
 		no reports of high speed operation causing damage.
 		
 		then again, i also don't have any reports from users of
 		defective parachutes.
 		
 	add on boards) compatibility appears to be a problem with apple nubus
 		adapters. several other add on boards have been used with
 		success. see case histories
 		
 	heat sinks) virtually all modified machines had a heat sink installed.
 		these were often the to-220 style power transistor type. some
 		used epoxy. some used a dab of heat sink compound with a dab
 		of cyanoacrylate glue. there was also use of a clamp with a
 		bolt through the hole in the motherboard.
 		
 		
 		
 case histories:	
 
 all speeds are the effective cpu speed (1/2 of clock oscillator). all reported
 cpu versions were 20 mhz.
 
 1)  27.5 mhz operational. ran for 10 minutes at 31 mhz before crashing.
     no fpu or other add on card
     heatsinked cpu only
     on 24 hours/day
     no damage during installation
    
 2)  27.5 mhz operational without apple nubus adapter. 25 mhz top speed with
 	apple nubus card installed
     heatsinked cpu only
     on 24 hours/day
     no floppy problems
     no damage during installation
    
 3)  27.5 mhz operational. unable to boot at 31 mhz
     heatsinked cpu only
     no floppy problems
     no damage during installation
    
 4)  25 mhz operational
     works with the following two configurations
 	
 	  	a)	realtech fpu adaptor card
 			realtech cache card
 			supermac 8*24 pdqsi
 		
 		b)  	supermac fpu adaptor card
 			supermac video spigot
 			supermac 8*24 pdqsi
 			
 5)	33 mhz operational
 		fuzzy startup sound
 		problems with hi density disks
 
 6)	33 mhz operational
 		fuzzy startup sound
 	heat sink on cpu and chip to right of cpu
 	
 7)	25 mhz operational. occasional crash at 33 mhz
 
 8)	25 mhz operational.
 	using fpu rated at 16 mhz without difficulty
 	
 9)	25 mhz operational.
 	pds adapter with a spectrum 24pdqsi graphics card and a 
 	videospigot, a 20mhz fpu
 	heat sink on cpu
 	
 10)	25 mhz operational. 33 mhz failed after several hours.
 
 11)	25 mhz operational
 	 5/80+quicksilver/fpu(only upgrade)
 	 
 12)	25 mhz operational. tried 33 mhz - system won't start. 
  	heat sink on cpu
 	configured with
 		realtech fpu/adapter card
 		supermac 8*24 pdqsi
 		realtech cache.
 	cpu on continuously - no problems.
  	floppy works fine at 1.4mb @ 25 mhz

 19) 20 mhz operational. bombed soon after startup at 25 mhz with nubus adapter
 	20 mhz rated cpu
 	ram 70 ns in slots, 80 on motherboard
 	
 20) 25 mhz operational
 	heat sink added to cpu later. no damage while unheatsinked.
 	apple nubus adapter with fpu installed.
