 
 sorry if this is a faq.  i don't normally read comp.sys.mac.hardware.
 i am purchasing a couple of centris 650's.  i configured the systems
 as follows:
 
 	eight (8) mb ram
 	ethernet
 	1 mb vram
 	math coprocessor option
 
 my purchasing agent told me about the math coprocessor option and sent
 me the apple summary documentation to prove it.  i ordered the coprocessor
 option, but i'm really not sure that we needed it.  i thought the '040 chip
 had a math coprocessor built into it.  has apple had a math coprocessor chip
 architectured to keep up with the speed of the '040 chip in the centris 650?
 i am concerned that i may have set up a hardware bottleneck.  please send your
 responses to:  david_anthony_guevara@cup.portal.com.  i will summarize if there
 is enough interest.  thanks!
