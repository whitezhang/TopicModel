 i'm a system and network admin. one of my users has a duo 230
 ([*]specifications below) that has been having slowdown problems.
 leaving the duo on for several hours causes it to slow down
 unacceptably. it can take 10-15 seconds to change applications. during
 this time it is completely hung.  if he reboots, the problem goes away
 (for a while). it seems the system is getting itself into a wedged
 configuration.
 
 he's re-installed system 7.1 and rebuilt the desktop. neither of these
 have helped. 
 
 it's possible that it's network-related, he uses eudora which checks his
 email every 10 minutes (over ethernet). he hasn't checked to see if this
 problem occurs while undocked (he's docked most of the time). 
 
 little to no non-apple inits, i don't want to start yanking the rest
 unless i know that might *really* be the problem. 
 
 he hasn't tried zapping the pram, i have advised him to do that next.
 
 anyone who has ideas, i'd love to hear about them. i'd call apple, but
 i've found they're best to call during the week (it's sunday evening).
 
 
 [*] powerbook duo 230  16/120. 12mb ram card from tech works to replace
 non-self-refreshing 8mb card. is using system enabler 1.0.1. express
 modem (including latest software). has been to apple dealer for keyboard
 replacement.
