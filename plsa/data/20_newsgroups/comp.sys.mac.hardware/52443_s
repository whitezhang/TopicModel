 sounds to me like your dealer really wants to get rid of the iivx's he has in
 stock.  i can imaging that they are getting hard to sell, given that 
  1. a c610 is way faster, and is comparable in price.
  2. an lciii is about the same speed, and is way cheaper.
 so your dealer may well be trying as hard as he can to convince people
 that iivx's are a much better buy than a c610 just so he can get rid of all
 his old stock!
 
 no disrespect to dealers or the iivx intended!
