 the sound driver is pretty ok, since it's fast. sound manager used by the
 book is *useless*. disposing of sound channels as soon as sound has completed
 is out of the question for games with smooth animation. (it's too slow.)
 
 the sound driver is so much snappier than sound manager. unfortunately,
 system 7 supports it poorly, making programs crash occasionally.

 well, i want my code to work on old systems too. i don't know about sys 7.1,
 but at least on 6.0.7, there are bugs in the sound manager that causes
 channels to hang (with no error message). this happends when i keep a
 channel open for long periods - necessary for performance - and play many
 sounds, stopping sounds halfway. callbacks seems not to be reliable.
 then only way i can safely tell if a sound has stopped playing is to
 inspect private variables in the channel (qhead, i think it was), and the
 only way i have found to tell if a channel is hung is to inspect an
 *undocumented* flag and modify it.
 
 am i happy with this? nope. i consider writing to soundbase simply to get
 rid of the bugs.
 
 any better suggestions? (silent games is not among the acceptab|e solutions.)
