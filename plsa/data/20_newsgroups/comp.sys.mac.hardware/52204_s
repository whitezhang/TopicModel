 don't be silly.
 
 using the sound manager on a quadra is very well, but using sm on
 any of the low-end machines doesn't simply work for a decent action
 game since it just steals too much time from the cpu. this is
 a fact. by writing directly to the hardware on an se, it is
 possible to have 4 simultaneous channels of sampled sound (11khz) for
 a cost of approx. 8000 cycles. exactly how would you do that using
 the sm, pray tell?
 
 the correct thing to do is to use the sm on the machines that can
 carry that extra load using the sm means, and to write directly
 to the sound hardware on the machines that can't. it's not the
 politically correct thing, but from the developers' point of
 view it is.
