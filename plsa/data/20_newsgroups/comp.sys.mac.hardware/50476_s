 
    i have to increase the memory in a plus or se (i'm not sure which since
 i haven't seen it yet). i did this a few years ago but i no longer have the
 instructions. i forget which resistor needs to be cut to go from 1 to 4 mbs.
  
    can anyone direct me to this information? is there an ftp'able doc some-
 where with diagrams?
                           thanks, dick grant
