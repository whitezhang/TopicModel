 we were told that the resolution on the 5fge could only go to 1024x768.
 
 and that the 5 fg could go to 1152x870.
 
 has anybody tried running these higher resolutions??
 
 somewhere i thought i read that the 1152x870 on a 17" monitor may make the
 type too small to read.
 
 any help would be appreciated.
 steve
