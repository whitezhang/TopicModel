     not without replacing most of the chips on the motherboard. the c610
 isn't like the iisi was, meaning that the motherboard of the c610 is 
 actually designeds to run at the speed of the cpu, and not designed to
 run at a higher speed (like 25mhz) but be forced to run at the speed of
 a slower cpu (20mhz).

     there is more than one oscillator. if you are talking about the cpu
 oscillator chip, i think that it is located under the socket for the
 '040. at least this is what i have read in some other posts in this
 group.
