 hmm, i don't know where this information concerning the cable and the
 warranty came from but i ordered mine from logos communications, near
 cleveland, and inside was a mac cable (with the correct pin connections :-))
 and a lifetime warranty.  the whole package was assembled at at&t paradyne,
 and every piece (the serial cable, the telephone cable, etc.) had at&t 
 part numbers on them, except the quicklink software package and the 
 compuserve intro kit.

 if anyone's interested, logos number is (800) 837-7777.  i ordered mine
 last wednesday and got my modem on friday, though it's not to far from
 cleveland to pittsburgh.. :-)  on the down side they only ship ups cod.
