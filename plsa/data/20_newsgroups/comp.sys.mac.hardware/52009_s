 	i've been getting seemingly random disk accesses on my centris 610
 with a quantum 240 lps, but this is not the regular recalibration it has been
 doing since i got it....  this is sometimes short, sometimes long, accesses
 that sound like there is some read/writing going on.
 	i have sam 3.5, and disinfectant 3.0, but neither picks up anything..
 any ideas?
