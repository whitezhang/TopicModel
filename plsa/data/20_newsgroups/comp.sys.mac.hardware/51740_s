 to boorishly reply to myself, i found i did have the instrutech information
 already. the specs (to use the term loosely) are as follows:
 
 a/d: 16 bit converter, with 14 bit accuracy to 100 khz, 12 bit accuracy to
 200 khz. no specs for s/n, monotonicity, linearity. there are 8 multiplexed
 inputs sharing the single a/d, so that all inputs are not samples at the
 same time, and in the above conversion specs the all-channel sample rate
 must be used. thus, for two channels, you only have 14 unknown quality bits
 at 50 khz per channel. this is poorer quality than the national
 instruments, at the same sample rate.
 
 d/a: 16 bit converter. no specs for s/n, monotonicity, linearity. each of
 the 4 output channels has its own converter.
 
 the price for the external converter box (the itc-16), the nubus interface
 board (the mac-23), plus c driver software and igor xop's is $2695. rather
 steep.
