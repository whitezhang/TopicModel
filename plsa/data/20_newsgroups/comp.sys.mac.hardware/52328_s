 i've had my c610 for about six weeks now with no problems whatsoever.
 it's been "customized" with---
 
  * replaced the apple-quantum 80 drive with a connor 212 drive.  
 
  * installed a tandberg scsi tape drive in the internal bay which works
    just fine (though apple doesn't seem to be supplying front panel
    bezels w/ a standard 5.25" cutout...).  
 
 it's hooked up to an apple laserwriter plus and has no printing
 problems at all, tested printing complex photoshop graphics.
 
 it has expanded vram and extra 8 meg simm, no problems.
 
 so in sum, i have no idea what this dealer is complaining about.
