 what would be a good platform for some fairly basic video work of the
 following nature:
 
 reading real video in for playbak in various app's 5-10 minnutes in length
 basic editing features for said video - rearange sequences, adding grapic
 slides from something like power point etc... 
 
 i'm not to familiar with this stuff but would like a good system with crisp
 performance.  it's for educational/promotional things so the video quality
 should be decent.
 
 i'm thinking tempest or cyclone, big drive,loads o ram, floptical or 128mb
 optical ?? - however, i'm not to sure of the various cards and software
 thats out there.
 
 please email any responses,
 
 thanks
