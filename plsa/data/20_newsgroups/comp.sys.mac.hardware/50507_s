 has anyone had any problems with their duo dock not ejecting the duo
 properly?
 
 when i first got it, the duo would come out of the dock a couple of inches
 when ejected, and i had to pull it the rest of the way. nowadays (and i've
 had the system for 4 months), the duo doesn't come out *at* *all* - despite
 the fact that the mechanism makes all the appropriate noises, and i have to
 grab hold of it and pull it out myself. is there a simple fix for this, or
 do i have to return it to my apple dealer, where it will languish for weeks
 while i have to make do with no colour display, no vram, no floppy or
 scsi etc. 
 
 (btw, it's not that the duo is locked into the dock - it just doesn't
 want to slide out any more).
