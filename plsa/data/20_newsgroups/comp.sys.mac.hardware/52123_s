 i read in macweek that some developers are getting nubus cards from apple
 with pre-release powerpc chips on them.  does this mean that when the
 chip is released, those of us with old apples will be able to take
 advantage of the powerpc risc technology just by inserting a card?
 
 i don't know anything about hardware, so can someone tell me how much of
 a cludge this would be?
