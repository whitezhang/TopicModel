 
 i have an external hard drive i wish to use as startup disk.
 problem is, when i switch on the mac, it boots on the internal hd,
 but when i restart  (warm boot) the mac, it boots from the external.
 how do i make  it boot directly from the external ?
 
 please email replies if possible.
 
 thanks in advance.
 
 jerry
