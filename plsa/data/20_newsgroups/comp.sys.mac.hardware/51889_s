 
 interestingly enough, the cdrom 300i that came with my quadra 800 has 
 only 8 disks:
 
 1. system install
 2. kodak photo cd sampler
 3. alice to ocean
 4. cdrom titles
 5. application demos
 6. mozart: dissonant quartet
 7. nautilus
 8. apple chronicles
 
 has anyone else noticed that they got less than everyone seems to be
 getting with the external?  what i really feel i missed out on is what
 is supposed to a fantastic games demo disk.
 
 i have heard that people have gotten up to 9-10 disks with their drive.
 i assume they get the 8 titles above plus cinderella and the games demo cdrom.
 
 any comments and experiences?  should i call apple to complain? =)
