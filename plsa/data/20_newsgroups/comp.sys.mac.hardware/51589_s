 with a little luck, i could own a c650 sometime in the near future, and
 so i was just wondering if someone could clear these two questions up for me:
 
 1.  what speed simms does the c650 need/want?  (i know that it needs 80ns
 vram...not sure for the main ram.)
 
 2.  i've heard two conflicting stories about the total expandibility of the
 c650's ram...132 and 136 megs.  which is true?  (perhaps another phrasing
 would be better:  does the 8 meg version come with all 8 megs on the logic
 board, or 4 megs + a 4 meg simm?)
 
 just wondering....
