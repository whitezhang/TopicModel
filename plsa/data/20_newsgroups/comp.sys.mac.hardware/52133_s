 i have also moved on to a 66.6 mhz clock. thus far not problems. i'm not totallysurprised as i've had q700 run at 35.4 mhz (cpu clock speed) using a vso. my
 25 mhz rated daystar quadracache got very hot at 32 mhz and would fail previously. i glued on a piece of aluminum stock to the hi speed ram chips and it runs
 cool without problems at 33.3 mhz. the combination is faster than a q950.
