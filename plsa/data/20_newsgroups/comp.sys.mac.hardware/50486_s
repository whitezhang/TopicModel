     you must not have tried very hard. i just opend mine in about 2
 seconds. take a look on the bottom, it has a dial that turns to open
 much like the older adb mouses used to have. it's a bit harder to turn
 at first but it is quite simple to open.

     well, if you don't match up the pins correctly you will have some
 problems. a close look at the socket should give you an idea of the
 proper orientation of the chip.
