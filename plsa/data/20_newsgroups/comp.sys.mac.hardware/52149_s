 i have a nice vxc moniterm 19 in b/w monitor, formerly used on an atari st.
 i think such monitors are / have been used on macs.
 can someone tell me what mac can use it, what card i should get to use it, etc..
 this monitor also has a label on the front saying viking 2/90, and has a db9
 connector.
