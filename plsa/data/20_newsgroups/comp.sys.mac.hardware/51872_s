 the subject says what i would like to do, here are the details:
 
 i have a 512ke with the macrescue upgrade board that makes it the
 equivalent of a plus (system 7 and macenvy both identify it as such).
 
 the macrescue board clips onto the 68000 on the mb.  it also has
 a 68000 itself.  periodically i have to remove the clip (not an
 entirely easy thing to do) and clean the "legs" of the 68000.
 larry pina's book asserts that this is occasionally a problem with
 snap on upgrades:  the 68000's "legs" will oxidize, causing 
 unusual system errors.
 
 well, that's me.
 
 so, i would like to do something permanent, and i think it would be
 fairly easy to put a socket in where the 68000 currently is, and
 modify the macrescue board to plug in.  what i'm not 100% sure of
 is whether it will work.  it seems to me that the two 68000s aren't
 acting independently; so removing one shouldn't have any effect on
 the performance of my mac.  i'm about 97% sure.
 
 will someone provide the extra 3%?
