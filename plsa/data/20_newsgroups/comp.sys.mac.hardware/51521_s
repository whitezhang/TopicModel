 i recently purchased a centris 610 and am having difficulty getting
 my computer to recognize my hard disk drive (external) using both the
 disk uitily of tms (diskwriter) and jasmine's software, neither one
 will show the drive.  the drive is the only device connected to the 
 scuzzi port. i cant find the manual to the tms pro 120 and seem to
 remember that it is "terminated".  is there something else that i am
 doing (or not doing) that does not allow my 610 to recognize my external
 disk drive?.
 
 thanks in advance for the information.
