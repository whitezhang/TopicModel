 can some people with cache cards please post speedometer numbers they get
 with the cards. i have only one report, which seems to indicate that
 a 32k cache card gives you only about a 1% speedup!! access to memory takes
 longer when you have a cache card(and get a miss) thus a small cache card
 of 32k may be worth $0. i don't know what kind of numbers 64k cards get
 you. also i found it interesting that you can disable the cache cards
 via software(read about it in the mac iisi tech notes from ftp.apple.com)
 
 so is $99 a good deal or not, i still don't know.
