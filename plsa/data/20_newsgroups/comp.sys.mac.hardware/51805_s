 all i know is that the megadrives worked perfectly on both my
 mac plus and my powerbook 140.  it was for this reason i assumed
 the problem had something to do with the quadra.  even with the
 quadra, they mostly worked ok.  the problem occurred when i ejected
 a cartridge from a drive: it would start popping up dialog boxes
 saying "this cartridge must be formatted with jasmine driveware"
 even though there was no cartridge in the drive.
