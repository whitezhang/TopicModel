 sorry about the misinformation.  i made a bad assumption about
 the new machines behaving like a quadra 900, see previous
 post.  about sampling the cd audio though, have you tried it?  i 
 found the aliasing to be really bad.  like it needed a filter or something.
 much worse than i expected.  i installed the cd-300 in the 
 quadra myself so maybe i missed something.  everything else
 works great though.
