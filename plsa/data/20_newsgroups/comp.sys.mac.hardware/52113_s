 but it is to risky to run it to fast. most of your quadras 700 should work at 33 mhz without any problems. 
 
 but a safety tip do a backup from your harddisk befor you start to upgrade. during my 35 mhz test i damaged my harddisk and had a hardtime to get it working again. so once again do a backup befor you start!!!!!!!!!
 
 now the speedometer results after replacing the osz.

 very interesting are the graphics results (graphics 30.052) couldn't belief this, but it is true. two points which my cause problems are the 4 mbyte ram solder on the board. the are only 80ns rams and run at the upperlimit with 33 mhz. the next part which may cause trouble are the video rams. i have the orignal 100ns vrams from apple in my quadra, here you are also at the upperlimit where most of the chips running but it isn't garantied to run. most of the other parts on the quadra board running on there o
 
 
 
 
 wn clockspeed so they wont make truble.
 
 the most importaned question is do i neat a new heat sink. i would say no. after running my quadra for more than 14 hours the heat sink is really cool. a 33 mhz 486 with heat sink is mutch warmer than the 68040 in the quadra, so i didn't see any problems. the room temperatur was 22 celsius (72 f). if you living in a area were it is hot 100 f (45 c) and your room temperatur is not mutch below i would suggest a new heat sink with a ventilator to stay on the safe side.
 
 
 hope you will have the same success than i had,
