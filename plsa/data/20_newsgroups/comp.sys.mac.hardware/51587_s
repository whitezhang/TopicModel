 i just recently bought a 4 mb ram card for my original mac portable 
 (backlit) and have since had some bizarre crashes. it happens when i put 
 the machine to sleep and wake the machine up. sometimes it will just 
 freeze the cursor and lock the machine up forcing me to push the reset 
 switch. other times it will give me the usual bomb box with the error 
 message of "co processor not installed". 
 
 i know one solution is not to put the machine to sleep, but does anyone 
 have any ideas on what could be causing this or better yet what might fix 
 it? the memory card is psuedostatic ram and goes into the pds slot. that 
 probably figures into the problem. the manufacturer is king memory (not 
 kingston) from irvine, ca. they say the problem is in my machine. 
 
 any ideas? -- gene wright.
