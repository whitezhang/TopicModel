 not quite. 66mhz pentium - 65 specint92, 57 specfp92 .
 	   66mhz mc98601 - 50 specint92, 80 specfp92 .
 
 note that specint is more important for most real world applications.

 as far as the 486dx2-66 goes - 32 specint92, 16 specfp92 .

 intel chips have traditionally been faster than their motorola "equivalents"
 although the significance of chip speed in real world application performance
 is something that is highly debatable.
