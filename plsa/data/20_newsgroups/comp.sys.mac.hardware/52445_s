 	
 	i have a northern telecom disk array dated 1987 that has two 253mb drives
 units in it and i cannot get it formatted.  i set the scsi id on 1 and my
 software recognizes the unit, but i cannot mount it or anything - do i have
 to use both drives in the array? 
 
 	any help with these drives or possibly newer software than what i'm using
 (fwb hdt1.0 and 1.1) will be greatly appreciated!
