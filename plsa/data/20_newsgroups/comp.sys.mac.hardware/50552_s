 
   i've got a racet 5.25" mo drive with a ricoh ro-5030e mechanism with the
 new roms... the thing is, i have a new tosoh optical disk 512/bytes per
 sector cart for the thing that refuses to mount or be formatted... all the
 carts that i have for the drive that work are racet certified media
 512k/sector carts... all i can think of is that this tosoh cart uses some
 kind of incompatible low level format... anyone know what software will
 allow this to be formatted on this drive? or a new dip setting for the
 mechanism? i've tried just about every combination of drivers and custom
 formatting programs i can find with no luck... any ideas?
