 i doubt this is a quadra-specific problem.  i had to get
 rid of my "venerable" bernoulli 20 last year (with enough 
 cartridges purchased at ~$90 each to make the whole thing 
 worth more than my whole computer ;).  the tech support guys
 at ocean microsystems suggested that some third-party drivers 
 might fix the problem - in my case the cartridges wouldn't 
 format/mount/partition for a/ux.
