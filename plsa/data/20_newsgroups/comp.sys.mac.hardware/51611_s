 i currently use an hp deskjet with grappler ls ver 1.0, 
 and it works on system7.  course, i only use the swa dutch
 and swa swiss fonts that came with it, due to the 4x size
 requirement to print to the hp. (ie: must have 40pnt definition
 to print a 10pnt font)  when i upgraded,  i talked to orange
 micro, and they state that ver 1.2 of grappler ls definitely
 works with system7.  however, the upgrade was us$40, so i
 passed.
 
 hope this helps?
