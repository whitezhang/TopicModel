 i too have been watching the iisi speedup reports and plan to upgrade in
 the next few weeks.  the plan i have is to build a small board with a few
 different crystals on it and to be able to switch between the different
 speeds using a front pannel switch.  this way i can get the speed when
 i want but i can also run at slower (stock) speeds it i experience any
 compatability problems with any applications.  i don't expect to be able
 to switch clock speeds with the system running, but if i can switch
 without any lock-up problems, then i could switch to 33mhz when needed
 and put it back to idle (20 mhz) when not needeed.  this would further
 reduce the wear-and-tear on the cpu even with a heat sink.  of course
 i would not want to run the different clock signals through the switch
 but use a chip or two on the board to select the frequency desired and
 route it directly to the mother board.
 
 i haven't started probing around inside my si yet.  does anyone know the
 voltage level to power the crystal oscilators?  
 
 thanks.
