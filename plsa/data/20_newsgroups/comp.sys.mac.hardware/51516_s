 it would depend on the requirements of the poster's data, for some
 purposes 1/256 resolution (with or without calibration curve).
 
 
 otherwise the other possibilities would be:
 
 1) get a digital voltameter with serial output & connect to serial
 port on mac, collect data with some communications program.
 
 2) buy an a/d chip from analog devices, burr-brown, etc, connect to
 a parallel to serial converter, use serial port for acquisition
 (nah. too much soldering and trouble shooting :-)
 
 3) get a board from national instruments, data translation, omega,
 etal.  the finest solution, but possibly the most costly.
 
 
 
 to the original poster:  if the signal is too large, why not
 use a voltage divider? two resistors, cost very cheap...
