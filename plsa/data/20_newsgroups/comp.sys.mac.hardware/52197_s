 there are two approaches:
 
 1. if your power cord is the kind that detaches from the back of the
 monitor (most common) you can get a *replacement* power cord that will go
 from the monitor to the back of the computer.
 
 2. you can get an adpater that connects to the plug end of the existing
 power cord and provides the proper end that plugs into the back of the
 computer.
 
 both cost about the same (aprox. $5) and are available from many computer
 stores (clone dealers are usually better at having these things and at
 good prices). power cords are standard, so you don't have to go looking
 for some special thing at a mac store.
