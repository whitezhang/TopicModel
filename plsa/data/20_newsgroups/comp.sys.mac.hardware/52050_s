 anyone happen to know what the max resolution for quicktime is?  i'm 
 trying to determine if a maxed out system using quicktime could produce
 and edit broadcast quality video (including bringing the video in via
 video spigot/etc.).  so far i have yet to see anything that's even close
 to s-vhs in quicktime, but it'd be great to hear that it's possible.
 
 thanks for the help,
 alex bratton
