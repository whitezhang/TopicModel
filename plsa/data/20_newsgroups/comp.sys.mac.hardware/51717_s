 i  have one of the original powerbook 170's (with 4mb of ram) and find
 that 4mb is a drag when trying to do my work.  so, what is the best way
 to get the maximum ram for this unit, and what's it going to cost me?
 i'm hoping i can get the latest and best info from real users by posting 
 to this group.
 
 thanks in advance,
