 i'm considering adding a floptical drive to my current system.
 
 what i would like to know is which floptical drives are recommended for
 their quality and performance.
 
 my preference would be floptical drives capable of handling both 800k and
 1.4k floppies, but handling 800k floppies is not a necessity.
 
 so far, i only know a bit about the iomega floptical and the infinity
 floptical drives.  are there any comments/recommendations for either of these?
 
 are there any other floptical drives that are worth looking into and where
 can they be purchased (i.e. which mail order places, etc).
 
 thanks in advance.
 
 please send replies directly to umsoroko@ccu.umanitoba.ca
