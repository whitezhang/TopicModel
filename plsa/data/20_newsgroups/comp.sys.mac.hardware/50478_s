 so far i have only seen pictures of the new ergonomic keyboard,
 but it seems that the 'b' is placed on the left part after the split.
 however, when i learned typing in school some years ago, i was taught
 to write 'b' with my right hand. is this a difference between danish
 and american typing, or what???
 
 thanks a lot in advance!
