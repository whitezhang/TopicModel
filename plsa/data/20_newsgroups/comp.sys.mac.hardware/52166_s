 hi everyone,
       i'm experiencing a very annoying problem with background printing
 on the hp deskwriter (sys 7.1, deskwriter driver 3.1, powerbook 170).
 when i print from, say, ms word, i see the message "spooling to disk,"
 but sometimes nothing prints. checking my memory map thanks to now menus,
 i see that hp backgrounder has not loaded. restarting fixes this. it
 seems to me that hp backgrounder is quitting unexpectedly, and that its
 status as "multifinder not aware" allows it to do this without my being
 informed by a message such as "hp backgrounder quit unexpectedly." have
 you ever seen this problem before.
         there may or may not be a related problem. i have experienced
 problems in putting my computer to sleep. choosing "sleep" from the
 finder menu sometimes does nothing. today on a whim i checked the memory
 map, and i discovered that hp backgrounder was not loaded. restarted
 reloaded hp backgrounder, and i was able to put my machine to sleep as
 usual. just a mere coincidence or is the hp backgrounder crash preventing
 my machine from going to sleep?
 	has anyone seen this problem? i'm seriously considering the purchase of
 a stylewriterii because of the poor quality of the hp software. 
 
 	please send your answers directly to me and post to the net.
 	yours truly,
 	marc bizer
