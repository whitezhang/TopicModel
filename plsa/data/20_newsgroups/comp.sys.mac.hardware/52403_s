 i have a few questions that i would like answers to 
 (or opinions on) since i'm thinking about buying a lc-iii:
 
 q1) when the powerpc-based macs are announced, what will
 happen to the 680x0-based macs?  
 
 q2) is system 7 the 'last word' for 680x0-based macs? 
 will we ever get real multi-tasking for the mac?
 
 q3) will there be a way for nubus/pds-equipped macs to add 
 a powerpc-on-a-board to their systems?
 
 i'd hate to think that i'm going to put my $$ down
 on a machine that in 6 months is now part of a
 dead-end product line!
 
 thanks in advance,
