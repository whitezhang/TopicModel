 i think the other replies sum up the fact that you can place a hard drive
 on its side.  the point is this will only be sure to work on the 'new'
 drives, namely 1/3 ht lps drives that have a smaller platter and are also
 more stable.
 	why should i take the chance?  because i've been running a maxtor 1/3 ht
 120 lps on both its side and flat for about a year and i've had no
 problems with it.  period.
 	like i always say, never trust the manufacturer.
