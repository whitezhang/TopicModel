 
 hi,
 
 the subject line says it all.  my system acts weird at times.  all of a
 sudden the system will be corrupt, boot blocks will get chewed, etc.
 
 this was a really big problem for a while.  i couldn't even format my
 drive properly.  i installed hdt's driver and things got better.  now
 all i have to do is reinstall the system.  could an incompatibility 
 exist between it and a quantum external drive.
 
 i'm looking for a pure hardware solution.  it's not a virus, bad
 software, etc.  could i have a bad scsi cable?  or is the ibm (wds-80)
 just a screwey drive?
 
 thanks,
 
 chuck
