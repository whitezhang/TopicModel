 battery powered devices like the powerbook are sometimes more sensitive to 
 serial port weirdness.  i had trouble with connecting my mac plus to an hp 95lx
 handheld.  everything else worked okay on that port, but not the hp. (it runs
 on two penlite batteries).  it turned out that the plus (by accident or by 
 design flaw?) was putting a 4 volt bias on the serial port that was doing 
 weird things to the hp (which has only 3v dc!).  the hp worked fine when 
 connected to the printer port.  
 
 does your pb screen get dim or anything when connected to the device?  have you 
 tried using the printer port?
 
 good luck.
