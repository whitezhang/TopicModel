 there has been no empirical evidence to support the first statement.  true,
 there is a power surge at startup that has the potential to do damage, but
 the internal power supply is well-protected. (i've turned my mac on and off 
 six or seven times a day for three years without problem).  the monitor is
 the same.  to leave it on is to waste a lot of electricity -- twice as much
 as a television, possibly more.
 
 turn it off when you're not using it.  it'll save you money and the world
 a few more resources.
