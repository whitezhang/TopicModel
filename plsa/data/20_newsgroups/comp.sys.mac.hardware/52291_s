 i've been playing with a centris 610 (8/230) for the last couple weeks.  the only
 problem that i have seen is that a couple of the applications i run are
 incompatible with the 040's processor cache, so i have to run with it turned off.
 actually, the main thing i don't like it is that it doesn't have a software
 powerup/powerdown, and the power switch is directly under the floppy drive!  (i
 haven't hit it thinking it would eject the disk, but some tired night i'm going
 to be really upset with that design decision.....)
 
 in all, no problems with it. floppy and printing have been just fine.  (printing
 is done across a localtalk net, not a directly connected printer)
