 
 i have a lightening scan pro 256 hand scanner.  it came with scanning/editing
 software, ocr software, and some plug-in modules for photoshop et al.  the
 scanner was a tad on the pricey side ($480), but the scans are incredibly
 accurate, in 256 level, 300 dpi grayscale.  it also has dithered and line art
 settings when grayscale isn't desired.  great scanning software, easy to use.  i
 frequently write letters to my neices, and spontaneouly include a scanned image
 in the note.  hope this helps!
