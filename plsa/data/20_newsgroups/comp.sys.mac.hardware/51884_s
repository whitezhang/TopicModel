   yes, e-machines makes two mini-docks--the powerlink presente and the
 powerlink desknet. the presenter offers a variety of video-out options, 
 including ntsc, rgb and svga. it also has sound out, floppy drive port
 and a power port. unfortunately no scsi port and it blocks the serial port.
   the desknet has the standard ports plus built-in ethernet. alas, none of
 these have an fpu.
   in the future, rasterops is putting out a mini-dock, but the name escapes
 me now. it is supposed to support 16-bit color and "quadra" comparable
 video speed. no idea if it has an fpu.
   hope this helps...
