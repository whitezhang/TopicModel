 well, almost nubus 90 anyway, comprehensive bus contention between processors
 is not supported in the current macintoshes, could be wrong?
 
 however, i know for a fact from seeing the cyclone data spec sheets myself,
 don't ask, macintosh cyclone models will provide full implementation of the
 nubus standard.
 
 very interesting possibilities indeed!
