 we are having problems with our laserwriter print drivers going bad on
 various people's machines on our appletalk network.  on our network, people
 have 7.0, 7.01, and 7.1 versions of the laserwriter print driver.  we have
 been solving the problem by reinstalling the print driver, but it is
 time-consuming and a real pain.
 
 the printmonitor software also seems to go bad frequently.  we have also
 just been replacing it (over and over, it seems) to keep things running.
 
 does anyone out there have any ideas about what may be causing the printing
 software to go bad?  are there known init conflicts or network conflicts? 
 i would appreciate communication about any similar experiences you may have
 had or ideas you have.
 
 you could send me an email directly to: karens@edc.org....
 
 thanks....karen
