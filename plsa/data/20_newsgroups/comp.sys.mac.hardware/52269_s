 it's made by (surprise) national instruments:
 6504 bridge point parkway
 austin, tx 78730-5039
 (800) 433-3488
 anonymouse ftp at: ftp.natinst.com
 
 their 1991 catalog lists the nb-8g as follows:
 
 fetch and deposit dma controller (8 channels)
 ieee-488 interface with data rates up to 850 kb/sec, with dma and
 programmed i/o
    transfers
 8 16-bit counter timer channels
 rtsi bus (that's the connector on the top of the board - it links it with
    other national instrument boards
 list price of $1295
 
 the board isn't in later catalogs: it has been superceeded by the
 nb-dma2800.
