 my telephone line seems pretty stable and i have the supra as well.  works 
 great but with every passing day i fall behind on how many great 14.4s are 
 out.  zoom is out of the question from what i'm hearing.  at&t has a great 
 product from what i hear and the sportster is really cheap now too.
 
 if you want to receive a fax, your computer will have to be on, but not 
 the monitor and of course the modem.  you can set the number of rings that 
 will receive the fax on a specific ring you set with fax stf software.  
 it's entirely up to you how to arrange that.  i've had faxes sent to me 
 which is great but i've been home to set it.  i don't have a need to set 
 fax receiving up all day.  also i hear there is a device that can channel 
 all incoming phone signals for about $70.  rumor also that the phone 
 company can hook you up with the same gizmo for about $5 if that's what 
 you need.
 
 best of luck and write back if you'd like more feedback.
