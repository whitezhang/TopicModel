 in light of the 100 letter over "what was the lisa" i thought i'd start a
 new one.  what was the iivx?  i hear it was some machine that predated the
 main 040 line by about 6 mos, but used obsolete tech.  rumor has it that
 several were sold....
 
 
 <for those iivx owners whose panties are in a bunch now, this is just a joke.>
 <really, i'm just tired of the repetitive nature of this type of dialog>
 <plus, flaming is stress relief>
