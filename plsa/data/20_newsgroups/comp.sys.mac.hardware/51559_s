 no, he's not missing anything.  you're right that some models of the 650 ship in
 the usa without fpu or ethernet.  per ejeklint is also right -- *all*, i repeat,
 *all* centris 650's sold here in new zealand and, i assume, europe have the fpu
 and ethernet.
 
 i know.  i bought a 650 4/80 and it has both fpu and ethernet.
