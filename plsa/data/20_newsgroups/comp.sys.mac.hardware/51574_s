 i am seeking recommendations/vendors for a networkable fax. it would
 mainly be used for outgoing fax's from mac's on our net. the ability
 to fax from other platforms would be a plus. ethernet interface would
 be preffered but localtalk would suffice. can anyone provide any info?
 thanks in advance, --peter
