  
 i am running system 7.1 on a centris 610. i have not been able to setup my
 printer yet because when i open chooser, i get a blank screen. i do have all
 kinds of print drivers but none shows up. i even do not get a port iconn
 either. it is just one big blank screen.
 
 your help is very appreciated. 
 btw i did rebuild the desktop but that did not help either.
