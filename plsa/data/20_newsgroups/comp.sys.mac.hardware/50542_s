 
 hello all.
 	i am thinking about buying an external monitor for my se/30 and was
 wondering if anyone out in netland has any advice for me.
 	i am mostly thinking about a 14" color monitor and an 8 bit card that
 can switch between 640*480 and something higher (like 800*600).  i read an
 old report on a card from lapis that could do this, but could not use the
 external monitor as the main screen (with menubar) which to me is a major draw-
 back.  has this perhaps been fixed? or can any other cards do this (like the
 micron xceed) ?
 	also which monitor should i buy?  at the moment i am leaning towards
 the sony 1304, 1304s or 1320 (what exactly is the difference between these?)
 but are there any other good cheap monitors i should know about?  doesn't the
 monitor have to be multisync to support cards that can switch resolutions?
 
 please send me e-mail and i'll summarize.
 
 i would also greatly appreciate getting the e-mail addresses of any mail order
 companys that sell monitors or cards.
 
 thanks in advance
