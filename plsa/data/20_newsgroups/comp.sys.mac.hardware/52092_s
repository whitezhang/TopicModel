 i have a plp ii laser printer make by gcc technologies.  i have problem
 with a dirty first page.  the top portion of the first is always smeared
 with black toner across the page.  if i print more than one page at the 
 same time, the problem does not occur on other pages.  i cleaned the
 printer but still does not help.  can anyone offer any solutions?
 or know the phone # to gcc technologies?
 
 thanks in advance
