 i wish i caught the original post, but anyway ...
 
 
 the problem is that the plus's poor old power supply (sometimes referred to as
 the analog sweep board) is on its way out. apart from a board swap (bikkies to
 apple), there's not much the average joe can do to fix it.
 
 you can, of course, try and re-adjust the voltage levels (the 5v rail should
 be as close to 5v as you cn get it) but this is more often than not a
 temporary fix. a copy of larry pina's "macntosh repair & upgrade secrets" is a
 worthwhile investment for the serious do-it-yaself-er.
