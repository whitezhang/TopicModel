 
 several weeks ago, i described a problem with my apple high-resolution
 monitor and promised to summarize replies received by e-mail. to
 recapitulate: occasionally, every two or three hours or so, my monitor
 momentarily loses sync. the entire raster image bounces down about an
 eighth of an inch or so, then rights itself. this usually happens right
 after i close a large window, highlight a large area, or do something that
 radically alters the image on the screen. sometimes, though, it happens
 with no provocation whatsoever.
 
 i have received a bewildering range of replies. at one extreme was
 a man, clearly quite knowledgable about monitors, who said that the
 problem was that the 13" monitor's power supply simply couldn't always
 keep up with sudden changes of the raster image; the rapid change from
 a largely light screen to a largely dark one overtaxed the monitor's
 power supply. there was no fix available, he said, because nothing was
 really wrong. (i guess he meant that the flaw was so fundamental that
 it had to be endured.)
 
 this seemed quite persuasive and i would have been tempted to
 adopt an attitude of stoicism, except for a reply from a 13" monitor
 owner who discovered that this very problem is documented in the 
 apple service technical procedures, volume 3, under the heading
 jitter correction. the section describes a fix involving the replacement
 of a capacitor, the adjustment of a potentiometer, or, failing that,
 the swap of a circuit board.
 
 i would be grateful for a discussion among those who have had
 experience with this sort of thing.
