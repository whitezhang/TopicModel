 
 1.  why, or how actually, can a powerbook have a 640 x 400 pixel
     display, regardless if it is a 9" or 10", and still keep the
     72 dpi resolution?  (i assume that it doesn't, and i don't 
     mean to imply they *all* have these dimensions)
 
 
 2.  any info on price drops or new models (non-duo) coming up?
 
 
 
 thanks,
 jt
