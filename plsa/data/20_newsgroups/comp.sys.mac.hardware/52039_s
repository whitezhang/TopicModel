 according to macweek of 2-22-93:
 
 the cyclone will come in the same metal minitower case as the quadra
 800, while the tempest will share the low-slung case of the centris
 610. apple will offer a miniature video camera that can be mounted
 above the user's monitor or moved about on the end of its cable to take
 pictures of objects or documents. taking advantage of the 32-bit
 digital signal processor (dsp) built into the systems' logic boards,
 the camera will be able to put an image measuring 360 by 288 pixels,
 with 256 gray levels, on the screen.
 
 users will be able to install supplementary lenses that can record
 detail as fine as the wire bonds on an integrated circuit. the camera
 is expected to cost between $150 and $250.
 
 the systems will ship with all the software needed to put apple's
 casper voice-recognition technology to work; users apparently will have
 to purchase an operational high-fidelity microphone.
 
 the two models will talk as well as listen. a new system facility
 called the speech manager will convert text strings sent by
 applications to phonemes and then pass them to a speech synthesizer.
 
 the cyclone will include a 40mhz '040, three nubus slots and support
 for up to 128mb of ram. the tempest will use a 25mhz lc040, lacking an
 fpu, and hold up to 68mb of ram; it will have a single slot that will
 require a nubus adapter and have room for only 7-inch nubus cards.
 users will be able to update the tempest's process but not the
 cyclone's.
 
 for more get the 02.22.93 issue of macweek.
