 frankly, i think this model is a screwup.  it does not have postscriptlevel
 2, only has 13 fonts, and does not even have  fine print or photograde, or
 grayshare.  even the 300 model has this!  i am shocked by the kind of
 features you get for this printer.  i myself was hoping for some decent
 printer to replace the personal laser writers.
