 i don't know about the specific problem mentioned in your
 message, but i definitely had scsi problems between my
 q700 and my venerable jasmine megadrive 10 cartridge
 drives.  my solution was to get silverlining.  none of
 the loops that involved blind writes worked to the drives;
 in fact the only loop that worked was the "macintosh
 software" loop (whatever that means).
