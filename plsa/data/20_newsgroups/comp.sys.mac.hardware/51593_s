 the problem is that the pins in the adb connector 
 are close to each other, and if you happen to bend the
 cable a little while inserting it, you short the adb
 port. if you take it to an apple repair centre, that
 means a new motherboard (though a component replace is
 physically possible)
 
 same goes for serial ports (localtalk as well)
