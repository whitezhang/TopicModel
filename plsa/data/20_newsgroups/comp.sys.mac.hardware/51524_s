 
 	i too am interested in peoples' experience with accelerators for the
 se.  is an accelerator the best route to improve performace in my se, or should
 i consider upgrading to an se/30 motherboard?  obviously, buying a new mac 
 would be ideal, but alas, i only have enough money for an accelerator or
 motherboard.
 	e-mail reply preferred.  thanks.
