     actually, there such a thing as an '040 without a coprocessor. it's
 called the 68lc040. this is a redesign of the full 040 (which people are
 calling the 68rc040, although i have been told by a number of people
 that motorola doesn't call the full '040 that) without the integrated
 fpu hardware. it just isn't there.
