 hello
 	i recently accelerated my mac plus (micromac 25mhz accelerator) 
 and now i can't get my mac to boot off of the hard disk.  it boots fine 
 from a floppy, and i can mount the hard disk using scsi probe, but i 
 cannot get it to boot from the hard drive.  i installed a new driver, so i 
 don't think that is the problem.  
 	this poses a rather large problem.  i only have 4 meg of ram, and 
 i need to run mathematica, which requires 5 meg.  i was hoping to use 
 system 7 virtual memory so that i could run mathematica.  however, i can't 
 run system 7 from a floppy, so i can't get enough ram.  
 	any suggestions? thanks for your time--
