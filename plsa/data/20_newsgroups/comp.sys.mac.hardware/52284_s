 the first problem was the sound.  i tried the m0, but then even the logon was
 muted.  i don't want that.  any other suggestions for that hissing?
 
 the second is really strange.  first, i kept mentioning that fc slowed down
 all the time and took too long.  well i just logged on with extensions off and
 i didn't have any slowdown.  also, last time i was online i quit (which
 usually disconnects and quits).  it disconnected but it wouldn't quit.  i had
 to force quit, and then when i launched fc again it said the modem port was in
 use.  this is really strange.  i thought it might have to do with fax
 software.  or the restart could have reset the modem port (a more likely
 explanation).  so, any suggestions?
