 i have been using the pli (sony) 3.5" mo drive and now a sharp color
 scanner using standard scsi cables and standard $20 terminator on my q700. 
 no problems.  if you were using a iifx, that might be another story.
 
 make sure there is only one terminator in the cabling and it must be at the
 end.  some boxes have internal terminators; some can be switched out and
 others are socketted.  these count.  if the box with internal terminations
 cannot be put on the end to terminate the cabling, they have to be
 disabled, ie, switched out or pulled out of their sockets.  if you have 2
 boxes with internal terminations, the terminations in one box has to be
 disabled...., etc.  i am sure that this has been covered by the "experts".
 
 my experience with scsi boxes that connect to the mac indicates that they
 must have some software package for the mac to 'talk' to them.  my pli mo
 drive and sharp scanner has one for each.
 
 good luck.
