 psi makes an internal fax modem for the map portable (1-800-622-1722) but 
 asks too much for it (retail $450). i'd buy an external and save about 
 $350. 
 
 there is a manufacturer that still makes internal hd's for the portable, 
 they're listed in some of the catalog "magazines" for apple stuff you can 
 find at bookstores. if i see it again i'll post it. but, again, you might 
 want to just add a small lightweight external hd built for the 
 powerbooks. you'd be able to use it with a new computer some day. any 
 other mac portable questions, i'll have to cry uncle.
 
 don't blame me. i voted for xxxxxxx.
