   i have a radius precision color 24x video card for the mac that fits in a 
 nubus slot.  the card has 3 mb of vram on it, which means that 24-bit color 
 is possible on the card!  the card supports just about any monitor scan
 rate you can think of (i used it at 640x480, 800x600 and 1024x768, but it
 can go higher).  you can switch resolutions and depth on the fly with a
 software control panel.
 
   this is the accelerated version of the card, which means all quickdraw 
 calls are not executed by the cpu but taken over by the video card, freeing
 up the mac processor for other tasks. 
 
   the cheapest i could find this card for when i called around last night
 was $1738 at mac's place.  i will sell it for $1250 + shipping.  it is just
 over a year old and never been any problem.  it comes with software and the
 original manuals.
 
   hurry!
