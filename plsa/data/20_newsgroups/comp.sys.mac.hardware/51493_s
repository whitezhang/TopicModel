 flopticals have been available since the beginning of the year at $25
 per floptical (= $1.20 per megabyte), and i have seen them advertised
 in macweek at $20 (< $1.00 per megabyte).  for someone on a tight
 budget, the fact that the minimal dollar increment for more storage is
 less---$25 versus $60---sometimes matters.
