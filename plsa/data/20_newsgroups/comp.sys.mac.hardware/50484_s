 because scsi works well with removable media, and works well with large
 capacity devices. the floppy interface you suggest handles the former, but
 it doesn't have any hooks for dealing with the latter... you'd have to kludge
 it. plus, it's extremely low performance. and, scsi has gobs of room for
 expansion compared with a floppy (i can just see it, let's stick a 5.25",
 a 3.5", a tape drive, and a mo drive, all on the floppy interface. the
 possibilities for unexpected collisions are enormous).
