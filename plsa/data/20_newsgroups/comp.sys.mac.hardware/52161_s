 i have a iisi & a portrait display (and i love it).  i'm using the
 built-in video support, so its slow and deals with 16 colors/grays.
 so, i'm wondering:  if i get a video card, how much does this tend to
 speed up things and will i be able to get more than 4bits?  oh, i have
 combicache w/fpu.  does this limit my choices of video cards?
 
 thanks
