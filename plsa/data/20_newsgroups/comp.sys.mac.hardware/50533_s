 i also use retrospect, but i noticed that central point software's
 "mactools backup" also supports the apple tape drive under 7.x. 
 the apple tape drive is quite slow, so the advantages of retrospect
 relative to the simpler mactools backup are less significant than 
 might be the case for someone backing up a large server to a dat drive.  
 
 used apple tape drives are going for ~$100, so it might make less
 economic sense to pay an extra ~$140 for retrospect when mactools 
 is cheaper and includes other worthwhile utilities.
 
 retrospect is nice, though, and i'm probably going to upgrade to 2.0.
