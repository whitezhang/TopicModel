 i don't know the answer to your direct question, but if the mac superdrive can  
 read ms-dos disks (can it??) then you can transfer files between the next and  
 a mac by using ms-dos formatted disks since the next *can* read/write that  
 format.  and if you're interested in transferring files, you can also do it  
 over the serial port using kermit.
