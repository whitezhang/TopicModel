 i have the same problem and was about to post this....
 
 hello duo owners (and apple technical people :-)
  
 i have a new duo 230 which appears to have a problem waking up from
 sleep when running on battery power. when woken (usually for the second
 time) after sleeping, the wake fails and the screen appears with a
 corrupted image of broken horizontal lines and control can only be
 recovered with control-command-poweron or the reset key at the back of
 the machine. the problem occurs even when the system is stock standard
 (no extensions, no virtual memory, a fully charged new battery, system 7.1
 etc). i have not had the problem when the machine is plugged in to ac.
 i've checked that the battery is properly seated (it appears to be fine).
  
 what's going on here ? anyone else had this problem ? is it software or
 hardware ? 
  
 if you have a duo 230 and a bit of time, try repeatedly sleeping and
 waking the machine on battery power and let me know if you see the same
 behaviour (and let apple know too !).
  
 many thanks to anyone who can clear this one up for me.
  
 bruce
