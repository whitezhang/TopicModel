 go to radio shack and buy a tube of heat sink compound. it comes
 in a little blue and white tube with a black screw on cap.  at
 radio shack, it's catalog number 276-1372.  it's a mix of
 silicone and zinc oxide, and conducts heat very well.  plus, it's
 tacky.
 
 usually, you would smear a bit between the chip and the sink, and then
 bolt or clamp the sink down, but if you don't move your mac, gravity
 and the stickiness of the goo should be more than suffcient to hold
 things in place.  just make sure you remember it's in there, in case
 you tilt your mac and jar it hard enough to shake it loose.  you
 wouldn't want a loose piece of metal running around inside your mac.
