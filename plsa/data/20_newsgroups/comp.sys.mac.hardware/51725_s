 here is the story:
 i have a network with 4 macs on localtalk. one of them has an
 ethernet card, and is currently connected to a next (don't laugh
 i got it for the price of a mac iisi). the next is connected
 to the internet over slip running on a 9600 baud modem.
 
 currently, we can telnet from the mac w/ ethernet to the next,
 and then telnet out again to the rest of the world.
 
 what we want to know is if there is some sort of hardware that
 will route telnet sessions from the localtalk macs to the next
 via the ethernet mac. from what we have heard, air doesn't do
 the trick.
 
 software solutions would be good too, but my impression is that
 there aren't going to be any.
 
 our immediate interest is to be able to get to the next and telnet
 out again. the slip connection doesn't allow us to assign ip numbers
 to machines, so everyone shares that 1 number...oh well...
 
 thanks in advance.
