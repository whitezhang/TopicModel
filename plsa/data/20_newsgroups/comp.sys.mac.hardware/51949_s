 i recently got a centris 610 4/230 on my desk. it's a vast improvement on
 my previous machine (a iisi 5/40). however .....
 
 i've encountered a problem with fonts ..
 
 entries in a filemaker 2.0 database which looked fine when printed from my
 previous mac using system 7.01 now look wierd !
 
 spacing between characters has increased greatly - causing lines to be
 truncated. i'm using plain and bold helvetica in various sizes - the
 increase in character spacing seems to occur for all sizes and styles. 
 
 i'm using a mixture of truetype and fixed-size fonts - exactly as on my
 iisi - when things worked perfectly.
 
 we've managed to get similar behaviour using word 5.1.
 
 apple uk adopted their usual "friendly" approach and told us to call our
 local dealer - god help us !!
 
 any ideas ??

 artificial flowers:  pieces of plastic and metal, crudely fashioned to
   bear a limited, superficial resemblance to real flowers, but with no
   credible attempt to match their internal complexity in terms of form,
   function, or behavior.
