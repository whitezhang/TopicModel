 put me down for a pb100 4/20 with ext. floppy, appletalk remote acces,
 ac adapter, and fresh out of box (was used, but buyer switched to 140
 on arrival and sold unopened box. purchased last october for $925.
 later i bought a used powerport v.32 9600 bps internal fax-modem for
 something like $225, i'm using right now! works great!  :)
 
 no real complaints. i love my portable system (got a color home setup
 also. mac ii). reasoning was that matlab programs at school and other
 simulations of dynamic control systems sometimes took hours (or
 overnight) to run, tying up my mac ii. i got the pb100 with fast modem
 to do light work and on-the-run stuff. i figured i'd give it to my
 little sister next year when she goes to college. it's running system
 7.1 now without any problems. also i sometimes do dec4015 terminal
 emulations with matlab on our university's vax_vms (nice thing that it
 benchmarks itself as an average of 230 times faster than a mac iifx).
 so, the pb100 just does graphical output and terminal emulation (not
 too hard at all for it). it was a fabulous setup !!!!  :)  weeee!!!
 
 (by the way, all matlab software was on class accounts. i was also the
 ta for a class that used simulab/simulink. we had site-license and
 take-home, then-destroy later site-release licenses... no pirating
 there, incase you're wondering.... great program!!! )
 
 just like to add, whatever future system you get, you can almost never
 get enuff memory.... buy it while it's cheap - that is buy it when you
 get the computer since it's usually cheaper than upgrading... i always
 run out of disk space... but i have a syquest on the mac iisi, so i
 never worried about space before... got several carts).
