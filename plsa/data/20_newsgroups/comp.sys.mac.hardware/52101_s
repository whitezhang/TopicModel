 looking for a mac pb 100 that's in good condition (brand new, w/warranty
 would be ideal).  it should also include the external floppy drive and have
 at least a 40 meg internal hard drive with 4 meg of ram.
 
 so... if you have a pb100 that you'd like to turn into cash, please write me.
 
 thanks, very much.
