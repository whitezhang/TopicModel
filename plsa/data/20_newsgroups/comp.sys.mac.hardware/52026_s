         we are having problems with a bunch of se/30's in one of our labs. the
 fault is that the machines either bomb or freeze when attempting to write to
 their internal floppies. the internal floppies have been tested on their own
 and are fine, which means that it is a main board fault. the machines all come
 from the same batch.
 
         the date code on the back of the machines is december 1990.
 
         1. do you own a machine from this batch.
 
 	2. has any user had experience with this fault.
 
         3. was it a warranty repair.
 
 
 any feedback would be appreciated and i will post the results to the net.
