     well the monitor is consistently the largest power drain on your
 electric bill when you are looking at your computer set-up, especially
 if you have a large (16" or greater) color monitor. generally what i do
 is leave my mac on all the time, except for the occasional resart or
 syetem crash, but i turn my monitor off each night before i leave my
 office. i also turn off after dark when i do this, since there is no
 reason to have the screen saver running when there is no picture being
 displyed on the monitor's tube.

     really? what makes you think this? the q700 file server in my office
 has been on for the last 2 months, straight, and it hasn't had any
 problems. (note: i also keep the monitor for the file server turned off
 when i'm not actually working on the server itself.)
