 i have many questions for all you experts out there pertaining to apple's
 built-in video.  
 
 #1, do all macs that have built-in video have the ability to use vga monitors?
 #2, if so/if not, which macs have this capability?
 #3, can they drive svga as well?
 #4, how big of a vga monitor can they drive?
 #5, how can you tell if an unlabeled monitor is vga?  by the pinouts?
     if so, what should it look like?
 
 particularly, i'm interested in knowing if the si or ci drive vga, as well
 as the lc's capabilities in driving vga/svga
 
 thanks!!!
