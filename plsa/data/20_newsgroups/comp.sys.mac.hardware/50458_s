 help!!!
 
 i have an adb graphicsd tablet which i want to connect to my
 quadra 950. unfortunately, the 950 has only one adb port and
 it seems i would have to give up my mouse.
 
 please, can someone help me? i want to use the tablet as well as
 the mouse (and the keyboard of course!!!).
 
 thanks in advance.
