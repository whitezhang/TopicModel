 i have had my q700 running with a 66.666 mhz osc for a few months. i have a
 number of scsi devices connected (quantum lp52, maxtor 213, toshiba mk156f via
 emulex adapter, pioneer drm-600) and have had no trouble.
 
 i am using the stock cooling facilities, i considered adding a fan/heat pump,
 but don't feel they are necessary (for my box anyway). i have a temp meter on
 order and plan to do some measurements when it arrives in a few weeks. email me
 if you want to see the results.
