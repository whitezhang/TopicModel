 i ordered an external floppy drive from them 2 years ago.  when i placed
 the order, they said it was in stock and would ship the next day.  a week
 passed and no drive.  i called them up and they said they were out of stock
 and my drive should ship in 2 weeks or so.  since i needed the drive right
 away (both my internal hard drive and floppy were dead) i cancelled my
 order and haven't dealt with them since.
