 
 help!
 
 	i just received my falcon 2.2.1 upgrade from spectrum holobyte today.
 my se is running sys 7.0.1 with 4mb of ram. like the instructions said, i only
 installed disk 2 (the program...no start up screen or music).
 
 	i just downloaded macsbug from ftp.apple.com like it said, and
 installed it in my system folder. i restarted the mac an hour later, and it 
 wouldn't completely boot off the internal hd. i get the "happy mac", then it
 disappears, only to reappear and repeat the cycle continuously. i never even
 get the "welcome to macintosh" message. norton utilities fixed about 12 new
 problems, but the same thing still happened.
 
 	what do i do?
 
 	please e-mail to "orly@aludra.usc.edu"
 
 
 		thanks in advance!!!
