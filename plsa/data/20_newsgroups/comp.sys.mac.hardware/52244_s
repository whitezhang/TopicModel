 this is completely false.

 this is also false. what you need for multisession capability is
 multisession capability -- which is based on the firmware and
 electronics, not the drive speed. i'll admit, though, that i have
 not seen a multisession capable drive that isn't double speed.

 the above (1 & 2), proves 3 to be false.

 the apple cd300 is an excellent double-speed multi-session photocd
 capable drive. so are drives based on the slightly-faster toshiba
 xm3401. some companies selling such drives are: spin peripherals (a
 bargain at $499) and pli (a company i hate) and relax technologies
 (a company i know little about other than that they are  a longtime
 player in mac mailorder, which is usually a good sign). the nec
 cdr74 is also a good choice (nec's own mechanism, i think). clubmac
 sells it for around $619.

 your welcome, ooh but now i see your from germany. most of the
 mailorder info does you little good, i guess. if not:
 spin peripherals -- 800-466-1200
 club mac         -- 800-258-2622
 relax tech       -- 510-471-6112
 
 nothing wrong with the apple, though, which is based on a sony
 mechanism and speed-identical to the nec. the toshiba's speed
 advantage is very slight: 20% in average access time (a minor plus)
 and 10% in data transfer rate (a slightly more important plus).
 
 good luck,
 mark
