 i think you are suffering from some alignment or color
 table or <whatever> problems, if a color classic is as fast
 as a quadra rendering to screen.
 
 what screen card you use does of course matter much (built-in
 video is almost always faster than nubus)
 
 or you measured "scroll entire screen" where the color classic
 had a vram 10" screen in 4-bit color and the quadra had a
 21" 24-bit screen on nubus :-)
