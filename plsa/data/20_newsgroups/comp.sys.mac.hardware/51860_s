 you macinators who have used these voice messaging/fax/data-modems.  i
 have a question.  first what brand names do you recommend(i am mostly
 interested in the voice messaging and fax part).  is the voice part as
 reliable and understandable as the sellers claim?  approximately, how
 much hard drive space does an average day of callers take up, if they
 speak for one minute?  
 any feed back would be appreciated.  my company is looking at buying
 one or two.  hey, i may buy one myself too.
 
 thanks in advance
 don
