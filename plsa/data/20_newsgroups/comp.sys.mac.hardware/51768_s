 how many nubus slots do you have?
 
 applied engineering has something called the quadralink, which is
 a card with 4 serial ports that you get at through the comms
 toolbox (in addition to the built-in ones) it also comes with
 software for fooling applications to open an ae port when they
 think they open a built-in port.
 
 they also have a more expensive card with dma (better performance)
 and i _think_ they, or someone else, have a card that handles
 8 ports simultaneously.
 
 as i said, with nubus, you're green. learn how to use the comms
 resource manager to get at the various installed cards.
 
 cheers,
