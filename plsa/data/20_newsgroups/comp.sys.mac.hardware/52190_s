     the origional bit is missing but long/short follows:
 
     the origional poster asked if he/she could use any old vga/svga
 monitor with a centris (hence title).  
 
     the answer ot this question is an unqualified yes.  you can use any
 old vga/svga monitor with a centris.  you do need an adaptor (i use a
 mac vga-q from james engineering (510) 525-7350) to run between the two
 machines.  the adaptor i have mentioned will convert a centris to a
 three row vga/svga 25(?) pin adaptor for your monitor.
 
     now, the special interest disclaimer.
  the above answer is correct for using a vga monitor at 600x400
 resolution.  if your monitor will sync to 56khz horizontal the above
 adaptor will allow you to choose 800x600 resolution (i prefer this on my
 1604s).
 
 then you have the question of matching adaptors and sync rates.  i would
 advocate calling james engineering because they seem to have a clue.  as
 to the comment by the person who said don't bother calling apple because
 they will treat you like an idiot this is totally untrue.
     apple will treat you like a f**king assanine idiot for even
 considering going third party and if you want this treatment wants you
 to pay for their thech support line (the supposedly compitantly one) and
 then still has no fu***** clue.
 
 personal experience.  also the tech suppport for the vga monitor makers
 doesn't see to extend to macs (sony, magnavox).  in addition to this to
 find out the info you will have to call dealers unless you can find the
 sync rates elsewhere as ads like hardware that fits
 (*&^%&%^%$$(&**&^(%&%^$!) that rate monitor resolutions give the most
 favorable rating (which usually means you can get this if you use a
 specialized application video card).(i.e. "well you can get a resolution
 1168x832 on this $5,  9" "super smelly sock" monitor that will let you
 display two full pages side by side.  all you need is our reasonably
 priced "oder eater" video board for $27,000 and it will give you an
 ultra fast horizontal sync rate of six fast kilohertz and three khz
 vertical.")
 
 
 
 note:  with the sony 1604 at least on the centris 610 built in video
 board using an 832x624 adaptor, there is a boarder of an inch + to the
 sides of the image after adjusting the horizontal width as favorably as
 possible.  using a 800x600 adaptor this can be reduced to about half an
 inch.
