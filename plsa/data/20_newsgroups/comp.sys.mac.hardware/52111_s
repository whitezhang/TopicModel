 i read in a recent tidbits(171-2?) about the possibility of putting
 a 68030 in a pb100. i am interested in doing so, but would like
 to know more about it. does it involve just replacing the 68000 that
 is on the daughterboard, or does it involve getting a new daughter-
 board. also, would the 68030 be able to run qt with the pb100's
 screen(not pretty i know, but possible?) and of course, what would
 the damage be ($). any info would be appreciated.
 thanks in advance. jay fogel
