 if you get the centris 650 with cd configuration, you are getting a mac with
 a 68rc040 processor that has built-in math coprocessor support.  my 
 understanding is that the "optional fpu" refers to your option of purchasing
 the centris 650 4/80 without fpu or one of the other configurations with fpu.
 
 apple does not offer an upgrade from the non-fpu system to become an fpu
 system.  and, it is unclear whether the '040 processor on the non-fpu system
 (a 68lc040) can be replaced with a 68rc040 supplied by another vendor.
 apple did send a memo out at one point sating that the centris 610, which only
 comes with a non-fpu 68lc040 processor cannot be upgraded to support an fpu -
 the pin configurations of the two chips apparently do not match so you cannot
 swap one for another (again, according to apple's memo).
 
 hope that helps.
