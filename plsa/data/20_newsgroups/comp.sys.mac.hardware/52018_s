 
 does system 7.x support all scsi cd rom drives?  or are specific drivers
 needed for each different make/model?
 
 specifically, i'm looking at getting a nec cdr-25, mainly because they
 are cheap.  i know its a slow drive, but multimedia isn't my interest.
 i mainly want it for extracting software distributed on cd.
 will i need to get a specific driver to use this drive on a mac?
 
 
 thanks...charles
