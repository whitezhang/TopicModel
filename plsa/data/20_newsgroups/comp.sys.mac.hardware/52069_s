 
   so i finally decided to risk this upgrade, faq in hand i've gathered the
 pieces together.  the only problem is that i haven't been able to find
 anyone who's even heard of thermal tape/glue (which is what the faq
 recommends for attaching the heat sink)  i am just tempted to use duct
 tape here.... anyone hae any ideas for me for attaching the heat sink to
 the processor??  much thanks.
