 hi-
 do any of you hardware gurus out there know what kind of memory architecture  
 apple uses in the powerbook duos?  or in the powerbook in general?
 
 what are the factors that make the duo 210 so slow compared to a desktop  
 machine running the same processor at the same speed (25mhz 68030)?  how many  
 wait states are in the memory system, etc?  what kind of a data bus does it  
 use?  32-bit or 16-bit?  
 
 it's still slow when plugged into a duodock.
 
 anyone know in general what kind of shortcuts notebook manufacturers take when  
 making notebooks?  i heard of a 486dx2/66 notebook getting a "whopping" 10  
 mips rating.  a similar desktop machine should be getting about 3 times that,  
 i guess.
