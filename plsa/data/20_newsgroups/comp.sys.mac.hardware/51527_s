 	in certain apple 13" rgb monitors there has been a problem with
 	the high voltage capasitor. apple knows about this problem and is
 	replacing the cap at no cost if it falls into the bad batch that
 	they got from their supplier. your local repair shop should know about
 	repair extension 3l0218.
