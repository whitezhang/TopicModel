 ravi,
 
 	its not a good idea to have a horizontally formatted hard disk in a  
 vertical position.  if the drive is formatted in a horizontal position, it can  
 not completely compensate for the gravitational pull in a vertical position.   
 i'm not saying that your hard disk will fail tomorrow or 6 months from now, but  
 why take that chance?  if you want more detailed info on the problem, please  
 mail me at:===> sunnyt@dna.bchs.uh.edu <===.
