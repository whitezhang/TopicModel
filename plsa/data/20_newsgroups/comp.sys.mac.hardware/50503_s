 is that the low-end configuration?  if it is, it has the 68lc040 (no fpu), as  
 opposed to all the other configurations with a 68rc040 (has an fpu).  be sure  
 you know what you are getting before you buy!!!  the 68rc040 is around  
 $350-$400 right now, if you intend to upgrade it from a 68lc040.
