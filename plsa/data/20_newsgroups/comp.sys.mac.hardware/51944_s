 you shouldn't have ignored the zyxel.  it can be purchased with a "mac
 bundle", which includes a hardware-handshaking cable and faxstf software.
 the bundle adds between $35 and $60 to the price of the modem, depending
 on the supplier.  it is true that the modem has no mac-specific docs,
 but it doesn't require much 'tweaking' (aside from setting &d0 in the
 init string, to enable hardware handshaking).
 
 for more information on the zyxel, including sources, look at various files 
 on sumex-aim.stanford.edu, in info-mac/report.
 
 disclaimer:  i have no affiliation with zyxel, though i did buy a zyxel
 a u1496e modem.
