 i remember reading a thread a few days ago that mentioned removing an external
 syquest drive from its case and dropping it in the internal drive of a centris.
 . . i was going to do that with my 610, but had a couple of questions.  my
 pli 80m syquest drive has a wire from the drive to an id# switch on the
 outside of the case.  where do i connect this switch??  can the computer just
 "tell" with internal drives?  
 	i noticed that the drive will lay over part of the motherboard (i
 didn't look closely, but i seem to recall it laying over the ram that's
 soldered onto the motherboard?  would that cause problems?
 	one last question!  is there anywhere to order a faceplate cover?  
 the drive's front panel is smaller than the space left in the case (the
 drive's panel is the same size as the spotsbm clone's cases).  should i just
 cut a hole in the plastic panel that is currently holding tmpty place?
 
 ans are welcomed!  thanks!
