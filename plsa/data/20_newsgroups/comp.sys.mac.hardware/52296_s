   i had a similar problem with my stylewriter i (the original!).
 have you tried cleaning the print heads? with the swii driver, it's
 and option in the print dialog box. sometimes i had to do it several
 times to get the crud out. yes it wastes ink, but it beats those
 white annoying lines.
   another idea is to print a couple of pages with just a big
 black box. it can help to get the ink flowing.
   good luck!
