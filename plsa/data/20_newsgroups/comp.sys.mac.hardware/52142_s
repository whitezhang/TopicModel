 does gx take the place of 32 bit qd or add to it? right now 32 bit is
 kinda aesthetically a pain in a few places because of hacks upon hacks
 to maintain compatibility with original qd---i think of things like
 where you have to cast cgrafports to grafports and such. it would be a
 lot cleaner to ditch this entire mess and start over---do we get that?
