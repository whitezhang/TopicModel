 a quick query for powerbook gurus:
 tom spearman, in a post on alternative powerbook battery options
 mentioned that there exist 3 versions of their powerbook 140-180
 batteries: a 2.5 amp hour one (m5545/a), a 2.8 amp hour one,
 (m5545/b) and a 2.9 amp hour one (m5545/c). anyone out there
 know how to determine which of these a battery is? i looked at my
 battery and there is no obvious exterior indication. i contacted
 tom spearman who had gleaned the information from macuser and he
 didn't know either. anyone out there know the answer?
 	thanks!

 btw, if you can reply via email i would be grateful. i don't
 often read this newsgroup. i will post a summary of answers.
