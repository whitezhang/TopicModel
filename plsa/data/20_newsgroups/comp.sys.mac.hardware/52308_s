 
 can anyone recommend a 3 button mouse that is compatible with macx and quadra?
 if so, can the buttons be programed to say, cut, paste etc?
 
 can anyone suggest a supplier?
 
 the only 3 button mice i know exist are:
 
 	1. logitek	$106.00 aust (injan ).
 	2. anorus	$100.00 aust (mac direct).
 are these ok for the above configuration?
 
 please reply me directly.
