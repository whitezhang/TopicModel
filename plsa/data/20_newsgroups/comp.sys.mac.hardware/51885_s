 i think you must be talking about the syquest 105 (code named mesa i believe).
 it is a 3.5" winchester technology drive pretty much like the other syquest
 drives in terms of how it works. according to the latest macleak, the 
 drive has a 14.5 ms access time, 1.9 mb/s sustained throughput (these figures
 are from memory so they could be slightly off, but they give you an idea of
 performance nonetheless). the drive was originally released for the pc
 and just recently was released for the mac world (don't ask me what the 
 differences are) and through they are currently in limited supply, according
 to a syquest rep. they are in the process of ramping up for mass production.
 i have already seen them advertised by a number of manufacturers in macleak
 including pli, massmicro, clubmac, and macwarehouse's poweruser. the pli
 and massmicro units are priced at just around $1000; the lesser name brands
 are going for around $750 for an external drive. cartridges which hold 
 105 mb sell for about $80 each. at these prices, the drives and cartridges
 are cheaper and better performing than the 88mb drives.
 cost per megabyte compares favorably with other cartridge drives and bernoulli
 drives, but for large amounts of data optical is still cheaper, and more
 reliable.  personally, i'm excited by the new drive and look forward to 
 getting my hands on one.
