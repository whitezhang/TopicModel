 so is there any problems putting a drive formatted vertically on
 its side horizontally?
 
 i got a drive a few years ago with the rubber feet on the side,
 etc. and have used it like that since (obviously designed for that
 orientation). however, it doesn't fit under any of the clever
 places i can think of to place it, so i would really like to lay it
 flat and put it under a low shelf.
 
 this is probably not a "newer" drive, and it is only 70 meg, but
 when i bought it, it was a large drive for an average user
 (comparable to buying a 200 meg drive today). so is my old, 70 meg
 drive as fragile (or not) as a new 200 meg drive?
 
 just curious.....
