 	i think this kind of comparison is pretty useless in general.  the
 processor is only good when a good computer is designed around it adn the
 computer is used in its designed purpose.  comparing processor speed is
 pretty dumb because all you have to do is just increase the clock speed
 to increase speed among other things.
 
 	i mean how can you say a 040 is faster than a 486 without 
 giving is operational conditions?  can you say the same when 
 you are running a program that uses a lot of transidental functions.
 knowing that 040 does not have transidental functions building in to 
 its fpu and 486 does, can you say that 040 is still faster?
 
 	anyway, i hope people do not decided upon wether a computers
 is good or not solely on its processor.  or how fast a processor is
 based on its name, because one can alway do a certain things to a
 processor to speed it up.  
 
 	but if we restrict our arguements to, for example, pure
 processor architectural issues.  or how one processor will work
 well and another will not based on its design, then we can get
 somewhere with our discussions.
