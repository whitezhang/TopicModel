 andrew,
         i had the same problem when i bought some additional vram. in my case
 the problem arose when i set the color depth to 16 bit on a 14" monitor.  the
 problem was solved by sending back the simms and getting different ones. 
 someone on a local bbs i use said that the problem is with incompatible vram
 chips and that apple has some kind of repair/technical note discussing the
 issue.
 
         if you've had the problem since day 1, i'd take the chips back to
 whomever sold them to you and get good ones.
