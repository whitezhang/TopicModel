 are you sure it's not a problem caused by software?  i've seen this sort 
 of effect when a runaway program (which could be caused by an init 
 conflict, for instance) accidentally wacks on a register in the video 
 hardware.  have you tried booting with no extensions and then letting the 
 q950 just sit there in the finder?  you might also want to try changing to 
 24-bit addressing (yes, i know you can't access your full 64 mb of ram - 
 it's just an experiment) as the video hardware registers can't be accessed 
 then.
 
 another thing to try as a 'recovery' measure is to use something like 
 quickkeys to change the pixel depth of the display.  this reprograms (some 
 of) the video hardware registers and may allow sync to be restored.
