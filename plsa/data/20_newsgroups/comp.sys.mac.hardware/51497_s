 	bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzt!! sorry -- wrong. it would be an
 extremely hot idea...at least with the current alphas. the available
 alphas run up to 200 mhz. but they produce quite a bit of heat. in
 fact so much that they need special mounting with extra large heat
 sinks.
 	also apple looks pretty commited to the powerpc route instead
 of a deal with dec.
