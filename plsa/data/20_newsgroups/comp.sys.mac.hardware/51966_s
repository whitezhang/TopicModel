 fwb distributes hdt personal edition (hdt = hard drive toolkit), which
 is what i own. this is less fancy than the "full" version, but good
 enough for what you and i want to do. casa blanca offers drive7, but
 i'm not that familiar with it. i *think* that both drive7 and hdt pe
 can be had for around us$50.
 
 i've used silverlinging at work (v 5.42??), and i like hdt pe much
 better. imho it has a better interface, and easier to understand.
 
 any drive7 users?
