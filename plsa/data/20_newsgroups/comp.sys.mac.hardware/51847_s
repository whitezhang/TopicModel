 
 i really want to buy a powerbook and would like one that can run 
 mathematica. so i need a coprocessor but i can not afford a pb180.
 (who can?)  is it possible to put a mcp in a pb160? the guy at the  
 bookstore says no but i didn't think he had too much of a clue.
 
 please respond by e-mail:  ross@sbphy.physics.ucsb.edu
 
 thanks in advance, richard
