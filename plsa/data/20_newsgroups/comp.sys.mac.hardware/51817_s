     to display millions of colors on a 16" monitor you need 2mb of vram
 in the q950.

     correct. this is the amount of on-board vram that the q800 comes
 with.

     yes this is possible. technically, you only need to take out 2 of
 the vram simms but leaving in the other two will not get you anything
 because the 950 cannot really do anything with 1.5mb of vram. it only
 knows 1mb and 2mb.

     yes, this is correct. you get to 1mb by putting 2 256k vram simms
 into the vram simm slots on the q800's motherboard.

     yup. you have to take off the power supply. it's only a couple of
 screws so you should be ok. just make sure that everything is
 disconnected from it and watch out for static discharges.
