 i believe that apple, sun and a number of other desktop machine
 manufacturers have agreed with the government to incorporate
 power-saving techniques;  this is also something that governments in
 other countries are likely to require in the future, so expect to see
 it.  this may include the ability for the system to fully power down
 the monitor, via a controllable power outlet, and power it back on
 automatically.  (is this a "sell" on screen saver software companies?)
 
 goals for "idle" power consumption have been set at something like 30
 watts for the system, not including the monitor (? don't quote me on
 this).
 
 note that in many businesses, the savings will be substantial,
 especially if you factor in reduced load on air conditioning systems.
 sun did a study that indicated that simply powering off monitors for
 the night would save the company (sun itself) on the order of $1m per
 year.  putting other (and automatic) power-saving features in would
 probably have greater than double that value.
 
 given that we are seeing more and more reason to leave our work and
 home computers on (getting faxes, automatically getting email, ...),
 building power consumption control into all machines has a potential to
 cut ~2% off the national power consumption, based on data i heard.
 
 btw: when encouraging employees to power off monitors when leaving
 work, it was pointed out that this should only be done with monitors
 with the power switch on front.  there was some indication that
 monitors with power switches on the rear are not designed to tolerate
 lots of power cycling.  this may only apply to the monitors we use, but
 might be worth checking if you happen to have a monitor with the switch
 in back.
