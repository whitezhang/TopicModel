 the third-party media adapters are usually cheaper (at least in toronto) than
 apple's. i bought the adapters from asante instead of apple.

 >(can't say for certain about the models 125 and 133), so your best bet
 
 that's not true. only the decstation 5000/200 comes with a thinwire
 (bnc, coaxial) ethernet connector. the 5000/25, 5000/133 and 5000/240
 all have a single 15-pin aui ethernet connector only. i distinctly
 remembered this because when got the 5000/200 first and i thought all
 of them are going to be thinwire. i eventually had to go back and ordered
 destas (dec's oversized version of an aui-to-bnc adapter that must be used
 with a transciever cable) for the rest of the stations.
 
 my advise to the very original poster (beverly?) is:
 
 (1) if all you want is to create a lan with two workstations and won't add
     machines to it ever, go for thinwire regardless of the media type. going
     for utp (unshielded twisted pair) wiring requires a concentrator which
     means extra money and i believe these units come with at least 6 ports.
     as for thicknet, it's a nightmare and cabling is expensive. avoid it
     unless you have no choice (e.g. the two machines are two floors parts).
 
 (2) on the mac side, you will need:
     - one thinwire media adapter (from apple or third-party).
     - macx (make sure you get version 1.2; 1.1.7 won't run on system 7.1).
     - mactcp (which comes with macx; if you get macx v1.2, you should be
       getting mactcp v1.1.1 with it. don't use earlier versions on a centris).
     - you may or may not need a 25ohm terminator depending on the
       thinwire media adapter. so just ask the sales if the adapter is
       self-terminated or not.
     - configure mactcp to use "ethernet".
 
 (3) on the decstation side, you will need:
     - for a model 200, you will only need a t-connector.
     - for models 25, 125, 133, 240, you will need an aui-to-bnc adapter.
       get one that can be plugged in directly to the aui port of the
       decstation. this way you save the cost of a transciever cable
       (a 15-pin aui male to a 15-pin aui female cable).
     - get a 25ohm terminator.
 
 your two-machine network will look like this:
