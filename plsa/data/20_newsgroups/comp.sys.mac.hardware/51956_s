 that seems about right.  i have a mac iisi 5/130 with 64k cache card running
 system 7.1.  my roommate has a 486sx/25 5/200+ running windows 3.1 and from
 what i've seen, my iisi is faster in some operations.  in others, they are
 comparable...but keep in mind i'm strictly speaking of operations on the
 desktop level of windows 3.1 and system 7.1, not actual computational speed
 in other programs...
