 	hand scanner, please read on and save my life.........
 
 my problem is that my caere typist plus graphics hand scanner will not
 connect to my powerbook 160.
 
 the cable from the scanner will not fit the scsi port of the computer. 
 
 i managed to gaet a cabled assembled that adapted the cord to the
 computer. however, this placed the computer into scsi mode, that is it
 acted as an external hard disk whenever i switched the computer on.
 
 i've asked an engineer in london to assemble a new cable for me. but
 he's taken 14 weeks and has yet to find the solution, out of sheer
 laziness. and i know that a cable exists to solve the problem.
 
 if you know the solution. please let me know what cable i need and how i
 can get hold of one.

 thanking you in advance,
 
 zia.
