 ns>i am going to be getting a c650 soon, but i don;t want apple
 ns>to come out with the cyclones and the tempest in a month
 ns>and have the price drop on the system i want.  i have negotiated a
 ns>good deal with a supplier for a c650 8/80 and i would like to jump on it,
 ns>but, again, i don't want the price drop to smuther me.  btw, the deal
 ns>i have is a c650 8/80 with mouse for $2295... does anyone know of a better
 ns>deal?
 
 i don't know of a better deal, but would you be willing to share your
 deal with the rest of us. that certainly sounds like you're getting a
 great deal. i'd be interested in that deal too.
