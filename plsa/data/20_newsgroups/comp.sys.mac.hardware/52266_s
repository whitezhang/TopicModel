 i believe that that would be the same as a system error #64. since there is no
 error #64, then i would guess that it would be a -64 error. which is a font
 manager error of "error during font declairation".
 
 i would assume that the system that's on the floppy that you are trying start
 up on has a corrupted font in it, or something like that.
