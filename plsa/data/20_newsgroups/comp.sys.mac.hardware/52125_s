 what is the real story here? can i hook up any pc svga montitor to the
 centris internal video? do i need to make my own cable if it doesn't not
 come with one? has apple released a tech note with the pinouts for doing
 such? the reasoj i ask is that it seems the prices for svga are lower than
 that of their mac counterparts...
