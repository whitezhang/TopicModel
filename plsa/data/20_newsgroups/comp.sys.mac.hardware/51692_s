 the iiip has just been superseded by the 4m, which is the one i am using at
 work.  the quality of the print is execellent, beating 300 dpi printers hands
 down.  in australia the price of the 4m is about comparable with that of the
 iii-series, so hp are trying to get people to buy the new one !!!
