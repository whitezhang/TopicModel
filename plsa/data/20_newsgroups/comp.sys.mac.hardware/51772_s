 
    my mac monitor displays about 20 vertical lines when i use it.
 it means that either my display memory goes wrong or monitor is bad
 or video card is bad.
    i checked my monitor, it works fine with other mac.
    i checked my video card, it's also fine.
    i replaced all the rams, it still didn't give me right answer.
    hence i assume something wrong with some part of my motherboard.
 
    i don't know hardware architecture of the macintosh.
 
    can anyone tell me what's the problem ????
 
    it's a mac iicx.
 
 
    many thanks in advance.
