 hello. i have a question (or two) about the serial ports for the
 powerbooks (specifically the 145 with system 7.0.1). is there a
 difference between the serial ports on the powerbooks versus
 any other mac, say plus or ii?? i have heard, though not confirmed
 by apple that the serial ports have problems at high speeds.
 
 i also heard that sys 7.1's new power manager 'fixes' this problem
 allowing speeds just as any other serial port.
 
 my particular use is that i have a 6811 evb board that i need to
 interface with my powerbook via the modem port at 9600 baud. 
 currently, we are interfacing using mac pluses.  i set everything
 up just as in lab and nothing.  in fact, the powerbook locks up.
 
 can anyone help, inform, advise? i would appreciate it.  
 i would prefer email since i don't read the news at all.
 i will post a summary if enough response is generated.
 
 thanks.
