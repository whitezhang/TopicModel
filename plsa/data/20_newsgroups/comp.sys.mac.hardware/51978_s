 sorry, this must be a faq, but it's a quick fix that i need to take care of  
 before a demo in less than 24 hours from now! couldn't think of a better place  
 for a rapid answer than comp.sys.mac.hardware.
 
 i need to connect the serial a of a compac 386/20 pc to the printer port of a  
 mac iici. does anyone have handy the pin-pin routing for the cable that would  
 allow this connection? 
 
 the serial port on the compaq is a male db9. how would this map to the din8 of  
 the mac serial? i tried one of those really short femaledb9-maledin8 cables  
 that apple sold as adaptors to plug in macintosh serial peripherals from the  
 pre-macplus era. this cable didn't do it. do i need a null modem adaptor as  
 well on the db9 side of things? 
 
 i just need to be able to map the data tx and rx pins correctly.
 
 
 thanks kindly,
