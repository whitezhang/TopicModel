 a similar reason is why people at work, used to seeing sco unix running
 on a 486, are suprised when they see my sun-3 at home running faster w/a 16mhz
 68020/68881.  the sun was designed from the ground up for unix, the pc
 wasn't.
 
 this is why you need a gargantuan processor to run windows.  the basic
 design of the box is all wrong. (would've been better if ms had put most
 of windows on a plug-in rom card from day one. (priced at $24.95 or
 so...) people woulda loved it.
 
 apple had the right idea, just stumbled a bit in the execution.
