 i would like to find out about the adb connector on the back of the
 macintosh powerbooks.    
 
 	after seeing several products that use it for powering devices
 	on the powerbook i also thought up of something to power from
 	the adb connector (the keyboard/mouse connector)
 	does anyone have spex on it....  i know it has voltage on it
 	and a serial i/o of some sort if some kind soul could tell
 	me the way you talk to the mac through it (ie packet info)
 	it would be appreciated greatly!!!!!
 
 	on a second note,   what are the pin outs of the 
 	mac powerbook  modem connector ..   i have would like to
 	know which pins are +5v, data  etc...  
 
 		again thanks!

 actually, unix is a very user-friendly system.  its just that it is
      particular about which users it chooses to be friendly with.   -the oracle
 programmers and programs alike need die gracefully upon failure, and exit with
      no system disruption.
