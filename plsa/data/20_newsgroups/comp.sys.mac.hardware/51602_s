 the internal hd in my lc disappeared for a day last week, and i'd like to
 hear any (reasonable) theories folks can suggest for what happened.
 
 it is an lc, with 10mb of ram and an 80mb internal drive, running system
 7.1, with a few scsi devices in a (so far as i know) properly terminated
 chain.
 
 i had shut down the system for a day-- i was out of town and we sometimes
 have thunderstorms this time of year-- and upon restarting got a blinking
 question mark.  i booted from a floppy and saw that my external hd seemed
 okay, but there was no sign of the internal.
 
 i installed a system folder on the external and was, indeed, able to boot
 from it.  i tried things like disk first aid and silverlining, to inquire
 about the internal drive.  they either could not find it or got errors in
 trying to talk to it. (silverlining claimed it was a connor drive, but it
 is a quantum... )
 
 well, i'd backed things up, so i was able to work.  but, at some point i
 noticed that the internal had reappeared.  now, disk first aid says that
 all's well, etc.  things seem to be fine.
 
 but, what happened?  was this a warning that something (the internal hd
 or something else) is about to die?  i'm definitely nervous.
 
 and, if this is a signal that the internal hd is sick, is it true that i
 can only put up to a 127mb drive inside an lc?  some folks have claimed
 there's a limitation in the lc (other'n size or power) while others (and
 that includes lacie, over the phone) say anything that fits is okay.
 
 thanks for answers.
