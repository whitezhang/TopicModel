 you are excused... the answer varies from mac to mac so it would be

 : i have a iisi with the standard 5 meg memory and i want

 : i really don't need more than 10 meg max, so what is
 : the best (performance wise) and most economical way
 : to do this?  someone told me that i should only use
 : simms of the same amount of memory, that is 4 1 meg,
 : 4 2 meg, etc.  what if i just wanted to buy just 1 4 meg
 : and use the rest of what i already have?  the manual
 : hasn't been very helpful with this.
 : 
 the si uses a 32 bit wide data bus and therefore you must use 4 8-bit
 wide simms.  sorry, but no short cuts here.
 
 : thanks.
 
 you're quite welcome.
