 when apple came with their demos to iowa state, i got a chance to run
 speedometer3.1 on some of the new macs.  both machines were running
 system7.1, had a 14" rgb.  don't know what the caches were set to.
 neither machine had an fpu  it appears that the centris610 is quite a
 bit faster than the lc iii:
 
 		centris610		lciii
 
 cpu		13.01			6.92
 graf		15.67			7.69
 disk		2.22			2.44
 math		25.57			10.19
 
 p.r. rating	12.91			6.58
 
 so, there is a comparison.  there is definitely a very noticable speed
 difference between these two machines according to speedometer3.1.
