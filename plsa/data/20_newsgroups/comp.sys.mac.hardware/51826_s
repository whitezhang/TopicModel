 dear mac-friends,
 
 i've seen the following problem om three mac iisi machines
 all with 17 mb ram installed (70 or 80 ns simms).
 
 if the contents of a window are being calculated and updated
 a lot of strange horizontal lines are temporarily generated
 on the screen.  the lines translate to the top of the screen and
 have a slightly lower brightness than their surroundings (they
 are a few millimeters apart).
 i admit that they are vague, but they can still be distinguished clearly,
 especially if the environment (i.e. the rest of the room) is a bit dark.
 applications which produce this effect are:
 - the previewer of directtex 1.2 (i.e. dvireader 1.2)
 - kaleidagraph 2.1.1/fpu
 
 the machines use their built-in video and drive the old 
 apple hires monochrome screen (two monitors/cable sets tried).  
 the effect is independent of the settings in the following control 
 panels: memory (adressing mode, disk cache) 
         and monitors (nr of greys/colors).
 
 have you ever seen this effect too ?   is there a solution ?
 
 thanks,
 fred
