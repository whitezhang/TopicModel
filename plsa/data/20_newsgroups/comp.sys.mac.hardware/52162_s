 first of all, i wouldn't advise wasting your time with apple.  they'll
 treat you like an idiot and you won't get any answers (a personal
 opinion).
 
 the safest thing to do is match the svga monitor's scanning rates with
 apple's rates.  i don't know apple's video scanning rates, but i use the
 micron xceed 30's rates, as they're a good approximation.
 
 about cables: you just have to go out to someplace like fry's and get a
 few mac-vga cables and try them out.  i have a viewsonic 5e (14") and i
 use an nec adaptor.  other monitors may use other adaptors.  i also have
 a mac->832x624 adaptor that tricks system into thinking the monitor is an
 apple 16".  i need to readjust the vertical and horizontal sizes but it
 works fairly well.
