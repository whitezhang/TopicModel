   what you need is a hardware router such as etherroute/tcp made by
 compatable systems ($1400).  this will allow you to connect your localtalk
 network (4 macs) to your ethernet network (next and ethernet mac).  it will
 route tcp/ip protocol between the two networks.  software routers are also
 available for less money, but i'm not sure if they work with tcp/ip.
