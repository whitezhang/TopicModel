 in my quest for speed, i've run into a problem. 66.66 mhz and 80 mhz
 clock oscillators are available but i haven't found any speeds between
 66.66 and 70 mhz for further testing. fox electronics (813) 693-0099 can make custom oscillators but if anyone knows a source cheaper than $12/osc please
 let me know. some 68 and 70 mhz units would complete my speed trials on the
 old q700
