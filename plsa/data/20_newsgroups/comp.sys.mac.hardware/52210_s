 saying things like that incline one to believe that you can't get it (scsi)
 to work for your setup (too bad). i've daisy-chained 4 scsi devices off my
 mac without a problem (limit is 7 scsi devices in the daisy-chain). if it
 isn't working for you, it's really better to state the problem (unless all
 you really intend to do is try to get nasty e-mail, in that case perhaps you
 would be better off posting to alt.masochistic type of newsgroup).
