 i bought a bernoulli 90pro drive last year after comparing it with lots of
  diffrent storage solutions,
 optical drives are slow, very slow compared to 13 to 19ms access of bernoulli.
 
 since i needed additinol online storage (rather than just a backup or archiev
 e disk), i choosed bernoulli drive. i use adobe preimere and quicktime movies
 alot. you ran out of storage real fast.
 
 imho, the best buy currently is the bernoulli 150multidisk. 150mb per cartridge
