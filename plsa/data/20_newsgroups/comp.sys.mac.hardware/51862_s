 just a quick summary of recent findings re. high speed modems. top three
 contenders seem to be at&t paradyne, zyxel, and us robotics. zyxel has the
 biggest "cult following", and can be had for under $300, but i ignored it
 because i need something with mac software, which will work without any
 tweaking.
 
 the at&t dataport earns nearly unanimous praises for reliability. they are
 backordered at the moment, probably because of the special $299 price in
 effect until may. its fax capabilities are worse than that of the other two
 modems. warning: at&t ads say that the modem comes with a mac kit (cables &
 all), and has lifetime warranty. this applies *only* when you order
 directly from paradyne! i called elektek (one of the distributors), and
 they wanted to charge me $16 for cable, and gave only 1 year warranty...
 
 usr sportster for the mac is also highly (but not as highly) recommended;
 it's only $250 from clubmac, and if you are willing to roll your own cable
 and don't care about the faxstf software, you can get the generic model
 from pc outlets for $190.
 
 all this assuming that you don't have a rich uncle, and can't afford a
 motorola codex...  :-(    i ended up ordering the dataport; we'll see how
 it works in two weeks or so.
