 
 	well, i just got my centris 610 yesterday.  it took just over two 
 weeks from placing the order.  the dealer (rutgers computer store) 
 appologized because apple made a substitution on my order.  i ordered
 the one without ethernet, but they substituted one _with_ ethernet.
 he wanted to know if that would be "alright with me"!!!  they must
 be backlogged on centri w/out ethernet so they're just shipping them
 with!  
 
 	anyway, i'm very happy with the 610 with a few exceptions.  
 being nosy, i decided to open it up _before_ powering it on for the first
 time.  the scsi cable to the hard drive was only partially connected
 (must have come loose in shipping).  no big deal, but i would have been
 pissed if i tried to boot it and it wouldn't come up!
 	the hard drive also has an annoying high pitched whine.  i've
 heard apple will exchange it if you complain, so i might try to get
 it swapped.
 	i am also dissappionted by the lack of soft power-on/off.  this
 wasn't mentioned in any of the literature i saw.  also, the location
 of the reset/interupt buttons is awful.  having keyboard control for
 these functions was much more convenient.
 	oh, and the screen seems tojump in a wierd way on power-up.
 i've seen this mentioned by others, so it must be a...feature...
 	anyway, above all, it's fast.  a great machine at a great price!
