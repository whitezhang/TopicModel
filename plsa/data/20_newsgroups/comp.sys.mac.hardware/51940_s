 i recently made the mistake of purchasing a sony cpd-1320 monitor for my
 mac iici.  the monitor is very good, however it seems that the iici does not
 support vga (then why did you buy it you ask?  i am stupid i reply).  what i
 am looking for is a video card, preferably 8 bit, which supports vga.  i am
 interested in any information i can get.  offers for the sale of applicable
 cards will also be considered.  
 
 thanks in advance.
