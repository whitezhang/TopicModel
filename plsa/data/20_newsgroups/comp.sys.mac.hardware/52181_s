 it happened to my classic ii once.  at startup, after the usual powerup
 tone, there were chimes (kinda like do(1st)-mi(1st)-sol(1st)-do(2nd) or
 1st c - 1st e - 1st g - 2nd c on the music scale), and it hanged before
 giving the happy mac.  i had to re-powerup.
 
 this was asked before but i can't remember the answer.  i've tried to
 find the answer from the faqs and other ftp sites but to no avail.
 
 can anyone tell me what those unusual chimes mean?  a spurious memory
 check error?
 
 thanks
