 i agree completely, but there was only a refund for people who bought the gc
 with a quadra. i have seen an alpha version of an extension from apple called
 8.24 gc quicktime video which offloads quicktime compression/decompression
 from the cpu to the am29000 on the card. so it seems it can be done even though
 in a developer article it states that the gc can't be programmed - but they
 asked that any suggestions be sent in anyway...
