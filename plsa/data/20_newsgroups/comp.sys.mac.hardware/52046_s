 the problem with turing your computer on and off constantly is not due to
 the power surge at start up.  it is due to thermal fatigue.  you turn on
 your computer, it heats up, and everything expands.  you turn it off, it
 cools off, and everything contracts.  there is a limited number of cycles
 of this that any component can take before it fails.  modern electronics
 are much more robust in this respect than their predeccesors.  in fact
 portable computers are designed with this in mind since the sleep function
 that extends battery life also greatly increaces the number of thermal
 cycles that occur.  as a rule of thumb, if i am not going to use my
 computer (and this includes the monitor) in the next 4-6 hours, i turn it
 off (i always dim the monitor when not in use to prolong the life of the
 phosphor).  i tend to think that with the pace of technical innovation in
 the computer industry you should be much less concerned with the fatigue
 life of your equipment and more concerned with how long your particular
 architecture will be supported by hardware and software vendors. :")
