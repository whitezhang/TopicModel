 have you tried the library?
 since you go to wpi (so do i), go to ak and look on the first floor, a 
 professor has posted an ieee (i believe) spec sheet on the 68060 which
 is around 10 pages long.  i'm sure the library has the info you request, it's
 just a matter of finding it.
 
 
 hope this helps,
