 to the best of my knowledge there aren't any problems with quadras and
 blind transfers.  trouble with blind transfers usually means the programmer
 screwed up the tibs or didn't test their driver with the device in question.
 well designed tibs poll or loop at every point where delays of >16µsec occur.
 this usually occurs at the first byte of each block of a transfer but some
 devices can "hiccup" in the middle of blocks.  if this happens in the middle
 of a blind transfer there is the possibility of losing or gaining a byte
 depending on which direction the tranfer was going.  in anycase the scsi manager
 will eventually return a phase error at the end of the transaction because
 it is out of sync.  actual data loss would only occur if the driver didn't
 pay attention to the errors coming back.
 
 note that this effect is not caused by anything actually on the scsi bus but
 rather by the transfer loops inside the scsi manager.  the problem occurs when
 the processor bus errors trying to access the scsi chip when the next byte
 hasn't been clocked yet.  also note that the bus error is dealt with by a bus
 error handler and doesn't crash the machine...
