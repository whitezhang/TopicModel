 hmmm... that's not quite right.  the performa 600 is real darn close
 to the iivx (but a better buy imo).  i also don't think they are so
 much a 'low-cost business solution', but a low-cost _home_ solution.
 why else bundle at ease (among other things)?  hardly a business
 application. 
 
 what do you mean by 'no "retail price"'.  quite the contrary, i think.
 the price is darn near the same all across the country.  that (again,
 imo) was one of the selling points of the performas -- ie: no haggling
 required.  kinda like the saturn (car) of the computer set.  one
 price, medium performance, ready to go.
 
 when i shopped for my performa (600cd), the difference between sears
 (*sigh), montgomery wards, silo (*sigh), circuit city (*sigh*) and
 bizmart (*sigh*) couldn't have been $100.00.  why i chose one over the
 other was based solely on availability and a friendly salesman who
 went the extra mile (when did you last hear that about someone who
 sells apples?).  admittedly, except for montgomery wards (and i
 suspect i was just lucky) all of the salesfolk i spoke to didn't know
 didly about the computers, peecee or mac.  but then, neither did any
 of the  apple dealers i spoke with...
 
 if you would've told me a year ago that i would buy a macintosh from
 montgomery wards i woulda laughed for a long, long time.  go figure.
 i'm *real* happy with my performa.  oh, and i bought the apple
 performa plus monitor (vs. buying 3rd party).  happy with that
 decision as well.  i walked in, plopped down some cash, and walked out
 with a spankin' new computer the day before christmas.
