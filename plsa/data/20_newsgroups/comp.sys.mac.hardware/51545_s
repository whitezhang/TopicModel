 the service notice on the 13" hi-res monitors expired 3/23/93 after this  
 date apple will not reimburse service providers for the fix (replacement  
 of the hi-voltage capacitor). all you folks that have been putting up with  
 intermittant shutdowns without getting it to your service provider missed  
 out on the freebie. it was in force for a year. if you got it free after  
 3/23, you got a deal...
