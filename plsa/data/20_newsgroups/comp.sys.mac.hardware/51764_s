 the previous article referred to the fact that you could only use 20ns simms in
 a 50mhz machine, but that you could use 80ns simms in slower machines. i just
 pointed out that if you could only use 20ns simms in a 50mhz machine, you can't
 use 80ns simms in anything faster than a 12.5 mhz machine. bank switching and
 caches were not considered in either example (although both would help memory
 access).
