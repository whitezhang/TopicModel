 terry, hi.  i recently bought an lciii and a datadesk 101e.  i can't
 remember trying to rebuild the desktop with it, however it did give me
 a strange problem.  when i held down shift during startup to disable
 all extensions, nothing happened. i tried it with another keyboard, using
 the same adb connector cable- and it worked with the other keyboard.
 the shift key on the datadesk keyboard worked well otherwise. i checked
 the dipswitches and they are fine.  try disabling your extensions and tell
 me if it works.
 
 i am annoyed with datadesk.  i sent them the keyboard in the mail for
 inspection/repair/replacement.  the technician on the phone said they
 have a 10-14 day turn around time- meaning you should receive the
 inspected/repaired keyboard in that time.  well, they have had the
 keyboard for over 3 weeks and i still have gotten very little info
 from them about it. it's annoying because it cost me $12 to send them
 the keyboard (they do not refund the money) and their costumer service
 lines are toll calls. tell me if you have a similar experience.
