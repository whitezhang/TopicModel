 8 mb simms do not have to be composite simms, although many (most?) 16 mb 
 simms are.  72-pin simms allow two memory banks per simm, thus permitting 
 the use of 4 mb dram devices (the same ones used on 4 mb simms) to be used 
 for two 4 mb banks on one simm.  i can't imagine that it would be cheaper 
 to build an 8 mb simm using 1 mb drams as the 4 mb parts reached (and 
 exceeded) bit for bit price parity with the 1 mb parts some time ago.  
 it's probably possible to build a single-bank 8 mb simm using 4 mb parts - 
 this could cause problems in a q800.  i'm not sure why you'd want to do 
 this, though, as a dual-bank 8 mb simm would be cheaper to build than a 
 single-bank composite one.
