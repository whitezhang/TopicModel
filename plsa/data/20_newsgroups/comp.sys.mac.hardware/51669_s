 so, will it be possible to have a nubus or pds powerpc upgrade, or will it 
 require a logic board swap? it would be interesting for apple to come out with
 a nubus powerpc that allowed use of the cpu's 680x0, like rocketshare. but i 
 guess that's getting a bit fantastic!
 
 i was wondering, since macweek reported that developers were 'seeded' with
 powerpcs on a nubus card.
 
 also, any word on machine arrivals or estimated speed? last i heard, the 
 estimates were around 3-4 times the speed of a quadra in native risc mode. i
 heard an apple employee mumble something about the arrival of powerpc machines
 at a much earlier date that q1 94, but i doubt it's true.
 
 finally, is the powerpc developer's cd 'mini-course' available? i saw it 
 advertised in the developer's university calendar, and i'd like to know if it's
 at all *interesting*.
