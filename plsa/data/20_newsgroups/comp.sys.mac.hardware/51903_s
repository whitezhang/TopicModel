 the powerbook 170 hardware doesn't have a wakeup timer.  nor does the 140.
 the mac portable had one, and i think the powerbook 100 had one.  i don't
 know about the newer powerbooks, but i kind of doubt it.  i got bit by
 this too, and it took my a while rooting around on the developer cd
 before i found this out.
