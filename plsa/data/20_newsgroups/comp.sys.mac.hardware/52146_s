 hello out in networld,
 
        we have a lab of old macs(ses and pluses). we don't have enough money 
 to buy all new machines, so we are considering buying a few superdrives for 
 our old macs to allow folks with high density disks to use our equipment. 
 i was wondering what experiences (good or bad) people have had with this sort
 of upgrade.
