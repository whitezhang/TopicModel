 	hi,
 
 	i own a iisi and i'm considering buying a powerbook.  can
 anyone give me a listing of all the models and tell me what i'm looking for,
 i.e. passive matrix vs. active, memory sizes, upgradeability, internal modems,
 disk size.  if you could provide some prices too that would help.  i'm not
 informed enough on powerbooks to know how well they operate.  
 	i have been following the posts on some of the problems that have been
 encountered such as the trackball not working in the horizontal.
 	i would appreciate the list as well as any advice you may have.
 
 		thanks in advance.
