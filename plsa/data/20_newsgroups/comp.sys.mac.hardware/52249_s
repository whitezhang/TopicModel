   your source is wrong.  the double speed cd300 is still slow compared to a
 typical hard disk.  the lc can easily handle the scsi transfer rate of the
 cd300.  none of the current macs, even the quadras, support scsi-2 unless
 you get a scsi-2 nubus card.
 
   you don't have to have double speed to use photocd.  it's just faster
 reading images off of a disk.  i think that the cd150 can handle photocd,
 but only single session.  the cd300 can do multisession photocd.
