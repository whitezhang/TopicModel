 			  while there may not be a part number for the cd300i drive, i have seen
 a part number for the bezel kit (a new front panel with the slot in it
 through which you insert the cd). the document (which i got from the
 2/10/93 announcement at our apple office) states the drive kit and bezel
 kits are separate items and the bezel kit has an srp of $149 fro the c650.
 the external unit may be a better deal after all.
