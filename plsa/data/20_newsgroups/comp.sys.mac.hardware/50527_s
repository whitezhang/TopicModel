 
 well folks, after some thought the answer struck me flat in the face:
 
 "why would apple release a duo dock with a processor of its own?"
 
 here's why- people have hounded apple for a notebook with a 68040 processor
 in it. apple can't deliver that right now because the 040 saps too much
 power, radiates far too much heat, and is too large for a notebook. how
 does one get around that without designing a new chipset? use existing
 powerbook technology to your best advantage. the duo dock gives apple a
 unique ability to give users that 040 power in a "semi-portable" fashion.
 by plunking the 040 into the dock, you've got "quadra" power at your desk.
 on the road, that 33mhz 68030 should be able to handle most of your needs.
 okay, not the best solution, but its an answer to a no-win situation. :-)
 so, does this mean one will be able to use the powerbook's processor in
 parallel to the dock's processor? okay, we're getting really hypothetical
 now...
