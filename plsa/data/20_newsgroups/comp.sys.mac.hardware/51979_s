 i have a mac plus with 2.5mb ram. i have just bought an extra 2mb so that
 i can have the max 4mb ram that a plus supports. however, i can't get it
 to boot after i install the 2 extra simms. instead i get a sad mac (sorry,
 but i can't remember the code). looking at the motherboard, i can see
 that 2 resistors have been snipped off where it says "256kb path -
 1 row". i assume that was done when the first 1mb simms were added.
 
 so, my question is: are there any other resistors that need snipping? 
 				or, do i have bum simms which need to be exchanged?
 
 any and all advice will be appreciated.
