 i know that jet inc makes refills for the stylewriter and deskwriter
 ink jet cartridges in several colors....but are pre-filled cartridges
 in color available from anyone (or do i have to use-up one cartridge 
 before i have a chance to print in color?)
 
 also, are inks in process colors (cyan, magenta, yellow) available
 to refill cartridges?
 
 thanks in advance....
