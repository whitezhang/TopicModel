 i've had similar problems w/ other board types, and the problem is not a
 result of the 8/24gc board! try zapping the pram by holding down
 "command-option-p-r" durring startup! you will have to reset everything to
 your previous preferences (the date & time remain intact!), but the video
 board will start remembering it's previous settings!
