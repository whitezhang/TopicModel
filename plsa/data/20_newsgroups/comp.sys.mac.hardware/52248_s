 i'd like to install an apple (quantum) 40 mb hard drive taken from a iisi in an
 external powerdrive box from hard drives international that currenty has a dead
 conner mechanism in it. have you done this (or do you know how)? if so, could
 you please walk me through it, in as much detail as possible?
 
 please email me directly. if anyone else is interested in this, email me and
 i'll forward responses to you. if enough people want instructions, i'll post a
 summary within a week or so.
 
 thanks in advance,
