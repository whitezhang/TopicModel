 a friend of mine who owns a pc said that he recently got a program that can
 format a disk that can exceed the normal capacity of a hd disk. apparently it
 rewrites the driver or takes or the driver or _something_ that allows it get
 more space out of a normal hd floppy disk.  it supposedly gets upto 1.6 megs
 (so something like 1640k?). i don't have the program - since i can't use it
 and its supposed to be called something like "form16" or something like that.
 
 my question is whether its possible to do this on the mac and if its not
 possible is it due to hardware limitations. a developer friend of mine said
 that it might be possible but he doesn't deal with this aspect of the field
 much.
 
 thanks for any information contributed.
