 hi everyone. i recently posted about how i received a bad vram chip for my
 new lciii, and someone responded that it may not actually be bad, but it may
 be a 512k lc vram chip, and thus doesn't work properly with my computer. so
 i'm wondering if anyone can interpret these codes for me, so i can figure
 out what type of chip macconnection sent me.
 
 each chip says: m518121a-80j
 		 2515251
 
 on the back of the card, it says 0593
 
 i believe from the numbers that means it is an 80ns chip, but i can't figure
 out what the size is supposed to be. if anyone can help, i'd be grateful.
 please email me your response. thanks a lot!
