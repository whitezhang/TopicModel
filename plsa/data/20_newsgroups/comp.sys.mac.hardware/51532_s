 i've had a couple of e-mail responses from people who seem to believe that
 this sort of thing is not only unsupported, it is downright dangerous.
 
 i have heard of no such warnings from anybody at apple. just to be sure, i
 asked a couple of our technicians, one of whom has been servicing macs for
 years. there is *no* danger of damaging logic boards by plugging and unplugging
 adb devices with the power on.
 
 scsi, yes, adb, no...
