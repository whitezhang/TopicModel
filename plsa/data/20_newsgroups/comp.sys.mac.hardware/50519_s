 hi!
 
    i'm looking into buying a serial port switcher, because while my mac has
 two serial ports, i have appletalk, a modem, a printer, midi, and a sound
 digitizer.  (2 != 5, unfortunately.)
 
    specifically, i'm looking at the axion electronic switcher, because it
 seems to be fairly cheap.  (about $128 at maczone.)
 
    does anyone know anything about it?  i've heard that with most of these
 things you can still only use 2 serial ports at a time, it just prevents you
 from physically swapping cables.  although i've also heard that programs
 that use the comm toolbox may be able to use as many serial ports as they
 want; does anyone know if this is true with the axion switchbox?
 
    finally, if the axion stinks, or if you're using something else that you
 think is good, i'd be interested in hearing about other products.  i would
 like to spend under $140, if possible.
 
    please reply through mail; i'm not a regular reader of this newsgroup.
 if there's interest, i can post a summary of replies.
 
 thanks a lot!
