 just my luck.  i did however call my local apple dealer and he said that
 the he thinks the serial numbers of the machines that are covered begin
 with either 70 or 53-56, and maybe one other.  he also told me that apple
 had extended the service on these serial numbers for another year!!!  
 
 so there is still hope - get those monitor in!!
