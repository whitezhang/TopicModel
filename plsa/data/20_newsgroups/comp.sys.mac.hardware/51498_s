 
 i have a chance to buy a used ps/2 appletalk card to create a network with
 my home machines.  however, the guy who has the card tells me there's a
 db-9 or db-15 (can't remember now) on the back of the card, rather than
 the 8-pin (or 4-pin) mini-din that i expect.  this sounds more like a
 thicknet ethernet card.  should there be a transciever on it, like on the
 quadras?  what would be a reasonable price to expect to pay for one of
 these cards, keeping in mind that it's micro-channel architecture, which
 means take your best guess and double it.
 email replies would be appreciated, to here or to rrr@ideas.com
 thanks.
