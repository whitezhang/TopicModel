     mostly. the q950 does have a scsi2 controller chip as it's scsi
 chip, but it does not have the chips to use the wide or fast scsi-2
 modes and therefore doesn't offer much more in the way of scsi
 performance over the q900. it does, howrever, have a faster i/o
 controller than the q900; this is where the real speed boost comes from.
