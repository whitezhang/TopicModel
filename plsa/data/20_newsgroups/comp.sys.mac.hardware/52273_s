 nope.  i keep my mac running all the time since it also acts as a
 usenet node and exchanges mail and news every half hour (i run uaccess)
 and receives all my faxes.
 
 i do turn off the monitors hooked up to it.  they produce more heat
 than i want - it can be warm in my garage office in the summer.  i've
 got one of those handy power control centers ($25 at fry's) to i just
 flip the switch in front when i start or stop working.
 
 by the way, this strategy seems to be somewhat endorsed by apple since
 their new color classic will turn off its own monitor after a certain
 length of idle time.
