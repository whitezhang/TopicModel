 
 hi there,
 
 does anyone know why apple has an ambiguous message for
 c650 regarding fpu?  in all mac price lists i've seen, every c650
 has the message "fpu: optional".  i know from what we've discussed in this
 newsgroup that all c650 have the fpu built in except the 4/80
 configuration.  why would they be so unclear about this issue in their
 price list?
 i'm planning to buy the c650 8/230/cd pretty soon, but i'm now getting
 confused with whether it comes with fpu or not.
 why say "optional" if it's built in?
 please, anybody help me understand this game.
 
 regards,
 
 thian.
