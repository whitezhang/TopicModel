 is there a way to connect a powerbook 145, mac iisi, and personal laserwriter
 ls so that i can (not necessarily silmultaneoulsy) print from either the iisi,
 or pb, and file share between the iisi and pb?
 i know i can get the ($expensive$) lw nt upgrade for my ls, but i can't afford
 that...
  
 thanks, mark
