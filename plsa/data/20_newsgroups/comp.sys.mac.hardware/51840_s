 
 a question in general about displaying ntsc through a mac.
 
 if i understand correctly, the video spigot can display ntsc
 in a small window as well as capture the data in quicktime
 format.
 
 however, if i want to use a larger window, what are my options?
 perhaps i misunderstood the video spigot review...  
 
 also, i am not interested in quicktime.  i would merely like to
 use my mac as a television from time to time.  i have a nice
 sony 1430 monitor, and i would like to use it as a second tv
 when my wife is watching sitcoms on our regular tv.  
 
 perhaps some of the video cards for the mac accept ntsc input?
 i have a iisi, and i am willing to buy a nubus adapter.
 
 thanks in advance for any help,
