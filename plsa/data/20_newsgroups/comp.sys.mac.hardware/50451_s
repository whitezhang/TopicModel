 could someone please tell me what a 
 
 laserwriter iintx upgrade kit is.
 
 its a small box, which has a bag inn it , seemingly
 containing 6 chips (look like roms) and a iintx manual.
 the installation instructions are most informative and say, in full,
 "this product must be installed by an apple ........."
 
 so what does this do ? at first i thought it might be a nt to ntx
 upgrade, but i thought that required an entirely new board.
 
 any info appreciated.
 
 doug.
