 the quadralink by ae is a possibly problematical solution to your needs.
 i've used one for the last 4 (?) years on my personal system, but a fatal
 bug has crept into their more recent s/w. the bug only shows up during
 heavy serial traffic but completely crashes the system (macsbug can not
 reboot, time to hit the restart button).
 
 ae told me in january that they were aware of and working on fixing the bug
 which i described to them. since then they have not answered any of my
 faxes asking them for a status of the bug-fix.
 
 the ql has been great, but for now i have mine sidelined. if you are only
 going to be using 2400 baud or less, then you may have no, or very
 infrequent problems,
