 yea, thanks to lots of good information in this newsgroup, i was prepared
 for lots of details (even shipping time ... got my c610 8/230/cd in 5 weeks).
 i guess my biggest disappointment is the lack of detail in the written
 specs and documentation.  the case load spec is an example -- the setup
 section says apple 14" and 16" monitors can go on top, but 21" and other
 big ones can't.  why couldn't they publish a maximum load?
 
 now if i can figure out if there's any hope using the "partition" button
 on the hard disk setup utility (do i dare just try it and see what happens?),
 then maybe i can divide up the wealth among the family members a bit more
 securly.  the "getting more information" section of the manual suggested
 trying other avenues before calling apple, but didn't mention the net.
