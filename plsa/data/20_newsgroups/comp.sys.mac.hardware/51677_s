 on a serious note, i have heard the tales about syquest failures.  but i
 am curious about jon's comments on cartridge wear for the the bernoullis.
 can someone elaborate?  is there a general consensus that the 128m opticals
 are the most reliable?  i am mostly concerned about media failures, as
 opposed to drive mechanism failures.
