 add me to the list of bugged 230 owners.
 
 i had a bunch of problems regarding sleep/wakeup/restart with the 230 when
 i first got it, both with and without the techworks ram.  finally it "died",
 wouldn't start, until i  opened the docking door (which snaps open) and 
 the machine came up fine, but with the clock a few decades off.  apple 
 replaced the processor board.
 
 now,
   twice the machine has frozen (no mouse action)
   twice the machine has refused to wake up.  acutally, the backlighting
     came on, and the disk spins when the power adaptor is plugged in
     (but not with a good battery).
     the first time this happened removing both power adaptor and battery
       for ~1 minute brought the machine back.
     the second time this happened the machine wouldn't wake up until
       powered down for about 30 minutes.  the screen had what looked
       like red horizontal lines accross it.
     both timse the file "fax modem preferences" has been corrupted
       according to disinfectent).
 
 i have removed all the fax and modem software, and the third party memory,
 and am waiting to see if it happens again.
 
 forrest
