 i can only comment on thermal recalibration in general. some new
 drives perform it in order to increase overall integrity of data
 writes. basically, the firmware instructs the actuator to perform
 a test to see if the data tracks are within a certain physical
 tolerance, since when the media heats up or cools down, *some*
 track drift is inevitable, and the drive has to monitor it. this
 becomes especially critical at very high recording densities, and
 so was used primarily on very large-capacity mechanisms, but it
 seems to be finding its way into more smaller drives as a way of
 boosting the drive's long-term reliability and mtbf ratings.
 
 i first became aware of thermal recalibration when it was pointed
 out that the technique conflicts with prolonged write times when
 digitizing, say, audio or video to hard disk. some manufacturers
 explicitly state that drives with thermal recalibration are not
 to be used for applications that have prolonged disk writes.
 
 hope this helps.
