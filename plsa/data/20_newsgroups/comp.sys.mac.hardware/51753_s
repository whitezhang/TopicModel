 
 first of all:  thank you everyone who replied.  as you can well
 imagine, i got nearly one hundred responses, so i figured i'd thank
 you all here instead of individually.
 
 the tallies:
 
 i got one vote for a/ux, which runs on the macintosh.
 
 i got several nays for commodore's 3000ux system.
 
 most people agreed that sgi's were nice, and very very expensive.
 
 some (devoted) sun users nearly insisted that i try to find a used
 sun, say a 3/60 or 3/80.
 
 about a dozen people told me how they love their next...only now next
 is out of the hardware business (see below).
 
 and most of the other 85+ people said:  get a 486 box, and run some
 version of unix that's available either in the public domain or
 commercially.
 
 =============
 
 and so i weighed my options.  what stood out, in my opinion, was that
 there were several different versions of unix available on one system:
 the 486 (pc) architecture.  if i bought a sun, i'd have to use sunos.
 if i bought a (used) next, i'd have to use nextstep (see below).  ad
 nauseum.
 
 but with a pc, i can run linux, which is a small user-friendly (?)
 flavor that uses shared libraries to cut down on volume, although i
 hear its networking abilities aren't up to speed with 386bsd, another
 pd (==free) port (which takes up a lot more space).  i can purchase
 bsd386 (commercial product) if i choose.  there are several other
 commercial packages available.
 
 so, what i've found out (after pricing systems, etc.), is that i can
 get a really good unix workstation for as little as ~$2500.  including
 source code!
 
 or, for ~$3500-4000, i can get an unbelievable eisa bus 486-66dx2
 system, fully blown, and run single user bsd386.
 
 what i'm really excited about, though, is nextstep for intel.  next
 changed into a software company only, and they are releasing their os
 for pc's.  i've used next's before, and i absolutely loved them.
 everyone who wrote me about next (or nextstep) commented on the
 developer's environment, and how well designed the whole package is.
 
 ===========
 
 so, my choice is to:
 
 1)  wait for the mail on monday, so i can read what nextstep's system
 requirements are
 
 2)  if i'm wowed on what they say, i'll buy a system that fits into
 their criteria
 
     2a)  get nextstep
 
 3)  if i'm wowed, but i can't afford it yet (most likely), i'll buy a
 system that fits their criteria
 
     3a)  get linux or 386bsd, as a temporary learning experience so i
 can save up for nextstep
 
 4)  if i'm not sufficiently wowed (least likely), i'll buy a system
 that is slightly less blown out (like a 486dx 25, isa) and put linux
 or 386bsd on it.
 
 ================
 
 again, thanks to everyone around the net.
