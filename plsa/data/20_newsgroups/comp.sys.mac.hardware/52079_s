 has anyone else gotten a system error when trying to print from mathematica 2.1
 to the hp deskwriter. i'm using a pb170 with:	8 megs ram
 						sys 7.0.1 + tuneup
 						hp print drivers etc....
 
 it works find on an imagewriter i. i'd like to get as much information as
 possible before i send a bug report to wolfram.
 
 thanks.
