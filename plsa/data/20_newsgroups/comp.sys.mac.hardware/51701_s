 i've been looking into getting a portable mac to do some work and i've
 had my eye on the pb 100. lately, i've been seeing people with the old
 portables, and they're selling for $300 less that the pb 100s. what i
 want to know is: what are the differences between them? all i know is
 that the portable is heavier, but the pb100 doesn't have an internal
 drive. here's what i need to know:
 
 does the portable support appletalk/network connections?
 what's the cpu inside a portable? (68000?)
 does the portable support system 7?????????
 what's the maximum memory capacity of the portable? can you still get
 	ram (meaning: does it use special simms?)
 what kind of internal hd does it use?
 does the portable have a better screen?
 
 						thanx in advance.
