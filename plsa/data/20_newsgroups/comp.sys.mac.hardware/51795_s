 
 i have finally decided to update my se :-)).
 i am planning on buying a centris 610-8/230 cd.
 now, what monitor should i get? here are a few
 guidelines:
 	my wife uses pagemaker occasionally, i use excel sometimes
 	and i do alot of telecommuting from home to work. we both
 	do word processing. greater than 14 inches.
 
 i have looked at the radius color pivot. this can be bought for
 under $1000. i have heard good things about the e-machines t-16,
 the older model not the new t-16 ii. how about the super mac 17t?
 these both can be had for a little over $1000. any others??
