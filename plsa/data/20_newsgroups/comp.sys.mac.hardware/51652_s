   actually, an accelerator such as the daystar 33 mhz 68040 is cheaper than
 upgrading to a q700 (25 mhz).  the accelerator costs about $1400 whereas
 the upgrade costs $2131 (just quoted from my dealer).  however the q700
 upgrade gives you very fast built in video that supports monitors up to 21"
 with 8 bit depth and up to 16" at 24 bit depth (with additional vram).  it
 also has a scsi port capable of a much faster throughput than the ci, which
 makes a big difference if you have a fast hard drive.
 
   if the improved video and scsi features are important to you, you're
 better off getting the q700 upgrade, otherwise save some money and get an
 accelerator.
