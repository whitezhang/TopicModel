 
 hi folks
 
 i'm planning to buy a lciii but need advice on choosing a monitor.
 what do people recommend for a decent 14"/15" monitor?  
 
 i'v looked at some ads and the spec for nec 4fg/4fge and the price is 
 within my budget, but could lciii be able to use the various resolutions 
 available on 4fg (specifically the 1024x768 resolution)? does lciii only 
 support one resolution?
 
 also any recommendations for a reliable mail order place for lciii or
 monitors? does anyone have experience with the following mail-order places?
 
 	syex express 	(houston, tx)
 	usa flex 	(bloomingdale, il)
 
 thanks,
 
 jeff
