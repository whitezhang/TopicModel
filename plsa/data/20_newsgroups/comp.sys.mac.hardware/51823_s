     apple has really confused people with this whole thing. i think
 we'll be answering this question for about the next year or so. there is
 no "option" to get an fpu on a c650. what you have is a choice of cpus:
 there is the 68lc040 that does not have an integrated fpu like the full
 '040 and is only present in the base 4/80 model of the c650 (appleusa).
 and there is the full '040 which you get when you order anything other
 than the base 4/80 configuration. therefore, since you have ordered one
 of the 8mb versions with on-board ethernet models you will not be
 getting the lc040. but even if you wanted to have the lc040 you wouldn't
 be able to order a c650 with 8mb ram, on-board ethernet and an lc040.
 it's not an "option."
     also, a note to people out there that have 4/80 c650s and c610s
 thinking that there is an optional fpu, the '040 class chip cannot
 recognize an external fpu, so there is no socket on the motherboard for
 a fpu chip and you cannot go out and purchase an fpu on a pds card or
 something like that. the only way to get an fpu in these machines is to
 replace the lc040 with a full '040. and if you have a c610, you will not
 need to worry about a heat sink if you do replace the lc040 with the
 full '040, but if you have a 4/80 c650 you do need to have a heat sink.
