 
    i seem to be having some trouble with this...
 
    i can get the mac to go to sleep, but i can't make seem to 
 make it wake up with setwutime().  i am aware of the error in
 the header files and im vi.  i am setting the wu time to be
 about two minutes, then putting the mac to sleep, but it doesn't
 wakeup at the appointed time....
 
    does it require a call to systemtask in order to make sure that
 everything is setup?
