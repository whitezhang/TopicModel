 	i remember running across an ad in the back of mac[user|world]
 a few years ago, for a nubus board that had umpteen simm slots, to be
 used to "recycle your old simms," when you upgraded memory.  i don't
 remember who made this board, and i haven't seen it advertised in
 any of the latest mac magazines.  it mentioned that it included software
 to make the simms on the board act like a ram disk. as someone who has simms 
 he can't get rid of/use, but hates the waste, this sounds to me like a majorly
 good idea.  does anyone out there know what board/company i'm talking about?  
 are they still in business, or does anyone know where i can get a used one
 if they are no longer made?  any help would be greatly appreciated.  please
 e-mail me, to save net.bandwidth.
 
 
 	thanks,
 
 	cap.
