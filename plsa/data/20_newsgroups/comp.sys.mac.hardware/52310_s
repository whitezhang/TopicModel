 i am using a nec 4fg with my centris 610. the cable adapter was provided by
 nec (you have to call to get this free adapter). i am also sharing it with my
 486 (using a switch box and extra cables).
 
 my questions: 
 
 	how do you tell if it is 600x400 or 800x600 that was displayed?
 	or how do you change the mode(resolution)? 
 	is there sw for this or something i have to do with the hw?
 
 i am assuming i am getting 800x600 since i have 1m vram and the 4fg can display
 1028x768(?) with my 486.
