 
 here's another question by a hesitant powerbook purchaser.
 i want to be able to run mathematica and would like to hear some comments  
 from the gallery about this. how much slower does the program run on a  
 machine without an fpu (namely a pb160) versus a machine with an fpu  
 (namely a pb170).  what types of calculations get bogged down the most. i  
 primarily due moderately simple algebra, integrals which can be dealt with  
 analytically and plotting including 3-d plots. i don't do a lot of  
 numerical work. would a pb160 with a lot of memory ( and the very nice  
 video port ) be sufficient or should i really try to get an fpu for this  
 type of work? is a pb170 with 8mb faster than a pb160 with 12 or 16mb.
 all comments appreciated.
