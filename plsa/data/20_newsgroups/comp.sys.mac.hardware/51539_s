 of course it was in dale's post, just not in the words that macuser 
 used.  rom accelerated video just means that some quickdraw commands
 has been rewritten (inside the rom) to take advantage of the 68040
 addressing modes.  commands that do fills should be slightly faster
 since the new instructions fetch 2 bytes at a time versus one.
