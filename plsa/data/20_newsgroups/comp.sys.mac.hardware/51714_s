 i have a laserwriter iig that has disappeared completely from the
 network, i.e. it's name doesn't show up in any zone.  (you can print
 to it from it's serial interface, tho!)  i have seen some discussion
 here about changing the zone a iig is in... including some ps code
 that lets you change the zone.  is there maybe some ps code you can
 use to have it go back to all its factory default settings?  i have
 a feeling that's what needed to heal ours.
