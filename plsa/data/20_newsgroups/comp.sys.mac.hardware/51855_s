 the problem is this:
 after starting up my machine it gives a high pitched sound once at the desktop also it only does it when the mouse is up or a menu is not showing.
 
 as if i click the mouse the noise goes away for the amount of time the mouse is down. also this problem only happens for about 5-10 minutes.
 
 please let me know if you know what this is, it sounds like it is coming form the power supply.
 please post here and email me:

 thanks!
