 ok, i have a question... why?  why do people copy the article, and the 
 only new thing they add to the post is there name?  i'm not picking on 
 this person, i've seen a few of these.  is it just a mistake?  am i 
 missing something?  is it some unknown net-equette i missed somewhere?
 i skip over all the quoted material, since i've already read it, and look 
 for the non-quoted material, and all i get is the name addition.  is this 
 supposed to me "i agree", or "i second this" or what?
 
 sorry...
 
 just wondering if i missed something somewhere along the line...
