 i'd appreciate it greatly if someone could e-mail me the following:
 (if you only know one, that's fine)
 1) specs for the 68040 (esp. how it compares to the pentium)
 2) specs for the 68060 with estimated cost, release date, etc...
 
 i'm interested in speeds, systems it can run (windows nt, risc, or whatever),
 costs, bus info, register info.  all the technical info.
 
 i am hoping that the 68040 can win yet another battle against the intel people.
  
 :)  thanks for any info you can give.
 
 thanks.
