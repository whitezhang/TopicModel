 benchmarks are for marketing dweebs and cpu envy.  ok, if it will make
 you happy, the 486 is faster than the 040.  bfd.  both architectures
 are nearing then end of their lifetimes.  and especially with the x86
 architecture: good riddance.

 the point being the processor speed is only one of many aspects of a
 computers performance.  clock speed, processor, memory speed, cpu
 architecture, i/o systems, even the application program all contribute 
 to the overall system performance.

 look them up yourself.
