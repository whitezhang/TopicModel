 
 	i just bought a select 300 and rushed home to print 
 some grayscale pictures for my kids, when i discovered that
 grayscale(and photograde) are not available if you are
 using an se...even if you are running with an '030 cpu.
 you won't see this in the printer's docs, and the apple
 rep didn't mention it to our users group either. it seems
 that se roms won't support those "features". okay, i 
 guess i should have somehow known that this was the case.
 let the buyer beware, huh apple?
 	be that as it may, i have been thinking about the 
 problem and i'm puzzled. why  can't a defencieny in the 
 rom be made up for in software. i write software for a living
 (on unix platforms) and i don't understand the "it just
 can't be done" responses i've gotten from those i have
 asked so far.  isn't mode32, or somesuch piece of  soft-
 ware, just such a fix. 
 	anyway, i was hoping someone knowledgeable
 about mac internals could set me straight: is it simply
 impossible for a mac se to print grayscale, or could
 someone armed with enough info and a little pro-
 gramming experience cook something up that would
 supplement the rom's capabilities?
 	also, how does one know if one's mac can
 support the grayscale and photograde that the select 300
 is supposedly capable of? ( short of buying the printer
 and trying it out like i did)
 	thanks for your help.
