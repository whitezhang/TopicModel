  
 1)    i have an old jasmine drive which i cannot use with my new system.
  my understanding is that i have to upsate the driver with a more modern
 one in order to gain compatability with system 7.0.1.  does anyone know
 of an inexpensive program to do this?  ( i have seen formatters for <$20
 buit have no idea if they will work)
  
 2)     i have another ancient device, this one a tape drive for which
 the back utility freezes the system if i try to use it.  the drive is a
 jasmine direct tape (bought used for $150 w/ 6 tapes, techmar
 mechanism).  essentially i have the same question as above, anyone know
 of an inexpensive beckup utility i can use with system 7.0.1
  
 all help and advice appriciated.
