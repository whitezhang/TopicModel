 you should be able to pick up an adb cable at any computer wiring store...
 i'd give you the address of alberta computer cable in calgary, but a: i'm
 in victoria (b.c., canada) and b: i don't think an address in calgary would
 help you too much....basically however i just phoned them up, and they
 charged me approx. $15 cnd for a custom made adb extension cable for my mouse.
 
 hope this helps...
