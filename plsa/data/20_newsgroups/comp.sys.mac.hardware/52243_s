 
 a rep at the dealer (actually it's a university order center, so
 they don't have any immediate financial interest), told me that
 they have been having lots of problems with their centris 610.
 he didn't go into details, but mentioned problems with the
 floppy drive and intermittent problems with printing files.
 it sounded to me like they were having both hardware problems
 and software compatibility problems with the machine.
 
 he's not recommending the centris 610 to anybody; he says to
 consider a centris 650 or a iivx. (why he would recommend a
 iivx over an lciii i don't know, but that's what he said.)
 
 so, what does the net think? did the dealer just get one flaky
 machine, or did apple send the c610 out the door too early?
 is your c610 working just great, or is it buggy too?
