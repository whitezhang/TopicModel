 why would you dispose a channel if you are going to play more
 sounds soon? if you are trying to write a game, you shouldn't
 be using sndplay. instead, make a channel and use buffercmds
 to play sounds on it. it works great. you can add callbacks to
 the channel also to let you know when the channel is getting
 empty. before it gets empty.

 callbacks are very reliable, i found them 100% reliable, even
 under system 4.1. i was doing continuous background sound with
 interrupting sound effects on system 6.0 with the im-v
 documentation.
 
 you probably were cancelling your callback commands out of
 your channels, of course you didn't get called. in general, if
 you have problems with sounds working when you play one per
 channel and then close the channel (with the related
 slowdown), but then when you play more than one you don't
 work, then you are adding more than one synthesizer to a
 channel, possibly the same one multiple times. this might be
 because you are calling sndplay on a preexisting channel with
 a sound resource which adds the sampled sound synthesizer to
 the channel first thing before it plays. most sampled sounds
 have this command at the start of them. you need to resedit
 the sound and remove that command, then when you create your
 channel, specify the sampled sound synthesizer to be the
 channel's synth. then you can use asynch sndplay's all you
 want. you'll probably want to switch to buffercmd's, since you
 are going to have to use snddocommand anyway to add callbacks.
 
 now before you go ahead and tell me i am full of it, and the
 sound manager doesn't work for games, remember, spectre uses
 it. and it works great. if spectre can spare the cpu time, you
 can too.
 
 one little disclaimer: there are some out there who say the
 sound manager in the iisi can't be made to work right. i'm not
 sure either way, but i know for sure that you can make your
 sounds work 100% correctly on every other machine using the
 sound manager.
