 for the most part, this is a bunch of bunk.  i've got a computer engineering
 degree, yet i've spent the last 7 years writing software that people actually
 use.  moreover, the salary distinctions are incorrect; i received 3 job offers
 upon graduation; the two jobs that actually used my hardware experience were
 $7000/year lower!  my advice is to decide which classes and projects most
 interest you, and pick the major that allows you to take them.
