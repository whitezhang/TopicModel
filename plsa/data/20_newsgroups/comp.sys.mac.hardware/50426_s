 we're all set to buy one of these for the office, to use for scanning in
 color photographs and for optical character recognition.  we've played with
 the original grayscale onescanner and were very pleased.  is the color model
 comparable in quality?
 
 also, what brand of ocr software would you recommend?  we're leaning toward
 caere omnipage.  any better ideas?  thanks.
