 the toshiba has a 200ms access time, the nec has a 280ms access
 time, right around the sony/apple. access time is, of course,
 somewhat important, but not as vital in the case of cds as data
 transfer rate.
 
 all the drives are double-speed drives with maximum data transfer
 rates of 300k/second. any is a good choice. apple's is very cheap
 when included with new macs and i agree with christian's comment
 about drivers.
 
 plus, apple's is bootable on the centris and quadra 800. a very nice
 feature if you need to install system software. i don't know if the
 nec or toshiba are bootable on those machines.
