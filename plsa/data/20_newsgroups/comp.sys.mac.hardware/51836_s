 the cd300 (external) is already shipping and has been shipping for quite awhile  
 now.  demand for the units are high, so they are pretty rare.  i've seen them  
 listed for around $525-550 at local computer stores and the campus mac  
 reseller.  i've also heard rumors that they are bundled with a couple of cd's,  
 but i can't confirm it.
