 hello forrest:
 
 i noticed your recent posting regarding crashes of the duo 230.  at the
 present i own a pb100 and a iisi.  i had been contemplating selling both and
 geting a 230.  based upon your experiences would you make that
 recommendation?
 
 this is the first time i had heard of any problems with the duo.  is this the
 norm.  have you been able to work around the problems?
 
 thanks for responding!
