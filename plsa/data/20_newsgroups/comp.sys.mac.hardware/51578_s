 here's a good one: does anyone know of a product that allows
 me to rack mount my 2ci (or maybe 650 if i blow some more
 money...) ??? my application is music, and would like to be
 able to haul it around (would probably plan to get an mo drive
 or something so i don't have to depend on an internal fixed
 hard drive - i.e., may be pretty rough on an internal hd...)
 
 i'm in the san francisco bay area, if that matters.
 also, anyone have any info on 650's and midi? and, would anyone
 care to email me with the price they paid for their 650? or if
 there's a price list faq, never mind... just curious about the
 difference between the best retailers and the local university
 pricing...
 
 thanks, jeff adams
