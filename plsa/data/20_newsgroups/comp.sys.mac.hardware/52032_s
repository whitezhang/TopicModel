 i recall that ehman 'died'...
 
 can anyone suggest what the problem is when the picture jumps
 about an inch any direction?
 
 two page monchrome monitor connected to newlife accelerator and 
 video board in an se... at the end of the work day, several hours
 with power on, the picture will occasionally jitter a couple of times
 and then remain calm for a few minutes. then it does more shaking...
 
 the environment around the computer appears to be stable. nothing
 newly introduced near the computer. 
 
 any ideas? please e-mail to carsona@sfu.ca or reply here.
 
 also... has anyone used ehman two page with powerbook video? what
 was required? just a cable adapter?
 
 thanks for any help!
