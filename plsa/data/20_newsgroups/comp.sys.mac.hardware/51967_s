 the supplemental manual that comes with the quadra 800 explains it. i
 don't have the manual in front of me, but as i recall, you insert the cd
 while the machine is running, select restart from the special menu, and
 then hold down a special sequence of keys to force it to boot from the cd
 instead of the hard disk. i think the key combination is
 command-option-delete or command-ctrl-del.
