 a/rose = apple real time operating system environment
 
 this is a system extension for these nubus cards using the 
 mcp (= macintosh coprocessor platform). the mcp-cards are nubus cards with a
 motorola 68000-processor and 512 kb ram (expandable to 1 meg).
 mcp is a development platform for hardware-designers so they can use a card
 with an own processor and thus the main processor isn't needed for these cards.
 currently the only cards i know are
 
 - the apple tokenring-card
 - the new apple ethernet-card
 - the apple nubus serial card
 
 perhaps there are some third-party-cards, but i don't know.
