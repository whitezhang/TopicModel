 i have used both my serial ports with a modem and a serial printer, 
 so i cannot use appletalk.  is there a ethernet to localtalk hardware
 that will let me use the ethernet port on my q700 as a localtalk 
 port.  until they come out with
 satellite dishes that sit on your window & give you internet access
 from your home, i won't at all be using that port.
