 alain:
 get your facts straight before you post something like this.  the duo
 dock does not have a cpu of its own.  it is a docking station with 
 ports connecting various components, including the portable powerbook
 with its own cpu.  i guess these rumored new duo docks have a built-in
 cpu to perform functions of their own.  interesting!  if they're not
 compatible with the current duo models, i think you'll be hearing a
 lot more "screwed by apple" complaints.  imagine a company obsoleting
 (ooh, a new verb!) a virtually brand new computer... sheesh...
