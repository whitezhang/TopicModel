 
 hi.  i think i have a problem with the stereo sound output on my quadra
 900, but i am not totally sure because my roomate has the same problem
 on his powerbook 170.  any info or experience anyopne has would be
 greatly appreciated.
 
 when i hook my quadra up to my home stereo system, the following types
 of sounds (mono, as far as i can tell) all play fine through both
 speakers:
 
 system beeps  (already provided ones such as indigo and ones i record)
 
 armor alley
 spectre
 spaceward ho!
 
 
 but, the following games only play out of the left channel:
 
 lemmings
 out of this world  (awesome game, btw)
 glider 4.0
 oids
 
 
 but still, stereo system beeps do play in stereo, through both speakers.
 (the one i'm specifically referrring to is apocolyptic beginning, which
 my roommate downloaded from some ftp site (sumex?))
 
 
 all of the symptoms are the same on my rommates 170 (he can't run
 ootw because he doesn't have color).
 
 we're both running system 7.1
 
 
 
 does anyone with lemmings or the other three games i mentioned above get
 sound out of both speakers on a mac ii class, quadra, lc, powerbook 140 or
 greater, centris, se/30, etc... (stereo) machine?
 
 i used to have a mac ii, and i sort of rememeber lemmings playing in
 stereo on that machine, not just on the left channel.  (i could be
 mistaken, though.  if there were a problem with the quad 900's and pb
 170's, i am wondering why the system beeps still play in stereo?  if there
 isn't a problem with our machines, i wonder why the 4 games above are
 apparantly written to support only one channel of stereo when they
 could just use mono sounds so the mono sound would at least come out of
 both speakers  (like spectre, etc. do)?
 
 quadra 900's and powerbook 170's have the same roms (to my knowledge),
 so maybe this is a rom problem?  (if so, though, why wouldn't system 7.1
 patch over this problem?)
 
 
 
 
 thanks for any help you can provide!
