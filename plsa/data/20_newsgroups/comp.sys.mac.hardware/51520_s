 hi there,
 	i am trying to find out a reliable power center, it is basically
 a surge protector that sits below the monitor and has individual control
 for each outlet. some people have an opinion that none of them work well.
 the ones that i could locate in microcenter catalogue were:
 
 tripp lite's isobar command console ($79)
 
 proxima power director (89.95)
 
 kensington masterpiece plus (109.95)
 
 has anyone used one of these? could you please send me your feedback
 on these?
 
 thanks
