 	performa 200 == classic ii
 	performa 400 == lc ii
 	performa 4xx == lc iii
 	performa 600 == well, nothing :)
 
 	the performas are made to be low-cost business solutions.  the 4xx have
 bundled software, modems, etc.
 	because they have no "retail price" you might be able to get a steeper
 discount on them.  shop around.
 
 	as far as the monitors go, buy 3rd party.  much cheaper.
