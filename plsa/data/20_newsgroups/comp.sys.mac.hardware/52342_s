         interesting, as i think computer technology is now
 becomming widespread enough now that it is no longer a position
 which must require a degree.  i know of several people i work
 with that make just as much as i do and they don't even have
 a bs degree in comp sci. yet they make 28+ a year.  they also
 didn't have to pay 30 grand to thier local university either. :(
        i think computer programming is being reduced to a trade
 practice, than a truly specialty field.  it will be even more
 so in the future.
        if your interested in cutting edge type of stuff and you
 choose cs as i did, i suggest checking out the emerging field
 of software engineering.  the difficulties for example of designing
 scaleable design environments for individuals so that a single person
 can handle 100,000 to 1,000,000 million lines of code all by himself
 in a reasonable manner and then incorporate that into a teamwork enviroment
 is truly a gigantic problem...not going to be solved any time soon
 unfortunately...but hey you could be the person that provides
 the missing key for some good groundwork!

 well, if your like the poor slobs in the world..like me, you are
 in no financial position to continue graduate work right out
 of a top 10 comp sci school.
 
 the trick is, to find some generous inc you work for to pay for the
 rest of your education...trust me its the best way to go..even
 if you don't get a top salary.  which i have always been a poor
 slob throughout school but if you follow this rule: book=salary=food&shelter
 you should always have a computer and you won't go hungry.
 
 what else could a man want?!
