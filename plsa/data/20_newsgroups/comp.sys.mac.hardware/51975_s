 hi,
 
 could some kind soul please e-mail me a copy of the pinout for the serial
 connector on an imagewriter ii printer?  we have one that we'd like to hook
 up to a pc, and it seems that nobody sells the proper cables anymore.  no
 problem -- i can make one, but i need to know the pinout first.
 
 thanks in advance.
