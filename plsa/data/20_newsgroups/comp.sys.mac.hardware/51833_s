 the problem mentioned last is a known quadra scsi problem, it was heavily
 discussed last year and an apple employee pointed out that there was a
 one byte error in the scsi driver routine for the quadra's (at least the
 700
 and 900).  system 7.1 should not have that problem, for most people the 
 solution was to get an updated driver from the drive manufactor.  in my
 case mass microsystems wrote a new driver which fixed the problem on my
 quadra
 700, all that occured early last year.
