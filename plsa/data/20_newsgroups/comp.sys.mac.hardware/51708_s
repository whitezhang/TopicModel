 060 fastest, then pentium, with the first versions of the powerpc
 somewhere in the vicinity.

 no.  computer speed is only partly dependent of processor/clock speed.
 memory system speed play a large role as does video system speed and
 i/o speed.  as processor clock rates go up, the speed of the memory
 system becomes the greatest factor in the overall system speed.  if
 you have a 50mhz processor, it can be reading another word from memory
 every 20ns.  sure, you can put all 20ns memory in your computer, but
 it will cost 10 times as much as the slower 80ns simms.
 
 and roughly, the 68040 is twice as fast at a given clock
 speed as is the 68030.
