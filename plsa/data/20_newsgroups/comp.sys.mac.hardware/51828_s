 i would really like to get one of the new cd300i cdrom
 drives for my c650, but my local apple doesn't know 
 when they will be available.  he doesn't even have a part
 number yet.   does anyone know what the part number 
 for this drive is and when it will be available?
 
 my apple dealer suggested i buy one of the cd300 external
 drives, but i don't want to pay extra for a case/power supply
 i'm not going to use.
