 i don't know how to say it best but you are gaurenteed that the
 price of the c650 is going to drop this year.  this week's macweek
 reports that apple is probably planning a drop in august.  my guess
 is that it may come sooner if apple decides to  change the price
 structure upon release of the multimedia units this summer.
 
 your price looks pretty good at about $50 more then i payed for
 mine last month.  i would have rather waited for one of the new
 machines this sommer (like the cyclone) but the resale value of my
 iici would have not been squat by then.  thus, financing forced me
 to purchase now.  i'm happy with the machine and won't feel
 betrayed at all when apple cuts the price to less then $1000 next
 week (heh).
 
 bottome line:  if the c650 does what you want, buy it.  if you wait
 until the cylcones come out for a price break then you might as
 well wait for the powerpcs to come out for another price break and
 then the units which follow them.  you may save some money but
 you've lost a lot of time when you could have been using the
 computer.  face it, apple's prices are going to be in a continuous
 state of flux.  at least they aren't going to try raising them
 again (grin).
