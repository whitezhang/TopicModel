 i think the original poster meant opening the mouse, not just
 releasing the ball and getting to the rollers. i found that on the
 original adb mouse, sometimes unscrewing the two halves allowed for
 easier cleaning.
 
 if the original poster has his answer, i'll ask: how do you open the
 new ergonomic mouse? by open, i mean split the two halves to get at
 the guts. it isn't obvious to me based on the 5 minute look i spent
 with one at the office yesterday as there are no visible screw
 heads.
