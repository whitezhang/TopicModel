 i have a question for y'all:
 
 i'm looking at an ad for the new 3.5" fast scsi-2 drives from micropolis
 in the june, 1993, macworld. (i have seen similar ads for the ide versions
 in ibm pc magazines)
 
 well, the ad says that all three drives have a fast scsi-2 interface,
 but then it says that the dtr rate for each drive is 5 megabytes/second,
 *max*.
 
 how can this be?  i thought that if a drive was to be fast scsi-2 it
 had to have a dtr of 10megs a second?
 
 (i am assuming the 5megs/sec claim by micropolis is from the 512k cache.
 i admit that i would be very impressed if the drive can *read/write* data
 at 5megs a second!)
 
 thank you.
