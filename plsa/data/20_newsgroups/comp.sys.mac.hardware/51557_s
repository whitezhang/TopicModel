 i just recently purchased the gcc blp elite and i really like it.  my
 needs
 are much the same as what you describe.  in addition, i wanted to get one
 that
 i could access via appletalk, so that eliminated the new line of
 inexpensive 
 printers from apple.  the print quality is good to excellent based on
 what 
 font you're using and what paper you use.  i'm still experimenting with 
 different papers, but a medium grade laser printer paper seems to work
 fine.
 
 printing envelopes, transpariencies, letter head, or other single feed
 jobs is
 very easy.  there is an adjustable, automatic centering, guide on top of
 the
 sheet feeder which aligns the paper properly (and doesn't feed a sheet
 from
 the sheet feeder, as some do).
 
 (i have no affiliation with gcc, just a satisfied customer.)
