    huh?  where did you get this idea from?  i think you got this
 backwards.  the duo's memory is faster than its equivalent desktop
 machine by 5-10% (and the rest of the powerboks). i think the
 explanation for this was that it can refresh faster (in 2 instead of 5
 cycles i believe).  things that could affect performance would be
 factors such as use of functions enhanced in the fpu (which the duo
 doesn't have undocked).  extensions and background applications can
 slow your computer down too.  real life differences in speed are likely
 to be influence by the software you are running, what kind of screen
 depth you are running etc.

 ps!  the duo is 32-bit through-out.
