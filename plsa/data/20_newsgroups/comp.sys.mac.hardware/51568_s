 hi,
 
 i'm in the market for an internal color video adaptor for my pb 145.  i
 was wondering if anyone has used the powervision adaptor made by
 mirror.  if so, can you tell me how feel about the speed and
 compatability of it?  i might also be interested in other boards by
 envisio etc., so if you have such a board please e-mail your opinion of
 it.  thanks in advance.
 
 john
