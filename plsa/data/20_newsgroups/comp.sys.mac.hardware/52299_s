 in the last two weeks i have the following problem on two 160's
 
 1 has a 8mb simm and the other a 6 mb simm
 both are about 2 -3 months old, bought from different vendors and installed
 by different people. 
 
 both computers begin crashing frequently, locking up and ultimately the
 memory chimes.  crashes would almost always occur if you moved the screen
 and sometimes would occur when you weren't even touching the computer.  in
 both cases, taking the machine apart, taking the memory out and putting it
 back in solved the problem for awhile but then it would comeback,  my
 marginally educated guess as to what's happening is that larger simms are
 "lopsided" in that the insertion point is sort of a pivot point and after
 time they begin to move about - possible because of pressure on the
 keyboard or something?  
 
 anyway, has anyone else had such a problem or solution - if somehow you
 could support the other end of the simm to prevent it from moving.
 
 i've had no problem for the past 3 weeks by replacing my 8mb simm with a
 2mbsimm -although this is not desireble solution.
 
 please email any resp - and/or post if usefull to the rest of the world.
