 	i planning to upgrade my mac iisi:
 
 		(1) from the present 5megs to 17megs;
 	and	(2) add a math-coprocessor.
 
 	technology works, of austin (texas) comes quite highly recommended by 
 some mac magazines.  i was just wonderring if anyone could share with me 
 anything about tech works (both good and bad experiences); or give any advice
 about other mail-order companies that i may consider.
 
 	your reply would be very much appreciated.  thanks in advance.
 
 sincerely
