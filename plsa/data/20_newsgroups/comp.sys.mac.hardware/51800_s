 i would like more info on this if anybody has it. our exabyte
 8500 tapedrive has never been working from the quadra 950.
 we have been trying it since september 1992, replaced cabling,
 inits, i don't know what all. all the "industry experts" we
 phoned (the tapedrive dealer, our apple dealer, the software
 dealer) all say it's our fault, or they don't know. the last
 thing they said was that we needed a special quadra scsi terminator
 (???). anybody know more? thanks,
