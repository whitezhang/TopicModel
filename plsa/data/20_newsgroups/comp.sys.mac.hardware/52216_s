      since image writer lq was discontinued, there is no apple talk
      printer with 11"*15" continous paper printer.
 
      i would like to know is there are any possibility to connect
      an ibm compatible printer to an apple talk net directly (or 
      with a net serial hardware), and if i need any other software
      to do it.
 
 i've have not found quite the solution yet. the following comes from
 macuser's minifinders:
 
 the grappler iisp is a dot matrix-printer interface cartridge that
 emulates the imagewriter lqs. includes networking and spooling
 software that allows multiple users... $159 orange micro 714-779-2772 
 
 if you find out any more information, please let me know because in
 the future i have the same problem, or if anyone else has the
 information please post. thanks
