 does anyone know how to zap the pram on the duo 230. inaddition i have recently
 noticed that checking the ram left in the finder on the duo 230 4/80 
 reveals the normal 1800k for the system file but only about 1/10 to 1/5 of the
 bar is actually highlighted implying that only 2-300k is being used for the
 system. what gives? i have had no crashes yet or other software problem...
 
 thanks...
 arun mathur...
