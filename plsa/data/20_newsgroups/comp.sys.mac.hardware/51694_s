 connector used for many mac peripherals.

   printer (cheap) cables using this configuration switch a couple of
 pins between one end and the other.  i want to use cheap cables for an
 a-b box.  anyone know which pins get reversed so i can do some
 creative editing on the internals of my box?  any help would be
 greatly appreciated.
