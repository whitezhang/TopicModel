 hi mac fans,
 
 i have some problems with my new quadra 700. several programs
 (mathematica 2.1, afterdark-mandelbrot module) causes a systemcrash
 if the 040cache is active. do anyone have a list of programs which
 are compatible and which are not? do anyone have some hints for the 
 use of the quadras perfomence?
 
 thanks joerg
