 be very careful when you plug in a external monitor and a external speaker.
 make sure that all the power cords are in the same strip.  if you don't you
 take a chance of having a very bad audio buzz.  this is caused be a "ground loop" and the only way of getting rid of this loud buzz is to make sure that you 
 have a common ground.                                
 make sure that all the power cords are going in to the same strip or off the 
 same outlet.  this will assure you of a common ground.
