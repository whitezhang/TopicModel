     i think this is mostly the fault of the people who write up the
 literature and price lists being confused themselves. since there are
 two possible processor configurations and one of the them doesn't have
 an fpu it does seem to be an option, even though it really isn't.

     well, then allow me to end your confusion. the c650 only come with
 an lc040 in the base 4/80 configuration. if you are not getting this
 configuration then you are getting an fpu.
 
 >>why say "optional" if it's built in?
 
     good question. i have been wondering that since feb. 10th.

     this is possible, but an option is something that you are supposed
 to be able to request when you want it. what apple has done is given the
 buyer a choice between configurations and not an option.

     this is not unclear at all. in fact apple has included in the roms
 of those machines with lc040s code to recognize the presence of the full
 040's fpu and use it. thereby making the upgrade as easy as switching
 chips. you pop the lc040 out and pop in a full '040.

     they did? i think i would double-check this. it has been stated
 countless times in this newsgroup by two of the centris hardware
 designers that the lc040 and the full '040 are pin compatible and that
 the c610 can be upgraded to a full '040.
