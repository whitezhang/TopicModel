 how important is this? how many nubus cards do you have/plan to
 acquire? how much memory do you really need? i've got a ci, and
 20mb of ram. that's plenty. i also have a 24bit graphics card
 on the nubus - i'm a sucker for pretty pictures...i think the
 lciii can have a bootable ramdisk in memory, which a ci can
 not have. at least, not out of the box.

 the ci is 32-bit clean. i solved the sound input problem with
 a macrecorder. but that's gotten to be a fairly expensive
 solution now that macromind owns macrecorder.
 
 + performance-wise, i have read that they are almost identical, the
 + lc iii being a little slower.
 
 the actual difference is probably not worth worrying over.
  
 + so, which should i get?
 
 depends on the price you can get the ci for. educationally speaking,
 the 4/80 [?] lciii here at fsu can be had at just under $1300. add
 in roughly $500 for a monitor. last i'd heard, an 8mb lciii simm
 went for ~$250. 
 
 i think you're in a win-win situation. no matter what you decide,
 you'll most likely be happy with it.
