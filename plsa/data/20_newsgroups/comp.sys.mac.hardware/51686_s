 you're not going to like this, but if memory serves me, postings
 i've read in this newsgroup and elsewhere indicate that there are
 no, repeat no, internal modems for the duo besides the express
 modem... at _any_ speed.  something having to do with the modem
 using the main cpu for some of its tasks, and apple not releasing
 details on the architecture, or something.  i'm vague on the
 details, but the gist was that there are going to be no
 third-party internal duo modems.  if i'm wrong, somebody please
 correct me on this.  sorry to be the bearer of bad news.
