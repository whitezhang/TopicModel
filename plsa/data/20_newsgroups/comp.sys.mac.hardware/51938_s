 someone asked me if i there existed an init that removes the dialog
    "you're gonna disconnect all apletalk users " or something
 like that, when the powerbook falls asleep.
 
 he said he was sure that such a thing existed, and he thought it was
 freeware. can anyone help me out with this ?
 
 btw : where can i get switch-a-roo, or something of the kind,
 but schareware or freeware ?
