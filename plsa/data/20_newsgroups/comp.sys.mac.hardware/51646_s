 i have a macc iici and a color scanner.
 i scanned a picture at 600 dpi. when i try to print
 it on my hp500 color printer, after 10 minutes of
 making noise, the mac hangs. i would need to reboot it.
 what does this mean? do i need to buy more memory? i have
 5.0 mb now. i also have about 50 mb of disk free, and the
 scanned picture is about 12 mb.
