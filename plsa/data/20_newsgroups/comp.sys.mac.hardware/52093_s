 ec>it was called the mac xl when sculley came on board. i bought one at
 a close-out place after the mac plus and the awesome 20-meg serial hard
 drive were introduced. to pacify people who bought the xl and only found
 it was discontinued within a year, apple sent people like i a letter
 saying for $1500 and the xl, they would give me a 1-meg mac plus with
 the hd20.
 
 the lisa was originally introduced in 1980 or '81, i forget now, and
 sold for $9995 with 2 400k floppy drives and 1mb memory. it didn't do
 too well. <grin>
 
 before becoming the mac xl it was called a lisa 2/10. it had a built in
 10meg hd by this time and was expandable to 2mb ram although that's not
 what the 2 in 2/10 stood for. it was the second coming of the lisa. it
 also predated the mac plus and the 20mb serial hd by quite a few months.
 for a short while it was the power users system.
