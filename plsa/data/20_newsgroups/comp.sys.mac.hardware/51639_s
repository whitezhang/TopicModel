 i don't know how many times i've posted this the net.  no one ever
 listens.  
 
 once and for all:  floptical media is only $1.40 a megabyte if you don't
 know where to buy it.  i am bying my flopticals at $30 per 2 disks.  i
 see that as $.75 a meagabyte, not $1.40.  no, i'm not buying in bulk, i'm
 not getting a special deal.  $.75 a meg is good in my book, approching
 floppy price.
