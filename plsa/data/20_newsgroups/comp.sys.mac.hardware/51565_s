 finally got my computer fixed and i'd like to sum up.
 
 about hard drive companies: the original 160 meg drive that was bad (bad
 sector or something) was an ibm.  the new one is a quantum.  is the lciii
 supposed to be shipped with ibms?  is there a quality difference? 
 apparently! :)
 
 second, about hard drive position.  i've put the lciii on its side and
 the new 160 hd has had no problems at all.  i've even switched back and
 forth between horizontal and vertical and there are no problems.  as far
 as i'm concerned i don't believe hd position is important for drives up
 to 160 meg, in any computer.  don't know about cd-rom, though.
