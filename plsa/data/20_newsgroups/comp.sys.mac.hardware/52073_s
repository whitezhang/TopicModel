 hello,
 
 i saw this question posted a week or so ago, but as far as i could tell no
 answer appeared on the net. what is the good oil on connecting the apple
 extended keyboard to a powerbook? the earlier questioner wonderd if this would
 be too much of a load for the pb and as i want to connect just such a beast i
 am curious.
 
 i haven't got a pb yet so i can't rtfm but i assume that a standard keyboard
 with a mouse would be ok as the spec sheet i read mentioned connecting an
 external keyboard. but is the extended plus mouse pushing it?
 
 any help gratefully recieved. i will summarise to the net if necessary.
 
 thanks, john collins.
 
 p.s. i am thinking of a pb160 but i assume that this would apply to all pb's.
