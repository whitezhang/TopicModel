 does anyone have a version of "which mac do i buy?"
 that is later than v 1.3.1?
 
 i no longer have access the ziffnet/mac, accessed
 through compuserve, to check for myself.
 
 "which mac..." is a hypercard stack that assists
 in decision making based on budget, features, and
 main software used.
 
 please let me know if you can help me out. download
 from compuserve should not cost much if a higher speed
 modem is used. stack, compressed, is about 125kb?
 
 thanks for any help...
