 hello
 
 i have recently suffered from various problems concerning
 an adaptec 1542a controller.
 
 problem 1:
 floppy disk drive doesn't work. there's apparently at least two jumpers
 on the controller that affect the floppy disk drive. unfortunately i
 have located only one of them (in the lower front corner). i would like
 to know, if there are any other such jumpers and possibly where they 
 are located.
 
 problem 2:
 my hard disks refuse to boot. with my two scsi hd's (rodime, miniscribe)
 i get a message 'missing operating system', even though the disks have been
 formatted with the same controller and they damn sure have an operating
 system on them. if i boot from a quantum i might get as far as getting
 the ms-dos version information. this might of course be due to incombatible
 memory drivers.
 are there any jumpers that could affect the hd causing such errors?
 
 	thanks in advance
 
         jouni
