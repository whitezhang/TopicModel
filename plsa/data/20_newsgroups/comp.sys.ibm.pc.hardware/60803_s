 i am asked to design a video-aid system for teacher to show their students
 how to work their way round in windows.
 
 i have seen people using video projector, tv set and large size monitor as
 thrir display for presentations. i am told that there are three ways to
 connect to a video projector: composite, y/c & rgb.
 
 can anyone explain to me the different between the three and the likely cost
 for each of them?
 
 i would also like to know if there are telnet or kermit for windows.
 
 please reply to me via e-amil as well as bulletin. my internet account is
