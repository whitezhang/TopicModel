 help!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! my computer from gateway is freezing up on me.
 gateway tech support couldn't help me. they want more specifics on when
 it freezes up.  i did!  anyway, here it is.  if the keyboard is left idle
 in dos for more than 15 minutes, i can type on the command line, but as 
 soon as i hit a carraige return, the computer locks up.  this will happen
 almost every time, whether i've just booted up, reset, or finished using a
 dos program.  everything works fine if i don't let it sit.  windows is a
 different story.  if i let the machine sit while in windows for 15 minutes
 or more, it does not freeze up.  however,  i do get frequent application
 errors that kick me out of an application unexpectedly, losing my work.
 i just don't know if this is a hardware or software problem.  any help
 in diagnosis or things to try, would be greatly appreciated.  
 
 p.s.  i do not run any tsrs (except smartdrive) and qaplus diagnostics 
 says everything is good.
