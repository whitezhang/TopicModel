 xga or xga-2?  for the original xga you just need something that can do
 1024x768 at 45/90hz interlaced (just tell them "8514 compatible" and they
 should get the idea).  for the xga-2, get what you like.  i prefer multi-
 syncs like the ibm 6319, the necs or even a fixed frequency monitor like
 my home viewsonic 6.  i like the multisyncs because it's easy to run them
 in modes like 800x600x64k colors noninterlaced, or at higher modes like
 1360x1024x16.
