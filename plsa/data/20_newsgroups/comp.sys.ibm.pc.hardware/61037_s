 i have recently picked up a page scanner by the name of ez-scan ii
 model 35.  the software for it was made for per-windows 3.x windows
 and will not work with the newwer windows.  does any one out there kow
 were i could find the company that made this beast (copyrights say
 1987.) and the name gms a division of dest.  does anyone know if these
 companies still exist and if they do, do they have an email address?
 
 or, if anyone knows of a freeware/shareware programme that is able to
 access this scanner.
 
 thanks in advance, and please email - this group scrolls way too
 quickly.
