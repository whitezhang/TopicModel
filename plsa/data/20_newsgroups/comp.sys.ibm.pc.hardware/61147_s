 quantum lps240a hard disk phantom seeks
 
 i just purchased and installed a 240mb quantum 3.5" hard drive, model
 lps240a, and have a concern about its behavior.
 
 although the disk drive itself seems to behave properly with respect to
 file i/o, it performs what i call phantom seeks.
 
 when the pc is absolutely idle, i can hear a spurt of activity in the
 drive every 30-40 seconds, lasting 1-2 seconds. this activity seems to
 be initiated strictly within the drive itself since the disk led never
 comes on. [the disk led is attached to the disk controller card, not
 the drive.]
 
 my other hard disk, a seagate st3283a, does not have this kind
 behavior.
 
 can anyone comment on this strange phenomenon?
