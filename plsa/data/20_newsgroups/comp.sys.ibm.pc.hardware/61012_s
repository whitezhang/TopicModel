 	1.  don't hold your finger on it
 	2.  when cooking with it use a very small pan and be sure
 	  to not spill liquids on the components
 	3.  if you do not plan to cook with it there are a number of
 	  small cooling fans designed to mount on the chip and plug
 	  into your power supply.  look in consumer shoppers.
 
 	now if only some innovative person could design and produce
 a heat sink which could be used to keep my coffee warm, why i might
 even buy a pentium !
