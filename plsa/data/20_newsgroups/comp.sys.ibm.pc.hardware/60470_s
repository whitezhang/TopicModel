 	very possibly, but if it's still going to be backwards compatible
 with the isa bus, it's going to be the same tripe that the current eisa
 implementation really is.
 
 	from what i've seen, the pci bus will just be a new 32bit 33mhz
 intelligent bus (ie, bus controller takes care of interrupts and the like,
 not jumpers...)  hopefully it'll get somewhere up there with the amiga 
 zorro iii bus....
 
 	vl bus is a bit too much of a hack for my liking...
 
 	toodlepip!
 	marc 'em.
