 contrary to what others might have thought, i actually did have a scsi drive
 once.  it was the seagate 296n and the st-02 controller.  i found that the
 controller couldn't keep up with a 1:1 interleave, so the best i could do
 with the drive was a 2:1 interleave and a data transfer of about 450 k/sec.
 
 i have had that drive/controller coexist with mfm, rll, and ide drives
 because the st-02 bios will kinda muscle itself in there with no help
 needed from the computer's bios.  dos will see many logical drives, much more
 than 4 (i've had up to 10).  i've often wondered how many scsi drives you
 could hang off a st-01/02.
