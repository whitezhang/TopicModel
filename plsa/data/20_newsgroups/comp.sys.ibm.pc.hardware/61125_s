 from what i've seen in coursework, most cpus never actually
 "idle".  they will continue to service interrupts, etc.,
 etc.  the clock will always be running at n mhz no matter
 what it's doing.
 
 i suppose depending on the instruction, the cpu may use
 circuitry which has more transistors than other
 instructions, but if you consider the additional heat
 generated by only a handful of additional, tiny resistors
 and then spread that heat dissipation over the cpu's
 packaging, the change in temperature to the immediate
 environment (ie. the surface of the package) will be
 negligible.
