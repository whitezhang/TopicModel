 
 would someone be willing to explain to me the 486dx 50mhz is not more
 popular than it is?  i would think it would be just as fast, if not 
 faster than the 486dx 66mhz for certian applications.  plus, a 50mhz 
 motherboard would seem better if you had any plans on upgrading the
 chip in the future.  i must be missing something, since everyone is 
 buying the dx2 66...  many adds don't even mention the dx 50.
 
  thanks a lot,
    -matt
