 i can wait 'cos i've already got an accelerated card. it does 1280x1024 but
 only 16 colour. you may mock me, but such cards will be here quickly enough.

 i only wait when the difference between my current system and the new stuff
 is big enough to warrant changing. for instance, i'll be upgrading my 486 33
 to a 486dx-2 66 eisa, vlb board rsn. the performance difference (under linux)
 is great enough to be worthwhile. at the same time i'll be buying a new
 graphic card and new scsi controller. i'll be buying an s3 card 'cos they're
 fast enough, i have x11 drivers for them and it'll have 2mb vram just like
 a weitek 9000 card. it will also be much cheaper. when affordable 4mb cards
 arrive, i'll buy one.

 over the last year i've done much the same. but now i need a 19" monitor, more
 memory (20mb just ain't enough), a gb disk (1.2gb and no space left...). oh
 well, stay single, don't smoke and you may afford it this year ;-)
