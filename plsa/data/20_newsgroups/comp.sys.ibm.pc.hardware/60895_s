 hello,
 
    i have a diamond stealth vram card (the older version
 with the dip switches on the back).  i have two problems:
 
 1 ) i've lost the manual!!!
 
 2 ) i have it in a machine with a network card, and
     everything works fine until i run windows, when
     the network connection dies.
 
     (in case it's important, the network card is an
      smc arcnet 8-bit compatable card.  it's i/o
      address is 02e0 and it's ram base address is
      d000.  it's also using irq 2)
 
 
 shown 54%, press <space> for more, 'q' to quit, or 'h' for help
                                                                                 
     i believe there is a file on the diamond bboard that
 explains how to sort this out, but with no manual, i don't
 know the bboard number.
 
     if you can, please help me with as many of the following
 as possible:
 
 a ) send me the diamond bbs number
 b ) e-mail (or post) the dip switch settings for the card
     (or fax them to me at (412) 521-8668)
 c ) tell me what i'm doing wrong, so i can magicly get
     everything working.
 
     any help at all would be much appreciated.
 
                 thanks in advance,
 
                        red/.
 
 
 end of file, press return to quit
