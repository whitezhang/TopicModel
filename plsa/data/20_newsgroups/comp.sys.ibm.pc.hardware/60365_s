 
 	i'm trying to transfer some software between two machines 
 	and i'm having real trouble.  my own intel 14.4k (
 	v32/v32bis/v42/v42bis) works fine--i just talk to it
 	at 56k and everything comes out clear.  this other modem,
 	at the other machine, is a "turbomodem+" from "the 
 	complete pc" (the machines are in seperate houses, 
 	so a direct serial link is impossible, and copying this
 	much data to disk is a pain--easier to turn the machines
 	on for a few hours and go see a movie--no, this is not
 	pirated software).
 
 	i am having no end of trouble trying to set it up.  it will
 	dial and connect just fine--at 9600 baud.  but if i try to
 	set the comm at 19k2, 38.4k or 56kbps, the stupid thing
 	connects, but just gives garbage (it connects 14.4k).  
 	his machine (a dx48633) has a 16550afn uart, so that's
 	not the problem.
 
 	it seems to me that the stupid thing wants to talk to 	
 	a comm program _at_ 14.400bps, even though it will take
 	dialing instructions at 56k (and respond ok, etc. to 
 	other commands).  i don't have a comm program that can
 	do precisely 14.4k.  
 
 	i looked at the manual but it was unclear.  all i know is,
 	i didn't have this trouble with the intel--it came
 	ready to connect this way.  do i need to initialize it
 	any way in particular?
 
 	also, it's _using_ v.42bis and v.42 (and mnp5) when connecting
 	here (i.e., at 9600, since our tests at 14k4 are zip so far)
 	but it doesn't _say_ so there.  any ideas?
 
 	(btw:  i tried the initialization string that i use for
 	my modem, but it just gives error on that one)
