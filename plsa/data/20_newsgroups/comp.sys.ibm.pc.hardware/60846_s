 just a wild thought here, but how about this: there is a small boot program
 on every formatted diskette, whether or not it contains system files.  it is
 this small program that prints the "non-system disk" error, not dos.  if
 this program tries to transfer control to a bios location that is
 nonstandard on the gateway, then it could clear the bios.
 
 i don't think that the bios is overwritten, there is usually a small routine
 to clear the cmos area, in case an invalid configuration prevents the
 machine from booting.  i think that the boot code on the fuji disks may
 inadvertantly call this routine.
 
 just a thought.
 
 ... don't hit me, mr. moderator... i'll go back on topic... i swear!
