 i had one and on three different motherboards it didn't work with nt and
 in some cases dos. i sent mine back, but it is my understanding that
 on some systems such as micronics motherboards it is necessary to
 shut off the internal cache on the 486 to have it work.
 
 i've yet to hear from someone running a 34f on any motherboard with
 nt without shutting off the cache.
 
 if you get one my advise it to be very sure you can return it first.
