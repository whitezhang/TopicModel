 
 hi,
     recently, when i run the norton disk surface test, i realize a slow
 down in harddisk accessing.  at begining of the test, the harddisk will
 be checked at the speed that usually is.  as the surface test scaned
 half way through my harddisk, a tremendous slow down occured.  the
 expected time for operation will jump from 3 to 6 minutes.  i try to use
 some of the harddisk tools to check if there is any physical damage to
 my harddisk and report always turn out to be none.  the surface test
 only slow down for a certain section of the disk and turn back to the
 original speed after it gets over the section.  i am wondering whether
 it is a harddisk problem or some other problems. anyway help or comment
 will be appriciate....
