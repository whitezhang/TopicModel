 this past winter i found myself spending a ridiculous amout of time in front
 of my computer.  since my eyes were going berserk, i decided to shell out
 some serious money to upgrade from a 14" to a 17" monitor.  i'm running
 800x600 at 72 hz.  my eyes are very grateful.  however, i find myself using
 a smaller font with less eye strain.  has anyone else had this kind of 
 experience?  i thought that small fonts were the culprit but it seems that
 flicker was my real problem.  any comments?
