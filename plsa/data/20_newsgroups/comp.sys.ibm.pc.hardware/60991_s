 hi,
   i've seen alot of ads for voicemail/fax/data modems.....this would
 be way-cool if they work well....i don't want to have someone call me
 and get the connecting sound of a fax machine.  do they work very well?
 has anyone out there played with one?  if so, please tell me what brand
 and other info like that.....
 					thanks,
