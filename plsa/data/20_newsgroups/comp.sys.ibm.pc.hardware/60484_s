 compare to the nanao 17"?  i am looking for a good 17" (like many other
 net'ers) and found a good price for the philips.  here some the specs:
 
 	sony trinitron tube
 	digital micro control
 	1280x1024 ni
 	.25 dp
 	300x225 mm display area
 	to 100 hz refresh
 	anti-glare, mpr-ii...
 	auto-scan 30-64 khz
 
 why don't i ever see this monitor for sale (one company in apr computer shopper)
 what is the 1764dc?  what is the best price around for this?....
 
 and how 'bout that mag 17"?  i love my mag 15" (except for that little color
 alignment thing on the l/r edges)...
