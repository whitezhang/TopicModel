 actually, it does make a reasonable amount of sense. fixed disk
 sectors are buffered by the controller, and transferring them to
 memory with a 'rep insw' (or whatever the instruction is called) is
 quite efficient (single instruction, goes as fast as the
 controller/cpu know how to use the bus). since the 286 wasn't cached,
 the bus is likely a critical resource relative to cpu performance, and
 it's possible that dma bus interference would cause as much or more
 loss of cpu cycles (for 'computing') as does the 'rep insw' sequence.
 
 the floppy, on the other hand, is not buffered, so that using the cpu
 for floppy data transfer (as was done on the pc jr, by the way) really
 does stink.
