 with your date/time problems, you might have a problem with the dallas
 clock chip (i'm making a possibly bad assumption that your system has
 a clock chip and that it's the standard dallas clock chip).  i always
 look at the battery and the clock chip when such things go wrong--
 at least, as the first course of action.
