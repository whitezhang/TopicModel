 the vl-ide adapter can be much faster then the normal ide, it depends on the
 drive you use and the board you use. i am using a noname vl-ide i/o contr.
 it is tested under coretest with 2.000 kb/s using a cheap seagate 3196 and nearly
 4000 kb/s using a wd-caviar 2340, you have figure out the jumper setting on the
 controller to get reliable diskaccess, fastest setting gets 4600 kb/s under coretest
 but does not work reliable. you have to shadow the adapter bios to get the fast
 speed. i haven´t used a vl-ide-cache controller yet, but it might speed up twice.
