 what are peoples opinions on the above make of hard drives, i seem to have 
 found a really good bargain on a 170meg drive but i thought i'd check if
 anyone had any comments to say on this make?
 
 also i'm a bit of a novice with pc's (but an experienced computer user), when
 connecting and fitting this drive into one of my spare 5 1/4 bays what extras
 will i need, a cable for starters (i guess :-) , but what about brackets etc...
 
 also i think i might have to change some jumpers on the drive and my original
 connar 211meg one. i'll be attaching the second drive to a seperate ide socket
 on my controler card. what will i need to change ????
 
 yet again many thanks to all that have answered me in the past and to any that
 answer me in the future :-)
