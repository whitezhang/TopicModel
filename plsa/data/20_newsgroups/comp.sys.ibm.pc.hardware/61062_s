 depends on the fdc but generally no.  the drive at the end after the twist 
 should be set as drive 0

 since you're using the 5.25 as drive a: it should be at the end after the 
 twist with the resistor pack fitted.

 yes

 hope this helps.  i had exactly the same problems.  unfortunately when
 i changed to different machine the problems started again because
 of a different fdc.  seems (don't flame me, this is mainly guess work
 from practicle experience) that some fdc's do different things with the 
 select.
