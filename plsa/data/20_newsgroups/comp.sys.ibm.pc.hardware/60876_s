 	i need to be able to cause a beep, but without using any interrupt
 routines, as i cannot use the bios. i believe that the pic might have
 something to do with it, but i'm having troubles deciphering the
 information i have on it to figure out how to program it!
 
 	i'm programming all of this in turbo c, if that makes any
 diference at all...
 
 	please can anyone help me??!
 
 thanks,
