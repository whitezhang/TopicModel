 --------------------
 
 i am running a unisys pw2 386sx20 with dos 6.  my problem, even when i had dos
 5.0, is that when i have emm386 loaded i can't ctl-alt-del.  if i do, the
 computer beeps a few times rapidly and hangs.  then i have to use the obscure
 reset (requires a screwdriver or pencil) or the power switch to reboot.  does
 anyone have a solution to this problem?
 
 e-mail me at x51948b1@usma1.usma.edu
