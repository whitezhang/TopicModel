 hi,
 
 i'm kind of new at the pc stuff.  my machine has 4 serial ports.  com 1 and3
 and 2 &4 share same irqs.  you mean i can't plug a mouse into com1 and a modem
 into com3 and expect both to work?
 
 if answer is no, should i change irq's for com ports to be different?  and,
 does it really matter which irq i set the ports too?
