 there is a premium of approx $200 for the controller. what is nice is 
 being able to run hard disks, tape drives, cd-roms and scanners of
 one dma channel and interupt!
 
 scsi makes sense is you are going to load up a machine, if you just want
 a standard box for windows then ide makes sense.
 
 i have one loaded box that uses scsi and run unix and one standard box
 that runs dos/windows that uses ide.
 
 
 [ by standard i mean - 486, 4-8mb ram, 200mh disk, s3 video ]
