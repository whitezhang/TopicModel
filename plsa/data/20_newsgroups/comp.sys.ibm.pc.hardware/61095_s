 hi,
  that might look like a dull request, but i have been following this newgroup
 for a couple of weeks and it didn't help me make my mind.
 
   i bought a new 486 machine not long ago after being disconnected from the
 pc world for a while (i have been running on an xt 5mhz till last january!!).
 the machine i bought came equipped with a ati vga xl 24 graphic card. it
 gives a very nice picture and the  windows drivers are pretty stable. the only
 problem is that it is quite slow.
 
 i would like to go for a faster card (not in the 400$ range). i saw a lot
 of comments on many products over the last weeks, but didn't get an overall
 picture clear enough to make a choice. my question is : could somebody
 direct me to a source of information which would help me in my quest.
 i would like to get information about :
      - the refresh rates the various cards provide;
      - quality of windows drivers;
      - standard vga performance (non-windows stuff).
 
 direct me to a magazine article or something like that (i got winvid.zip 
 info, but it is not enough). if you have an isa card you are really satisfied
 with it,  let me know.
 	if this information is of any use, here is my system configuration:
 	- fujikama 486 33mhz isa system (contaq motherboard)
 	- monitor darius 14" non-interlaced multisync (up to 1024x768) 
                                (can reach 70khz horizontally)  
 
 i would also like to know if it is a standard for video drivers to allow
 screen dimensioning and screen positioning by writing on the eprom of the
 graphic card. this is the case with my ati card and it is very convenient
 when changing graphics mode since my monitor is not intelligent 
 enough to record settings.
 
 merci a l'avance for any information you would be kind enough to provide me,
