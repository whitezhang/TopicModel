 i would like advice on how to configure my 486 to accept:
 - com1 + com2  (currently on irq 4 and 3)
 - lpt1 (irq7)
 - bus mouse (irq5)
 - sound card (no idea what to do - can be set to any)
 - 
 using irq2 for bus mouse gobbled up too many cycles, and caused
 loss of communications with floppy disks, and a few other 
 problems.
 
 i could, i suppose, switch the 2 com devices externally, and disable
 the second port on the super io card, but i really want to 
 have them both available.
 
 could the sound card use irq2 without horsing up the works?
 
 all replies apppreciated - and i only just subscribed to this
 newsgroup - i assume there is an faq somewhere (rather, i'm
 sure someone will tell me about it....)
 
 thanks
