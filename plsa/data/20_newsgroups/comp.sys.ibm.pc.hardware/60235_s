 
 two questions:
 1: i'm trying to figure out how to access cmos advanced chip setting on a
 eisa motherboard (air) that has ami bios..specifically i would like to set
 the atclk or wait states or bus speed on this board, i can't seem to be
 able to do it..any help in this area would be greatly appreciated.
 
 2: i am looking for a phone number for wangtek tape drives, specifically i
 am looking for jumper settings on a 5099en24 drive..
 
 thanks in advance.
