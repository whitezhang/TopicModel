 
 i'm looking into getting an external, reasonably fast (<350 ms avg access time)
 multispin cd-rom drive that supports "photo cd multi session", has audio
 output, and scsi interface for connection to the pas16 scsi port. does anyone
 have any comments/experiences/warnings/recommendations they'd like to share
 concerning the texel dm-5024 and/or toshiba txm-3401e and/or others. thanks!
