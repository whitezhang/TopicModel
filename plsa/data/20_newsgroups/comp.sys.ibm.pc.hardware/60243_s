 good luck finding an mx17s.  when i was looking around back in
 december/january, mag wasn't producing any because they couldn't get
 tubes from sony.  i asked when they expected to restart production as
 i was willing to wait a few months to get an mx17s but they said not
 any time soon.  i wound up getting a t560i and am extremely happy with
 it.
