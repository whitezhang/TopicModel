 i am looking for a company that can make custom keys.  for instance we need
 a key that says help, main menu, etc which we are going to use instead of
 f1,f2, f3 etc... can anyone point me to a company that does this.  also 
 do you have to have a special keyboard, or can i just pop off the old keys
 and pop in the new ones...
 
 		thanks for the help
