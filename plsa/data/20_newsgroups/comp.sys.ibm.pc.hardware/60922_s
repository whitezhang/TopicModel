 hello,
 a friend a mine has a commodore 386sx and we've put in that machine
 a second harddisk, he now has 100+200 mb. but the problem is that
 the 200mb harddisk isn't supported in the bios. alas there's no user type
 47 in the setup. at the moment we use it as a 193mb type but there are
 getting bad blocks on the harddisk :-<. question: who knows a solution to this?
 i've seen a small program for this once in the byte, but i haven't been able
 to find this. would speedstor or diskmanager work for this, i used these
 programs quite a lot in the xt-days, but i don't have these anymore, seagate
 used to ship diskmanager with each drive they sold.
  
 help will be greatly appreciated.
