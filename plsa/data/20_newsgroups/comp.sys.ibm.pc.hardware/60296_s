 hi.  recently my svga monitor has been acting up by taking about
 3 minutes to warm up.  
 
 previously, when i first start up my pc i can see all the 
 cmos messages (ram test ...etc) but now i've got to wait 
 for about 3min before the display shows anything and
 it starts up with a bright white flash.  this only happens
 when the system has been off for a long time (eg overnight).
 if it was only off for a couple of hours and then turned on
 again, the display works as normal like before.
 
 does anyone know what is causing this?  is it a warning that
 it will give up soon or just signs of aging (the system is a
 386sx and its about 3 yrs old).  i've used systems at work for
 years and never seen this happen to a monitor yet.
 
 i'd really appreciated any help that you fellow netters can offer.
 thanks a lot.
