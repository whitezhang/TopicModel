 i have a 486 dx 33 motherboard in my pc that i'd like to speed up. 
 i'd rather not replace the whole motherboard, instead i'd like to know
 if i can use a dx/2 66mhz cpu. the bios is late model ami, circa 1991,
 and the system crystal is approx 66.3mhz. 
 
 my question is, can i just replace the original 33mhz cpu with the new
 dx/2 cpu? if its possible, will there be a need for extra cooling
 devices such as heatsinks and / or muffin fans??
