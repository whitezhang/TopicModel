 do you mean the viewsonic 7?  it uses a matsushita tube.  the computer 
 shopper review faults it for having below average sharpness and for
 lacking some controls (pincushioning, degaussing, convergence and color).
 it was the lowest priced monitor in the test,  and did have good center 
 to edge focus.
