 fellow netters,
 
 i'm in the market for a hand scanner.  however, i don't know anyone who has
 one.  i have my eye on two choices.
 
 dexxa:  this scanner is available at wal-mart for $90.  it includes grayworks
 software and provides 400 dpi and 32 grayscales (i think).  the ocr software
 catchword is available through mail-order for about $90 also.
 
 mustek:  (gray artist for windows)  this scanner offers 256 grayscales
 (according to cad & graphics) and 800 dpi.  it is available for $169
 mail-order and comes with perceive ocr and picture publisher le.
 
 i am also looking at a genius hand scanner (b105) from cad & graphics.  it
 is basically the same as the mustek scanner except for the resolution (400
 dpi) and price ($149).  
 
 basically, i would like recommendations on which to buy.  i have heard that
 logitech makes the best and manufactures dexxa scanners.  but which one is the
 best buy?  would 800 dpi really be helpful (output would be no better than hp
 laserjet iii or canon bj-200 - 300x300 to 360x360)?  i am leaning toward the
 mustek because it offers the most features and is in the middle in terms of
 prices.  which should i buy?
 
 if you have a hand scanner, please let me know whether or not you would
 recommend it.  also, if you know of another scanner within the price range
 (under $225) that would be a better deal, please e-mail me.  any and all help
 would be greatly appreciated.
