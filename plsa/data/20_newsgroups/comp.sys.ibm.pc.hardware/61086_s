 i'm having trouble with installing a second ide drive on a promise ide caching
 controller. the first drive is a conner 3204 and works fine. the second drive
 is a conner 30174, it is currently unjumpered  to be the slave drive. the
 problem is the slave drive is recognized but is reported back as having no
 free space. disabling cache has made no effect. what else should i check for?

 krispy,
 lets start with what promise controller that you have. ther are only
 about 4 or 6 of them made. the one that i have the dc-99m needs
 nothing done but install it as stated. as to the 2th. hd you do know
 about running fdisk on it and partisitions and then formatting it
 after your finished with the fdisk operation right!....sam
