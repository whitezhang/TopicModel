 doesn't anybody actually read the licence agreement of winbench
 before blindly running it? the licence agreement very clearly says
 that details about hardware configuration, driver, resolution and
 other relevant facts *must* be included when giving winmark results.
 
 ziff-davis wants everybody to do this and that requirement makes
 sense, really! plain numbers are useless when resolution, driver and
 machine are unknown.
