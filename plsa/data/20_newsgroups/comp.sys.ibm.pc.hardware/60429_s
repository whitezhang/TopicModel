 ide does not do dma.  this is because it's like te pc at hard disk
 interface.  the controller moves a sector to some buffer memory on the
 controller card, then the cpu moves the data from the buffer to main
 memory where it's needed.  if ide doesn't work this way, then it's not
 compatible.
 
 heck, if ide used dma, then you'd hear all kinds of complaints about
 isa bus systems with more than 16m ram not working with their ide
 drives.  16m is the dma addressing limit of the isa bus, and if ide
 did dma there would be trouble.
 
 (btw, there are dma-enabling signals in the ide cable spec, but the
 last report i heard was that they are never implemented, because it
 would require a different kind of ide adapter and different drivers.)

 os/2 2.0 will do for me until amigados for the 386 comes along...
