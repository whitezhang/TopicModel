 
 	just a quick thanks to the many who explained the backing up of my
 masters.  apparently they are not copy-protected; i just used a program that
 is unable to handle high-density (old shit).  i was surprised to hear that
 "no programs on high-density disks have copy protection," which someone
 back there said.  huh!  learn something new every day!
