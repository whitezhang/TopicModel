 i've been trying to get my fujitsu m2611t 45mb hard disk (circa 
 1990) to share my ide card with a new seagate st3283a 245mb one.  
 i've tried fiddling the jumpers to set the master and slave drives 
 without any success  [without the table of hard drive specs from 
 this newsgroup i couldn't have got that far].
 
 has anyone else got this combination to work.  the place i got the
 new one muttered something like "hmmm  fujitsu, nice drives, not
 very compatible."  he'll let me swap the seagate for another brand 
 but he thought it was more a problem with the fujitsu.
 
 so has anyone got a similar fujitsu drive to work with another cheapish 
 disk ... or want to buy a cute and cuddly little fujitsu drive ?
