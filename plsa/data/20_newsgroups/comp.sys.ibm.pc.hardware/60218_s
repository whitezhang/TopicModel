 oh yeah! i just got my new eizo flexscan yesterday (to replace my old 8515), and
 i tried it with 1360x1024. this mode is just great! i can get four perfectly readable
 command windows on the screen! and if i need more colors, i can go back to 1024x768
 or even 800x600.
 one thing i am wondering though: why isn't there a monxxxx.dgs file which contains
 all the resolutions up to 1360x1024? now i have to change the xgasetup.pro every
 time i want to switch, instead of simply going through the system settings of os/2.
