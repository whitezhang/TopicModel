 
 all,
 
 during my attempts to find out how the at harddisk controller
 works i stumbled across i/o port 376h. the "normal" controller
 ports are in the 1f0h-1f7h range, so what does this port do???
 
 the only information i have upto now about this port is that it
 is a write only port and the information you have to write in it
 is related to the number of heads on the disks.
 
 could somebody shed some light on this and give me the missing info.
 
 thanks,
