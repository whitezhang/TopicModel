 yep.  i've done this, too.  the trick is to use a tiny screwdriver and push
 down on the "latch" of each pin and then pull it out of the connector.  label
 each one first with tape so you don't get them confused after you've pulled
 them out.  compare the pinout tables in the mitsumi and soundblaster manuals
 to get the correct orientation.
