 i can definitily say that you can use an rll as master and ide as slave, as
 i have just upgraded my machine with a 200mb ide ( and custom controller
 mdl ci-1010 extended ide controller ) while maintaining my rll'd wren as
 master drive.  the trick is the controller which supports up to 4 ide drives
 while coexisting with existing controllers ( mfm,rll,esdi,scsi ).
 
 so according to the documentation it should work with esdi, and i can assure
 you it works with rll.
