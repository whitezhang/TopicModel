 if anyone out there can help, i would greatly appreciate it.
 
 this christmas, i built a computer out of used parts for my father-in-law.
 the disk drive that i installed was a seagate 251-1 mfm.  anyway, he now he
 would like to put another hd into this system.  i don't want to buy another
 mfm, the only reason why i used an mfm in the first place is that it was
 free.  would i need a special ide hd controller?  also, if i do need a 
 special ide controller, where can i purchase one, & how much are they?
 
 please send any responses to:
