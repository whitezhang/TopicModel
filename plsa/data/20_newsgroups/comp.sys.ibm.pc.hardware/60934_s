 i have a friend with an original hp laserjet.  the nameplate does not 
 specify a number, but since the lj ii followed later, one assumes that he 
 has a lj i.   his problem is a tax program which requires a 17 cpi font to 
 print the forms properly.
 
 this unit came to market in 2 versions.  the plus version supported 
 dowloadable fonts.  you can guess which one my friend has - the plain, not 
 the plus.  the printer does though have a slot and he has a small selction 
 of cartridges including a 16.6 cpi - but none with a 17 cpi font.
 
 can anyone suggest a source for a cartridge with a 17 (or 18?) cpi font?  
 alternatively, is an upgrade to the plus version available at reasonable 
 cost?
 
 any suggestions would be welcome.
 
 thanks
