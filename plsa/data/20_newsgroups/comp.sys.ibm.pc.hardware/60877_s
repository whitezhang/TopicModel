 	i have a 5fg and think it is great. i haven't seen the nanao's so i
 can't compare, but the 5fg image is very sharp and the color contrast is
 *extremely* good. i've used other trinitron monitors (e.g. a sun ss2 color
 monitors, which is a 19" trinitron), and think the 5fg is at least as good,
 perhaps brighter, and has *none* of these silly horizontal lines running across.
 	btw, i could be wrong, but i thought that the 5fge is slower as well
 as missing accucolor. it may not be able to handle 1280x1024 the way the 5fg
 can.
