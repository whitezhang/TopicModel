 being a big fan of the official ibm keyboards, i have a ps/2 keyboard attached 
 to my clone computer.  i want to know if there is a software utility
 out there that can be used to switch the locations of the ctrl and
 cap locks keys.  even better, does ibm or any third party make ctrl
 and cap lock key replacements that can be used to visually switch
 the keys as well?
