 computer: 286-25 mhz
 bus: isa (12.5 mhz)
 drive: maxtor 7213a (213 mb)
 
                                     config.sys / autoexec.bat
 
                      ms dos 5             no           win 3.1
                      smartdrv.sys        cache         smartdrv.exe
 
 core (v 2.7)         6950 k/sec          1390 k/sec     1395 k/sec
 norton si (v 5.0)     730 k/sec           980 k/sec      982 k/sec
 
 i'd still like to here from people with vlb-ide.
 i still want to know what vlb bus speed is used with ide drives.
 i still want to know if some (most ?) ide drives can handle bus speeds > 8 mhz.
 
 ps: a friend with a 286-20 and a new maxtor 7245 (245 meg ide) drive gets
 between 800 - 1000 k/sec (can't remember exactly).  i think the bus is running
 at 8 mhz in this case.
