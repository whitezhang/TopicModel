   i am unable to get my gateway 486dx2/66 to run windows
 in 1280x1024.  i ordered a 2m ati ultra pro, and i'm pretty
 sure the 2m is really there because i *can* select
 1024x768x65536.   but no matter what i do with the flex program
 in the ati's program group, 1280x1024 remains ghosted out.
 i have windows 3.1, build 59 of the drivers, dos 5.0.  the
 drivers were installed by gateway, not by me, so perhaps there's
 a file missing from the hard drive.  it runs 1024x768 just fine.
   i did go into the desktop window and select 1280x1024.  sometimes
 it refuses (ghosted out), other time it accepts it, but when i hit
 ok and re-enter desktop, it's back to 1024x768.  at no time does
 it unghost 1280x1024 in the main flex window.  help!
