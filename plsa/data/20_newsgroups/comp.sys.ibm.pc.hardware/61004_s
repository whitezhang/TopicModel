 
  i am think of buying a new computer through the mail order, i am looking at
 the gateway 2000 66v systen and the zeos's system. which is better (in terms of
 value, price, ungrade, service), because i am in canada, i wonder can i have
 the same level of service as in the states? 
 
 thank you for any advice!
