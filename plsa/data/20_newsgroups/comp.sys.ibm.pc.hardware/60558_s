 well, i was told that my last message came through without anything
 in it, so i'll try again.
 
 i have a leading edge 386sx 16 with a flaky motherboard and a friend
 game me one to replace it, but he didn't have any docs for the 
 mother board.  it's a cheertron board with award bios and has a   
 sticker on it that says vi 1   t1 3  t2 3  on it.  i can tell what
 most of the switches on the blue blocks mean.  except fdc and
 sh, but i have no idea about all the jumpers.  i've replaced hard
 drives and modems and installed math co-processes, but this is a
 bit out of my league and without the docs, i'm really lost.
 
 if anyone could give me some help on this, i'd really appreciate
 it.  i don't get on news regularly, so if you can help, please
 e-mail me at passman@world.std.com
 
 thanks.
