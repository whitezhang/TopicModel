 i have 1 4mx9 70ns 36pin simm for sale.  it is in perfect condition.  it
 will not work in my system because it requires 72 pin simms.
 i would like to get what i paid for it.  $115 + 3 for insured shipping.
 
 in addition, if you have a 4mb 70ns 72 pin eisa or ps/2 type simm for
 sale, drop me a line.  thanks.  nimesh shah  nshah@acs.bu.edu
