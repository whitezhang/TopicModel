 
 hi, all. this is my first posting, so be gentle...
 
 i have a zenith external floppy which has a db25 connector, and i'd
 like to use it with my sharp and toshiba laptops, which also take a
 db25 for their ext floppy, but it doesn't work.  i have the pinouts
 for the zenith, and would like to make adapters so i can use it.
 
 does anyone have pinouts for these or other manufacturers' db25 ext
 floppy connectors?  i would greatly appreciate this info, either by
 e-mail or fax.
 
 thanks very much,
