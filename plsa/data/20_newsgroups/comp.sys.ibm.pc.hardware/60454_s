 i have had a gateway telepath modem for about a month or so now.
 actually, i had one that wouldn't connect to anything no matter
 what software i used, so i got a new one sent to me.  this allows
 me to connect to my favorite news system with zero problems.  so
 i'm somewhat happier ....
 
 but i still cannot connect to my favorite dos bbs with any kind
 of reliability.  i have success about 1/10 calls.  not good!  i
 would hope that the fact that this one can connect to at least
 one of my fave places means i just need to adjust it.
 
 what i usually get is a fast stream of garbage, in the modem response
 line on the dial window. sometimes it will drop to full screen mode
 first, then i get about 2-3 screens of garbage.  in both cases the
 modem seems to time out before connecting and drops carrier.
 
 i am using default settings (at&f) and getting this problem.  i
 am using the autoconfigure settings that gateway has supplied with
 my copy of qmodem (atw1&c1&d2s95=44&w0) and getting this problem.
 (they have refused to help me beyond this, claiming "it must be
 the bbs" or something like that.  not so -- my work modem connects
 to this same place just fine, using factory settings -- a microcom.)
 
 anyone have any ideas?!
