 i have been using both ide (or mfm) and scsi drives for years.  i have 2
 ide and 1 scsi on one system and the other with 2 ide, 2 scsi disk, and 
 1 scsi cdrom.  i currently using always in2000 scsi card, but i also have
 a future domain, a western digital scsi card, and i work with an adaptic 
 before.  as i recall, all these cards can support boot and floppy drive.
 however, to use with other controller (ide, mfm...) the boot drive has to
 be the ide (or mfm).  you can not boot from the scsi if you have other 
 controller in the system.  if you guys only have 2 drives (1 ide, 1 scsi).
 just set up the ide in your cmos setup.  make sure you can boot from it.
 then, set up the scsi controller (irq, dma, etc). set the scsi drive to 
 id 0.  just plug and play for all the cards i seen so far.  only if you 
 have more than 2 drives then you need driver for the third drive and so
 on.  if you have more question, email me, i will try to answer it.
 good luck!
