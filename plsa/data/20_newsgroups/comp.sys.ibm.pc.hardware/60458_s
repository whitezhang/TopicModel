 i agree that the image is as sharp as it gets with these sony tubes,
 however in the 17" monitors using these tubes, the 2 annoying black
 lines on the top and bottom quarters of the tube, which are created due
 to the wires holding up the invar shadow mask, are quite annoying after
 a while.  that is the only thing that is making me lean more in favor
 of the nec 5fg (or now also available the nec 5fge - only difference,
 no accucolor ).  any experiences or opinions from people who have used
 the nec 5fg would be appreciated since i want to get one right after
 my exams are all done (ie: about a week from now).
