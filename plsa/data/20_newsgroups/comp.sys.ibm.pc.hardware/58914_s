 andrew, yes there is a dx and dx2 version of the 50mhz 486.  if you are 
 considering buying one or the other, definitely go for the dx with a nice 
 size external cache!  the performance is far greater.
 
 the dx2 only has the internal 8k cache to work with at 50mhz, while the dx 
 has a potentially much larger cache to work at 50mhz with.  neither 
 systems could actually run a program out of main memory, since dram is 
 still too slow for that high of bus speed ( 60ns = 16.66mhz < 50mhz ).
