 ide drives have jumpers on them to indicate if it is a master or a slave.
 if it is a master, then a second jumper indicates if a slave is present.
 these must be set correctly according to each drive's manufacturers spec-
 ification.  the cmos setup is almost positively not the problem.  it is
 probably not the controller - ide controllers all support exactly two
 drives maximum.  check those jumpers.
