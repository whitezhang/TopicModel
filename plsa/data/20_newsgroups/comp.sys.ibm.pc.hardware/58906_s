 i read a recent article in personal computer world mainly about the new
 digit audion formats (dcc and md) but at the end talked about how nice
 it would be to use these for data storage with a brief calculation of
 how much data you could store. the author had been talking to someone
 from sony about these formats and mentioned this to get the reply "md
 is a purely audio format, we wouldn't use it for data", then when
 pressed for info about mo the sony man basically admitted that it was
 no more than a slight adaptabtion on md!
 
 what i think the original poster was wanting was mo drives at md audio
 player prices. i'd assume that the problem here is that an md system
 can have higher tolerances than an mo system as the ear doesn't pick up
 the occasional bit error as well as an archiving program!
