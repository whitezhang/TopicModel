 not completly true.  for at class and later machines, irq5 is
 reserved for lpt2.  since it's rare to have a second parallel
 port in a pc, it's usually a good safe choice if you need an
 interrupt.
 
 on the other hand, we just ran into a problem with that here
 at work on a gateway computer (4dx-33v).  it has a modem on com1,
 a mouse on com2, and the other serial port was set to com3 (which
 normally uses the same interrupt as com1).  we had a real fight
 with a board when trying to use irq5, and discoverd the problem
 was that gateway had set it up such that com3 used irq5.  as soon
 as we disabled com3, our problems went away.  grumble ... after
 several days of trying to figure out why the interrupt didn't work.
