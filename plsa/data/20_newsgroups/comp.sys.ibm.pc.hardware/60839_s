  wm> the software is netware 286 level ii and i can see burnt on to the
  wm> screen sft netware 286 level ii v2.0a. however, to configure netware
  wm> for level ii (mirrored or duplexed disks) requires a second disk, yes? 
 
  yes.  mirroring requires a controller that is capable of writing to two
  disks at once.  duplexing, which is the preferred way of mirroring, uses
  two controller cards and two disk drives.  duplexing requires a special
  card and two identical disk drives (in most cases).  duplexing can
  sometimes be pulled off with slightly different drives/controllers, as long
  as the sizes are the same.
 
  wm> so how is the novell server 286a normally configured?
 
  the configuration is completely up to the user.
 
  wm> 1. can i install sft netware 286 level ii v2.0a as level i, or is this
  wm> what is causing my serialization error?
 
  if you only have one disk, then you can't use level ii sft.  however, the
  osobj disk has a serial number on it, and if this disk is for a different
  version of netware then you would get a serialization error.  make sure
  that this disk actually belongs to the rest of the set of floppies in the
  netware installation set.
 
  wm> 2. is the novell server 286a normally equipped with two hard drives,
  wm> one of which has failed?
 
  two drives could be either two netware volumes at sft i, or one volume
  mirrored using sft ii.  impossible to tell with the network being down.
 
  wm> 3. would this mean i can not install the network software because it
  wm> will not be serialized for this hardware with a failed drive?
 
  try disconnecting the failed drive, using a standard disk controller, and
  installing the software as one volume under sft i.  if the software will
  install, and if the one disk is functional, then it should be able to work
  in this configuration.
 
  wm> 4. what else can cause a serialization error?
 
  see the comment concerning the serial number on the osobj installation
  floppy.
 
  wm> 5. what happens if the keycard fails?
 
  what is the keycard attached to?
