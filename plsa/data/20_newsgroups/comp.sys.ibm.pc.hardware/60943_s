   close. universal asynchronous receiver transmitter.

    even if you are running dos, if your cpu can't handle the speed of the
 interrupts, you will still lose characters.  i have one 286/10 machine with
 an external 9600 bps modem attached and can't drive the serial port any faster 
 than 19.2k without losing characters.
