 hi,
 
 i just got a problem, i have a cheapo 2400bps modem which i use to connect
 to my university, but i get too much garbage on the screen. i do know it's
 because the noise in the line (i can actually hear it).  so my question is
 will an error correction protocol help to eliminate this garbage?, my modem
 doesn't have any of these on hardware, can a software implemented protocol
 do the trick?
 
 thanks.
