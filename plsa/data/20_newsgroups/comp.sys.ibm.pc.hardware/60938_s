 ibm, apple, motorola ready to unwrap powerpc 601 processor
 
 
 the wraps will come off the powerpc 601 processor this week, as motorola
 corp., ibm, and apple computer inc. detail the results of their yearlong
 effort. this first in a series of powerpc processors will be a 32-bit
 processor with a 64-bit memory interface, much like intel corp.'s
 pentium, with the capability of performing as many as three instructions
 per clock cycle, according to sources familiar with the chip. motorola
 is expected to release the chip in volume by year end in two
 configurations, running at 50 and 66 mhz with performance of 40 and 50
 specint89 marks, respectively, sources said. floating-point performance
 for the 3.6-volt processors will be even better, as their specfp89
 performance will be 60 and 80, respectively. the 601, a scaled-down
 version of the power 220 chip developed by ibm for its rs/6000
 workstations, will also include a 32k single buffered cache on the chip
 with protocols to support motorola's 64-bit multiprocessor 88110 bus
 built in. the chip, which is being designed initially to support the
 micro channel architecture, is bus independent, so vendors could develop
 powerpc- based systems using a number of different architectures,
 including isa, eisa, or sun microsystems inc.'s s-bus design, one source
 noted.
 
 according to sources familiar with the development effort, motorola has
 been extremely successful in developing the powerpc as an inexpensive
 architecture, despite a complex design made up of more than 2.8 million
 transistors using a 0.6-micron technology. initial chips are expected to
 be priced from $300 to $400 -- only slightly higher than intel corp.'s
 486 processors -- but could be sold profitably for less than $100, one
 source said.
