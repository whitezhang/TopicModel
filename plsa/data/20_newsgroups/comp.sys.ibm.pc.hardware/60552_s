 most importantly, which winbench version are you using?  on my local bus ati
 graphics ultra pro, i've gotten various winbench scores from 15.8 million to
 31 million winmarks, depending on the version.  winbench 2.5 gives the most
 optimistic scores, 3.11 gives the least.  a winmark rating is meaningless
 without a corresponding version number.
