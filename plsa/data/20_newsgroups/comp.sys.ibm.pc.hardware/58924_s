 no rumour, ibm's clock tripling chip was seen in some trade show last
 fall (comdex or something, i wasn't there). all you people who are
 drooling after this chip do realize that it has no fpu, just like
 486sx, that evil marketing ploy(tm) from intel, don't you? it has 16k
 of internal cache, which probably is where the saved silicon real
 estate went. because of some contract, ibm is not allowed to sell its
 486 chips to third parties, so these chips are unlikely to become
 available in any non-ibm machines. of course, nothing prevents other
 companies from implementing a dx3/99, but nobody hasn't even come out
 with a real 486dx (fpu and all) clone yet (although amd soon will).
