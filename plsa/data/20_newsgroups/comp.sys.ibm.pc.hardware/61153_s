 i got a et4000/w32 card which is made by cardex yesterday
 and ran a winmark test on it. the card is a vl-bus card which
 can display 16.7 million colours in 640x480 mode with 1mb dram.
 
 it comes with et4000/w32 window drivers and a normal et4000 drivers.
 the et4000/w32 drivers handles, 640x480, 800x600, 1024x786 in 256 colours.
 also, in 640x480 and 800x600, it supports hicolor, 32k and 64k colours.
 
 here is my winmark result running on a 16mb 486dx33 eisa/vl-bus system using
 hint chipsets.
 
 winmark 3.11 from zd lab.
 
 using et4000/w32 drivers
 640x480 256       10.63 megapixel/sec.
         32k        7.34 
         64k        7.30
 800x600 256       10.07
         32k        6.38
         64k        6.35
 1kx786  256        8.17
 
 using et4000 drivers.
 640x480 16m        1.78
 800x600  16colours 4.01     
 1kx786   16        4.22
 
 from the result, the et4000/w32 drivers are specialized to use the
 hardware feature of the et4000/w32 chip whereas the et4000 drivers are
 just normal driver for et4000 based graphics card.
 
 the price of this graphics card that i got is $185 from a local dealer.
 it may be less from mail order. it has os/2 2.0 drivers comes with it
 which supports 256 colors on all resolution.
 
 from these results, it has double the performance of a et4000ax based card
 in 256 colours mode.
