 	actually there is an s3-based card on the market that supports
 	multiple adapters in one system. unfortunately, it is vl-bus
 	only (they may have an isa version by now...?) from a company
 	called metheus. the address and phone number is:
 
 			metheus corp
 			ogc science park
 			1600 nw compton dr.
 			beaverton, or  97006-6905
 			(503)-690-1550
 	be aware, this is a very high-end card, capable of 4mb of vram,
 	so it does not come cheap. but, i have personally seen two of
 	these boards running a dual screen windows 3.1.
