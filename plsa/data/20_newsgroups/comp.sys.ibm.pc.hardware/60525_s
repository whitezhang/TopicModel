 hi!
 
    i'm busy resurrecting some old machines (hey, they're cheap and they
 work :)) and would be grateful for any help with the following card -
 
 magitronic - full length 8 bit memory only card.
 has room for 8 rows of 256k dips for a total of 2mb ram.
 has an 8 position dip switch on it, presumably for addressing.
 
 does any kind soul out there have any docs or drivers for this beast?
 i'd be disgustingly grateful.
 
                             thanks,
                                     lee.
