 i have the same question as guido. it is possible to use the esdi drive as a master and the ide drive as the slave ? 
 at the moment , i have been using the esdi drive and recently i bought a ide drive to use as the 2nd drive . 
 the person in the computer shop told me that it is not possible to run 2 disk controller cards together on the same motherboard ( esdi and ide ) but i think there might be some way of making them work. can anybody enlighten me on this?
 and it is possible to  run a esdi hdd using a ide controller? or vice versa?
 can anybody please help me out on this?
 your help will be very much appreciated.
