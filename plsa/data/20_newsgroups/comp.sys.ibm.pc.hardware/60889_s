 i ran a 386-33 out of a cardboard box for more than a year with no
 major effects (yeah, no case at all, mb sitting on a static bag)
 other than the noise from the poersupply it ran pretty good.
 as for cooling problems i bought a 12-14 inch fan and  turned
 it on full and set the output directly on the motherboard.
 
 i did finally get a case though and i am still running the parts
 with no ill effects.
 
 i also had no kids to spill things on the mb> i had no cat leaving
 hair on the mb etc. etc. on and on....
 
 the two major concerns are keeping static away and keeping the mb cool
 enjoy
