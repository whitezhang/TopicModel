 [much discussion about switching 5.25" and 3.5" drives removed]
 
 another (albeit strange) option is using a program like 800 ii
 (available via anonymous ftp at many major sites), or fdformat
 (also available via anonymous ftp), that allows you to format
 5.25hd disks to 1.44meg, or 3.5"hd disks to 1.2meg (along with
 many many other formats!) so you can diskcopy (yes, the broken
 messy-dos diskcopy!) the 5.25" disks onto 3.5" disks or vice
 versa...  i use this techniques with "non-dos" self-booting 
 game disks on my old tandy 1000, and it works...  another program
 named teledisk (shareware--available on many major bbs's) will
 also make the weird format disks, provided you have 800 ii
 or fdformat installed....  some disks that won't diskcopy
 properly can be readily teledisk'd into the proper format...
 at least this is a software solution for a hardware/bios 
 deficiency, eh?
