 hello,
 
 in the edn magazine i found a note about the new c&t 82c735
 i/o controller. it support several parallel port protocols,
 including
 	fast centronics
 	microsoft enhanced capabilities protocol (ecp)
 	enhanced parallel port (epp)
 the last two handle data rates up to 2mbytes/sec.
 
 is there any specification about these protocols available?
 
 regards,
