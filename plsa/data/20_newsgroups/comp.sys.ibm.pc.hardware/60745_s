    you might try asking on one of the comp.sys.ibm.* echos (the best one
 may be comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware).  i say this because the conversion
 seems more geared toward a pc user wanting to use that monitor, than
 an atari user who already can use the monitor (unless maybe they
 want to really go wild - converting the monitor to vga, then
 using it as a vga monitor with a falcon :-)
 
    as for graphics cards, assuming that the atari monitor can be
 modified/adapted to handle vga signals, you should probably be able
 to use any vga card (at least with a res around 640x400).  i haven't
 tried this, but that would be my guess...

 ...you might want to price mono vga monitors anyways - it may be cheaper
 to go that route than to do the conversion; besides, with the falcon and
 beyond, vga/svga/multisync monitors will probably be the way to go...
