 i thought this was a neat feature until i noticed that
 when an image is re-sized, the scanning frequency is
 necessarily changed.  this causes digital multiscan
 monitors like my mag mx17f to get confused as to which
 mode to use if the frequency gets too far from the
 standard selections.  for this reason, i use the
 "factory defaults" for position/size on the ati card
 and adjust each mode individually (only the first time)
 at the monitor.  the mag (and many other multiscan
 monitors) has (have) the ability to recall these settings
 the next time each mode is "detected".
