 the temp on my 486dx2/66 is over 96c (measured with a k-type thermocouple 
 and fluke 55 dig thermometer).  this is an "idle" temp - not doing lots of
 bus i/o, not doing floating point, not doing 32-bit protected mode etc.  this
 is in a micron computer, without heatsink.
 
 i recently put a heatsink/fan on the chip, but i might take the fan off.  it
 makes a horrible whine at times, and i wonder what the vibration is doing to
 the pins on the cpu etc...
