 
 diamond video cards (stealth, viper, speedstar, etc...) 
 may have excellent specifications, and the windows drivers that
 come with them might make windows blindingly fast, but:
 
 if you're considering buying a system, with a view to using
 it to run unix (linux, bsd, etc...) or some other special software,
 there is a good chance that it will not work with the diamond cards.
 this is due to diamond's propriety attitude to it's hardware:
 it's impossible to get free information from them about their chips 
 (specifically their dot-clocks) without paying, and signing non-disclosure
 agreements.
 
 this made it impossible for the free software foundation to provide
 x-windows compatibility with these cards, as diamond didn't want to 
 divulge programming neccessities.
 
 as far as i know only diamond has this propriety on it's info.
 
 
 mark.
