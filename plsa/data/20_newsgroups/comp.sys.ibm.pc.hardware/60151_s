 i was recently loaned an older dec 210 286 at work, and i have the option
 of adding an additional western digital hard-drive to the machine.  the
 existing drive is currently a western digital as well, and is working fine,
 but i do not have any documentation available for configuring the master/slave
 relationship necessary for a c: d: drive setup.
 
 the first drive is currently formatted to tandy dos v3.3 but i am eventually
 going to upgrade both to ms dos v 5.0
 
 the drives themselves are both model number wd95044-a circa 5-07-1991
 they are 782 cyl 4 head drives.  a note to add is that there is no exact
 configuration for these in my current bios, but it seems to work at a
 setting 17 (977 cyl 5 head, 300 write_pre, 977 landing zone).
 there are three pairs of jumper pins on the back that i presume are
 for setting up the master/slave.  originally, the drive in the machine
 had none.  currently, i was suggested to try the far right (looking at the
 back) for master and the middle jumper for the slave.
 
 when booted, the reinitialize seems to puke accessing the d: drive.  it does
 flicker about three times on the second drive, but then gives the error.  
 hopefully the problem is as simple as the drive not being formatted, but not
 being a person who has ever had to actual format and unformatted drive, i
 would not even know how to do that.
 
 any and all help on this is great fully appreciated.  if not, a number
 for western digital might just do as good!
