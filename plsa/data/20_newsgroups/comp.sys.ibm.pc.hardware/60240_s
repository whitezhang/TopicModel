 i've been intently following the mag thread while waiting for
 mine to arrive in the mail. there seems to be a lot of
 complaints about minor alignment problems with the mx15f. one
 article contained a comment that the owner called the factory
 and was told that his screen rotation was within spec (1/4").
 
 well, my monitor arrived last night and, sure enough, it has
 a very noticable barrel distortion. it's not dramatic, but it
 is there and it is especially noticable when the image doesn't
 fill the entire screen. the fact that it is worse on the right
 side doesn't help matters.
 
 what i'm trying to find out is if these minor imperfections
 are the norm or are most of their monitors perfect? i don't want
 to send it back and get one with the same or an even worse
 problem. does the factory consider this kind of thing normal
 and ship their monitors with less than perfect alignment? 
 are other netters just living with these kind of imperfections?
