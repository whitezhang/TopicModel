 the last i heard, the author was having some problems in his immediate
 family and had delayed the continuation of development for a time.
 this was some months ago.
 
 it's a shame.  the driver is the best memory manager i have found
 anywhere.  it doesn't require v8086 mode (like qemm) so it works with
 ultima 7.  it doesn't take any memory (runs, then exits).
 
 if only the emm provider were a little faster and more stable.
