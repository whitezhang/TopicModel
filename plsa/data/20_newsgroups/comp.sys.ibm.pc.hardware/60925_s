 
 has anyone connected a high-res, fixed frequency monitor to their pc?
 i have a mitubishi monitor that does 1024x768 at 60hz, but won't do
 any other resolutions.  all the video cards designed for this sort of
 thing are very expensive (>$400).  has anyone done it with an svga
 card (i know it can be done, it's just a question of getting the card
 at the right resolution and frequency)?  i'd like to use a mono
 (hercules) monitor as my dos/command line monitor, and switch to the
 mitsu for windows or x-windows (under linux or 3bsd).
 
 any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  e-mail, please.
 
 thanks,
