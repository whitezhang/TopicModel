 i've noticed a recent proliferation of 1 gig scsi-2 3.5" drives, in
 particular, the fujitsu 2694 and the micropolis 2112. there is also the
 maxtor lxt1240s (6100 rpm, 1.2 gig) drive. they are all quite cheap,
 and have nice 3-5 year warranties. 
 
 my questions are: is there a catch?
                   which one is better?
                   what type of scsi-2 do these drives use?
                   is the service generally better for one of these     
          
                   manufacturers?
                   are prices likely to go down soon for any reason?
 
 thanks,
