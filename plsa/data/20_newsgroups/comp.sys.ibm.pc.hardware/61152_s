 i'm writing a driver that needs to remap some i/o ports.  this means
 virtual mode.  unfortunately virtual mode means it won't get along
 with expanded memory managers, so i need make it an emm driver too.
 
 does anyone out there have emm code.  can any point me to an emm code source?
 
 -thanks, morgan
