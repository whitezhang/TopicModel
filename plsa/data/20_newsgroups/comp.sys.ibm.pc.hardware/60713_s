 i've been troubleshooting the existence of way too many general protection
 faults on a 486-33, eisa-vlb, system.  at this point i think i've narrowed
 the problem down to the video drivers for the volante warp-10 adapter by
 national design, inc.
 
 yet somehow i find this hard to believe.  does anyone else have any
 experiences with this board.
 
 thanx,
