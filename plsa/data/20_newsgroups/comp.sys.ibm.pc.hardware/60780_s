 you unfortunately failed to mention if the error occurs with the parity error
 checking enabled or disabled.  i assume you mean it gives you a parity error
 when it's enabled, and not when it's disabled.  how high will the count go on
 the memory check at boot-up before this error occurs?  does the system beep
 at all; if so what's the pattern of beeps?  the error could be occuring in
 cache memory (not so likely) or video memory, as well as the simms.
 
 the fact that you have ami bios is not conclusive in determining the board
 manufacturer either.  boards are made by thousands of small taiwanese companies
 (among others) that buy the name brand chips and put them together with some
 simm sockets to make your board.  i tend to doubt your problem is with your
 ide controller, also.
 
 anyway, perhaps if you answer those questions someone can help you out better.
