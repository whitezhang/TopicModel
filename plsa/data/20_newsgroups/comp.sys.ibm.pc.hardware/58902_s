 help....
 
 i need to implement com3 and com4 on a board that i'm designing and i'm
 finding it dificult to track down a definition (hardware that is) of com3
 and com4.
 
 i have the io adresses and the fact that com3 shares irq4 with com1 and com4
 shares irq3 with com2, except exactly how this irq sharing is done is not
 clear especially if the existing com1/2 does not allow irq sharing. does the
 standard??? allow for a different irq to be used and if so how.
 
 please answer by email to :-
