 hi! i recently got hold of an old/obsolete pc. first thing i am trying to do
 with it, is making it work. seems the switches in the back have been toggled
 since last it was used, and i do not have the manual.
 can anybody help me to identify this beast, and mail me the prober switch-settings?
 all i know is that is is a bondwell 38, made in 1986, most likely a 286,
 can be toggled between 4.77 and 8 mhz, and looks like no changes have been made.
 any information would be appreciated.
