 there would be no problems as long as the os didn't set up a dma transfer
 to an area above the 16 mb area (the dma controller probably can't be
 programmed that way anyways, so there probably isin't a problem with this)
 
 besides, like i said before, the fdd controller uses dma channel #2.
 and i don't yet believe that the hdd controllers (any of them, mfm, rll,
 etc) don't also use dma.
