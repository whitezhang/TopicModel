 
 a weird thing has happened to my computer lately,
 it gets locked (stops doing anything) at any instance
 without any reason whatsover. i might be using 
 edit and gets locked, or i might be at the prompt
 at the same occurs. it happens almost once every 3 times
 i connect the computer, does anyone have the slight idea
 what's wrong with it?
 
 (if i try to use ctrl-alt-del after that, no response. i have
 to turn it off and back on again)
 
 thanks. any help will be really appreciated.
 
 e-mail if possible as sometimes i can't access this service.
