 {do these cpu fans also have heat sinks?  do you recommend using both
 {on the same chip (i.e. heat sink sandwiched between cpu and fan)?

 i have a pc power and cooling fan and it is a heat sink with a built in fan 
 that glues on top of the cpu.  even if the fan quits you still have the heat 
 sink fins to aid cooling.  the glue, of course, is the type that has high 
 thermal conductivity.
