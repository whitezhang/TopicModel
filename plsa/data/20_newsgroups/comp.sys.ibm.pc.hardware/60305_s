 i think the original respondent (guy dawson?) was refering to something
 much more elementary.
 
 every partition (whether it is the entire disk or not) has two fats and
 an initial directory.
 
 if you have a small disk (50 meg or less), i would recommend that it remain
 a single partition. unless you have some other consideration.
 
 if you have a large disk (greater than 200 meg), multiple partitions can
 make sense.
