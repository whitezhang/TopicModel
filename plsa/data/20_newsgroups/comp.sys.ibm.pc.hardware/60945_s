 
 
 help!  i am trying to view .jpg files with my 386sx, 20mhz machine
 .  i have a stb-powergraph graphics card with 1024 x 768 by 256 colors,
 with 1meg ram on it.
 
 i have tried cview097 (with windows-- extremely slow), and dvpeg24.
 dvpeg24 doesn't work!  even if i pick a lot of the "modes" that are
 supported by powergraph (so it says in the manual), it doesn't work
 when i try to view a picture... it only buzzes.
 
 anyone out there that can help me; give me suggestions?
 
 i would really appreciate it!
 
 thanks!
