 aaahhhh!!!!!  please someone tell me what i have done!!!
 
 my 40 meg miniscribe (8450at) has a big sticker on the side that says
 
 ***do not rotate interrupter** --->  (big knob here)
 
 a big knob sticking off the side of the drive is pretty hard not to turn
 when removing the drive!
 
 i turned it.   now the drive won't spin up!  even with no data or controller
 cables plugged in.. just power... it won't spin up!!
 
 please help!  
 
 thanks
