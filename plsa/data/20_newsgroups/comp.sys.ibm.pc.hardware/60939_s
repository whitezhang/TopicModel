 we are talking about a scsi-1 device (e.g. hd) on a scsi-2 controller.
 
 here is a rewrite of my mac & info sheet scsi section:
 scsi: only external device expansion interface common to both mac and ibm.
  allows the use of any device: hard drive, printer, scanner, nubus card 
  expansion {mac plus only}, some monitors, and cd-rom.  normal {asynchronous}
  scsi is 5 mhz;  fast {synchronous} scsi is 10 mhz.  difference between these
  modes is mainly in the software drivers.
  main problem:  there are a lot of external devices which are internal 
  terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the scsi port 
  {a scsi chain is supposed to be terminated only at the begining and end. 
  any other set up causes problems for either mac or ibm}. 
 scsi-1:  8-bit; 7 devices per scsi controller.  asynchronous {~1.5mb/s ave}
  and synchronous {5mb/s max} transfers.  8-bit scsi-2 is often mistaken for
  a fast version of scsi-1 {see scsi-2 for details}.
 scsi-2: fully scsi-1 compliant. scsi-2 mode - 10 devices per scsi controller.
  8-bit scsi-2 is implimented as a very fast scsi-1 since it can run using
  scsi-1 hardware and software drivers which limits it to 7 devices, which
  results in it sometimes being mistakenly consitered part of scsi-1.  16-bit
  and 32-bit scsi-2 require different ports, electronics, and scsi software
  drivers from scsi-1 {which makes them more expensive than other scsi
  interfaces}.  32-bit scsi seems to run only in synchronous mode, hence term
  'wide and fast scsi' transfer speeds are 4-6mb/s with 10mb/s burst {8-bit},
  8-12mb/s with 20mb/s burst {16-bit}, and 15-20mb/s with 40mb/s burst
  {32-bit}.
 
 8-bit scsi-2 is the biggest headache due to the fact that it is the only scsi-2 
 that i know of that can pump scsi-2 speeds through scsi-1 devices and software
 controlers.  its main implimentation is on the mac though you do see adds
 for scsi-2 at 10mb/s maximum throughput for pcs.  since 8-bit scsi-2 does not
 need all the hardware {including electonics} and software of 16-bit and 32-bit
 scsi-2 it is the cheepest of the scsi-2 interfaces.  just pop out the scsi-1
 electornics and pop in 8-bit scsi-2 electronics.  some people consider
 16-bit where scsi-2 really starts {i used to be one of them} but
 4-6mb/s average though put with a theoretical burst of 10mb/s is not scsi-1
 but is 8-bit scsi-2.
 rule of thumb: if it is scsin and over 5mb/s then it is some type of scsi-2.
 
 8-bit scsi can use part of scsi-1 electronics which further reduces its cost
 compared to 16 and 32-bit scsi-2.
