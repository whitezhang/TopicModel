 connecting devices
 ------------------
  
   normally, a 7 wire connection is used. connect:
         gnd1    to    gnd2
 	rxd1    to    txd2
 	txd1    to    rxd2
 	dtr1    to    dsr2
 	dsr1    to    dtr2
 	rts1    to    cts2
 	cts1    to    rts2
   if a modem is connected, add lines for the following:
         ri, dcd
   if software wants it, connect dcd1 to cts1 and dcd2 to cts2.
   beware! while pcs use pin 2 for rxd and pin 3 for txd, modems normally
 have those pins reversed! this allows to easily connect pin1 to pin1, pin2
 to pin 2 etc. if you connect two pcs, cross rxd and txd.
  
   if hardware handshaking is not needed, a so-called null-modem connection
 can be used. connect:
         gnd1    to    gnd2
 	rxd1    to    txd2
 	txd1    to    rxd2
 additionally, connect (if software needs it):
         rts1    to    cts1 & dcd1
 	rts2    to    cts2 & dcd2
 	dtr1    to    dsr1
 	dtr2    to    dsr2
 you won't need long wires for these!
   the null-modem connection is used to establish an xon/xoff-transmission
 between two pcs (see software section for details).
   remember: the names dtr, dsr, cts & rts refer to the lines as seen from
 the pc. this means that for your data set dtr & rts are incoming signals
 and dsr & cts are outputs!
