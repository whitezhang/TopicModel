 another possibility is, that you did not give your email address as password
 for the anonymous account. if you that, you see following message:
 
 230-
 230-you entered an invalid/inpropable password, and are now accessing
 230-restricted subset of files.    please read readme for more information.
 230-we have special access features, see file readme
 230 it was last updated tue apr 13 23:45:09 1993 - 9.4 days ago
 
 this can happen, if your terminal emulator does not generate the '@'
 character as you think (it is hard to see, since passwords are not echoed..).
