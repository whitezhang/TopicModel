 
 hello,
 
 i'am almost ashame to ask this question. it really looks like a faq, but couldn't
 find the answer. anyway...
 
 the original ibm-pc/xt 83 or 84 key keyboard is, in my opinion, still the best
 keyboard around. function keys on the right place (eh.. left place), firm click,
 etc. is there any chance to connect one of these to a modern 386 at clone?
 
 i do understand that the new at keyboard has more functionality. i.e. the
 typematic repeat rate is programmable etc. it seams to me that the pins &
 electrical specs. of the old and the new keyboard are, however, the same. 
 maybe the communication protocol is different? 
 
 please answer by e-mail. also if you can tell me that is absolutely impossible.
 in that case, i will bring the keyboard the museum of obsolete technology.
 
 thanks,
 
 duco
