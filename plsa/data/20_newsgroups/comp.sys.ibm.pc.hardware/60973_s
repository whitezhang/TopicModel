 my 486dx2-50 has 8mb of 70ns ram and a trident svga card. sometimes i feel it
 runs very slowly, especially when running windows.
 
 i'm planning to buy an ati graphic ultra + next semester. is that all i need
 to get the problem solved? is 70ns ram chips too slow for my machine? do faster
 ram chips make a big difference?
 
 i use cad software on my computer as well. do those up-grades good enough to
 speed it up a lot? any one experienced the difference between isa bus and vl bus(both with a graphic accelerator)?
 
 (a scsi controller may not be appropriate, since i may have to replace my hard
 disks as well. however, sometimes i do have huge files on my computer. does
 
 
 
 it really worth to use a scsi interface? i can't spend too much on  it)
 
 t he )
 
 
 
 any help will be appreciated. thanks in advance.
