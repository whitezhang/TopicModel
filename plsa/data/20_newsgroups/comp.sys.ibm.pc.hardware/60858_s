 no.  the simple $25 style ide controller does not use dma.  the cpu performs
 the data transfer with a string move instruction.  this requires that the
 cpu stop what it had been doing and transfer the data.  only the smart drive
 controllers, be they ide or scsi, can transfer via dma.  these controllers
 tend to cost the same wether they are ide or scsi.  to get the dma benefits,
 ide must sacrifice it's price advantage *on the controller*.

 floppies aren't on the ide bus, your arguement makes no sense, this isn't
 an ide issue.  the floppys have their own processor on their controller
 board which handles all of these commands.
 
 the difference between ide and scsi is that all scsi peripherials are
 intelligent.  they each have their own controller.  they depend on the
 cpu to do fewer things for them, i.e. ide drives needing a processor
 to transfer their data.

 the dettach/callback mechanism alows the cpu to make requests of the 
 devices on the scsi bus and then dettach and go about its business.
 later, when the device is done, it issues a callback to say that the
 data has arrived or the function has completed.  most scsi cards will
 also dma the data into memory without the interupting the cpu, therefore
 allowing it to continue working uninterupted.  ide supports no such concept
 as dettach/callback.  
 
 can you see how this would be a win in any multitasking system?
