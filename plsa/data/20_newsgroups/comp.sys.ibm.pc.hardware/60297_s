 you'll probably get one when you realize that your $100 vesa super
 dooper local bus ultra high tech controller sucks...

 with any luck pc bus archeitecture will be doen any with by sbus.
 
 have you ever seen what happens when you hook a busmaster controller to
 a vesa local bus.  it actually  slows down your system

 maybe my workstation doesn't understand what your vesa local bus
 ide is
 
 vesa local bus will be killed off by pcmi? whatever intels spec is.
 vlbus it not good for much more than vga cards.
 
 to each his own.  i'll laugh when you start crying over how much you
 spent for your 2 little ide drives and then finding out you need more
 space.

 don't stick your foot in your mouth when you make a statement you know
 nothing about.
 
 
 i'd rather wait a second compared to the 5 minutes and ide would take.
 (obviously exaggerated).
 
 have you ever tried to backup 2 gigs of disk?  oh i forgot you can't
 because you have an ide and no one makes ide disks that big.

 i guess you probably bought a 486sx too

 what?  the scsi-2 fast,wide spec has much more bandwidth than any stupid
 vlbus ide crap....
 
 stop this thread now, its just cluttering up bandwidth.  if you want
 to read about scsi vs ide just pay a visit to you local usenet archive.
 
 the best scsi-2 fast,wide,etc is clearly faster than any the best ide drive.
 all the response given are based upon personal experience with 1 or 2
 drives.  you can't judge such completely different interfaces.  
 ide has the low cost adavantage + a descent performance.
 scsi has the ability for super high capacity expandibility and speed.
 
 neither one is better in all cases.
 
 if you don't belive what i said about busmastering and vlbus then pick
 up a back issue of pc-week in whihc they tested vlbus, eisa and isa
 busmastering cards.
 
 send flames to /dev/null.....
