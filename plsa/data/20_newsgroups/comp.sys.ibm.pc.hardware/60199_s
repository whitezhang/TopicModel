 hi!
 
 i have a problem with my floppy drives. in an effort to make my 3.5" drive 
 (normally b:) my a: drive, i switched the order of connections on the cable 
 from the serial card/floppy/ide controller. i booted up, changed the cmos
 settings to reflect the a: drive as the 3.5 and the b: drive as the 5.25.
 the drive lights didn't come on, and there was a failure trying to read from
 those drives.
 
 i switched the cables back to their original positions, and then booted-up and
 restored the original cmos settings. the lights for the floppies came on
 during this process, and they stay on for as long as the computer is on.
 i see that when there is a disk in a:, the drive is spinning, yet there seems
 to be no disk access. msd.exe and norton si detect both drives, but when i 
 try to get detailed information about a: or b:, norton si tells me that there
 is no disk in the drive.
 
 can anyone offer any suggestions?
 i'm in desperate need of help!!!
 
 thank you for your time.
