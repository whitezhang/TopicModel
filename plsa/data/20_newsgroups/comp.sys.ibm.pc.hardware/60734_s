 have you checked: 1/ the setting of drive a: to 1.44 m floppy.
 						2/ the setting of drive b: to 1.2 m foppy.
 						3/ the cable connecting the two drives to
 						the controller card (i can't remember which
 						two wires are swapped, but they determine
 						which is drive a: & b:).
 
 i hope this is of some help :-)
