 
 i asked for opinions yesterday on gateway machines. all
 the e-mail i received indicated that they were solid,
 reliable machines and technical support was very good.
 
 well, gateway faxed me a price sheet just now. it seems
 to be on the higher side, but then again, maybe not.
 dell's price for a similar price is a whole lot more.
 is this a decent deal? please advise via email!
