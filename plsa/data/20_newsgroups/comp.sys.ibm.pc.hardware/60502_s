 i'm not sure if this will work, but how about using one of those 't' expanders
 used in the low-profile cases.  they allow 3-5 slots staggered on either
 side of the card.  you can install it in the last slot, and then (probably) 
 have 2 or 3 sideways slots.  this is actually how it is done in the low
 profile cases - a standard motherboard, the 't' connector in one slot, 
 and the expansion cards plugged into the 't'.  i guess you could do this at 
 each end of the slots (1 & 8) to add even more.  
 
 the 't' connectors are simply tracks with slots on them - no electronics
 on it.  the only downside - your case won't close, but for a homebrew system,
 that may not be a problem.
 
 don't know about performance, though.  i'll leave that discussion to the 
 engineers.
