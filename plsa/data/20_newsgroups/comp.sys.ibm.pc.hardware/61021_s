 i have had a scsi and ide drive working together for some years now.
 scsi is supposedly pretty transparent to other types of drives
 (esdi,rll,ide,etc) - but oftentimes you need to get the correct drivers
 to get it to work with odd environments.
 
 for information purposes, i had:
 
 st-01 card + st296n drive and a maxtor 212a drive with generic ide
 controller running together. i have also had the same scsi setup work
 in combination with a rll drive, the st251-1 drive.
