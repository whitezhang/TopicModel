 i have been using a nec 3fgx for several months now.  several others here 
 also have this monitor.  we have had no problems.  personally i would spend 
 extra money for this monitor and sacrifice other features on a pc such as 33 
 mhz viz 50 mhz.  based on the comments of others you might want to view the 
 3fgx vs the 4 series on a pc running windows at 1024x768.  the refresh rate 
 appears ok for me, but you might feel differently.  finally speaking of 
 spending money, with the size of today's files, etc, a tape backup is 
 certainly worth $200-$300.  recently i set up a friend's pc 50mhz and vesa 
 local bus.  the redraw time for a graphics program was only a factor of 2 
 faster which i doubt warrants the extra cost.
