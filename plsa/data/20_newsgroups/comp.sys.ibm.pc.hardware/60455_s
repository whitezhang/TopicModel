   the one i got only does about 4kb/s in text and 320x200 (vga/mcga) mode,
 which is almost identical to the other w5186 based cards (ati 68800
 does about 6kb/s).  this is weird since the orchid supposedly should
 be much faster (and i was told by someone that it can do almost 16 kb/s),
 since the vga chip is covered by the orchid label, i can't really tell
 for sure if it uses a 5286 chip, but the spec. sheet that comes with
 the board (no docs!) did say it has 1 meg dram and uses a 5286 chip.
 winmarks (3.11) is about 4 mil. slower than a viper (34 vs ~38) using
 standard palette.
 
   btw if anyone is insterested, i'm trying to sell a diamond viper (2 megs
 vram) for a friend for $300, email if interested (i'm too broke to
 take it myself).
 
 >also, is the ami p9000-based card real?  what does it use for vga?  speed?
 
   i think it's available in limited quantites.  no idea of what vga
 chip it uses though.
 
   be very careful with oem p9000 boards though, the orchid i got
 for example only has a readme file on disk that serve as 
 documentation, and conflicts the hell with my vlb controller 
 card (or maybe it's my motherboard, an a.i.r. 486 vlb)
