  computers are a special case.. and it's a pretty good idea to
  leave them on.. cuz everytime you turn on a computer, you're 
  putting a surge of electricity through its delicate components.
   imagine you're turning on your computer 5 or more times a day.
  you're increasing the chances of damaging the chips, memory,
  etc on all the components of your computer. so you may save
  a few cents here and there in electricity bills, but it won't
  look like much when it come time to fix your computer.
