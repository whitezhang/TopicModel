 i purchased a super voyager vlb 33mhz board from washburn & company a month ago.
 i don't have the mailing address-- clyde washburn advertises regularly in pc week.  he can also be reached via compuserve.    the phone number is    
 1-800-836-8027.
 
 i think washburn has very competitive prices compared to other ami distributers,plus i liked  the fact he's a ee that knows what he's talking about
 concerning hardware, and he can be easily reached via compuserve for non  
 critcle questions, and is very informative to his customers over the phone.
