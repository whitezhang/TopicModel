     i've been using the build59 drivers on a gw2k 4dx2-66v for several
 weeks with no problems. i'm running windows in 1024x758 and all software
 i've run has worked fine. this includes many games and the cd-based 
 multi-media encyclopedia, on which the full-motion video works fine.
 i'd recommend you give them a try.
