 just curious why floptical drives never seemed to catch on. remember
 those 21 mb disks that look and feel like 3.5" floppies? these drives
 are scsi devices and can read and write both 720 kb and 1.44/21 mb
 disks. sounds to me to be one great product for the pc market. are the
 prices really that unaffordable compared to cd-roms which are currently
 not rewritable? i know about the new rewritable cds and expect sony to
 develop the first mds for the computer. my question is: why isn't there
 any substantial interest in developing the flopticals?
 
 just a thought.
