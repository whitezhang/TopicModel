 i have a logitech 2s-2f (or 2f-2s) 2-button mouse that i want to
 interface to a serial port of a different (non-ibm-compatible) system.
 the mouse is xt/at/ps2 compatible, with a db25 connector.  i tried
 to reverse engineer the mouse, but it has a micro-controller inside
 it.
 
 if i could get the db25 pin-out, and perhaps a copy of the bios routines
 that support it, i could map all this into my target system?
 
 anyone know where i might get the pin-out or the bios routines?
 are the routines published someplace convenient?
 
 thanks!
