 
 help!  i really got ripped off and i need some help unripping myself.
 
 i bought a maxtor 4380 300mb esdi hdd from hi-tech for $300, then paid to
 get it repaired, for about another $300.  here's the deal:  the thing works
 fine!  it low level formats, etc without any bad spots at all!  and then...
 (jaws music) sectors start going bad!  eek!!!  one at a time.  norton disk
 doctor keeps marking some u and some c.  that fixes it.  for about 5 minutes.
 
 then next day when i run ndd on it again: no dice more uncorrectable and
 correctable sectors.  ahhhhhuuuurrrrrrggggghhhhh!!!!!  so i fugure: "ok, ndd's
 just not being thurough enough, i'll use spinrite, i heard that works well."
 what happens?  spinrite goes and returns the clusters to active use!!!  
 ahhhuuuurrrrrrggggghhhh!!!!  ndd undoes it of course.  the problem seams to
 be getting worse and worse.  however when the hdd is low level formatted
 again the problem goes away for a while, only to return in a day or so.
 
 i'm so pissed off right now i'm considering buying another hdd, and i really
 can't afford it.
 
 i'm using smartdrive, and windows 3.1 (i'm not using the 32 bit disk access
 though, i know that can create problems).  the disk is using the second
 option to trick the controller into thinking it's got less then 1024 cyls,
 and everything else selected is standard, maybe i need to use a different
 head skew or something?  i don't know.
 
 anyone who knows how to fix this problem please tell me how!!!! help!!!!
