      here's a document that i wrote some time back.  it's slightly
 out-of-date, now that dos 6 has been released, but much of it is still
 useful.

           hints and tips for the adaptec 1540/1542 scsi adapter
 
 
      this document contains hints and tips for getting the adaptec
 1540/1542 scsi adapter to work with various hardware and software
 packages.  they are based upon my experiences with an adaptec 1542a
 controller, and will, hopefully, help others.  however, note that i
 cannot guarantee that the following will really help you (it works for
 me), and the information in this document could possibly cause you to
 lose some or all of your files on your hard disk.
 
      important!  back up the entire contents of your hard disk before
 trying anything based upon information in this document.

 ***** windows 3.1 enhanced mode:
 
      the windows 3.1 install program should automatically configure dos
 and windows for use with the adaptec 1542.  however, just in case
 something went wrong, i'm going to describe some of the changes needed
 to get windows 3.1 working with the 1542.  also, you may have noticed
 that installing windows 3.1 makes your pc run much slower, even when
 you're not running windows; methods of speeding it up are discussed in
 the section called, "windows 3.1 runs slowly".
 
 
 * msdos configuration:
 
      the windows install program adds the smartdrive disk cache to your
 config.sys and autoexec.bat files.  if you follow the instructions,
 you'll notice that you'll need to use double-buffering with smartdrive
 (this is the default setup).  you'll also notice that your system runs
 much, much slower -- in both windows *and* msdos.  see the section
 called, "windows 3.1 runs slowly", for some ways of speeding your system
 up.
 
 
 * windows configuration:
 
      to get the adaptec 1542 to work with windows, make sure that the
 "[388enh]" section of the system.ini file contains the entry:
 
 	virtualhdirq=off
 
 i believe that the windows install program automatically adds this entry
 to system.ini, but i'm not sure.  if this doesn't work for you, you
 might want to try adding some more lines:
 
 	virtualhdirq=off
 	systemrombreakpoint=false
 	emmexclude=a000-cfff
 
 (you probably don't need the above lines, though.)  the
 "systemrombreakpoint" entry is used to enable support for memory
 managers like qemm/386max (only needed if you use such programs).
 
 
 * windows 3.1 runs slowly:
 
      once you do get windows 3.1 running with the 1542, chances are that
 your system is running much slower than before.  if it's not, it's
 probably because:
 
      1. you happen to be using aspi4dos.sys version 3.1 in your
 	config.sys file.  congratulations -- this appears to be a
 	winning solution.
 
      2. you are very lucky.  whether your luck will hold out remains to
 	be seen ....
 
 if your system is running much slower than before, this is almost
 definitely caused by smartdrive with double-buffering.  according to the
 windows documentation, and the microsoft technical note #q81808
 ("smartdrive double buffering required with aspi4dos.sys"), you must use
 smartdrive with double-buffering enabled.  while this works, it really
 slows down your pc; i once estimated that this slowed my pc down by a
 factor of 5 (five).  as i consider this unacceptable, i looked for other
 solutions.
 
      unfortunately, you cannot just disable double-buffering.  if you
 do, windows 3.1 in enhanced mode will not work, and you might even
 destroy the contents of your hard disk by trying to run windows 3.1.
 what you can do is one of the following:
 
      1. use other drivers that provide double-buffering.  it is my
 	opinion that the unbelievable slowness in smartdrive is caused
 	either by horribly inefficient double-buffering, or by a bug in
 	smartdrive.
 
      2. use a driver that provides "vds" services ("vds" stands for
 	"virtual dma services").  this is a standard, which is supported
 	by windows 3.1, that allows bus-mastering disk controllers (like
 	the 1542) to work with windows.
 
      after trashing my hard disk countless times, i found the following
 solutions, none of which require using smartdrive (note, however, that i
 am now getting occasional parity errors, which are probably *not* caused
 by these solutions, but might be -- see below).  while the following
 does not require smartdrive, using some kind of disk cache utility is
 strongly recommended, as this makes windows run much, much faster:
 
 1. if you do not have the aspi4dos.sys driver, or you do not need aspi
    functions (for controlling a cdrom, tape drive, more than two
    physical hard disks, etc.), you can add the scsiha.sys driver to your
    config.sys file, e.g.:
 
 	driver=c:\scsiha.sys /v386
 
    (windows needs the "/v386" option.)  this driver must be loaded into
    low memory (it cannot be loaded into high memory), and it occupies
    about 16-20k.  as of november 1992, the scsiha.sys driver could be
    obtained from the adaptec bbs at (408)-945-7727 (hopefully, it's
    still there).
 
 2. if you need aspi functions and have the aspi4dos.sys driver, version
    3.0 or 3.0a, you can use both the aspi4dos.sys and scsiha.sys drivers
    in your config.sys file, e.g.:
 
 	driver=c:\aspi4dos.sys
 	driver=c:\scsiha.sys /v386
 
    amazingly enough, the scsiha.sys driver can also be loaded high
    (assuming you have dos 5.0); i would have thought that this would
    crash my system, but it doesn't.  i asked adaptec's technical support
    about this, and they said that loading scsiha.sys high should be fine
    as long as aspi4dos.sys is loaded low.
 
    on my system, not using scsiha.sys with aspi4dos 3.0a would
    occasionally cause windows 3.1 to crash upon restarting or exiting
    windows, with the additional result of a corrupted disk (some of my
    c:\windows\*.grp files would be corrupted).  for me, these crashes
    usually occurred while making a different program from progman.exe
    the default windows shell, and vice-versa.  this is the reason
    scsiha.sys may be necessary.
 
    i have absolutely no idea if scsiha.sys is necessary with versions of
    aspi4dos earlier than 3.0.
 
    note that many people can use aspi4dos 3.0 or 3.0a without
    scsiha.sys; they do not seem to have any problems at all.  i consider
    these people lucky.  others, like me, have had all sorts of problems.
 
 3. in my opinion, the best, but not necessarily the easiest, solution is
    to upgrade to aspi4dos 3.1.  the scsiha.sys driver is no longer
    needed.  unfortunately, while you could get previous aspi4dos
    upgrades from the adaptec bbs, the aspi4dos 3.1 driver is not
    available from the adaptec bbs.  as far as i know, there are only
    three ways to get a copy:
 
       * you can buy the new (as of november 1992) adaptec ez scsi driver
 	kit, which supposedly includes aspi4dos 3.1 as well as other
 	drivers, such as cdrom drivers.  i believe the list price is
 	around $75.
 
       * if you already have a copy of an older version of aspi4dos, you
 	can supposedly contact adaptec to upgrade it to ez scsi for
 	around $30.
 
       * a copy of aspi4dos 3.1 is included in central point pc tools 8.0
 	for msdos.  note that the documentation and driver are stored in
 	different directories.  note further that only aspi4dos is
 	included; the cdrom drivers and drivers to support more than two
 	hard disks are not included.  this is where i obtained my copy
 	of aspi4dos 3.1.
 
 note, however, that i am now getting occasional parity errors with
 windows.  in all probability, defective hardware in my pc is causing
 this, as i upgraded my motherboard just after i found the above
 solutions.  however, because these parity errors occur only during disk
 accesses, there is a very small, but definite, possibility that the
 parity errors are driver-related (for example, changing the bus on/off
 timing for certain disk transfers might cause this).  i've run various
 memory tests for hours at a time, and these tests have found no
 problems.  this problem is probably caused by memory with marginal
 timing requirements, which cause parity errors during disk transfers
 (this is why the memory tests didn't find any problems -- the problems
 show up only under disk i/o).  however, i'm mentioning this just in case
 it isn't a hardware problem.
 
 
 ***** floppy-controller-based tape backup devices:
 
      there are two possible problems with using the adaptec 1542 with a
 floppy-controller-based tape backup device, such as the colorado memory
 systems jumbo 250:
 
 1. tape backups/restores can take a very long time.  the tape drive
    constantly starts, stops, starts, stops, etc.
 
 2. tape operations may be erratic, or encounter too many tape errors.
    (this problem might be caused by defective hardware on my 1542.
    however, i've heard of other people having similar problems, and so
    i'm mentioning this just in case it is not a hardware problem on my
    1542.)
 
 
 * tape backups/restores take a long time:
 
      if you have a floppy-controller-based tape backup device, you may
 have to adjust the adaptec 1540/1542 "bus on/off timing" for best
 results when using the tape drive.  normally, while doing a tape backup
 or restore, the tape drive motor should be continuously running, with
 only an occasional pause.  however, the default bus timing on the
 adaptec 1540/1542 may cause the tape drive motor to start and stop,
 start and stop, every few seconds.  this causes needless wear to the
 tape and tape drive (however, note that a dirty tape head or a defective
 tape drive can also cause this -- make sure your tape heads are clean).
 this also causes the tape backup or restore to take much, much longer
 than necessary.
 
      the problem here is that these tape backups use the floppy dma to
 transfer data in memory to/from the tape drive, and the adaptec uses dma
 to transfer data in memory to/from the hard disk.  the floppy dma needs
 to feed data to the tape drive at a certain rate; if the tape drive is
 not fed data quickly enough by the floppy dma, the tape drive stops,
 rewinds a bit, and restarts (once enough data is eventually fed to it).
 the default bus timing on the adaptec (which is really dma timing) is
 "too large".  for example, when a backup is done, data has to be
 transferred from a hard disk to memory, and then from memory to the
 tape.  because the default timing on the adaptec "hogs" the memory too
 much (too much time is spent transferring data from a hard disk to
 memory), not enough time is spent transferring data from memory to the
 tape drive.  as a result, the tape drive constantly starts and stops,
 because data is not fed to it quickly enough.
 
      the solution is to change the adaptec's bus on/off timing.  the
 default factory setting is 11 microseconds on, and 5 microseconds off.
 the "bus on" timing needs to be lowered to 2-4 microseconds.  this can
 be done in one of two ways:
 
 * if you have aspi4dos, you can use the "/n" option.  for example, i use
   a "bus on" timing of 4 microseconds, which means that i use the
   following line in my config.sys file:
 
 	device=c:\aspi4dos.sys /n4
 
   note that there is no space between the "/n" and the "4".
 
 * if you don't have aspi4dos, your only recourse is to try to find a
   program called "setscsi.exe", which is very difficult to find.  the
   reason is that adaptec, for reasons of their own, does not seem to
   want this widely distributed.  i once asked someone who worked for
   adaptec, and they asked me to not upload it anywhere.  if you have
   anonymous ftp access to the internet, you could try using archie to
   hunt down a copy; i believe that there are a couple of sites that have
   it.  if you do find a copy, you run it like so:
 
 	setscsi -n:4
 
   this adjusts the "bus on" timing to 4 microseconds.  running
   setscsi.exe without any arguments resets the bus timing back to the
   factory defaults.
 
   note that it seems that you cannot use setscsi.exe if you use
   aspi4dos; setscsi.exe crashed my system if aspi4dos was loaded.  i
   could use setscsi.exe with scsiha.sys, however.
 
 do not lower the "bus on" timing below 2 microseconds, or increase it
 above 11 microseconds.  if you lower it too low, the hard disk
 throughput will suddenly drop; your system will feel slower.  for me, 4
 microseconds works fine.  this value may work fine for you, or you may
 have to adjust it downwards a little.
 
      once you've lowered the "bus on" timing, tape backups and restores
 should run faster.
 
      also, do not experiment with the bus on/off times (with the other
 options that i have intentionally not described), unless you know what
 you are doing.  bad combinations can cause parity errors and worse, by
 starving memory refresh.
 
      a program called bustifix.exe exists on the adaptec bbs.  unless
 this has been upgraded since i last checked (which has been a while),
 this is a self-extracting archive containing a batch file and a couple
 of other files.  this batch file was supposed to allow one to set the
 bus on/off times for the 1540/1542 and others.  however, when i tried
 running this program with my 1542a, my system crashed.  at the time, i
 was running scsiha.sys, and i didn't check to see if there was a
 conflict with it.  maybe this old program works only with the 1542b,
 although the docs say that it works with the 1542a?
 
 
 * erratic tape operations or too many tape errors:
 
      this "problem" may or may not exist.  although it existed on my
 system, a hardware problem just on my particular 1542 could cause it.
 however, i've heard of other people having similar problems, and so i'm
 mentioning this just in case it isn't a hardware problem just on my
 1542.
 
      symptoms of this "problem", which persists even after cleaning the
 tape head:
 
 1. backing up to tape encounters "unusable sector detected" errors,
    resulting in an aborted tape backup.
 
 2. tape backup works, but the tape compare fails.
 
 3. the tape drive starts, stops, starts, stops, etc. much too often.
    unlike the above-mentioned problem ("tape backups/restores take a
    long time"), where the tape drive starts and stops every few seconds,
    this kind of starting/stopping occurs every few 10-20 seconds or so.
 
 4. fastback plus 3.1 does not find/see any tape backup devices.  other
    programs, like central point backup and the cms jumbo software
    (assuming that you have a cms jumbo 250 tape drive) can find/see the
    tape drive, but fastback plus 3.1 cannot.
 
 5. too many tape read errors.
 
      although i do not know what is causing this problem, i discovered
 that using a different floppy controller solves it.  a few months ago, i
 upgraded my motherboard, which contained an integrated floppy
 controller.  as i already had a floppy controller on the 1542, i
 initially disabled the motherboard floppy controller.  after a while, i
 decided to try disabling the 1542 floppy controller and using the one on
 the motherboard.  when i did this, the tape drive (a cms jumbo 250)
 reliability increased dramatically, and fastback plus 3.1 was suddenly
 able to find and use the tape drive.
 
      i don't know if this was caused by a hardware problem on my 1542.
 on the one hand, the floppy drives worked great when they were attached
 to the 1542, which seems to say that there was nothing wrong with the
 1542.  on the other hand, the tape drive didn't work well attached to
 the 1542 floppy controller, but it did work when attached to a different
 controller; this could be an indication of a hardware problem on my
 1542.  i did change floppy drive cables, and so it is conceivable that
 the problem was in the cables.  i don't know what the cause really is;
 however, if you're having similar problems, you might want to consider
 trying a new floppy controller.
 
 
 ***** sound cards:
 
      many popular sound cards can play or record digitized sound, and
 this is typically done using dma.  like the tape drive dma, the
 adaptec's dma can conflict with the sound card dma.  unlike that of the
 tape dma, this "conflict" usually manifests itself as a parity error
 (your system crashes with a parity error message).  what happens is
 that, data is being transferred so quickly by the sound card and the
 adaptec, memory refresh cannot occur quickly enough, which causes a
 parity error.  usually, getting a parity error means that there is a
 hardware problem with your system; in this case, however, the parity
 error is not a symptom of bad hardware.
 
      i've found that such parity errors typically occur while recording
 digitized sound, and the chances of such errors increase as you increase
 the recording fidelity (e.g., higher sampling rate, recording in stereo,
 recording using 16-bits instead of 8, etc.).
 
      like the tape drive solution, the solution here is to lower the
 adaptec's "bus on" timing.  see the section on tape drives for
 information on how this is done.  note, however, that this may or may
 not solve the problem; it may only reduce the probability of a parity
 error.  the software used to record digitized sound can greatly affect
 this problem (i.e., some software is inefficient).  disk caches, the
 speed of your hard disk, and the amount of disk fragmentation can also
 affect this.
 
 
 ***** miscellaneous info:
 
      this section contains miscellaneous hints, tips, and rumors.  much
 of it is merely information that i've heard or read about, and have not
 verified.  i believe that the following information is correct, but i'm
 not sure.  use it at your own risk.
 
 * with qemm 6.00, 6.01, and 6.02, you need to specify the "db="
   parameter (e.g., "db=2"), unless you are using the aspi4dos driver.
   if you don't, qemm will crash/hang at bootup.  although the qemm
   manual mentions this, the install program does not seem to detect that
   a 1542 is present and automatically add this option to the qemm
   command line (at least, this occurred with the qemm 6.00 install
   program -- i haven't tested any other version).  earlier versions of
   qemm probably need this parameter, but i'm not sure (i've never used a
   version earlier than 6.00).
 
   if you use aspi4dos, you do not need to give qemm the "db=" parameter.
 
 * some or all versions of the 1542 do not support hard disks over one
   gigabyte in size.  to support hard disks with capacities over 1gb, you
   need to get a new rom bios from adaptec.  i'm not sure if this is
   still true of the latest 1542bs being sold by adaptec.
 
 * to connect a cdrom drive to the 1542, you need a scsi cdrom drive and
   some drivers.  note that some cdrom drives have proprietary interfaces
   (non-scsi); these drives cannot be used with the 1542.  you have three
   choices for cdrom drivers (i have no idea how well the following
   solutions work, or even if they work -- the following is secondhand
   information):
 
      1. you can buy adaptec's ez scsi driver package, which lists for
 	something like $75.  if you already have older adaptec drivers,
 	you can supposedly upgrade to ez scsi for around $30.  contact
 	adaptec for details.  the ez scsi package supposedly contains
 	everything that you need.
 
      2. you can buy the corelscsi! driver package, which is made by the
 	same people that make coreldraw!  this package contains cdrom
 	drivers, scsi tape drivers, worm drivers, etc.  i do not know
 	the list price, but i've seen this package sold for around
 	$80-$90.  note that corelscsi! does not come with the aspi4dos
 	driver, which is needed.  if you do not already have aspi4dos,
 	you may be better off getting adaptec's ez scsi instead.
 
      3. [this method is obsolete, as the following drivers have been
 	obsoleted by adaptec's ez scsi kit, but i'm mentioning it in
 	case someone already has these drivers.]  you can use the
 	drivers in the adaptec asw-1410 kit (aspi4dos) and the asw-410
 	kit (aspi cdrom drivers).  you will have to get a copy of
 	mscdex.exe (a high-level cdrom driver), if it is not included in
 	the asw-410 kit, but this is available from several bulletin
 	boards.
 
 * to use a scsi tape drive with the 1542, you need software that knows
   how to talk to a scsi tape drive.  software that i've heard about are
   (again, like the above section on cdrom drives, i have no idea how
   well the following solutions work, or even if they work -- the
   following is secondhand information):
 
      1. central point pc tools 8.0 for msdos supposedly supports a large
 	number of scsi tape drives.  it comes with scsi drivers
 	(aspi4dos 3.1) as well as central point backup.
 
      2. the corelscsi! driver package contains a scsi tape backup
 	program (see the above section on cdrom drives for more
 	details).  however, note that corelscsi! does not come with, but
 	requires, aspi4dos.
 
 * i've seen advertisements that sell the 1542 in three configurations:
 
      1. 1542 scsi controller with hard disk rom bios.
      2. 1542 scsi controller w/bios and adaptec aspi drivers.
      3. 1542 scsi controller w/bios, adaptec aspi drivers, and
 	corelscsi! drivers/programs.
 
   i imagine that adaptec now sells the 1542 in a fourth configuration:
 
      4. 1542 scsi controller w/bios and ez scsi drivers (including aspi
 	drivers).
 
 * those people who use unix might be interested in a version of gnu tar
   for msdos that talks to a scsi tape drive via the aspi4dos driver (you
   need this driver before you can use this program).  i've never used
   this version of gnu tar, but i've heard that it works (i don't know
   how well, though).  if you have anonymous ftp access to the internet,
   a copy can be found on wsmr-simtel20.army.mil and mirror sites:
 
 	pd1:<msdos.dskutl>
 	aspibin.zip  67841 920131 gnu tar for scsi tape drives, adaptec 154xx
 	aspipat.zip  21206 920131 patches for aspibin relative to gnu tar 1.10
 	aspisrc.zip 221370 920131 src for gnu tar for scsi tape, adaptec ctrlr
 
   i have no idea if a copy can be found on compuserve; unixforum might
   have it, if any forum does.
 
 * as far as msdos is concerned, the 1542a and the 1542b controllers are
   the same; with msdos, the 1542a should work as well as the 1542b.
   however, the hardware for these two boards is not 100% identical, and
   there is at least one (non-msdos) program that initially did not work
   with a 1542a, but did work with a 1542b (bsd386 -- a 386 version of
   bsd unix).
 
 * in case anyone's curious, here's an edited copy of my config.sys file:
 
 	files=40
 	buffers=40
 	break=on
 	stacks=10,256
 	device=c:\sys\dev\aspi4dos.sys /d /n4
 	device=c:\qemm\qemm386.sys on ram rom dma=32 st:m x=f800-ffff
 	dos=high,umb
 	devicehigh=c:\sys\dev\nnansi.sys
 	devicehigh=c:\dos\setver.exe
 	shell = c:\dos\command.com /p
 
   note that i'm using qemm and aspi4dos 3.1.  if i were using aspi4dos
   3.0 or 3.0a, i'd probably have to use a config.sys that looked like:
 
 	files=40
 	buffers=40
 	break=on
 	stacks=10,256
 	device=c:\sys\dev\aspi4dos.sys /d /n4
 	device=c:\qemm\qemm386.sys on ram rom dma=32 st:m x=f800-ffff
 	dos=high,umb
 	devicehigh=c:\sys\dev\scsiha.sys /v386
 	devicehigh=c:\sys\dev\nnansi.sys
 	devicehigh=c:\dos\setver.exe
 	shell = c:\dos\command.com /p
 
   if i weren't using aspi4dos, i'd probably use something that looked
   like:
 
 	files=40
 	buffers=40
 	break=on
 	stacks=10,256
 	device=c:\sys\dev\scsiha.sys /v386
 	device=c:\qemm\qemm386.sys on ram rom db=32 dma=32 st:m x=f800-ffff
 	dos=high,umb
 	devicehigh=c:\sys\dev\nnansi.sys
 	devicehigh=c:\dos\setver.exe
 	shell = c:\dos\command.com /p
 
   however, if i used a floppy-controller-based tape drive, or if i
   planned to record high-quality sound from a sound card, i would still
   need some way of changing the adaptec's bus on/off times.  the first
   two versions of config.sys take care of this, but this last version
   doesn't.
