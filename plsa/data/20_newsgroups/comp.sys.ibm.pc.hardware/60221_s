 hello world,
  
 i'm attempting to write an 8051 simulator on an ibm pc for teaching
 purposes, so that first-year elec-eng students can 'see' the workings
 of the microcontroller as it performs operations - logical ands, for
 example, being shown on a bit-by-bit basis (1 and 1 = 1) so that the
 students can see that it's not really a mystical process, but totally
 logical, for example. every instruction should show some 'working',
 and not just alter register/memory/port contents.
  
 does anyone know of any freely-available example simulation code,
 in pascal or modula-2, that would show me where i'm going wrong
 in writing my simulator? [i'm using ayala's -the 8051 microcontroller-
 as a reference - the simulator supplied with the package is overkill
 for simple teaching purposes, i feel, and there's no source code to help
 you roll your own.]
  
 please email me if you can help, or if you know of somewhere more 
 appropriate i should be posting this  - i rarely scan these groups.
  
 thanks,
