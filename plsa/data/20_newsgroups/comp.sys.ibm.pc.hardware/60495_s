 hello netters,
 
 	i have a question concerning scsi on dos.
 
 	i have a st01 scsi controller and two hard-disks conected
 	(id's 0 and 1). i'd like to connect a scsi streamer, but i
 	don't have software to access it. does such a beast exist
 	as shareware or pd ?
 	
 	also what if i want a third disk ? i know that dos only can
 	"see" two two physical and four logical disks. will it be
 	possible to use extra disks ?
 
 	thanks in advance.
 
 	ib
