 i was wondering if anyone out there has had the same problem i am having with
 my gateway 2000 486-33dx vl-bus system with ati graphics ultra pro lb.  
 when i have my computer in any resolution other than 800x600, everything is
 fine, but whenever i use it in 800x600 (windows, autocad, gifs) the screen 
 gets about 1 1/2 inches shorter.  at the very top and very bottom of the screen
 there is about a 3/4" bar of black.  the screen isn't cut off, it just squeezes
 everything into the smaller space and messes up the aspect ratio.  while i can
 manually change the v-size on the back, this is a pain in the ass, and it just
 shouldn't happen anyway.  i've called gateway numerous times and they haven't 
 been able to help me at all.  two different times they sent me a new card, and
 both times the new card didn't work at all in my computer.  they even tried
 to bill me for the first card because they didn't get it back in a couple of
 days, when they told me over the phone that they would wait more than 2 weeks
 before billing my card.  but their customer support is a different story...
 so, if anyone has had this same problem, please let me know if you know what
 to do.  hell, let me know if you don't have a solution, just so i know i'm
 not the only one with this problem.  thanks in advance.

 p.s.  i already tried going into the mach 32 install program and manually set-
 ting up the card.  doesn't work.  whenever i try to increase the vertical size
 of the 800x600 screen, it just starts to cut off the top and bottom.
