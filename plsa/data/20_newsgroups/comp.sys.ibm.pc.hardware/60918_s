 i've got an in-2000 working in a (wimpy) 386sx20 presently.  in a few
 months i'm getting a 486 motherboard and probably a toshiba 3401e cdrom and
 a sbpro.
 
 will i need special drivers for getting all this to work?  do they exist?
 basically, is this feasible, or should i expect to be getting a newer, 
 faster scsi card?
 
 thanks,
 -bryan
