 hi,
 
 i have the following problem: i have to use a computer for special purposes
 that doesn't have a monitor and keyboard connected. no monitor isn't a 
 program - but no keyboard.
 i can't disable the keyboard from bios setup (in fact, there is no setup).
 i spoke to someone who said that he had fooled the bios with simply
 using a self-made connector that connects two pins via a resistor.
 pity, pity... i lost contact to the person before getting more detail.
 so does anyone of you experts can help?
 
 thanks for any hints, even vague ones :-)
 
 thomas
