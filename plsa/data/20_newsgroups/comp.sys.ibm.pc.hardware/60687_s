 you  need to massage few switches in your system.ini.
 in the virtual memory section, flip the 32bitaccess switch on and the 
 associated driver (wdctl or some such) switch on.  this will enable
 32bit access, but be sure you can use it, as not all hard drives
 and controllers support it !  
 
 
 ...for seriously fast disk access:
 
 1)  throw out windoze
 2)  install os/2
 
 i did this weekend - os/2 is incredible.  finally a real os for
 the humble pc  :)
