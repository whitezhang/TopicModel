 yes

 yes, seen glue-on, tape-on, clip-on, one-inch square and larger.
 my favorite is the 3.5 inch plastic u.s.toyo fan i use just plopped
 down on top of the chip during open-case service.

 depends on the mounting

 only if the manufacturer was smart

 only if it goes out - got that "blanket" effect which doesn't help chip life

 longer system life makes good economic sense to me

 yes - well, not the melted cheese

 lets you touch the surface - the "rule of thumb" for cooling solid-state

 the "attached" fans look slick and work well but i'm bothered by the potential
 loss of cooling if the fan goes out. at least with the power supply fan you
 can reach back there every few days and feel the fan blowing.
 
 i prefer to put a stock fan off the drive brackets or front panel
 to blow air across the cpu - depends a lot on case and board layout, though.
 
 on-chip fans from fry's electronics in the sf bay area are about 30.00. i
 get the stock power supply fans for about 11.00.
