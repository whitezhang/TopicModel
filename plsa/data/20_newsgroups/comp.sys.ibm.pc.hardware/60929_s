 i'm interested in building my own pc. can anyone recommend a
 (uk available) book on the subject, and/or sources for parts?
 
 alternatively, can anyone recommend a source for a 486dx (33mhz)
 pc  (again uk available). i've just seen in computer weekly that
 the march '93 price for these has fallen to sterling 1092 (including
 os, monitor, keyboard, delivery and vat), but i can't find a single
 advert that would give me a system at that price.
 
 many thanks for your help.
