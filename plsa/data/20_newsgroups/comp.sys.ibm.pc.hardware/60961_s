 
 due to some problems with my ide drive, i ll formatted the maxitor7213at.
 now it started to give me some errors in some applications. i was told
 maxitor has a utility called ide_int in their bbs, anyone tried it? can
 some one tell me what that bbs number is? or better, can i find the file
 in some ftp site? or perhaps someone can email it to me? thanks.
