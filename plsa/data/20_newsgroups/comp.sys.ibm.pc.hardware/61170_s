 this is a common misconception, shared my many manufacturers, programmers,
 and users alike.  com3, for example, is simply the third equipped comm
 port, not necessarily the one with i/o address 3e8.  the bios just
 searches sequentially through a set of potential comm port addresses.  the
 first equipped port it finds will become com1, etc.  if you're playing by
 the rules, you can't have a com4 unless you have a com3 equipped.  the set
 of "standard" (whatever that means) port addresses merely reflects the
 order in which the bios searches the i/o address space in its search for
 serial ports.
 
 so, what you have is indeed com3 at the non-standard address 2e8.  were
 this address in the 4th table slot instead, programs which query the bios
 to determine the number of installed comm ports would not find it, as the
 field in the bios data area which contains this number would indicate that
 there are but 3 comm ports installed.  (frankly, i don't know of a simgle
 program that would actually have a problem with this.)
