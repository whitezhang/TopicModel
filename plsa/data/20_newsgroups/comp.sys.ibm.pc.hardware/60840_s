 when a program uses a dos call to get the system, it resets the flag that
 tells the bios that it has passed midnight.  it then uses this flag to
 increment the date.  if the menu does a call to the system to get the time
 before midnight, before the bios sees the midnight flag, then bios will not
 know that the day passed and the date will not get updated.
 
 i might have some dos's and bios's mixed up (darned cold messed up my
 brains) but this has been a well documented problem for years.  i don't know
 of a workaround.  hope this helps!
