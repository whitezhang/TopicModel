 the last time i was in microprocessor lab was in 1980, using z-80.
 so i don't know a lot of buzz terms in pc hardware.
 
 now i need to purchase a 486, help me to ask the right questions.
 
 motherboard:
     i need 486-33 with 8 mb ram, with additonal slot for 8 more mb.
     i would like to get two vesa local bus. one for video, not sure
     what am i going to do with the other. 
     it must be able to run unix.
     
     what are other questions that i should ask to ensure getting a
     quality stuff? what are other important features ?
 
 
 monitor:
     i want a 14" non interlaced svga, but not sure about what brand
     to get. i can't afford nec or sony. what brands should i consider?
     acer? touch?
 
     what else should i ask?
 
 video card: 
     i would like to run framemaker. so i need a fast video card. is western
     digital worth the $20 over cirrus logic?  do i need more than 1m of 
     v-ram?
 
     one company wanted $50 more for a local bus video card. is this normal?
     
 
 hard drive:
     segate, western digital, conner all have the same price. which one is
     more liable? which one has better performace?
 
 case/power supply:
     given the choise of desktop and minitower, which one is better?
     what is the adequate power supply?
     is cooling a general problem or a non-issue?
     what features should i ask for?
     
 did i miss anything?
 
 i am sure that there are a lot of semi-pc-literates reading this group.
 
 your help is greatly appreciated.
