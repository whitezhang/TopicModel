 no cache.

 correct.

 8kb.

 was it six instructions?

 80486dx without the mathematical coprocessor (fpu).
 >80486dx:  probably sorta like 80386...
 
 actually, the 80486 you described above is 80486dx.
 (there is no separate 80486 nor 80386, either).
 
 this is for intel processors. does anyone have a complete
 list with cyrix and ibm products?
