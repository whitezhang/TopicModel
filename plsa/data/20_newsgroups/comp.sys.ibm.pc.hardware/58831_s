 it is model number #7033d, a 14" interlaced .28dp.  btw, if you have a
 number to contact the company, that would really be helpful to.  thanks
 for replying.  i was beginning to believe that i was never going to get
 a reply.  i posted this on the netnews bboard because the first message
 i sent to you was returned, and i didn't know if my second message would
 get to you.
