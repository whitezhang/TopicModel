 i have an 8-bit serial card with two ports.  each port has the option of
 using irq 2,3,4 or 5.  i also have two serial ports on a multi-i/o card,
 and the ports can be set to irq 3,4,5,7 or 9.  from other posts i've read,
 i get the impression that irq2 on the 8-bit card is the same as irq9 on
 the multi-i/o card.  am i right?
