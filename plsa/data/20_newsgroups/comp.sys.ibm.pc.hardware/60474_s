 i recently decided to try using emm386.exe for a memory manager and when i
 tried to print to my printer in lpt1 from word55 i wouldn't work.  it would
 send the linefeeds for the top margin and then the printer ready light would
 go off and stop working.  i disabled emm386.exe and the problem went away.
 i would like to continue using emm386.exe if possible.  i would greatly    
 appreciate any comments or suggestions!!  please send them to arthur@u.washingt,
