 please: response directly to me (luoma@binah.cc.brandeis.edu)
         by email.  if there are a sufficient number of interesting
         responses, i will post a summary (on april 24 or 25).
 
 i have waded through the mass of scsi-ide posting, but
 i missed any answers to a question posted early on --
 
 has anyone (successfully) put both scsi and ide hard drives
 on the same system?
 
 i am particularly interested in having the scsi as the _boot_ drive.
 
 for those who have managed this feat, i would appreciate
 a bit more information, such as what drives, which scsi controller,
 and (if possible) what motherboard & bios
 (plus any other relevant info.).
 
 thanks in advance,
 robert luoma      (luoma@binah.cc.brandeis)
