 i have an internal modem that i configure as com4 with irq 3, but
 when i insert that card into my dos 5.02 pc, it shows up
 as com3, with irq3 and com4's address (2e8)!
 
 when i get into debug, and dump the data at 40:0, it shows
 the address 2e8 as belonging to com3 - even though the modem
 should be at com4.
 
 now, i know the modem is working correctly since i have tested
 it in a different pc - and it shows up correctly as com4, 2e8, irq3.
 
 to make it work in the dos 5.02 pc, i have to configure the
 modem as com3, 2e8, irq3---but though i have a comm program that
 allows that, the fax program that came with the modem does not work.
 anyway, i would like the computer to display the modem as it is set,
 as com4...
 i did run a few diagnostic programs, and they did not help at all:
 a few displayed the modem as com4, and others displayed it as
 being com3.
 
 i am not using windows, this is just a dos problem...any help
 or pointers appreciated....
 for various reasons, i must have this modem work at com4, thus
 switching com ports is not an answer...
 
 (last time i posted this, i did not get any dos specific answer,
 this time i have included all the specific information....please help!)
