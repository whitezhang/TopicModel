 gcc and other big programs seemed to crash about 15% of the time for me.
 gcc gave something like "program as got fatal signal 11" and when doing
 anything past the complexity of elvis, kermit, etc, i got kernel general
 protection faults at *least* once a session.
 
 i disabled my cache as suggested, and bingo, linux is as stable as a rock
 (it hasn't given me a core dump or kernel error yet).
 
 does any one know why the cache would do something like this?
