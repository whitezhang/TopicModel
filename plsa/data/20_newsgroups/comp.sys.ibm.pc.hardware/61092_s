 i don't know which tube the viewsonic 17 uses, but it has an 82khz horizontal
 bandwidth so you can go pretty high.  i ran mine at 1280x1024x75 which was as
 fast as the orchid p9000 could drive it.  also, the 17 does claim to be able
 to support 1600x1280, but i have no experience with that.
 
 since i have the spec sheet in front of me i'll type some in:
 
 crt:	17", 0.28 mm dot pitch, 90 deg deflection, rgb mediou short
 	persisance, tint (tm=52%), anti-static, anti-glare, anti-reflection
 
 input signal:  rgb analog 0.7vp-p, 75 ohms (also has setting for 1vp-p)
 	sync: h/v separate(ttl), composite (+/-), sync on green (+/-)
 	horizontal freq: 30-82khz, vertical freq: 50-90hz
 compatibility: pc from vga to 1600x1280 non-interlaced, mac iici and above
 controls: contrast, brightness, position, size, degauss, p-p voltage, color
 	temp, sync select, color tuning, moire on/off.
 video band witdth: 135 mhz
 max brightness: 120 cd/m2 at white flat field
 misconvergence: .35mm (max) at center, .45mm (max) at corner
 dimensions: 16.3"x16.22"x17.64", weight 42.6 lbs
 
 i don't know what some of those mean and don't verify their accuracy, i just 
 typed them in.  other things they hype on the sheet are a 'double quaduple
 dynamic astigmatism focus'.  right.  they mean they use two lenses.  advanced
 invar shadow mask.  viewmatch color control which they claim is and easy-to-use
 system that adjusts colors to closely match printer output.  as near as i have
 been able to figure out, this translates to separate controls for red, green,
 and blue.  how this makes it easy to match for printer output is beyond me.
 
 but beyond the hype, the monitor is very pleasant to look at.  sharp, clear,
 and isn't nearly as bad as the nec's for reflections.
