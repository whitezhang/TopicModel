 
 i'm using drdos 6.0 with superstor for nearly 2 years now, and i'm wondering, if
 msdos 6.0 could keep up with it at last. is there anybody who tried out both? 
 what about this double-disk ? (had lots of problems with sstor too.)
 how much memory do you get? (i've got 616k with emm and sstor)
 what about the on-line help (really great in drdos)
 any help appreciated.
