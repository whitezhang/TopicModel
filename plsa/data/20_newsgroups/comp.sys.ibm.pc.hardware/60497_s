 hi all,
 
   i would like to purchase cd-rom drive. the specs i would like to have is:
 
    * applicable to kodak multisession photo-cd
    * scsi(2) interface
    * compatible with adaptec-1542b
    * does not need any caddies
    * cheaper ( < $500 if possible)
    * double speeded
 
   i believe there are no drives satisfying all of the above condition,
   so i would like to know all of your opinion.  the above conditions
   are sorted by my priority.
   i think nec cdr74-1/84-1 is a little bit expensive, but it does satisfy
   almost all of the above conditions. the problem is that i do not know
   the compatibility with 1542b. has someone succeeded to connect these
   nec drives to 1542b? i have heard a rumor that nec drive is incompatible
   with 1542b adapter.
   any suggestions are greatly appreciated.
 
 thanks in advance,
 kobayashi,masaoki
