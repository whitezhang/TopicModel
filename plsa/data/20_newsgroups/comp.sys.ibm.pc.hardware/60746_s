 is it possible to buy a serial i/o card with the 16550 uart's built in
 (rather than having to buy them separately, and socketing them in)?
 
 my current i/o card uses 8250's (correct number? the braindead ones anyway).
 it also controls two floppy drives, and two ide hard drives.
 
 ideally, i'd like to get a new multi i/o card, that had 2 serial ports with
 16550's and could also control another 2 ide hd's. it would have to have
 configurable addresses for both the serial ports, and the ide controller, so
 it could co-exist with my existing card.
 
 does such a beast exist? now the hard part - where can i get one in australia,
 preferably brisbane?
 
 thanks,
