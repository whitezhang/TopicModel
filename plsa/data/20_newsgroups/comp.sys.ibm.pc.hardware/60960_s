 i don't see this as a problem with the chip-set (a mistake), i see this
 as something that was designed-in intentionally.
 
 so it would seem that to enhance the design (from 24 to 32-bit eisa dma)
 would require an update to the chipset.  an update to the chipset may 
 begat an update to the motherboard board design.
 
 what i'm saing is:  the motherboard manufacturer seems to be passing this
 off as a simple fix.  in my mind the fix is a updated chipset from hint 
 along with a possible motherboard layout update.  this is not simple.
 if i were you i would be cautious about this.
 
 you might look into the advanced integration research (air) vl/eisa
 motherboard.  all slots are eisa/isa capable.  2 (or 3) of the slots are
 vl-bus capable.  the air people confirmed this board supports 'real'
 32-bit eisa dma (i called them).  pentium/p5 (?) capable.  less expensive
 than equivalent ami or micronics vl/eisa board.
 
 look in computer shopper (april '93).  the zenon ads show the air mother-
 board.  a associate bought the air board and is pleased with it.  i'm
 attempting to get the local dealer to trade out the hawk board for the
 air board.
 
 model number of air board (with 486-33dx) is b433ei2.  you can call
 motherboard warehouse (for example) for a price.  phone #'s included
 below.
 
 air                    (408)-428-0800
 motherboard warehouse  (800)-486-9975
