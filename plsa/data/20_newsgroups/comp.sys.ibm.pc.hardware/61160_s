 the 50 mhz external bus speed provides a hell for cache designs. most
 of the dx-50 boards have too slow caches that make them effectively
 dx2-50:s. also as someone else pointed out, local bus boards are
 better off at 33 mhz bus speed. the 8k internal cache allows the
 dx2-66 to be generally faster anyway.
