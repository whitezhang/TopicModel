 i also have a dx2/66 and a maxtor 212. i have a local bus ide controller (generic) and i get
 985 kb/s. i tried swapping my local bus ide controller for an isa ide controller and my
 transfer rate went to 830 kb/s. the specs for this drive show a maximum platter to controller
 transfer rate of 2.83 mb/s. i dont know how to get there from here. the local bus interface
 got me a little, but certainly not as much as i had hoped. i am also looking for a way to 
 improve my disk performance, but im not convinced that the controller is the bottleneck
 (although im willing to entertain the possibility that it is). i am already running a big
 main memory disk cache, so im not really interested in this solution either.
