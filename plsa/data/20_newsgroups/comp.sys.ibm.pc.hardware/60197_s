 in pc magazine april 27, 1993:29 "although scsi is twice as fasst as esdi,
 20% faster than ide, and support up to 7 devices its acceptance ...has
 long been stalled by incompatability problems and installation headaches."
 note what it does not site as a factor: price.
 int eh same article the pc would will get plug and play scsi {from the
 article it seems you get plug and play scsi-1 only since scsi-2 in full
 implimentation has ten not 7 devices.}
 scsi-1 intergration is sited as another part of the microsoft plug and play
 program.
