 hi. i recently switched my old amiga 500 with a 486dx-50. my computer
 configuration is :
 
 486dx-50 mhz. 8/256 kb eisa (micronics motherboard asic eisa 50mhz)
 16mb ram
 st3283n 248 mb harddisk, scsi
 ultrastor24f eisa cache controller
 
 when i use norton6.0 harddisk benchmark, i get a harddisk data transfer
 about 980 kb/sec. and sometimes 1mb/sec. is that good ? i thought
 that with eisa i could get about 2mb/sec. 
 somewhere in the manual for my harddisk i have read, that some host 
 adapters need to perform a low-level format to optimize the harddisk 
 performance in that system, do i need that ?
 a guy i know, gets a hd transfer about 1.2mb/sec, and he has an st3283a and
 a isa 486dx-50, how can a isa with the same system be faster ?
 
 is there anything that i can do to get a speedier harddisk ?
 
 
                                         thanks.
