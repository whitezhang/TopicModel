 all this shows is that you don't know much about scsi.
 
 scsi-1 {with a scsi-1 controler chip} range is indeed 0-5mb/s
 and that is all you have right about scsi
 scsi-1 {with a scsi-2 controller chip}: 4-6mb/s with 10mb/s burst {8-bit}
  note the increase in speed, the mac quadra uses this version of scsi-1
  so it does exist. some pc use this set up too.
 scsi-2 {8-bit/scsi-1 mode}:          4-6mb/s with 10mb/s burst
 scsi-2 {16-bit/wide or fast mode}:  8-12mb/s with 20mb/s burst
 scsi-2 {32-bit/wide and fast}:     15-20mb/s with 40mb/s burst
  
 by your own data the "although scsi is twice as fast as esdi" is correct
 with a scsi-2 controller chip scsi-1 can reach 10mb/s which is indeed
 "20% faster than ide" {120% of 8.3 is 9.96}. all these scsi facts have been
 posted to this newsgroup in my mac & ibm info sheet {available by ftp on 
 sumex-aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6) in the info-mac/report as 
 mac-ibm-compare[version #].txt (it should be 173 but 161 may still be there)}
 
 part of this problem is both mac and ibm pc are inconsiant about what scsi
 is which.  though it is well documented that the quadra has a scsi-2 chip
 an apple salesperson said "it uses a fast scsi-1 chip" {not at a 6mb/s,
 10mb/s burst it does not. scsi-1 is 5mb/s maximum synchronous and quadra
 uses ansynchronous scsi which is slower}  it seems that mac and ibm see
 scsi-1 interface and think 'scsi-1' when it maybe a scsi-1 interface driven
 in the machine by a scsi-2 controller chip in 8-bit mode {which is much
 faster then true scsi-1 can go}.
 
 don't slam an article because you don't understand what is going on.
 one reference for the quadra's scsi-2 controller chip is 
 (digital review, oct 21, 1991 v8 n33 p8(1)).
