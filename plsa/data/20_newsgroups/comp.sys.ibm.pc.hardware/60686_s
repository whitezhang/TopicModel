 i am trying to put together a new pc with vesa local bus.  i would like
 to get vlb cards for video and scsi but i have heard of a problem with
 bus mastering controllers on vlb.  something to the effect that they will
 actually slow down a system.  anyone heard of this problem?
 
 specifically, i am interested in the ultrastor 34f vlb scsi controller.
 before i shell out the bucks for this thing i would like to get the
 straight scoop from someone who knows.  does anyone have this controller?
 any problems with it?
