 what is the deal with the ide transfer rates?  is anybody getting throughput
 anywhere close to the platter->controller rate?  i haven't seen anything
 even close to the 5mb/sec limit of the ide interface.  these drives are 1:1
 (non-interleaved), aren't they?
 
 here are the rates i get:
 
 1) sequential read (msdos c program that uses bios calls to read 64-sector
                     blocks sequentially from outside (first) track inward)
 
                      8mhz bus    10mhz bus
                      --------    ---------
    maxtor lxt340:    860kb/sec   976kb/sec
    quantum lps240:   862kb/sec   887kb/sec
 
 2) disk buffer read (same c program, but re-reads the same block repeatedly
                      so in effect is reading the ram buffer on the drive)
 
                      8mhz bus    10mhz bus
                      --------    ---------
    maxtor lxt340:   1046kb/sec  1212kb/sec
    quantum lps240:  1015kb/sec  1276kb/sec
 
 3) coretest v2.7 transfer rate (seems to agree with (2) above)
 
                      8mhz bus    10mhz bus
                      --------    ---------
    maxtor lxt340:   1051kb/sec  1224kb/sec
    quantum lps240:  1026kb/sec  1298kb/sec
 
 i managed to get hold of the quantum lps240at product manual and it goes
 into excrutiating detail describing how the bits get from the platter,
 through the controller, and out the ide interface.  nowhere do i see
 anything like "after the bits are whipped of the platter at high speed
 they sit around in a buffer to thaw before they are sent to the host"
 (even though i swear that's whats happening ;->).  here are some relevent
 quotes from the manual:
 
   "data is transferred from the disk to the read buffer at a rate of
    3.75 mb/s maximum, 1.87mb/s minimum."  (my calculations show 3121kb/sec
    maximum and 1578kb/sec minimum...  disk spins at 4306 rpm with 87
    sectors per track on the outside and 44 on the inside)
 
   "single burst errors of up to 24 bits within one sector can be corrected
    'on-the-fly', in real time as they occur, allowing a high degree of
    data integrity with no impact to the drive's performance."  (i take
    this to mean error correction isn't the bottleneck)
 
   "for page-mode operations, the data-transfer rate to and from the buffer
    ram is up to 10.0 mb/s. this high transfer rate allows the at interface
    ic to communicate over the at bus at a data-transfer rate of 5.0 mb/s,
    while the dcs simultaneously controls disk-to-ram transfers"
                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 so the thing can even do it's cache pre-fetch while it's sending the
 requested sector (it has 3 64kb read buffers for pre-fetching, i guess
 you could call that a cache :-|).
 
 so when i do a sequential read on the outer tracks, why am i getting a
 measly 862kb/sec when i should be getting around 3mb/sec???
 
 any of you hard-disk engineers out there know?
 
 
 wondering why my disks are so slow,
