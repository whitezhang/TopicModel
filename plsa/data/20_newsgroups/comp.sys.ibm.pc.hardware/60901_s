 i don't have my copy of the manual with me right now, but i can offer the
 following in the interim:
 
    1)  the card uses port addresses 0x2e0 and 0x2e8 (which are not
        configurable).  these addresses, incidentally, were inadvertantly
        omitted from my version of the manual.
 
    2)  i believe there is a dip that controls whether or not to enable
        irq 2 (for cga or ega support??!?).

                yes, that is a '%' (percent sign) in my network address.
