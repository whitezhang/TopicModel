 the only difference is the time the driver gets loaded. mouse.sys will be
 loaded during the config.sys and therefor before the command.com. mouse.com
 will be loaded during autoexec.bat and so after the command.com.

 mouse.com could be started from the commandline after the booting and it
 could - perhaps - be unloaded, if no other driver is loaded after it.
 the working of both drivers is totally the same.
 
 when i ran dos, i preferred loading most of the drivers in autoexec.bat,
 because some programs won't run with some drivers and i could choose the
 ones i needed during startup. but with drdos6, this advantage is gone,
 because drdos lets you choose in config.sys which drivers should be loaded.
