 i just bought an actix graphics engine 32 plus with 2 megs.  
 
 i am not impressed...
 
 i have been having all sorts of problems with the board.  various lock-ups
 in windows, problems with the screen not centering, no flexibilty in choosing
 synch rates for a monitor, buggy windows drivers, lack of 1024x768x64k driver,
 
 if anyone else has one of these cards, please e-mail me...
 
 looks like i'm going to try the ati ultra plus...
