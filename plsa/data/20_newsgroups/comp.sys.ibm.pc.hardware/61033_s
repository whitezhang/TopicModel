 greetings..
 i'm a novice in messing comp. hardware.
 my original ide hd is a 42mb western digital which came with the system
 when i bought it. and i just got a 213mb ide hd maxtor that i wanted to
 add as a slave drive. i did change the jumper settings on 213a maxtor to
 configure it as slave drv, but i didn't change anything on my 42m western
 dig, since i didn't have any doc. on it. and as i predicted, it just beeped
 and gave me an error message about hdd controller.
 so, i had to take my 42m off & install my 213a to be my only hd.
  
 any help on this matter would be much appreciated.
 (before i trashed my 42mb)
  
 thankx much
