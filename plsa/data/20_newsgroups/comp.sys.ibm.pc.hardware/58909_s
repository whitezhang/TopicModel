 please help if you can with the following strange problem:
 
   the maxtor 340 drive in my 386 clone would from time to
   time, for no obvious reason spin down completely (one can
   tell by the sound) and simply refuse to be accessed. dos
   reacts with an error (drive d: cannot be accessed or
   something the like). unfortunately, i cannot just reproduce
   the error. sometimes it occurs more often, sometimes
   less. the last time it happened was when i wanted to 
   demonstrate some software to a colleague.
     i would like to know if anybody has experienced similar
   problems. i don't like to take the thing to the dealer
   only to be told that there's nothing wrong with it. i
   checked the other post in this group about maxtor, and
   i don't seem to be the only one who has problems. however,
   no one describes the same problem, and i also have a 
   different configuration.
 
   thanx in advance for any e-mailed help.
