    a program in the archive keymap00.zip on simtel and mirror sites in the 
 msdos/keyboard directory will do this.  it is written in assembler and it 
 best if you have a compiler to create a new keyboard map.  it is possible, 
 however, to use a binary editor to edit the provided compiled keyboard 
 driver if you do not have a compiler.  i used hexed100.zip, also available 
 on simtel.  simply serach for the codes 00 01 02 03 to locate the biginning 
 of the "normal" keyboard map.  then swap the codes for the keys that you 
 wish to swap.  see the keyboard directory of simtel for programs that report 
 the scancode for each key to you (some bios programs also have this info).
 good luck,
 
 - pete
