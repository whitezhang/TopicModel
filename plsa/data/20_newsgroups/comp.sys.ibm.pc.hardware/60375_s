 
 we are trying to connect an olivetti xm4311 5" floppy drive as the second
 drive on a panasonic 286 machine.  it seems to sort of talk to it (gets it
 spinning and stepping) but gives a "disk not ready" error.
 
 there are two jumpers (which seem to work best open), a 3 position dip
 switch, and a 8 position dip switch.  we don't know how to set the dip
 switches and think that may be the problem.
 
 any information, or advice (other than "junk the stupid thing" :) would be
 most appreciated, thanks.  (email reply preferred).
