 i am servicing a machine (hp-286) and whenever the thing starts up i get
 4 beeps on powerup.  does anyone know what error message that signifies?  i 
 don't seem to have any problem with the machine but the lady who is using it
 is "very concerned" about it.  
 
 don't you just love hp computers???
 
 preferr responses by e-mail but i read the net so you can post it here.
