 while rummaging through a box of old pc (5150) parts, i found a half-size
 board that looks like a comm port board.  it was made by forte data systems and
 has a copyright date of 1986 on it.  the board provides a male 24-pin connector
 and has 3 jumpers of 3 pins each, two labelled a b c.  i plugged it into my pc
 and ran advanced diagnostics several times, changing the jumper positions each
 time, but the system did not recognise a comm port.
 
 does anyone have a clue as to what this board might be or how to configure it?
 i could use another comm port if it's free.
