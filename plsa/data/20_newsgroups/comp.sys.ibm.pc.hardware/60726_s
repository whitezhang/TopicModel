 
 hi all,
  
     i'm looking for some info regarding an old pcmade by otronics (or
 maybe oltronics) called the attache.  this little beauty is an 8088
 / z80 luggable with a 4 or 5 inch screen (monochrome cga) and 2 360
 floppies.  
     for serial ports it has 2 db-15 connectors (one is labled 'printer')
 and i can't figure out the pinouts for them.  i also don't know if they 
 are standard com ports addressable as com1 and com2.  i have figured out 
 that they'll only work with dos 2.something.  
     
     if anyone can give me some pointers on this one, i'd be most 
 appreciative.  please reply via email, as i can't keep up with news 
 lately.  (finals are coming up you know :( )
 
 thanks much,
 mike gordon   n9loi  mwgordon@nyx.cs.du.edu
