 
 for the past week or so i've been trying to install a qic-36 tape drive
 and an everex 8bit full size controller in my 486dx50 eisa system with no
 luck. i end up getting an error (miscompare) during the streaming read
 part of the test. i am pretty certain that the port setting, irq & dma are
 set properly since the tape responds properly to all commands, rewind,
 retension, write and erase, i also booted the system clean and still the
 same proble so i also tend to eliminate any memory conflicts. it has been
 suggested that my bus speed is too fast and that i need to slow it down.
 my system has an ami bios and i don't have the advanced chip setting
 option that i have seen on other systems so i cant do this. am i going to
 have to accept that this set up won't work? or can anyone suggest a work
 around? i will be glad to hear your advice/suggestions.
