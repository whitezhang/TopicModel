 	i have a similar configuration: colorado 250mb on 66 dx/2 tower.

 	you got suckered in the same way i did.  silly me, believing
 	that the "250" logo on the front meant actual carrying capacity.
 	the people who do this sort of thing for a living call it 
 	"marketing."  lawyers who prosecute it call it "fraud."
 	perhaps we can have a bunch of other duped buyers march on 
 	their corporate headquarters.

 	this is a bit long.  my system takes about 45 minutes to do 
 	the same thing.  usually 4.5 hours, particularly if the tape 
 	is grinding away the whole time means that your block size for 
 	the write is too small.  is there any way to change the block 
 	size or write buffer size so it's bigger?

 	this is because the files are opened by dos.  the files in the 
 	tape directory are likely the executable file or the configuration
 	file for the tape system.  i would recommend running the backup
 	from dos so it will make a complete backup of the tape directory.

 	the 250mb cartridges won't do you any good since the drive
 	won't write 250mb of physical data on the tape.
