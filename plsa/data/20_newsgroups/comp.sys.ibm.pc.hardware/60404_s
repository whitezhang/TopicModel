 ok, i'll try one more time with this one. if anyone out there has any
 information on microscience hard drives and how to set the jumpers
 (and where they are?) for master/slave configurations. i will gladly
 accept any info, as i have a 110m'er sitting in my room collecting dust
 just waiting for me to install huge applications. :) thanks in advance.
 (and yes, i regulary check the ide harddisk spec that is posted here.)
