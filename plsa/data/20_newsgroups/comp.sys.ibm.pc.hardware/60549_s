 i have just a few quick questions.  does anyone here have a 486 dlc
 system? (a cyrix 486 dx)  any problems with it?  
 second, how much should a cyric 486dlc-33 motherboard (with
 no ram) run me?  
 3rd...should a total amatuer (like myslef) be able to perform
 a motherboard swap without the aid of a technician, or is it
 beyond hope?
 4th...i hear that some (if not all) hard drives may require reformatting
 if you switch them to another computer (or motherboard as the case may
 be).  is there any truth to this?
 
 any replies would be greatly appreciated.
