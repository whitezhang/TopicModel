 i need a device (either an isa board or a subsystem) which will
 take two rgb video signals and combine them according to a template.
 the template can be as simple as a rectangular window with signal
 one being used for the interior and signal two for the exterior.
 but i beleive fancier harware may also exist which i do not want
 to exclude from my search.  i know this sort of hardware exists
 for ntsc, etc. but i need it for rgb.
 
 please email and or post any leads....
