 hi,
    i'm currently in the process of writing a number of pd programs
 for the sound blaster. the first of which is a cmf voice editor which
 is hopefully going to be available soon (as soon as i can get it to 
 an ftp site).
 
 anyway the next stage is to use the midi port to enter music and play
 the fm synth remotely. the problem is that i have little or no info
 on the sb midi port.
 
 i have tried using the sound blaster freedom project routines, however
 this just results in the port locking after a couple of accesses and
 loss the of note velocity data byte.
 
 i am using turbo c and would be grateful for any info or source fragments
 may help. when i was in berlin this summer i saw a book which seemed to
 have all this information, but my german is poor to say the least, if anyone
 has this book could they please mail me.
 
 my second request for help concerns standard file formats (how can a file 
 format be standard if you keep it secret ?) i need to know the file format 
 for instrument bank files *.bnk and roland music files *.rol.
 
 finally does anyone have a source for displaying pcx or gif files to ega
 or vga monitors.
 
 please help, you know it makes sense.
 
 colin
