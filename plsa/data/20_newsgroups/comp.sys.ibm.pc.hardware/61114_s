 gateway service has confirmed my suspicion, echoed by a couple of people
 who responded to the original request for help.  the ati vlb video board
 uses the addresses for com 4.  they could suggest no work around.
 i will be returning the df io card they supplied for com 4 (even though it
 could not possibly work) for credit against a bus mouse.  this will free
 up the com port i need - too bad the original salesman who suggested either
 the df io card or the bus mouse would solve my need for a port didn't know
 enough about the hardware.
 
 otherwise i must say that the 486dx2/66 system has worked very well - no
 problems with any other hardware or software.
