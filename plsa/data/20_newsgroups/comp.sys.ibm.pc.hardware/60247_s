 the above does not tell the proper story of scsi:
 scsi-i: 8-bit asynchronous {~1.5mb/s ave}, synchronous {5mb/s max} transfer 
 base.
 scsi-1{faster} this requires a scsi-2 controller chip and provides
  scsi-2 {8-bit to 16-bit} speeds with scsi-1 controlers.
 scsi-2: 4-6mb/s with 10mb/s burst{8-bit}, 8-12mb/s with 20mb/s burst {16-bit}, 
 and 15-20mb/s with 40mb/s burst{32-bit/wide and fast}.  16-bit scsi can be
 wide or fast, it depends on how the port is designed{the quadras will support
 fast scsi but not wide when the os scsi manager is rewritten since the
 quardas use a scsi-1 {non-wide} port}.
 
 the article in pc mag 4/27/93:29 was talking about scsi-1 {scsi-2 uses
 ten (10) devices in it native mode, outside its native mode it behaves a
 lot like scsi-1 (7 devices, slower through put}
 
 from your own figures scsi-1 is indeed twice esdi as the article pointed out
 as for "20% faster then ide" that seems to be 8-bit scsi-1 using a scsi-2 
 contoler chip {the mac quadra uses a scsi-2 controler chip for its scsi-1
 and gets 6mb/s through put for asynchronous {8-bit} scsi-1, far in excess of a
 normal synchronous scsi-1 output} 120% of 8.3 is 9.96 which is near
 the burst of a scsi-1 machine with a scsi-2 controller chip.
 
 the pc world seems to have scsi-1 and scsi-2 mixed up.  fact is scsi-2 
 controler chips allow near scsi-2 speeds through a scsi-1 device
 {as shown in the mac quadra} which skews some of the data of scsi-1 vs
 ide or esdi test. i agree that the article could have stated that the "20%
 faster then ide" came off a scsi-1 device with a scsi-2 chip.  maybe it
 was there and the editor killed it because the article was dealing with
 scsi-1 not scsi-2 and he did not understand the effect of a scsi-1 device
 with a scsi-2 controller chip.
 scsi-1 chips are limited to 5/mb max.  scsi-1 devices with scsi-2 chips
 {becoming common} produce up to 10mb/s in 8-bit mode and 20mb/s in 16-bit
 mode {the fast version, scsi-1 ports cannot use wide scsi}.  of cource
 the prime piece of wierdness is that scsi-1 devices have scsi-2 chips
 {or more accurately the machine does}. this allows the best of both
 worlds: high scsi-2 speeds and cheeper scsi-1 costs {full scsi-2 hardware
 (port, electronic controller, etc) is very expensive.  it also creates
 a logistic nightmare as to how fast scsi-1 goes.
 
 when one knows the facts behind the numbers then one realizes that the
 article knows what it is talking about {even if it does not tell how the
 figures came about} while  dxb132@psuvm.psu.edu is throwing out
 ranges that don't tell squat {since he ignores scsi-1 devices with
 scsi-2 chips his ranges tell even less then intended.} }
