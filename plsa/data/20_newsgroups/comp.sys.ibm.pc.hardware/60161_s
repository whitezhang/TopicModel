 i'm looking for a complete hw/sw solution:
 i need an isa/vlb scsi controller (e.g ultrastor 34f)
 plus a tape drive (500mb or less like archive) plus a windows
 program that will work on these.
 
 my intended system will have 32mb ram so
 plain isa controllers will no longer do.
 but i also hear that the scsi world
 is not very organized.
 
 so does anybody have a tape backup setup
 like what i'm looking for ? please
 describe it.
 
 thanks. e-mail please.
