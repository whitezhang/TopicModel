 i have a 486dx-33 isa pc-compatible (insight) with an infotel internal
 14.4fax/14.4data modem with quicklinkii for windows.  when i first put the
 modem in, i pulled a phone out of the jack in another room, and ran a phone
 line extension to my surge protector and then my computer.  the modem
 worked fine.  then i split the line from the jack in the other room, ran
 the line into my room into the surge protector and up to my computer.  then
 i got a regular phone and plugged that into the phone jack in the modem.
 now when i try to use the modem, quicklinkii says "no dialtone".  the phone
 plugged into the back of the computer works fine.  i tried unplugging the
 phone, but still no dice.  is it that the phone line was split too many
 times?  (i don't understand how this could be a problem, since the phone
 worked fine.)  please note: none of the software or hardware parameters
 were changed, only the phone line itself.  is my new modem faulty?  what
 can i do?
