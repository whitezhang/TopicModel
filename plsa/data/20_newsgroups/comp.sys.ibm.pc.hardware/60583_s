 hello, 
 i have a hayes 9600 moden with no cables or manuals.  the
 modem requires a source of 14v ac, but i do not know how
 to connect the power source to the 3 pin connector.  i know
 that the top pin is the ground, so i would guess that the other
 two are the ac pins, right?  if you have any hints, please
 e-mail me, i really need help...  thanks!!!  duc n.
