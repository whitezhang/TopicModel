 
 i've got a 386dx-40, 4mb and i'm using windows 3.1. sometimes i wondered why 
 windows worked endlessly on my hd when i was doing nothing (execpt having lunch
 or something like that). then i turned this virtual memory swapfile off, and
 windows became quite faster, but now having less memory free. and so i'm still
 wondering, why windows is reading everything from virtual memory when the
 convertional is sufficient? any common-sense-explanation is really appreciated.
