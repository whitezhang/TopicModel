 i recently bought a leading edge 80386dx-33 <mini tower case> and everything
 works fine. leading edge seems to be a decent brand and what-not. i would
 tend to say that it is a decent deal. the only things you might want to be
 wary about is that my l.e. computer has a back-plane mounted motherboard.
 ie: the motherboard itself is a card that can be plugged in to a backplane.
 some people don't like these configurations. the second thing is that
 whoever set up my computer at the factory didn't really know what they were
 doing. the installed windows video driver didn't even take advantage of the
 svga card/monitor. look forward to configuring the system optimally
 yourself.
