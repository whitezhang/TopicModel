 hey folks.
 
 is it possible to short out your cmos chip?  i think mine is fried.
 these are the symptoms...
 
 i have to do the following to get my computer (a gateway 486dx33)
 to boot...
 
     turn the power off
 
     disconnect the battery to the cmos chip
 
     turn the power on
 
     get into setup upon getting the cmos configuration error
 
     set up the cmos
 
     exit the setup with [f10]  (phoenix bios)
 
     ignore the diskette 0 seek error and press [f1]
 
 the computer then boots normally.  both hard drives are accessible
 but the floppy drives are not.
 
 i can back up over the network and such, but if i need to reboot,
 i have to turn off the computer and repeat the steps above.  if i
 simply <ctl>-<alt>-<del>, the computer hangs after the memory test.
 
 does this sound like the cmos chip is fried?  can i buy another one?
 where?
 
 thank you for your kind attention.
 
 john
