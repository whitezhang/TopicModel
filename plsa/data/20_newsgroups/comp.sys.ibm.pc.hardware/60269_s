 hi,
   i am looking to buy an accelerated video card for my 486 dx 50 with	
 isa bus.  i have a 14" svga ni monitor.  i'm currently running
 dos 5.0 and windows 3.1, although i'm considering os/2 in the	
 future.  can anyone make a suggestion for a video card that would
 suit my needs?  how is diamond speedstar? stealth? etc....
 				thanks.
