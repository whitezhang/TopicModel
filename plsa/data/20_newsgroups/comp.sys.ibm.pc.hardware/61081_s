 >come with them might make windows blindingly fast, but:
 
 most fellow diamond video board owners with whom i've corresponded may
 or may not share your opinion about the proprietary clocking scheme, but
 all of those with whom i've chatted have not been thrilled with the
 window's drivers, either.  some modes work fine, but others cause
 strange misdrawn objects, trails, etc.  many have also voiced their
 strong discontent to diamond's ambivalent attitude toward os/2 drivers.
 
 come to think of it, though, i hear and see a lot of complaints about
 the ati boards too, though recent word looks like the build 59 code looks
 much better.
 
 does anyone have an accelerated video board with drivers for windows
 (os/2?) where all the modes function properly?  anyone?  anyone?
