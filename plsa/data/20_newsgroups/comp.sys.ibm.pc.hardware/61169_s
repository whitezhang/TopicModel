 i've posted a couple of notes about encountering this problem. based on some 
 suggestions from:
 
 mark aitchison, university of canterbury, new zealand.
 	and
 chris a. larrieu @cs.wm.edu
 
 i think that my problem is a screen saver that also outputs sound (to my 
 pc speaker). i'm still looking at some of the other screen savers that i 
 use (with a randomizer), but this one definately caused the loss of several 
 minutes over night (but not the date this time).
