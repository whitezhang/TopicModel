 
 today i recieved a in-warranty replacement for my
 diamond speedstar 24x.  on the card i've noticed a few
 changes; mostly there is a new jumper labeled jp5.
 (the card is revision 5a)
 
 my detective work has shown that this jumper simply
 connects/disconnects the bale line on the 64-pin part
 of the isa bus.
 
 the question i have is simple:
 to those people who own this revision of the speedstar 24x,
 what does the manual claim that this jumper does?
 
 to anyone with an isa-reference, what is the function of the
 bale line?
 
 on a related note:
 are there any ftp sites which contain a descriptive reference to
 the isa bus?  my motherboard manual has a simple pin-to-signal-name
 chart, but that is it.
