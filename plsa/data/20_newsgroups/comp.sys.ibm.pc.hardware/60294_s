 (how is 0-40 twice 1.25? do you just pick whatever scsi setup that makes
 the statment "correct"?)
 even if you could make such a statement it would be meaningless unless
 you understood that esdi and ide (i include scsi and ata) are
 completely different (esdi is device-level, like mfm/rll).

 great, you can compare two numbers (ata has several speed modes, by the
 way) but what the article said was misleading/wrong.

 i would recommend people call the ncr board and download the ansi specs
 if they are really interested in this stuff.

 something is missing there. :) anyway, i agree. there's a lot of
 opportunity for marketing jingo like "scsi-2 compliant" which tells
 you nothing about the performance, whether it has "wide" support, etc.

 what does it use? hopefully a good ncr chip (e.g. 53c710)
