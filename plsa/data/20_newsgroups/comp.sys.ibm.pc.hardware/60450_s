 well people, i can only recomend the non-flat-screen, no-hype, 
 no-nonsense nec 3ds that i have, and plus, it has the advantage of
 not having one of those new flat screen tubes which are oversensitive
 and fragile and break often!
 this is a 15'' heavy-duty rugged set for those who insist on well-proven
 reliable technologies!
