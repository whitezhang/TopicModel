 
 n(p>just got a 66mhz 486dx2 system, and am considering getting a fan for the
 n(p>cpu. the processor when running is too hot to touch so i think this is a
 n(p>fairly good idea. (long ago when i did some electronics training i read
 n(p>somewhere that the regions within a chip that define junctions/gates etc
 n(p>slowly diffuse over time and this increases with temperature, hence a hot
 n(p>chip goes off-spec sooner)
 
 n(p>has anyone out there got a cpu fan??
 
 i work for a small pc oem. we offer both a personal and professional
 system line. our 486 pro machines always have a cpu cooling fan on dx2
 and dx-50 units.
 
 n(p>is there more than 1 type?
 
 there are several manufacturers.
 
 n(p>do you have to remove the cpu from its scoket to install the fan?
 
 sometimes - depends on the specific fan model.
 
 n(p>do all cpu fans derive their power from spare drive power lines?
 
 all the ones i've seen do; many come with a 'y' connector, so you don't
 have to have a "spare" connector.
 
 n(p>anyone had any trouble with cpu fans?
 
 none.
 
 n(p>does anyone have any evidence that cpu fans are a complete waste of
 money?
 
 touch a 486dx-50 chip after its been running a few minutes - you won't
 feel the fan is a waste!
 
 n(p>how are these fans attached? (glue? clips? melted cheese?)
 
 depends on the model. many use clips - make sure you use heat sink
 grease, or heat transfering tape, or you will have wasted your money.
 
 n(p>roughly how much cooler will the cpu be with a fan as opposed to
 without? (an advert i've read claims 85f vs 185f)
 
 tough to tell - i do know the chip sheds a lot of heat.
