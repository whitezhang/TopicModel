 
 the jp5 on the speedstar 24x is for those systems with boot-up problems.
 if your system fails to boot-up proprtly, please pull off the jumper
 block from jp5. this will not affect the proformance of the speedstar 24x.
  
 this is what my manual says about jp5. i never knew that it was there
 but the card is a real ask kicker in my book. it beats the hell out
 of my junk sony 1604s to the point that i can't even use above 648x480
 mode much...sam
 some times an upgrage turns out to be a big overkill, like driving a sony
 with a 24x that the monitor can't handle. or installing 60ns simms and
 then finding out that your mother board doesn't have a cmos wait state
 adjustment to take advantage of the new 60ns simms that you just bought!
