 yes, but what if my monitor only has 3 bnc's on it, and is expecting
 to get a composite sync signal on the "green"?  there ought to be a
 little black box that takes the vga signalling (which has horiz, vert,
 and composite sync on different pins, plus the r, g, and b pairs) and
 merges the green and composite sync together in the output.  it's all
 1v analog, as far as i know.  i can build this with op-amps but i don't
 think i can get the shielding done well enough to handle the frequencies
 involved without lots of shadows and junk on the screen.
 
 does anyone know of a vga->rgb(composite sync on green) converter?
