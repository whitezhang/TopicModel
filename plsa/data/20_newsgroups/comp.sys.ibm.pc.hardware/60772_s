 
 i have a new monitor which i set up approximately 3-4 feet from 
 where the ac power enters my house - at my fuse box. 
 
 is this safe for the monitor, or will/can the emf emitted by the ac current eventually affect my monitor?  if so, how, and is the 
 damage permanent or would degaussing fix it?
 
 thanks,
 tom catalino
