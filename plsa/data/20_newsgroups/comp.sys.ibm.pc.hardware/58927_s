 this may be the dumbest question of the year, but is there a
 way to 'piggyback' or expand a 6-slot motherboard (all 16-bit)
 to get the usual 8?  my case has slots for 8, and i'd like to
 get a scanner, but with all my other cards i'm already max'd out!
 i'm hoping that a simple solution exists, e.g. an adapter that turns
 one slot into three.  i don't mind if it turns it into 8-bit slots,
 as i can put my i/o card, midi card, and soundblaster card there.
 my other cards are 16 bit (ide/floppy, svga, modem).
 
 if there is such an expander, does that screw up performance of
 everything else?  i'd hate to buy a new motherboard! :-(
