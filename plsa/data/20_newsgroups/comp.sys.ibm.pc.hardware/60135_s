 hi,
 
 i just disassembled my old xt and get 2 disk drives - 30m hard drive and a 
 360k floppy drive.  my questions are:
 
  -can i use these 2 drives as drives d & e on my 386sx25 ?  this 386sx25
   currently has 80m hard drive, 1.2m & 1.44m floppy drives.
 
  -if i can, what s/w or h/w do i need ?
 
  please send your advice/comments to aovai@qube.ocunix.on.ca
 
  thanks a lot,
 
  av
