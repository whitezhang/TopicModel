 hi,
   just a quick question reguarding pc tape backup. i own a 386 dos box
 and have an archive vp402 interface card connected to a qic-02 tape
 drive. now the simple question is, does anybody in netland know were i
 can get some software for msdos (ver 5.0) to run this setup, freeware
 or shareware preferred .
 
 thanks in advance,
                    darryl
