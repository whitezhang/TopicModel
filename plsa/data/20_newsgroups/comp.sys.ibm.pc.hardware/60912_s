 hello,
 
 for 2 months i've unsuccessfully attempted to get either
 a 3rd or 4th serial port working on my system.
 
 various systems diagnostics (e.g., msd, norton) tell me
 it's there, but anything i hook up to it can't use it
 
 i have two serial ports on the motherboard
 
 if i set my internal fax/modem for com4 the utility
 programs report a com3
 
 i've checked to make sure all the irqs and addresses are
 correctly (as listed in most manuals) set
 
 am i missing something very basic?
 
 where should i go from here?
 
 any help, even a point in the right direction, would be
 most appreciated.
