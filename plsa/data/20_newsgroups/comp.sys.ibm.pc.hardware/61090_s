 that is, if the special software is free, like xfree86.  there are
 vendors that sells diamond x drivers for commercial unices.  but
 then, they charge $$$$.

 i think they only need a signing (i.e. no paying).  this still
 violates the fsf's policy of publically available code.

 while this is true, there are fixes for those who have already
 bought diamond cards.  in linux, for example, there are utilities
 that will put the card in vesa mode before invoking x.  of course,
 this means no fine tuning of diamond cards, but at least this
 will allow those who're stuck with them to use linux+x.
 
 i agree with mark's suggestion:  if you are buying a video card
 for specialized free software, avoid diamond.  but if you already
 have one, there may be a fix that can help you.

 ask me about linux, the freely distributable unix clone for the 386/486.
