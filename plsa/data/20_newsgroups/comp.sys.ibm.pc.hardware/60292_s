 i've started to notice the same thing myself. i'm running dos 5 and win 3.1 so
 i can fix it from the windows control panel. at times it is the date, at
 others the clock seems to be running several minutes behind where it should
 be.
 
 if you find out i'd like to know also. oh, and i also leave my system running
 all the time.
