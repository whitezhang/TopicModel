 subject: re: how hot should the cpu be?
 date: wed apr 21 19:01:49 1993
 
 the temp on my 486dx2/66 is over 96c (measured with a k-type thermocouple 
 and fluke 55 dig thermometer).  this is an "idle" temp - not doing lots of
 bus i/o, not doing floating point, not doing 32-bit protected mode etc.  this
 is in a micron computer, without heatsink.
 
 i recently put a heatsink/fan on the chip, but i might take the fan off.  it
 makes a horrible whine at times, and i wonder what the vibration is doing to
 the pins on the cpu etc...

 rob,
 don't worry about the whine of the fan it will go away in about 3 weeks
 of use, mine did...
 as to the vibration well that something i thought about to as i have
 a tower case and the mb is mounted vertically. so i mounted the fan
 on the case so that it just blows air at the cpu and its heatsink
 instead. work just like a charm, but the realy biggy to think about
 is after the whine goes away on the fan. if the fan should stop (burn out)
 how would you ever know this before the cpu goes up in smoke. thats what
 you should be thinking about. i have the parts together but have not
 had the time to assemble them as yet. but you build a thermistor controlled
 circuit that will turn on a pesso speaker and a led when the temp. goes
 above the normal operating range (96c) or there abouts. cheep to do if
 you use radio shack junk under $5....think about that one for a while!
