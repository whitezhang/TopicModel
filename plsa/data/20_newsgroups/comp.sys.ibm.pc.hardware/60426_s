 there is a way in which a multi-tasking computer actually gives you
 more cpu power then you had before, and that is with i/o overlap.
 with i/o overlap, your cpu can continue to "think" while disk
 operations are underway, whereas without overlap, your cpu sits idly
 waiting for each disk operation to finish - and disk operations take
 an *eternity*, compared to a fast cpu.
 
 so, when you've got multi-tasking, you want to increase performance by
 increasing the amount of overlapping you do.
 
 one way is with dma or bus mastering.  either of these make it
 possible for i/o devices to move their data into and out of memory
 without interrupting the cpu.  the alternative is for the cpu to move
 the data.  there are several scsi interface cards that allow dma and
 bus mastering.  ide, however, is defined by the standard at interface
 created for the ibm pc at, which requires the cpu to move all the data
 bytes, with no dma.

 os/2 2.0 will do for me until amigados for the 386 comes along...
