 i have a question regarding sending a null character across ethernet
 connection. the actual problem is that emacs (unix editior) needs
 the null character for setting a mark and unfortunately we don't know
 how to sent that from ibm pcs across ethernet. i am wondering if anyboy
 knows the keyboard combination for sending the null character. 
 btw control,shift 2 which ctrl @ does not work.
 
 thanks
