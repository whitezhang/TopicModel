 most likely reason is that your backup battery is failing - this battery 
 maintains the contents of the cmos memory when ac power is turned off, and
 if the battery is flakey then the contents of the cmos will be lost and 
 the checksum will be wrong (along with most other of the cmos data). try 
 replacing the battery.
 
 if, however, your pc doesn't use a battery but a large capacitor to power
 the cmos, you should check to see if you can replace the capacitor with a 
 more normal lithium battery. if this isn't possible, make sure you leave
 your pc on for a half hour or hour each day; this will keep the capacitor 
 charged. i'd opt for the battery change, though.
 
 it's also possible, but unlikely that a rogue problem or even a virus is 
 corrupting the cmos. if your battery seems okay, get a virus scanner and
 check out your system.
