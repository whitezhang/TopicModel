 i have a colorado memory systems jumbo 250 tape backup unit in my gateway
 486/33v tower system. i have found the supplied backup capability to be 
 fairly unreliable. in approx 3 cases out of 10, i have had the backup fail
 at one point or another, often hanging in the middle of writing the tape.
 seek errors, drive communication errors seem to be most common. i use the
 dos backup software from colorado memory systems. should i return the drive,
 get some better backup software, reformat the tapes (am using cms tapes)?
 any hints would be appreciated - this stuff is to time-consuming to do over
 and over again until it cooperates...
