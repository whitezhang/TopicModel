 the subject says it all. i'm wondering if anyone on the net has
 had any experiences with cornell computer systems of california.
 i was checking out their ad in computer shopper, and they seem to
 have a good balance between service, price, and hardware. the question
 is -- are they reliable?
 
 e-mail responses would be appreciated.
 
 thanks,
 adam.
