 
 'lo all,
 
   i am writting a program that checks a computer for its configuration.
 it's going to be run everytime a computer boots up to our campus
 network.  (actually, it already is running, it's just not getting all
 the info i want it to yet...)  anyway, i want to check for a mouse.  i
 already check for a mouse driver (using the code in microsoft's mouse
 book).  but there is no guarantee that the driver is loaded when my
 program runs, or that they ever load the driver.
 
   since i am interested in what hardware is attached to the machine, how
 do i detect is a mouse is attached?  i know it can be done because the
 mouse driver can do it.
 
   thanks in advance,
 
 andy
