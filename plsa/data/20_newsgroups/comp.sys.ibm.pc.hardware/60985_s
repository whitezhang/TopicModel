 i went out and bought the pas16 yesterday, and installed it into my gateway
 dx2-66v. i followed the instructions and set the sb side with dma 1 and irq5
 (the default) and then the pas side with dma 5 and irq 10. my question is how
 should i configure for mpu-401 compatibility. the manual and installation
 program recommended irq2, but on my machine it is configured to [cascade] to
 irq8-15. so can i still use irq2, or should i choose a different one? right now
 i have the mpu-401 emulation mode turned off. actually what is this "cascade to
 irq8-15" business?  
 
 a related questions (to other gw or vl-bus machine owners) i was told that 
 only dma 5, 6, 7 are 16 bit dmas, and 0-4 are 8 bit dmas. now what about
 32-bit vl-bus mastering dmas?? which dma channel(s) is used by the vl-bus
 extension to do 32-bit dma?
 
 yet another question, after installing pas16, my links (golf game) will hang
 the machine when i select sb mode and run, but works with adlib mode??
 civilization however works fine ( at least so far). any body knows what i might
 have done wrong? 
 
 thanks (i am obviously a newbie) -- john
