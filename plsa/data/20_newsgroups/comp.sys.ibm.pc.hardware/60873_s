 i have a leading edge 486sx25 with 4 megs of ram that are in the forms of  
 4 1 meg simms.  each simm has *two* chips on it. they are manufactured by  
 samsung and are 80ns.  a salesman told me that the leading edge cpc-2300  
 motherboard has the extra parity bit built in and reccomemnded i use mac  
 simms. i tried using 4 megs pulled out of a mac si (these are 8 chip  
 simms), but i got too many windows protection faults and parity errors. i  
 guess i should use the same simms as the ones i have, but i can't find  
 any!! most of the places i have called carry only 3 8 or 9 chip simms.
 
 so if anybody knows where i can get memory that is good with my computer  
 or if you have any suggestions at all, please let me know.
 
 any help is truly appreciated.
