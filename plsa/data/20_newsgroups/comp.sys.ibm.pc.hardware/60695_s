 i just installed a dx2-66 cpu in a clone motherboard, and tried mounting a cpu 
 cooler on the chip.  after about 1/2 hour, the weight of the cooler was enough 
 to dislodge the cpu from its mount.  it ended up bending a few pins
 on the cpu, but luckily the power was not on yet.  i ended up
 pressing the cpu deeply into its socket and then putting the cpu
 cooler back on.  so far so good.
 
 have others had this problem?  how do you ensure that the weight of
 the cpu fan and heatsink do not eventually work the cpu out of its
 socket when mounting the motherboard in a vertical case?
