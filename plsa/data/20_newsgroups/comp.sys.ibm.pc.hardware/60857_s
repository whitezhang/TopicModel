 i know you work at sun, but that's really no reason not to like fast 
 computers. i suspect a conspiracy here. are you trying to drag intel through 
 the mud at a con or something? i really wish you guys would make your own 
 computers faster instead of degrading others'. why don't you go straight for 
 the top and run a pentium at 0.7 mhz while you're at it?
 
 seriously though; why in the bleeding hell do you want a 386/40 to run at 
 25mhz?????????????
