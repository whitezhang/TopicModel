 while playing around with my gateway 2000 local-bus machine last
 night, it became apparent that windows 3.1 didn't give the option
 for 32-bit access for virtual memory.
 
 i am using a permanent swap file, and the disk drive is on the local
 bus interface.
 
 is this expected, or should i be investigating further why no 32-bit
 option appears?
 
 thanks for any help.
