 
      i would like to thank all those people who responded to my post.  i 
 would, however, like to clear some things up.  my tape drive is *external*.
 also, the connector on the back of it is of the male db-37 pin variety.
 as a result, i cannot easily find a cost-effective solution to use the drive.
 
      any advice will be greatly appreciated.  i would prefer email.
      thanks!
