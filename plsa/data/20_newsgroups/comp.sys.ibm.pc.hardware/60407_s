 there is a simple answer.  if my memory serves me the scsi bios will only
 work as the first or second drive.  any "built-in" drives e.g. ide are
 installed first and then when the scsi bios runs it will try to install
 as the next drive.  but if there are already two drives, then no can do.
 
 the solution is simple: use the aspi4dos device driver and disable the
 scsi bios (as it is useless in your case).  it works like a champ!  i
 have seen a similar situation before.
 
 good luck
