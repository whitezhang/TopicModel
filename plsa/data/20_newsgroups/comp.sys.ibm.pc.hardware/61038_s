 greetings,
 
 	i am looking to upgrade my hard drive to a much bigger
 one since i find myself kinda cramped on space, althuogh i have never filled
 it i would like the extra comfort of 30 megs or so.  if anyone would like
 to sell/trade a newish 80 meg or bigger hard drive for 125 straight and
 75 with a trade please e-mail me back at johng2matt.ksu.ksu.edu
 with an offer.  i would also sell my hard drive for about 60$ if you
 really want it.  it's a 42mb western digital ide.  other than that i am not
 sure what the transfer rate is, but it is pretty fast. faster than my
 roommates teac drive.  i have addstor running on it now and have had it
 for about 5 months.  i have *never* had a problem with it and would guarantee
 it works upon deliveree.  thanks
