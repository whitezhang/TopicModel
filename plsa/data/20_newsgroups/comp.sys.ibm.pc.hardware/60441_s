 i have a new mr535 mitsubishi hard drive (rll or mfm) that has been
 in storage and will not format.  i suspected that the switch settings
 may have been moved in the movement of the drive from one place to
 another.  does anyone have the switch settings for this drive.  it has
 j1 sw1 with 6 switches and sw2 has 8 switches.  sw2 is the one that 
 selects the drive number.  if you have info on this drive, or know 
 a number i can call to configure it, please, please let me know by
 email.  it has 977 cyl 5 heads and i think is type 17.        
 
 thanks in advance!
