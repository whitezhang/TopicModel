 hi,
 
 i'm looking to buy a 17" monitor soon, and it seems that i can't decide what
 monitor i should buy. i have a mag 17s (this is a .25 dpi version and it using
 a triniton tube) and a nanao 560i in mind.
 
 does anyone know of any specification or problems these monitor have?
 
 actually, any related opinions at buying a 17" monitor will be welcomed.
 
 
  thanks in advance,
