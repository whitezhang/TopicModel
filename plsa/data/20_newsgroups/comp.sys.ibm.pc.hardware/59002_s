 hi,
 
 i am going through a box of old ibm card and came across one called a 
 
 rapid technology squeeze card.  it is dated 1990 and has a 54mhz crystal on
 it and a big chip that has 'c-cube' on it.
 
 no connectors to the outside, but a ribbon-type 50-pin connector on the board.
 
 it is a 16-bit board.
 
 any ideas what it is?
 
 
 phil
