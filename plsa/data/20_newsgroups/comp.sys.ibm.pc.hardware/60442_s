 one of the monitors i reviewed for the june issue of windows magazine was
 the mitsubishi.  i also reviewed a new nanao, the f550iw, which has just
 been released.  last year for the may '92 issue of windows, i reviewed
 several monitors, including the nanao t560i.  there's no question that the
 nanao monitors are the best available this year, just as they were last
 year.  the difference between my ranking of the best in windows and the
 ranking in windows sources is due mainly to a difference in the testing
 criteria and the scoring.  i used different tests than they did, and i
 scored differently.  there's nothing wrong with the mitsubishi, and it
 scored very highly in my tests, but it was a few points shy of perfect.
 
 incidentally, one of the things everyone should do when they're reading
 reviews of any product, whether it's monitors or mice, is to read the
 criteria and methodology carefully.  unless you know how the product
 testing was done, and on what the scores are based, you can't possibly
 know what they really mean.  just seeing that i rank a monitor differently
 from windows sources is meaningless without knowing how we did the
 ranking.  likewise, it's impossible to tell whether a monitor will meet
 your needs unless you know how we did the testing.  after all, some of
 what we do may not apply to you.  likewise, some of what we do may apply
 more closely in one review than in another.  you can't always tell
 anything from reading the 300 or so words of commentary we write if you
 don't also understand the scoring.
