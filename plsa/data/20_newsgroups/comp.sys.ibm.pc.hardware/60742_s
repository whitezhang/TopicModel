 i have a dfi handy scanner model hs-3000plus and a little bit of
 software running under dos to use it. i'd like to make more extensive
 use of this device (in particular, write a driver for it on unix).
 
 so, can anyone give me a description of how to talk to this device. it
 connects to the system via it's own interface card.
 
 any info would help, it can't be too difficult to talk to :-)
 
 thanks, brian wallis...
