 i have both!
 
 i have ide only on my dros box and ide and scsi on my unix box.
 
 ide on the dros box 'cos it only has a hard disk, scsi on my unix box 'cos it
 has a scsi hard disk, cd-rom and tape.
 
 i bought scsi as it makes adding many devices easier. for the price of one
 irq and dma i have three different types of device connected up.
 
 faster drives are also available for scsi - i have a dec dsp3085s that realy
 does have a 9ms average seek time. i.e it finds data 25% faster than my 12ms
 toshiba drive.

 i don't think that scsi will increase your data transfer much on an isa bus :-(

 890kb/s is pretty good...

 many state of the art scsi disks use the *same* mechanicals as many state of the
 art ide drives. only the interface electronis differ - look at the 520mb fijitsu
 drive for an example!

 i use an adaptec 1542b on my unix box and no-name ide cards on both.

 caching controller! why? what does it give you that smartdrive ( for dos ) does 
 not? about 30kb extra lower memory! that's about it.
 
 a properly configured main memory cache will produce better results than a caching
 controller! my unix reads reads data from its main memory cache at 8.5mb/s! that's
 faster than the standards isa bus can ever sustain!
