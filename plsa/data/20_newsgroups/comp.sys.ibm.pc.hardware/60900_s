 
 i bought a 386dx-40 motherboard for 50$... no documentation at all. everything
 appears to work, except i'm having trouble getting a few of the led connectors
 working. i've looked at the manuals for 4 other motherboards, but the pin
 configuration doesn't look anything like what is on this board. does this
 pin arrangement look familiar to anyone out there??? any hints on where i
 can find this information?
 
                  1                 10
       "speaker"  . . . . . . . . . .
       "keylock"  . . . . . . . . . .
                  11          ^     20
                        j23   |
                              |the board came with a jumper vertically across
                               these two pins.
 
 i can get the power/keylock to work across pins 11-15, reset across pins 9 and
 19, but would prefer not to blow something up by further experimentation.
 the date on the board itself is 6/92, opti chips.
 
 i would really appreciate any help, and thank you in advance.
