         i'm buying a new system this week to replace my brain dead 286, and
 could use some feedback on a couple systems i'm looking at if anyone is
 familiar with them.
  
         the system that looks the most interesting is the budget 486/66 vlb
 tower.  for about $2343 (delivered) it offers vlb, 8mb, 200mb ide, a mitsumi
 cd-rom (with software bundle), media vision sound board, 14" ctx 1468ni,
 128k cache, and the usual drives, ports, & os software.  since my budget is
 $2350 for a system, it seems almost too good to be true (which may mean it
 is too good to be true, of course). among other things, i've never seen a
 review of the budget systems (or their parent company, micro smart), or of
 the motherboard they are using (the aetana). any feedback would be
 appreciated.
  
         in a similar vein, the second system i'm considering midwest micro's
 elite vesa 486/66 tower with a diamond viper (2mb) & midwest micro 14" mi
 monitor is one i've never seen reviewed anywhere.  i'm familiar with the
 firm but not the product line - and some idea of their quality would be abig
 benefit here as well.
  
         any other suggestions in the price range would be appreciated - my
 greatest needs are speed and graphics capabilities.
  
 	email response would be greatly appreciated.
 
 	thanks,
