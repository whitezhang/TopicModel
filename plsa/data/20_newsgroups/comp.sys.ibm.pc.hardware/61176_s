 i originally posted a complaint about how noisy my pc was. i got several 
 useful suggestions, but 1 was the most seductive: run your pc in silence by 
 removing the fan altogether!
 
 two variables: 
 1) i always run my pc without the cover, and 
 2) i'd be willing to attach a cpu cooler if that would make a difference.
 
 should i try to run my pc without a fan? i know it sounds like utter folly so 
 i'm asking - has anyone done this succesfully? or tragically? you're answer 
 may save my pc... thanks.
