 this isn't at all too high of a price.  keep in mind that you get *8* meg of 
 ram, a *local bus* ide *and* svga card,  a *250* mb hd, and a *15"* 
 monitor.  the local bus ide and svga really kick butt in windows.  i have 
 used a couple of machines with vlb in the past, and all i can do is praise 
 gateway.
