 i own a pc fancard ii, which is a slightly different beast.  it's a long card
 that plugs into an 8 or 16 bit slot and contains two muffin fans.  it requires
 no extra cabling.  i had a 286 that was experiencing some problems due to
 heat.  the fancard made the system run cool enough so that the problem no
 longer appears.  it's supposed to keep the internal temperature in the range
 of 75-95 degrees fahrenheit.  according to the maker's (m.s. tech)
 advertisements, the us army used a bunch of these to keep their pcs running
 (w/o a/c) in desert storm.  i can't vouch for that.  however, i am a satisfied
 customer.  and i have no other connection with the maker or the mail-order
 house (lyben  (313) 268-8100).
 
 hope this helps,
 
 george
