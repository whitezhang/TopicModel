 excuse me to every one.
 i am an amiga owner and tired to have the same graphic modes.
 so i saw on nn there was a little bridgeboard that made the
 amiga's pc slots communicate with the stanndard amiga's slot.
 the building mother house of this little gadget assure me
 that using this thing i can use all the pc boards included
 the svga cards.
 i am interested in computer graphics and i do not know many
 things about pc in general.
 so, what is the best (isa slot) card on the market ?
 i'd like to reach resolutions like 1280x1024 with 256
 colors or 800x600 with 24 bitplanes.
 
 any suggestion ??
 
 thankyou in advance
