 some motherboards support vl bus and 50-dx cpu.  there is an option
 (bios i think) where additional wait(s) can be added with regard to
 cpu/vl bus transactions.  this slows the cpu down to a rate that gives
 the vl bus device(s) time to 'do their thing'.  these particular wait(s)
 are applied when the cpu transacts with vl bus device(s).  you want to
 enable these wait(s) only if you are using a 50-dx with vl bus devices.
 
 this is from reading my motherboard manual, and these are my interpre-
 tations.  your mileage may vary.
 
 strictly speaking, vl and 50mhz are not compatable.  and, there is at
 least one 'fudge' mechanism to physically allow it to work.
