 i am trying to help a friend of mine get the second serial port on his dtk
 i/o plus ii card working and it does not want to cooperate. the documentation
 is no help at all. as an example, it says 'the serial port can be changed to
 com2 from com1 by moving jumpers.' but does not say what jumpers to move!! :-(
 
 there are 2 banks of jumpers. the first one is labeled as follows:
 c1
 c2
 s2
 p2
 p1
 g
 
 the second bank is labeled "irq" and has the following labels:
 5c
 5s
 4
 3
 3s
 2c
 2s
 
 i have determined that the c1 & c2 jumpers tell it to address the first
 serial port as com1 or com2. the p1,p2 jumpers tell it to use the printer
 port as lpt1 or lpt2. i am guessing that the "g" enables the game port and
 the "s2" should enable the second serial port, but i can't get it to work. i
 have tried numerous setting on the irq bank without success. i assume that
 this bank must tell the card which irq's to use for both ports, but i don;t
 know how.  any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!!
