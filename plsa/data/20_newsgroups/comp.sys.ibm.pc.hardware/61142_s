 i have two scsi hard drives, each has 512kb of 'cache'.
 
 there several reasons for this :-
 
 when the drive has read requested data from the disk the scsi bus may be
 busy. this data needs to be stored some where until the bus is free and
 the data can be transmitted.
 
 when the drive receives data to be written, the data can come down the bus
 faster than the drive can write it to the disk. it needs to be stored
 somewhere while the disk is writing it out.
 
 in these situations the memory is being used as a buffer not a cache!
 
 may be the drive does some read-adead caching as well...
