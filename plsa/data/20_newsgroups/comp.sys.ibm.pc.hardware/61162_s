 
   has anybody ever heard of hawk eisa/vlb motherboards?  net computers
 international (from computer shopper) has the 486/33 version w/256k
 cache for $559.  i'm trying to decide between this motherboard and the
 nice motherboard.  thanks!
 
   ps:  the hawk motherboard has 3 eisa slots, two of which are vlb.  the
 spec sounds identical to the nice.
