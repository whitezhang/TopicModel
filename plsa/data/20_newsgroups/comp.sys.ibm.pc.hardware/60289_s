 about two months ago i purchased the adaptec asw-410 driver for use with a
 cd-rom drive.  at the time this seemed the thing to do as the documentation i
 had with my adaptec scsi controller said that this is the driver to be used with
 cd-rom drives.  since then i have learn that this driver is out of date in a
 major way and that adaptec have an upgrade deal for going to the next driver
 (i think it's called ezi-scsi or something).  i wasn't too fussed about this
 until i upgraded by cd-rom drive from a sony cdu-541 to a sony cdu-641.  i now
 find that the audio-mode will not work.  i assume it is not being handled
 correctly by the asw-410 driver.
 
 so, should i chase adaptec for an upgrade?  if so does anyone know their
 fax number?
 
 any assistance appreciated.
 
 regards
 
 btw: everything else works fine, certainly seems that sony have caught up with
      the rest with the 641.
