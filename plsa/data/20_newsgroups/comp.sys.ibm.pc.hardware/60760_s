 i recently bought an amd 386/40.  the motherboard booklet says
 the board is a "391 wb/h."  i have 4 1x3 simms on board.  the machine
 also uses a super ide i/o card (model pt-604). (of course niether
 the motherboard or the i/o card booklet clearly state who the manufacurers
 are) i'm also using a trident 8900c svga card.
 
 	anyway, that's all of the pertinent info i can think of.
 my problem is that the computer often freezes or displays "parity error --
 system halted" messages depending on whether i set the memory parity error
 checking to "disabled" or "enabled" in the setup of the bios (makes sense).
 its ami bios (so it must be an ami board?).
 
 	i just took it back to the dealer and they replaced all of the
 simms but i keep getting the same error (more frequently now).  it all
 worked at the dealer and didn't start screwing up 'till i got home (figures).
 
 	i've tried to take out all of the simms and even re-inserted them
 in reverse order, making sure that the connections were solid.
 
 	my suspicion jumps to this damn all in one hd controller/serial/
 parallel/game-port i/o card, or to the motherboard (god forbid).
 
 	can anyone help?
 
 thanks, peace,
