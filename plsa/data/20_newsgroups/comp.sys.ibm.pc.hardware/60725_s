     could anybody please tell me where i might be able to find device drivers 
 for a couple of older gateway ethernet cards?  i don't have the model number
 off hand, but they have only a bnc connector, and a header connector for 
 a novell keycard (one has one installed).
  
     i'm looking at using these with a 2 node copy of 10-net that i picked up
 at a swap meet.  (i'd love to do lantastic or netware lite, but i'm a poor
 college student and the price was right.)
 
     please reply via email, as i haven't had a lot of time for news because
 of exams and such.
