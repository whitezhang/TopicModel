 the original poster, john navitsky, said that he might use the monitor on
 a sparcstation lx. the lx is able to generate a picture at 1280*1024 at
 76 hz. not officially, but i tried to set this resolution and refresh rate
 and the lx came up with a non-syncing screen. our tube obviously couldn't
 handle this speed. at 67 hz, it worked perfectly.
 
 when buying a third party monitor that's going to be used on a sparcstation
 lx, you might consider a monitor that's fast enough to do 1280*1024 at 76hz.
 i don't know for sure whether the lx supports this (sun certainly won't tell
 you) so you'll have to check.
