 windows: the recent reviews have all shown that the p9000 cards are
 	 significantly faster doing windows than the ati card.
 
 vga:	 the recent reviews have all shown that the p9000 cards they looked
 	 at are significantly slower doing vga than the ati card.  about
 	 1/2 the speed, as i recall.
 
 	 the big question for me is the orchid v9000 card.  each of the 
 	 p9000 cards tested so far has had the w5186 to do vga.  orchid
 	 is the only one i know about (i don't know about ami) that uses
 	 the w5286 for vga.  that is reportedly faster.
 	 
 	 i would like to know whether the orchid card can do vga as fast as
 	 the ati card.  if so, it would appear to be a formidable competitor.
 	 (advertised prices are about the same for the two cards.)
 
 someone in this group posted a little while back that they were getting an
 orchid v9000 card -- has that card arrived?  what do the benchmarks look
 like?
 
 also, is the ami p9000-based card real?  what does it use for vga?  speed?
