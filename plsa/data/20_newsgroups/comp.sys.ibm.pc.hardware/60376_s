 ide also uses dma techniques.  i believe floppy controller also uses dma,
 and most a/d boards also use dma.  dma is no big deal, and has nothing to
 do directly with scsi.

 you can thank your software for that.  if dos had a few more brains, it
 could format floppies etc. while you were doing something else.  the
 hardware will support it, but dos (at least) won't.  again, this has   
 nothing to do with scsi.

 and if you stick with dos you'll wonder why you can't multitask.
 
 again i ask why can't a unix or os/2 type os do all the miraculous things
 with an ide harddrive that it can with a (single) scsi hard drive.
