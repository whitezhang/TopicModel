 hello,
 
 	i have a 486sx25 isa machine with pheonix bios.  currently i have  
 8 megabytes of ram installed via eight 1 mg simms on the motherboard: ie.  
 both banks are full, and there is no space for more simms.  i am thinking  
 of running os2 on my machine and possibly linux with x windows, and i know  
 that more ram would be helpful.  however with simms, the only solution i  
 can see is to sell my 8 megs for about $180, and by 4 4mg simms for about  
 $400 used. apart from the fact that i can't afford the price right now,  
 the entire process of selling ram and buying it used probably means that  
 the machine might be down for a number of days which i would rather  
 avoid...
 
 so my question is, do the at ram boards that plug into a free slot work  
 well with a 486 isa machine. i have seen some being sold used for about  
 $90 with 4 mg with space for another 4mg's.  if these boards do work, how  
 do they do it?  is a device driver needed, or will the bios pickup the  
 extra ram as it does with the simms on the mother board? i know that the  
 isa expansions slots are 16-bits and 486 simm memory is 32 bits, so  
 probably all of this is just wishful thinking... however any help is truly  
 appreciated.
