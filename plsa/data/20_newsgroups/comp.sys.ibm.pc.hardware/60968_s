      no, it's not true.  you can get scsi and ide to work together, but
 there are restrictions (at least with the adaptec 1542):
 
 * you must boot from the ide drive.  there is no way to boot from the
   scsi drive if you have both ide and scsi drives.
 
 * you must disable the scsi rom bios (i'm not sure about this, though),
   and so you must also use some special drivers to access the scsi
   drive.  (hmm.  i know that you have to disable something related to
   the scsi bios, but i'm not sure if it is the rom itself.)
 
      back in february, someone asked about ide and scsi (this question
 gets asked again and again).  at the end of this message, i've included
 an edited copy of my reply.  you might find it interesting.

      for msdos applications, isa-based scsi and ide controllers
 generally have comparable throughput.  you might get slightly higher
 throughput with a scsi disk, but you'll also pay more for the disk
 ($30-$100 and up, in some cases).  you'll also pay much, much more for a
 good scsi controller.
 
      note that good scsi controllers really show their power if they're
 used with a good multitasking operating system (like a pc unix).
 unfortunately, neither msdos nor windows 3.1 is a good multitasking
 operating system.  the performance advantage of scsi controllers is
 mostly wasted with these, which leaves the advantage of being able to
 connect multiple devices to the scsi bus as the only advantage.
 however, note that you can expect to pay a premium for scsi devices.
 
      if you're only going to be using msdos, stick with ide.  it's
 cheaper, and you'll have less headaches.

 [ note: the following is true for msdos/windows only.  who knows what
   the future holds for windows nt and unix??? ]
 
      no.  generally, you have to find drivers for each scsi device,
 which probably don't exist unless you're using one of the "better"/"high
 performance" scsi controllers.  these are typically bus-mastering scsi
 controllers that cost around $180-$400 (street prices) and up, and
 drivers that allow you to connect these controllers to popular
 name-brand scsi devices either come with the card, or can be purchased
 (for under $100 list price).  examples of such driver kits are:
 
 * adaptec's ez scsi kit (list: $75).  this works only with adaptec scsi
   controllers.
 
 * corelscsi! (from the same people who make coreldraw!) (list: $99 (?)).
   this driver kit will supposedly work with any scsi controller card
   that has an aspi driver, like the adaptec.
 
      central point's pc tools for dos 8.0 supports a number of scsi tape
 drives (the documentation lists 40 tape drives).  unfortunately, it
 works only with adaptec controllers.

      yes, you will run into problems, if you're using a
 high-performance, bus-mastering scsi controller.  this doesn't sound
 right, doesn't it?  it's true, though.  with one of these controllers,
 you'll probably have to tweak your system to get it to work with sound
 cards, floppy-controller-based tape drives (like the cms jumbo 250), and
 windows 3.1.  i know.  i've been to h*ll and back getting my scsi
 controller to work with various hardware/software (thank god for tape
 backups).  if you want a copy of my "adaptec 1542 hints and tips" file,
 send email.
 
      these problems aren't really the fault of the scsi controller card;
 the problems are really with the general hardware and software design of
 the pc (e.g., no standards).  however, adding a bus-mastering scsi card
 is what brings these problems to the surface and makes them visible.
 
      scsi holds a lot of promise, but you can run into a lot of pc
 compatibility problems.  if you're planning on using only msdos/windows
 3.1, stick with ide.  if you want to use windows nt or a pc unix, you'll
 have to make some hard decisions: a good scsi controller and more than
 one scsi hard disk will probably give you excellent performance, at the
 possible cost of msdos compatibility.  [ i say, "probably", because,
 while i know this to be true with a pc unix, i don't know if this really
 will be true of windows nt.  i suspect that it will, but i don't know
 for sure.  ]
