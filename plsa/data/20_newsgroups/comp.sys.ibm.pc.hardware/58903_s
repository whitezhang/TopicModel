 as someone else already mentioned, don't "carry thru" the other 23 pins.
 
 plan a, minimal null modem:
 	sg(7)   -  sg(7)
 	td(2)   -  rd(3)
 	rd(3)   -  td(2)
 if you're transfering files betwen 2 pcs, this ought to work (unless
 you have a persnickity comm program).
 
 plan b, null modem with modem control:
 	sg(7)   -  sg(7)
 	td(2)   -  rd(3)
 	rd(3)   -  td(2)
 	dcd(8)  -  dtr(20)
 	dtr(20) -  dcd(8)
 some comm software will wait for dcd before transferring anything.
 such software will raise dtr to enable the modem to accept a call.
 with this cable, each side's dtr will drive the other's dcd.
 
 plan c, null modem with hardware flow control:
 	sg(7)   -  sg(7)
 	td(2)   -  rd(3)
 	rd(3)   -  td(2)
 	rts(4)  -  cts(5)
 	cts(5)  -  rts(4)
 for high-speed transfers, you want the flow control.
 
 plan d, deluxe null modem (combine b and c):
 	sg(7)   -  sg(7)
 	td(2)   -  rd(3)
 	rd(3)   -  td(2)
 	rts(4)  -  cts(5)
 	cts(5)  -  rts(4)
 	dcd(8)  -  dtr(20)
 	dtr(20) -  dcd(8)
 this one is ideal.  it leaves out dsr and ri (rarely used anymore).
 if you're really paranoid, or you just have an 8th wire to spend,
 you might add:
 	fg(1)   -  fg(1)
 
 the pin numbers above are (obviously) for 25-pin connectors.
 i don't have a 9-pin pinout handy.
