 i hope that there's somebody out there that can help us.
 
 some of our students change the ami bios passwords on a few of our computers 
 and set it for always. what we'd like to know is if there is a way to bypass 
 or remove the password. we have tried switching bios, but to no avail. the 
 battery is soldered to the bord, an all three machines is still under 
 guarentee so if that would have help we can't remove the batteries.
 
 thanks isak
