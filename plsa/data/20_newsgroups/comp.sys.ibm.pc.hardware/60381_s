 since the mac uses only scsi-1 for hard drives yes the "figure includes a
 hundred $$$ for scsi drivers"  this is sloppy people and dumb.

 ok once again with the scsi spec list:
 scsi-1 {with a scsi-1 controler chip} synchronous range is indeed 0-5mb/s
  asynchronous range is slower at 0-3mb/s.
 scsi-1 {with a scsi-2 controller chip}: 4-6mb/s with 10mb/s burst {8-bit}
  note the increase in speed, the mac quadra uses this version of scsi-1
  so it does exist. some pcs use this set up too.
 
 scsi-2 {8-bit/scsi-1 mode}:          4-6mb/s with 10mb/s burst
 {for those who want scsi-2 but don't want to pay for the 16-bit or 32-bit
  hardware or mess with the scsi-2 software controllers.  usable by scsi-1
  devices with close to 8-bit scsi-2 speeds}
 scsi-2 {16-bit/wide or fast mode}:  8-12mb/s with 20mb/s burst
 scsi-2 {32-bit/wide and fast}:     15-20mb/s with 40mb/s burst
 
 on the other interfaces let dxb132@psuvm.psu.edu speak:
 >ide ranges from 0-8.3mb/s.                          
 again synchronous and asynchronous modes with asynchronous much slower
  {range 0-5mb/s}
 >esdi is always 1.25mb/s (although there are some non-standard versions)
 
 one problem is the inconsitant use of the term 'scsi' in articles and by
 people.  its proper meaning is "the set of scsi interfaces composed of
 scsi-1 and scsi-2"
 look at the inconsitant use of scsi in the below quote:
 (my comments in {})
 
 pc magazine april 27, 1993:29 "although scsi is twice as fast as esdi,
 {this is asynchronous scsi-1 with a scsi-1 chip} 20% faster than ide..."
 {this is both asynchronous scsi-1 with a scsi-2 chip and 8-bit scsi-2}
 to read consitantly the quote should read:
 {asynchronous scsi-1 with a scsi-1 chip}
 "although asynchronous scsi-1 is twice as fast as esdi, one third the 
 speed of ide..."
 or {asynchronous scsi-1 with a scsi-2 chip or 8-bit scsi-2}
 "although scsi-1 with a scsi-2 chip and 8-bit scsi-2 are eight times as fast as
 esdi, 20% faster than ide..."
 
 note the nonuse of 'scsi' by itself.  this eliminates ambaguity.
 
 scsi-1 drivers are somewhat reasonable while 16-bit and 32-bit scsi-2 drivers 
 are very expansive {8-bit scsi-2 can use scsi-1 drivers with little speed
 degridation(the mac quadra does exactly this.)}
 
 if we are to continue this thread state clearly which scsi you are talking 
 about scsi-1 or scsi-2 or scsi over all {scsi-1 and scsi-2}
 it does make a difference.
