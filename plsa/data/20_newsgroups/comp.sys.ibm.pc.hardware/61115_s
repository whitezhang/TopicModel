 	build 59 still has a number of problems--sheared fonts, for 
 	instance, if you have crystal fonts enabled.  some other problems--	
 	"color darkening" and some others.  i don't use the drivers in 
 	any mode other than 1024x768x256, so if there are bugs in the
 	other modes i can't say.

 	to be honest, up until now, i have only found one bug in the 
 	diamond viper drivers, and it seems innocuous.
 
 	that is, under microsoft word, select format border, click
 	shading and take a look at the patterns.  the 5% pattern
 	has been swapped with the 90%, and so on.  the whole list
 	is _completely_ reversed--looks right onscreen, but take
 	it to another machine (i.e., a gup or ss24x machine) or
 	print it and iy shows--badly!  
 
 	keep in mind that i use mainly 1024x768x65k mode, so i can't
 	speak for the others, but otherwise these drivers seem pretty 
 	solid.
