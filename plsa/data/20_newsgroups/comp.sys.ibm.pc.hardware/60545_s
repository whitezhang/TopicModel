 i read an article about the benefits of a vlb motherboard. it said that a 
 true vlb board supports bus mastering, otherwise it is just as good as an isa
 motherboard.
 
 doesn't all vlb motherboard support bus mastering? i just bought a 486-33 vlb
 and the tech manual does not explicitly state the words "local bus mastering"
 but it said it "supports bus master and slave modes". are these terms
 synonymous?
 
 thanks.
 
 ps. - please reply by e-mail as i don't read this newgroup often.
