 i posted almost the same bad experience with  midwest micro but our
 %^*^&*^&* news program only sent one paragraph out of the middle. in
 addition to the facts that:
 (a) the modems (i had ordered two) wouldn't work as documented
 and
 (b) the tech person had no clue as to how it should work,
 it also turned out that:
 (c) one of the two modems they sent was clearly used but the techs
 thought that was standard practice and
 (d) the modems made all three of my floppy drives quit working and
 my cms250 tape drive start running away.
 
 that they are incompetent is one thing, but that they sell used stuff
 as new and won't even apologize for it is another. stay away from
 these crooks!

 bob,
 i have walked into micro center here in the cleveland area and bought
 a new track ball and picked the only one that was sealed in plastic
 rap. only to get it home and oped it up to find a good year old used
 dirty old track ball with a warranty card for some software package.
 
 i would never even think of installing anything that looked like
 it was used at all. you should of called medwest micro
 and made them do a pus pull tag on it. they would of picked it up
 and sent you out a ner one the same day. 
 things get better in knowing how to but equipment after the first try!
