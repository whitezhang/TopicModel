 most of these are single-scan monitors, which are useless for most
 pc users.  i posted requests for information in other newsgroups which
 were mostly fruitless, but i have managed to track down two multisync
 grayscal monitors in the 17-21" range, one 20" and one 21".  i am still
 looking into it, and i will post the results when i get more info.
 i am looking into a group purchase as well.
