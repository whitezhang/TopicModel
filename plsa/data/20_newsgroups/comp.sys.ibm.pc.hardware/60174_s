 i recently bought a monichrome vga monitor for $99 that will do
 1024x768 non-interlaced, which seems like a good deal. however, it is
 a fixed-scan rate monitor, and only handles 52 khz horizontal, i
 think. with my trident card it works only in graphics modes 5e and 62
 - not much use, since just about any application will set the mode to
 something else, especially if it wants to do text, i suppose. anyway:
 
  - is there any way that i can use this as a general-purpose vga
    display with a 1-meg trident 8900c card?
 
  - if not, can i do so with some sort of different vga card?
