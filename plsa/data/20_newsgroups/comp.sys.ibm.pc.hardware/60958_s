 hi,
     can somebody tell me step by step how to add a 40mb ide kalok?
 hd to an existing 120mb ide maxtor hd with stacker 3.0 and dos 5?
 i know how to set the jumpers on the 40m to be slave and the settings
 for heads, wpcom, sectors, etc. i also know that i have to do some
 cmos settings and fdisk. the problem is: what letter will the cmos
 give the new drive? if it's d:, what will happen when stacker creates
 d: and swap? can i tell cmos to make it e:? so that if i stack it, i
 will have c, d, e and f?
     i know this could be an faq or in a readme somewhere, but i want
 to hear from somebody who've actually done it. thanks!
