 from a recent byte magazine i got the following:

   if you are handy with a soldering iron, the loopback plugs are easy to
 make.  on a serial rs-232 nine-pin port, use a female db-9 connector and
 connect pins 1 to 7 to 8; 2 to 3; and 4 to 6 to 9.  for serial rs-232 
 25-pin ports, you'll need a female db-25 connector with pins 1 to 7;
 2 to 3; 4 to 5 to 8; 6 to 11 to 20 to 22; 15 to 17 to 23; and 18 to 25
 connected.  to test a centronics 25-pin parallel port, you'll need to
 connect pins 1 to 13; 2 to 15; 10 to 16; 11 to 17; and 12 to 14 in a male
 db-25 connector.
