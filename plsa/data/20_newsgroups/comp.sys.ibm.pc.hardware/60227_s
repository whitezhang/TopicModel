 i'd appreciate any advice about a video card for my system:
 
 486-33 dx, 16 mb of ram
 on a novell 3.11 network
 monitor:  nec 4fge, capable of 76 hz vertical refresh rate
 
 major considerations:
 
 i expect i will work mostly in windows, but with some dos
 applications and i would want decent speed in dos.  i do mostly word
 processing, database and communications--not much intensive graphics.
 
 with a 15" monitor, i expect i will work mostly in 800x600 and 256
 colors seems plenty, but i'd like like the image to be sharp, fast,
 and rock solid.
 
 other considerations:
 
 i sometimes run a unix clone (coherent) and i understand that some
 companies (e.g. diamond?) don't encourage the third-party
 development of drivers.
 
 i might move to os/2 if i decide i need better speed and reliability
 than i get with windows for my database work and multitasking.
 
 i don't have a local bus motherboard--i'm not sure how much to invest
 in an isa video board (versus getting something less expensive now and
 upgrading to local bus later).
 
 i like buying things from companies that treat their customers well.
 
 if you have any advice for me, i'd love to hear it via email or post.
 
 thanks.
