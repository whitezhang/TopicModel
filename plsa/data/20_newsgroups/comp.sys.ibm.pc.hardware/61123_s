 
 my disk that had my joystick code that some of you were kind enough to mail
 me puked....specifically, i am looking for c code to read the position
 of joystick without using int15h, i.e. accessing port 0x200/0x201 directly.
 
 i need it in c becaues of memory model considerations.
 
 i only need to be able to read the x and y position also.
