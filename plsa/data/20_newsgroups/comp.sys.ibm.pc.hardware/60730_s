 i have been able to successfully use both 16 and 24 bit color modes on my
 gateway system, although my setup is less complicated than yours.  it sounds as
 if you may have a hardware conflict or problem.  is your memory aperture above
 16m?  i have heard rumors of incompatibilities with that scsi card with a
 variety of systems.  call up gateway and give them hell until they help you
 fix it.
