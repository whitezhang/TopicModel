 i would like to know as well, since i just bought a 200mb seagate ide
 drive and want to add it to my computer (a four-year-old gateway
 386/20), which currently has an 80mb seagate scsi drive.  the scsi
 controller is such that the docs told me not to specify it in the cmos
 setup, i.e. both hard drive settings are listed as "not installed,"
 and apparently the scsi controller works its wonders.  i wondering if
 this is a problem.  also, i remember how, when i helped my cousin
 install his second ide drive, we had to define a master/slave
 relationship for them; do i need to do something similar here?
 
 >i am particularly interested in having the scsi as the _boot_ drive.
 
 same here.
 
 any help would be appreciated, since i intend to install this drive
 asap; i'd like to know what to do (and what not to do) before i start.
 thanks!
