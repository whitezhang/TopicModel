 i have a 486/50mhz isa board with 256kbyte cache and 16 megs
 ram. i just bought the new soundblaster 16 and tried to 
 install the card. the sb16 uses 16bit dma channel.i could
 select between channel 5 to 7. it is the first card i ever
 installed that uses 16bit dma transfer. after i tested
 the card the first time, the computer crashed and i got a
 parity error-system halted. this happens either from dos as
 also from windows. so it seems that my 16 bit dma channels
 are not working properly (they are there because testsb16.exe
 recocnize them and tests them ok until first access). 
 
 well, does anybody know a solution for this problem or a
 special test program for dma problems? i eliminated the 
 problem temporaly by using only 8 bit dma channel but it
 makes the system slow!
 
 thanks for your help.
 yours markus
