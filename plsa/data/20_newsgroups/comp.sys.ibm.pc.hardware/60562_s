 
 okay, i'm trying to install ncsa telnet on a couple (okay, a whole bunch)
 of machines.  they're all true blue ibms with either fallon phonenet cards
 or dastar cards.  (i belive those names are correct.)  well, the docs for
 telnet say that it'll run over an appletalk driver, but i've had little
 success.
 
 if anyone has succesfully installed telnet w/ appletalk, i'd like some
 help with the config file for telnet...
 
 btw, please reply via e-mail if possible...
 
 thanks,
 
 jeremy
