 i am very serious about the purchase of a 486dx-33 that uses the orchid vlb 
 mother board, the system also has the vlb ide and fahrenheit video board in 
 it. i haven't seen or heard any bad comments about this board! does anyone 
 out there have any comments good or bad about this board? i am considering 
 this board primarily because of orchid's reputation and long standing in 
 the field. thanks for any and all comments.
