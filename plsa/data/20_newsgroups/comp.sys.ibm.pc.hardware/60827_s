 stupid question from a new ibm pc user:
 
 i'm going to be selling my mac and getting a gateway 2000.
 
 what is the difference between ide hd and scsi hd?
 
 the gw 486dx-33v comes with a 250mb western digital ide drive.
 i asked how much more for the seagate 500mb scsi drive.
 
 the guy asked me "why are you going with scsi?".  i was lost for an answer.
 i just said "i know seagate better as a company, from a satisfaction point
 of view".
 
 are scsi drives faster than ide?  i'm not buying my gw for another 4 months
 or so, but this is a question that has bugged me for a while.
