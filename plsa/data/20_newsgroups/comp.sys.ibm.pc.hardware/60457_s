 would someone please email me the pinout for a ps/2 6-pin mini din mouse
 port?  i'm trying to make an adapter for a serial mouse, and the dealer who
 knows what adapter works with the mouse i bought doesn't have it in stock.
 i have several different adapters, but none of them make sense based on
 what sketchy information i have about the port (they have connections to
 "reserved" pins).
