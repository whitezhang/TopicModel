 hi there.  we just bought a 486 dx2/66 gateway system with a 2 meg ati
 ultra pro video card.  everything seems to work fine except for the
 windows drivers for 800x600 24 bit, and 800x600 and 1024x768 16 bit
 modes.  the fonts and icons start deteriorating after windows startup,
 and within minutes of use, everything on the screen is totally
 unintelligible.  naturally, i called gateway tech support to inquire
 about this.  the technician asked me about the drivers, and i told him it
 was version 1.5, build 59.  he told me that the 16 and 24 bit drivers for
 the ati ultra pro simply do not work!!!  is this true?  if so, i'm simply
 amazed.  how could this be?  the strange thing is i would have expected
 to see some discussion on here (unless the subject has made the faq!!!).
 
 one very suspicious point that came up later was that he stated that none
 of the windows accelerator boards have working 16 and/or 24 bit drivers
 for windows 3.1.  i easily challenged him on that because i've been
 running a diamond 24x in 15 bit mode at home for 4 months now, and i have
 tested and used the 24 bit mode as well.  he then backed off and said:
 "well, diamond has been working on those drivers much longer."  anyway, i
 just wanted to see if anyone else had any trouble and what they did about
 it.  any feedback will be appreciated.
 
 the system configuration is:
 
 gateway 486 dx2/66 local bus
 16 megs ram
 scsi hd & cd-rom
 ultrastor 34f local bus scsi controller
 ati ultra pro local bus with 2mb vram
 dos 6.0
 windows 3.1
 mach 32 drivers version 1.5 (build 59)
 
 thanks in advance.
