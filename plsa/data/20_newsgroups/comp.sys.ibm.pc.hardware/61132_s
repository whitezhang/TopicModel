 a friend of mine needs spec for a used hard drive he just got:
 it is a western digital, ide, 340 meg
 with 1010 cylinders and 12 heads.  we believe the model number is
 wd2340a, but we can't be sure.  it is a 12 ms, 3.5" model.
 
 any info would be appreciated, either from somone who knows, or maybe
 western digitals phone number
 
 thanks
