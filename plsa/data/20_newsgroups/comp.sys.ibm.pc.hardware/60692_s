 
 for those of you who might be familiar with insight distribution
      network, inc. and their multimedia kits:
 
 i'm seriously considering buying the insight talon ta-2000 mm kit, which
 is bundled with the cd-rom drive with 265-280ms access time, 300kb dtr,
 multispin, multi-session photo cd capability, etc., and with the pas-16
 sound card, etc.... (if you are familiar with insight, you know the kit
 i mean).  i believe the drive is either a texel (265ms) or an nec
 (280ms), but it is not clear to me which one is actually a part of the
 bundle (at least two of their sales people couldn't give me a straight
 answer as to which one; ah, yes, one of the drawbacks of oem!).
 
 other questions:
 
 - excuse my ignorance, but is "texel" a reputable maker in the cd-rom
   market?  or do you think nec is the better drive?
 
 - bottom line:  is this kit worth the money?  (currently, $449 for the
   ta-1000, and $699 for the ta-2000)
 
 alternatively, i was thinking that the ta-2000 might be overkill for my
 uses (however, i *do* want full multimedia capabilities, photo cd stuff,
 educational programs for my kids, etc.), and considered the lower-end
 ta-1000 kit and using the difference (around $250.00) to get something
 else useful, like a tape back-up drive unit.
 
 basically, i would just like to hear from those who have actually used
 these kits, and whatever pros/cons you might advise, preferably
 directly to the email address below.
 
 thanks,
