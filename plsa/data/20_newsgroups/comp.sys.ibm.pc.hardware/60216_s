 i have a 5 1/4" drive as drive a.  how can i make the system boot from
 my 3 1/2" b drive?  (optimally, the computer would be able to boot
 from either a or b, checking them in order for a bootable disk.  but
 if i have to switch cables around and simply switch the drives so that
 it can't boot 5 1/4" disks, that's ok.  also, boot_b won't do the trick
 for me.)
 
 thanks,
   davebo
