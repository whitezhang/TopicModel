 i got two very similar sounding boards for dirt cheap, too. their assy
 numbers were not 4000-series, but your description fits otherwise. they
 are 3com 3c505's aka etherlink plus cards. check out ftp.3com.com, there
 are drivers and diagnostic programs for just about any and all 3com
 cards. i concluded that my card was the 505 after i ran their diagnostic
 program for 3c505 succesfully ("..passes with flying colours") :)
 
 anybody know of packet drivers for these cards under os/2..?
