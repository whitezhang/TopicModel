 i just bought a new ide hard drive for my system to go with the one
 i already had.  my problem is this.  my system only had a ide cable
 for one drive, so i had to buy cable with two drive connectors
 on it, and consequently have to switch cables.  the problem is, 
 the new hard drive's manual refers to matching pin 1 on the cable
 with both pin 1 on the drive itself and pin 1 on the ide card.  but
 for the life of me i cannot figure out how to tell which way to plug
 in the cable to align these.  
 secondly, the cable has like a connector at two ends and one between them.
 i figure one end goes in the controler and then the other two go into
 the drives.  does it matter which i plug into the "master" drive
 and which into the "slave"?  any help appreciated.  thanks...
