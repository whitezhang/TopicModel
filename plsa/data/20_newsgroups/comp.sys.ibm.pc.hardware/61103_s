 if you bought your ide drive from a dealer, you shouldn 't have to 
 perform a low level format. even if the 1st hd is already partitioned
 into c and d, fdisk will automatically assign the 2 nd hd to d and 
 change the 2nd partition of 1st drive to e.
 
 check the jumper settings and cmos setup, in particular the correct
 number of cylinders and tracks
