 i need to duplicate a bunch of floppy disks (3.5") and ideally would like to
 be able to keep 2 to 4 floppies busy simultaneously on a single pc.
 [yes, i know that services to do this exist.] 
 
 i know that standard isa bus floppy controllers can only have one drive active
 at a time. i know that some controllers are available that can handle 4 
 floppies with serialized access. i know that microchannel machines can keep 
 more than one floppy active simultaneously. but does anyone have a controller 
 for an isa bus pc that can simultaneously keep 2 to 4 floppies going?
 how about for an eisa machine?
 
 if the limitation is a software limitation, i can work around that by using
 os/2 1.3 on my pc-286.
 
 new or used, i'm interested.
