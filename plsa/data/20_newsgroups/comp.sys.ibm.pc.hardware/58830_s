 well, my 14inch vga 1024x758-interlacing 2.5 year old no brand monitor just
 bit the bullet. i pressed the power switch and a few seconds later, the power
 light went out with a pop. gawd, it's only been two and half years.
 
 how long would normal monitors last? i think the problem with my monitor is
 the power switch... but the image was getting pretty dim anyway (i needed to
 have my contrast all the way to the max...). and the screen did flicker from
 time to time. is this normal (hehehe) or do i just have the worst of luck???
 
 question: what do i do now???? buy a new one? get it fixed? save up for a
 *really* good one and get by with a cheap ega monitor for now? i rather save
 my money to upgrade my 386sx to 486-66 though...
 
 thanks!

 what engineers say:
     extensive effort is being applied on a fresh approach to the problem.
 what they *really* mean:
     we just hired three new guys; we'll let them kick it around for a while.
