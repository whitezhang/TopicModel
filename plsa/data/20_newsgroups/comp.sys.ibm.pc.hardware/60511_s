 i recently bought a micron 486dx/33 vlb computer and the the local bus
 ide card was getting around 1k/s transfer rates (says norton).  i caled
 micron because this seemed pathetically slow and they said that norton
 6.xx doesn't recognize local bus and won't give accurate results.  i was
 told i would need norton 7.0 in order to get a true account of my ide
 transfer speed.
 
 i didn't really like this answer in part because the drive doesn't seem
 as though it's cranking along at much more than that, but i also don't
 know if i could tell the difference.
 
 i tried playing around with settings in the cmos (bus speed at the like)
 and noticed no significant change in performance.
