 these questions can be answered by any dealer of ibm value points, but, i will
 provide some unsolicited advice -- the most amusing kind of advice.
 
 today (tueday 4-6-93) ibm is supposed to officially announce the introduction
 of the vesa local bus value point systems.  these systems still have on-board
 video and disk which are far better than the prior value point systems, and
 you get vesa local bus for (future?) upgrades.  we are going to buy three of
 them with 17" monitors (also a newly available), and one of the three will
 immediately be upgraded to ultrastor 34f caching scsi disk controller and
 either the ati gup or the viper graphics board.
 
 do not buy a 486sx sytem.
 
 my personal philosophy on upgrade policy is that it is not loss-free.  when
 you earn money you pay taxes, when you spend money you pay taxes.  (i.e. they
 get you coming and going).  translated this means take infrequent but large
 steps.  you are far better off short term and long term if you avoid the sx
 models and go straight to the dx or dx-2 models.
