 recently, i have been getting a cmos checksum error when i first turn on my
 computer.  it doesn't happen everytime i turn it on, nor can i predict when it
 is going to happen.  i have an ami bios and all of the setting are lost, for
 example the drive types and the password options.  however, the date and time
 remain correct.  if anyone knows what can be causing this, please let me know.
 
 thank you,
 mike
