 i posted almost the same bad experience with  midwest micro but our
 %^*^&*^&* news program only sent one paragraph out of the middle. in
 addition to the facts that:
 (a) the modems (i had ordered two) wouldn't work as documented
 and
 (b) the tech person had no clue as to how it should work,
 it also turned out that:
 (c) one of the two modems they sent was clearly used but the techs
 thought that was standard practice and
 (d) the modems made all three of my floppy drives quit working and
 my cms250 tape drive start running away.
 
 that they are incompetent is one thing, but that they sell used stuff
 as new and won't even apologize for it is another. stay away from
 these crooks!
