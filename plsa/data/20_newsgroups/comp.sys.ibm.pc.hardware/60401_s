 
   i saw the following computer in a store and wanted to know if this is a good
 computer or does someone see something wrong with it.  i also would like to
 switch the motherboard later when this computer becomes too slow.  does anyone
 know if this is possible with a leading edge computer, or will it be difficult
 to find a motherboard that will fit in this computer.  any help will be
 greatly appreciated.
