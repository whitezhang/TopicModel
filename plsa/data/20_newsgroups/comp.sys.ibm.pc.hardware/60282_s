     the joystick reads in anolog values through a digital port. how?
     you send a command to the port to read it, then you time how long
     it takes for the joystick port to set a certain bit.  this time
     is proportional to the joystick position.  obviously, since time
     is used as a position, you cannot get rid of this ridiculus waste 
     of time.  if you wrote your own routine instead of the bios, it
     would speed it up some, but the time would still be there.
