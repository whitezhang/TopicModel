 you can configure devices for the same irq as long as you don't use them
 *simultaneously*, under dos at least. both lpt1: and sb just sit there until
 you tell them to do something. you can't configure a soundblaster for irq7
 if you got an ethernet card which hits that irq a thousand times or so per 
 second.
