 i have a 386 clone, and an internal modem set to com4.
 it worked fine until i upgraded to dos 6.0 and at the
 same time reloaded windows 3.1  now the system can't
 find com4; msd says com4 is "n/a", and three of my
 four comm programs say "hardware not present" or some
 similar error message.  procomm, however, finds the modem
 no problem and works fine!  curiouser and curiouser.  any
 hints/help?  thanks.
