 i upgraded my old 386 with 486dx-50 local bus motherboard two month ago 
 and with it i bought a controller card local bus and a grafic card 
 diamond stealth vlb.
 but when i try to put my new grafic card and my new controller together
 my system don't want to boot up; it stop after controller card checking. 
 i have try to change my ami-bios setup but nothing works. 
 just one thing when i disable my rom-bios adress on my controller card
 my system do one more step: checking all system and cache memory but nothing
 more.
 thanks for answer.
