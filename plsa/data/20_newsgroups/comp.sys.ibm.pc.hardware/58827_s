 you realize, of course, that inevitably some anal retentive moron is
 going to come along and wag his fingers and his jowls in outrage that
 personal politics are more important than [smcap][bold][font:god
 999pt.]the law[smcap][bold][font].
 
 but that's irrelevant to the problem here.  windows came with my
 system, but on 5.25" disks.  i hate using 5.25" disks, so i copied
 them over to high density 3.5"'s using xcopy.  it worked fine.  in
 fact, for a while i was changing configurations and whatnot so much
 that i decided to try putting them on the hard disk.  not only can you
 copy them over with one disk per directory, but if you want to, you
 can simply copy them all into one directory.  makes it a lot nicer
 when you're switching printer emulations around.
 
 norton 6.0 i don't have much experience with, but when a friend's
 system crashed, we restored from a backup rather than from the
 originals, and it worked fine.  this would imply that arj a -r norton
 c:\nu would create a workable backup, and if you did a full install
 the first time, you've got the whole thing.
 
 never played with wp for windows; i'm not too big of a fan of anything
 from utah.
 
 good luck....
