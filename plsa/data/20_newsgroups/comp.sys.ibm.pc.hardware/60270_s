 i don't know if this is an obvious question, but can any of the current 
 batch of windows accelerator cards (diamond etc) be used to drive a monitor 
 which has rgb and horizontal and vertical sync ( 5 bnc jacks altogether) 
 connectors out the back??  i might be able to get ahold of a raster 
 technologies 17" monitor (1510 ??)cheap and i was wondering if it was 
 possible to connect it via an adapter (rgb to vga ??) to my gateway, would 
 i need different drivers etc.  
 
 
 thanks
