    i have a 386dx clone, with a dtc esdi controller and toshiba 660
 mbyte
 drive. since installing dos 6.0, when i tried to re-install software
 from
 5 1/4 or 3 1/2 disks, when i mount the second..third..fourth disks, dos
 6
 doesn't recognize that i have changed floppies. if i do a "dir", i see
 the
 contents of the previous diskette. the only way to get dos to recognize
 that
 diskettes have changed, is to do a "label", and then to not label them.
 
    buying dos 6.0 has been a colossal mistake. dos 5.0 was stable, and
 worked
 well with my equipment. i have superstor pro, and desqview/x ( with
 qemm, 
 manifest, etc), so there aren't any features of dos 6 that i am using. i
 guess
 i should roll back to dos 5.0 but i am wary of what will happen when i
 do it.
 
    besides, like a fool, i don't have a dos 5. bootable disk anymore.
 i've
 made the same mistakes i caution my users not to make. like sheep, i
 joined 
 the crowd flocking to dos 6. baaa baaad system administrator.
