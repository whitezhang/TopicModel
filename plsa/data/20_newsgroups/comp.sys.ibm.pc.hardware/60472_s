 i bet it suddenly started sticking when you  started leaving the pc running the
 menu all night.  there is a limitation/bug in the date roll-over software in
 pc's that means you have to be doing something like waiting for keyboard input
 via a dos call rather than a bios call (as menus often use) otherwise the code
 to update the date after midnight never gets called. 
 
 somebody might be able to correct the details in case i've mis-rememberred
 them, but i think you have to change the menu program (if you have the sources)
 or add a tsr or system patch or something.  as far as i know the cmos clock
 keeps the right time (in fact about 7 seconds/day better than dos's clock).
