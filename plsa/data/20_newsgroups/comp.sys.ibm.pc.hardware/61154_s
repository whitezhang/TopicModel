 a couple other problems with the 486dx/50:
 
 1.)  system manufacturers had major problems solving the electromagnetic 
 interference problems with 486dx/50 systems.  getting an fcc-b (home use) 
 certification required additional shielding in the system.
 
 2.)  heat...a lot of people seem to be installing heat sinks and/or cooling 
 fans on their 486dx2/66 chips.  i would guess that the 486dx/50 ran 
 temperatures inside the case even hotter.  and heat is the enemy of system 
 reliability.
