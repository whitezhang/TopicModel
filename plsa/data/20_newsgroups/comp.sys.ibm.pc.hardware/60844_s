 call phoenix.  they can put you on line with replacement bios chips.  i had
 to do this when i upgraded a emerson 386/20 to an ide drive.
 
 also, if you are installing an ide drive, and there is a bios setting that
 has a total volume the same as the ide drive's volume, try using it.  the
 ide drive can usually respond to a variety of different geometries, as long
 as the setting that you use is equal to or smaller than the drive's actual
 size.  the controller will do the necessary translation automatically, in
 most cases.
 
 warning!!!  do not use a bios setting that is even one byte larger than the
 actual size of the drive!  a smaller setting will not harm the drive, but
 you will be sorry if you go even one byte over.  drive damage will not
 result, but headaches will!
