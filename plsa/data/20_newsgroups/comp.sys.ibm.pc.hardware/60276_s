 hi,
 
 i've got a victor pc/xt with a 20 mb harddisk in it. the controller is
 a toshiba mfm controller, with an additional 9 pins connector.
 
 there are 2 busses from my harddisk to this controller. one with 9 wires
 and another with 34 wires.
 
 the controller has two connectors for a 9 wire-bus and one for a 34 wire
 bus.
 
 now i got a 20 mb harddisk from a friend of mine, and i wondered whether
 i can connect this second harddisk to the same controller (there is room
 for a 9 wire-bus, but not for the 34 wire bus)
 
 how can i solve my problem, any suggestions?
 
 if you need more info, mail me, please (luttik@fwi.uva.nl).
 
 --bas.
