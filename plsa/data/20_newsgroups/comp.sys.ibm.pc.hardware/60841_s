 lpt ports don't recognize baud, parity, etc. settings.  you might be tring
 to connect a serial printer to a parallel port.  try this: attach the serial
 port of the printer to a serial port on the pc.  use the mode command to set
 the com port settings.  try
 
 c>mode com1,9600,n,8,1
 
 to set the port parameters.  then use the mode command to redirect the
 printer port lpt1 like this:
 
 c>mode lpt1=com1
 
 this should work.  good luck!
