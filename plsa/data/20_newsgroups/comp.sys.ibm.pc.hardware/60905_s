 oak.oakland.edu is the primary mirror site for wsmr-simtel20.army.mil.
 all other mirrors (except wuarchive) and all listserv and trickle
 servers get their simtel20 files from oak instead of simtel20 because
 it is much faster and allows more simultaneous ftp connections.  oak is
 always "in sync" with simtel20 because i maintain it, in addition to my
 duties at simtel20.  i run oak's mirror program whenever new files are
 added at simtel20.
