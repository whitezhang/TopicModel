 
 i'm afriad that's not true.  the monitor problem seems to occur whenever
 the 15" mag monitor is put into 1024x768 mode.  i'm running os/2 at 1024 and
 the same symptoms appear.
 
 it does not seem like a video card problem as the cirrus logic 5426 chip and
 the ati gup seem to cause these problems... two very  different cards.
