 he's right ya know.  i've helped to install dos 6 on about 4 computers now,
 mine included.  on one, he bought the stacker to doublespace converter,
 and it worked fine (rather, he sent in the coupon for the converter).
 
 in other cases, i've run the doublespace installation without a problem
 when compressing a new drive, compressing free space, or whatever else.
 seems to work for me.

 well, i ran the normal setup thing and it worked fine for whatever that's
 worth.

 couldn't agree more.  on my 486-50 i don't miss the speed.  it's still
 faster than a normal disk read would be.  as for the less compression,
 i've sacrificed that in favor of the convenience of having the dblspace.bin
 load before anything else.  with stacker, any changes to your config.sys
 or autoexec.bat meant rebooting twice so it could update those.
 
 personally, i'm waiting for stacker 4.0 to come out and implement those
 hooks and stuff.  plus, the defrag that comes with dos is okay, but i
 much prefer compress from pc-tools for sheer bells and whistles.  plus,
 defrag is sooooo sloooow on a dblspace drive.

 ditto.
