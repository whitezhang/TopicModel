 
  i have recently plunged into pc world. i have been using amigas before.
  trying to establish a network (lan) here that could use 2 different printers.
  panasonic kxp2124 for printing receipts and okidata ol400 for letters etc.
  is it at all possible in this world ? i know when using unix etc i can specify
  which printer to print from. but i am not sure how pcs would handle that. if
  they can't then i guess i'll leave peeeceees for good and move on to unix.
