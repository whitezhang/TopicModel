 it's not true.  ide bus uses signals which has similar name and same
 meaning to the counterpart of isa bus but its (ide bus) signal timing
 doesn't have to be same to isa signal timing.  my vl-ide bus card has
 a set of jumpers to set its transfer rate from 3.3mb/sec up to 8.3mb/
 sec (the manufacturer might have to correct these numbers as 3.3
 *milion* byte/sec and 8.3 *milion* byte/sec respectively).   you
 cannot transfer data at a rate of 8.3mb/sec on the isa bus.
