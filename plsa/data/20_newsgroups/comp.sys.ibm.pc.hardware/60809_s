 i ran into the same problem when i upgraded from a 2400 modem to a 14400
 modem. any time i give the modem a reset command [atz] while, in windows.
 the computer locks up. if i give the atz command in dos, it will work. my solution 
 was to not give the modem the [atz] command thru windows. in the procomm +
 install process i told the program i have a hayes compatible 2400 modem. atz
 was not included in the initialization string & it works fine. i called ms
 about this, & they didn't have a clue as to what the memory/interupt conflict 
 could be. the lockup accures using any windows comm program that gives the atz
 command.
