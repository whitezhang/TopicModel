 hello,
 
 i already tried our national news group without success.
 
 i tried to replace a friend's original ibm floppy disk in his ps/1-pc
 with a normal teac drive.
 i already identified the power supply on pins 3 (5v) and 6 (12v), shorted
 pin 6 (5.25"/3.5" switch) and inserted pullup resistors (2k2) on pins
 8, 26, 28, 30, and 34.
 the computer doesn't complain about a missing fd, but the fd's light
 stays on all the time. the drive spins up o.k. when i insert a disk,
 but i can't access it.
 the teac works fine in a normal pc.
 
 are there any points i missed?
 
 thank you.
 	volkmar
