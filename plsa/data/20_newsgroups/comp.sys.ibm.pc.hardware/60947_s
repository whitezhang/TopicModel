 well, i have a different story to recount.  i attempted to low-level format a
 wd 43mb disk about a year ago.  when i understood my error, i contacted wd.
 they told me that i hadn't hurt the drive and that i should just run fdisk and
 format/s on it.  it was fine.  also, i understand that western digital's bbs
 may have some low-level formatting routines specifically available for ide
 drives.  you probably need to talk to them and get the straight scoop.
