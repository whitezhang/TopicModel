 subject: help: led connectors for motherboard
 date: thu apr 22 09:02:48 1993
 
 
 i bought a 386dx-40 motherboard for 50$... no documentation at all. everything
 appears to work, except i'm having trouble getting a few of the led connectors
 working. i've looked at the manuals for 4 other motherboards, but the pin
 configuration doesn't look anything like what is on this board. does this
 pin arrangement look familiar to anyone out there??? any hints on where i
 can find this information?
 
                  1                 10
       "speaker"  . . . . . . . . . .
       "keylock"  . . . . . . . . . .
                  11          ^     20

                              |the board came with a jumper vertically across
                               these two pins.
 
 i can get the power/keylock to work across pins 11-15, reset across pins 9 and
 shown 82%, press <space> for more, 'q' to quit, or 'h' for help
                                                                                 
 19, but would prefer not to blow something up by further experimentation.
 the date on the board itself is 6/92, opti chips.
 
 i would really appreciate any help, and thank you in advance.

 nicji,
 it would realy realy help if you said what chipset and if the board
 was an upgradable or not board and how old it and the bios is???
