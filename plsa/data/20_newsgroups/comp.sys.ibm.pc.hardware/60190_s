 
 i'm using int15h to read my joystick, and it is hideously slow.  something
 like 90% of my cpu time is being spent reading the joystick, and this
 is in a program that does nothing but printf() and joyread().
 
 the problem is that a lot of programs trap int15h ( like smartdrv ) and
 so it is a slow as hell interface.  can i read the joystick port in
 a reasonably safe fashion via polling?  and that isn't platform or
 clockspeed specific?
 
 thanks,
