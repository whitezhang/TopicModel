 who said isa was necessary?  eisa or vlb are the only interfaces worth

 you didn't read to carefully.  vlb-ide uses the same connection mechanism
 as standard ide.  if transfer rate is limited by ide, whether it's
 interfaced to isa, eisa or vlb matters not.

 on mine, for one thing.  scsi blows ide out of the water, hands down.  if
 ide has better throughput, why isn't it used on workstations and file
 servers?

 no, that's the nice thing -- on a multitasking os, scsi can use both drives
 at once.  i've got unix loaded on one of my pcs (along with windogs) and the os can only use one of the two ide drives at one time.  it's pretty ugly.
 
 i just bought at quantum 240 for my mac at home.  i paid $369 for it.  i
 haven't seen ide drives cheaper.

 no, actually, we're talking about scsi being expensive simply because
 nobody did a common interface for the pc.  if they had a common (read:
 easily implemented) method of adding scsi to a pc (like as in a sun or
 mac), then you'd find scsi the connection medium of choice.

 on a single drive, scsi is more expensive.  but, you bought your pc for
 expandibility, so, you'd want to add more drives or whatever.  the
 following are why i find scsi intrinsically better than ide:
 
 a (partial?) list:
 	1.  you can add many different types of devices and access them 
 	concurrently.
 	2.  a scsi device works on many different machines (i have a mac
 	and a pc at home and moving hard drives between them is very nice
 	with scsi -- hook them up and away they go)
 	3.  scsi devices work together better than ide devices.  for
 	instance, recently, i added an older connor 100 meg ide to a maxtor
 	212 meg ide.  the connor *must* be setup as the slave.  it will
 	work no other way.  on scsi, you set the address, check the
 	termination, plug it in, and away it goes.
 	4.  i have a problem with ide's mutual exclusion - i notice that
 	the time it takes to switch from accessing drive c: to drive d: is
 	quite long as compared to the time it takes to switch from drive c:
 	to d: on a scsi system.  under a multitasking os, this is very
 	noticable, as many things can be going on at once.
 
 one neat thing that i've noticed lately (a fringe benefit) has been the
 ability to add older (almost dead) drives as storage on a scsi system with
 little problem -- we've got a bunch of almost dead 20 meg drives that i've
 added to my pc.  i've now got the interface full, but, it does allow me to
 have 4 20 meg drives, 1 240 meg drive, 1 tape drive, and 1 105 meg drive
 all on the same card.  
 
 simply put, scsi is handier than ide.  no mysterious jumpers to figure out.
