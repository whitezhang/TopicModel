 
 hi all compaq owners
 
 a friend of mine has compaq (portable iii), and he has lost all the manuals and
 diskettes.
 
 please help him getting the machine's equipment definition (cmos) memory
 configuration right. the machine says that some bytes of it are still 
 incorrectly set up. it seems, that compaq has some bytes defined not like
 the 100% ibm compatible machines. if you have a compaq, it
 certainly has diagnostics diskette with it. and this is needed. i can't
 reach quickly any compaq dealers here.
 
 if it is possible please email documentation, or some of its configuration
 software.
