 i was just reading in pc magazine that the peripherals in a pc with an
 isa bus can only access 16mb of memory.  also, that some video cards on
 the isa bus look for a memory aperture to map their memory to.  so that
 if i wanted to put 16mb of memory on my pc, my video card wouldn't have
 anywhere to map it's memory to.
 
 can someone explain this in more detail.  is there a way around this
 limit.
 
 if you email me a response, i will summarize.
