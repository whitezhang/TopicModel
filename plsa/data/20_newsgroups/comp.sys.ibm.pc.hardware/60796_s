 hi,
 
 does anyone have a source for 386dx/25 motherboards?  i've
 been calling around the local stores and everyone appears
 to be only stocking the 386dx/33/40 or 386sx/25/33 motherboards.
 
 how difficult is it to modify a 386dx/40 motherboard to run at
 25 mhz?  is it as simple as replacing the system clock with a
 slower part?
 
 thanks!
