    as of today i will no longer be a contact for zeos international on the net.
 this responsibility has been taken over by another tech (davidm@zeos.com) and i
 am moving up and on (mo money, mo money :)).  i just wanted to thank all of the
 netters who have supported and encouraged the participation of zeos on the net.
 i personally feel it is important for companies such as zeos to provide their
 customers with as easy access as possible when they have questions/problems and
 being on the net is an big step in the right direction.  i hope that other
 companies will follow suit (as weitek and others have done). again, thanks.
