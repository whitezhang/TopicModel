 in addition to startup time, i leave things running because my pc doubles as 
 a fax machine. 
 
 however, this is off the original subject. i didn't get the replies on bios, 
 cmos, and dos clock/date logic. all i know is that i've been running this way 
 for many months and it is only recently, the last month, that i have noticed 
 the intermittent clock problem. as i stated, it is not always the date that 
 doesn't roll forward, sometimes i notice that the clock is several minutes 
 behind where it ought to be. 
 
 when unattended, the following are generally running minimized in win 3.1:
 
 clock, winfax pro 3.0, print manager, ms-word 1.1, file manager, program 
 manager
 
 a random screen saver is generally running too.
