 | scsi ii draft proposal, rev. 10h, section 4.2.1: single-ended 
 | cable, which is in the cable requirements section, has an 
 | implementor's note: " stub clustering should be avoided. stubs 
 | should be spaced at least 0.3 meters apart."
 | 
 | for the non-technical, stubs are scsi devices. :-)
 
 however, also be aware that implementor's notes are basicly
 recommendations, they are *not* part of the spec.  as others have
 noted, many vendors (including sgi) violate this.  indeed, the main
 point is to reduce impedance changes, and therefore reflections, and
 therefore 'noise' on the bus.
