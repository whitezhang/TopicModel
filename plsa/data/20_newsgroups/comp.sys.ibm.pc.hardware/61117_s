 i purchased one personal computer and three for business from them. no 
 problems. the only time i called tech support was for a minor question 
 about a video driver and i had no problem getting through.
 
 all four machines seem to be high quality and well made.  a 486dx50 eisa 
 machine has been our network file server running 24 hrs per day since last 
 summer with no problems.
 
 i hope this is helpful.
