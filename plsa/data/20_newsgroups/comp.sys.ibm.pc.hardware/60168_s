 i have a 286 with an m205 motherboard.  the last byte memory manager (which
 i downloaded for a trial) reports the chipset is an addtech pcchip1 chipset,
 and it is able to activate the ram behind segments a000-ffff, which can then be
 used for umbs (except for video/bios).  i would like to write my own driver to
 activate the memory.  does anyone know where i can get programming information
 on this chip?
