  a few weeks ago i saw an ad in the german magazine c't
 about a so-called videostreamer. this is an interface
 between a pc's parallel port and any video-recorder for
 backing up your data on a videotape. the company (datasave?)
 claims that it can store up to 7 gb on a 300 minutes tape.
                          ^^^^^^^^^^
 
 it costs dm 250.- (about usd 200, i think)
 
 my question is:
  does anybody use this product, if yes, how many bytes 
  really fit on a 300 minutes tape (7 gb sounds quite
  unbelievable to me). 
 
 however, any comments on the interface are appreciated.
 please mail your replies directly to me, i will sum up
 if neccesary. thanks in advance...
