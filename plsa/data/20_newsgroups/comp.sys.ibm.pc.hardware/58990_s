 i'm looking for a better method to back up files.  currently using a maynstream
 250q that uses dc 6250 tapes.  i will need to have a capacity of 600 mb to 1gb
 for future backups.  only dos files.
 
 i would be very appreciative of information about backup devices or
 manufacturers of these products.  flopticals, dat, tape, anything.  
 if possible, please include price, backup speed, manufacturer (phone #?), 
 and opinions about the quality/reliability.
 
 please e-mail, i'll send summaries to those interested.
 
 thanx in advance,
