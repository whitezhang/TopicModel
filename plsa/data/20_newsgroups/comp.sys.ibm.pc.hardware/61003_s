 
 i have one of these monitors. it appears to function ok, but is unhookable
 to anything standard (cga,ega,vga) - it will plug in but gives fuzzy
 diagonal noise. 
 i also have a graphics board that is apparently a 3270 graphic board
 (double card with 2 8-bit bus connectors, and a 9-pin female connector
 with a picture of monitor). i tried plugging these two into a standard at
 to no avail. how can one connect these to (the monitor seems to
 be of relatively high quality, so i'm curious)? any special drivers and/or
 setup needed - i can't locate any jumpers on the card.
