 is this the kx-p1124 you're talking about?  or is there a kx-1124, too?
 i'll assume you just forgot the p....

 this light is also the power light.....  on (not blinking) just means that
 the power is turned on.  if you look at the panel, it should read
 
       power
       ---------
       paper out

 when you power up the printer, assuming it does have paper, the red power
 light (which, when flashing, doubles as paper out) should light, and a few
 seconds later, the green online light should come on.
