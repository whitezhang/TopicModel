 we are trying to install a donated hard disk (miniscribe
 vintage 1988) on a supercheap ancient compaq xt for
 use in education.  the only problem is that the
 supercheap compaq didn't come with the manual and i
 haven't been able to figure out how to start the setup
 program.
 
 i began using pcs after 286s were invented, so i have
 a couple of basic questions:
 
 1.  did xt-class computers even *have* setup programs?
 
 2.  if they did (or, do), how do i access it?
 
 if anybody has any good advice on how to proceed or
 what to do next or what to look out for, please let me
 know.  e-mail is best, but i'll also be watching the
 newsgroup postings.
 
 thanks in advance,
 -robert
