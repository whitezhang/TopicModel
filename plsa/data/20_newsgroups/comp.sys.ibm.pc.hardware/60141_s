 like who, f'rinstance?  when i bought my system (november), no first, second,
 or third tier vendor could touch the price for the hardware/software
 combination i got from gw2000.

 if you were selling as many systems as fast as gw2000, you'd end up with four
 or five pissed-off customers too.  and four or five ecstatic ones.  and lots
 of satisfied ones...

 don't minimize this; if you buy mail order, it's a good thing to know that
 you'll get replacements parts, no questions asked, in a day or two, via fedex.

 which they do in the vast majority of cases.  remember that it's only the
 people on the tails of the curve who are motivated to write -- the ones who
 love it, and the ones who hate it.  you don't hear from the folks in the
 middle very often...
 
 they have rough edges, no doubt about it; but they give good value per dollar,
 and use almost all top-quality components.
