 i need to buy a scsi controler for my 486 machine to use with a quantum  
 425f harddrive. i know that adaptec is good, but they are kind of  
 expensive. essentially i want a controller in the $100-$150 range that i
 can use with this drive. i plan to use windows and later on os 2.1 when it  
 comes out. any reccomendations appreciated.
