 i had this problem some time ago.  some bioses do not automatically install 
 com3 or com4 in the port tables. programs like most modem programs which 
 write directly to the port work fine but anything that uses a bios call 
 fails. find a bbs or ftp site where you can get a copy of port finder. put 
 "device=pf.sys" in your config.sys or run pf.com from your autoexec.bat. 
 this little program will locate all existing ports and make sure the bios 
 tables are updated. it works great. pf will also let you swap ports and 
 such also if that is of any value to you.
