 dear all,
 
 	i am trying to get my standard connection going with ka9q (pa0gri113016)
 and a gvc nic-2000 ethernet card. i know that my router and modem is
 working because i am able to ping, finger, and even telnetd with it.
 
 	however, after a time, it crashes randomly. help would be
 greatly appreciated.
 
 	i suspect that there is a hardware conflict in the pc.  i am
 running with a 386sx/33, 2 mb ram.  the ethernet card is configured
 for irq 5, ports 0x360-0x37f. 
 
 	thanks in advance. i know that it's not much to go on, but i
 don't even know what the questions to ask are, sorry.
 
 please send mail.
 
 elliott
