 
 	i am interrested in the extrodinarily simple concept of the null modem
 cable. (actually i have no idea, so don't count that last statement.)  what i'm
 asking is what pins does it use (or what are it's specifications?)  i just want
 to solder one myself instead of buying one.  i don't even know what port is
 used.
 
 help me please (at ke_kimmell@vax.cns.muskingum.edu)

 p.s.  i'm intending to use the cable for pc-to-pc transfers (via lap-link or
 telix.  ideas and info gladly accepted.)
