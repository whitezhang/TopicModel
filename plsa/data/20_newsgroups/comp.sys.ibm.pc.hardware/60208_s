 my western digital also has three sets of pins on the back. i am using it with
 another hard drive as well and the settings for the jumpers were written right 
 on the circuit board of the wd drive......ma sl ??
 
 i can't remember what the last one was. if you can't find these markings on the
 circuit board, i'll open my machine and tell you what mine are.......
