 netters!
 
 i need a cdrom drive as my order was cancelled and thought 'why not ask
 the net.community'? i was ordering a nec cdr-74 but saw so much cheaper
 ones that i want to know more.
 the drive will be used to install software and (if available) for listening
 to cd's. perhaps some day i'll want to use it to read the other cd's, but
 that's not really relevant at the moment.
 
 i've been offered the following cd-rom players, for the prices stated.
 they all claim to have scsi-i, and operate under os/2.
 the drives are not listed in the cdrom-faq and therefor, please give
 your opinions on the drives, i've got the impression that they're not
 all scsi. actually the nec was listed as non-scsi in the cdrom-faq and as
 a compatible scsi product in the os2faq.
 
 i've calculated the prices as having dutch guilders times 2. it's actually
 about times 1.8.
 
 mitsumi crmc     $240
 philips lms-i    $300
 philips 205      $350
 toshiba ?        $370
 nec cdr-74       $650
 
 who bought that trantor that is in the faq? it's extremely cheap and scsi,
 so what's the trick or where can i order it (holland using mastercard).
 
 trantor t128     $200
 
 regards, jv
