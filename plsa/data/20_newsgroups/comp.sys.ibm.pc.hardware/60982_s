 
         i am considering selling an atari 1040 and purchasing an ibm compa-
 tible.  i need to know what kind of money or trade i can expect to get for
 the atari before i bother.  i am about to start graduate school, and that
 means i'm about to be poor!  (there's a price list for used synthesizers on
 rec.music.makers.synth, but no equivalent list for computers...)
 
 this system is tailor-made for a midi musician.  details follow:
 
   * atari 1040 st
       tos 1.0
       1 mb ram
       720k floppy drive
 
   * supradrive 20 mb external scsi drive, 18 months old
 
   * 12" atari monochrome monitor
 
   * generic 2400 baud external modem
 
   * software: all software is registered and comes with manuals.
       passport's master tracks pro, version 2.5 (sequencing software)
       dr. t's copyist professional (scoring software)
       first word (word processor - *not* the pd version)
       megamax's laser c, version 2.0 (programming language)
       vip professional (spreadsheet package - low-tech lotus clone)
       partner st (desk accessory with integrated calendar, cardfile, etc.)
       migraph's easy draw (an early, pre-postscript release)
       neodesk (improved desktop for atari st)
       universal iii (improved file selector for atari st)
       miscellaneous software (including uniterm communications software)
 
 
         i will consider all prices above $900.  i am also willing to
 trade the atari system for a quality (386 or 486) pc, including lap-tops.
 i own some pc hardware, so a complete system may not be necessary.
