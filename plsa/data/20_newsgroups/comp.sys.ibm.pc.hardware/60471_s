 
 greetings,
 
         please forgive me if this is faq. if there is source on this kind of info, 
 please let me know. i just got a 286 station (around 21*16.5*7 in dimension),
 and i am thinking about upgrade it to a 486 or 386.
 
         the station has a power supply, two floppy disk drives, and the big
 case. i have sony 1304 monitor, syquest drive (mac), and maybe a cd-rom
 reader (mac) for it. here are the questions i have so far:
 1) is there a 486 motherboard at this dimension that i could use the case?
 2) the original owener has the controller for floppy drive and hard disk
 removed. can i use them to control these devices under 486? how much do i
 have to pay for a new controllers if the old ones won't work?
 3) how can i make syquest (scsi) and cd-rom (scsi) work on this station? 
 i heard that there is a cheap sound board that has scsi controller built-in?
 what's quality of this board? how much usually does a scsi control cost?
 is there any ftp sites that has syquest driver or cd-rom driver for the pc if
 i can have everything hooked up ok?4) what i want is a 486 motherboard, a sound board to make it a mpc- 
 quality station. how much would it cost to do that? is it worth the hussle
 than just buy a new 486 station? btw, i need to buy a keyboard for it too.
 
 any input is welcome.
 
 thank you.
