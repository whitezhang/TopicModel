 i have been following this thread and figured i'd throw in my two cents...
 
 the amiga zorro ii bus is comparable with the isa bus (7.16 vs 8.33 mhz).
 the amiga has had a pre-emptative multi-tasking  os since '85 and can
 operate with 1 mb ram!  scsi is used almost exclusively on these systems.
 
 a scsi controller that transfers data by dma allows the cpu to request data
 from the hard drive and continue working while the controller gets the data
 and moves it to memory.  a controller that allows reselection can operate
 even better with multiple devices.  this is espically true with scsi tape
 units.  for example, when rewinding or formatting a tape, the command is
 issued to the controller and the bus is released to allow access to other
 devices on the bus.  this greatly increases productivity or, at least, do
 something else while backing up your hard drive :-).  which happens to be
 what i am doing while reading this group.
 
 its a long story, but i still use ide on my 486 except for the cdrom which,
 thanks to scsi, i can move between both machines.  if, and when, scsi is
 better standardized and supported on the ibm-clone machines, i plan to
 completely get rid of ide.
