 highspeed  analog-digital pc-board
 
 hello ladies and gentleman !
 
 i am looking for a highspeed a/d pc-board with a sampling rate above 250 mhz an a
 resolution of 8-bit. the sampling rate can be arranged by an interleave mode where
 the time equivalent sampling yields 2, 4 or 8 times higher sampling rate than
 the a/d-converter uses in non interleave mode.
 
 the board must content an a/d-converter similar to analog devices ad 9028 or 
 ad 9038 or if available a faster on.
 
 if you a pc-board (16-bit slot, isa) with this specification or better, please
 send me an email

 or a telefax to: ++49 / 511 / 7629353
 
 
 thanks in advance for your help !
 
 sincerely
