 i recall reading a review article in pc computing wherein they reported
 a reduction in the loading time for lengthy programs using stacker 3.0.
 this was not due to the compression algorithm per se, but to the fact
 that fewer fetches were required during the sequential file access. does
 anyone have any actual performance numbers relating to speeds of stacker
 and dblspace?
