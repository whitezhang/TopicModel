 les,
 
 	i am right now working on an mpr-ii certified (swedish standards for
 low emissions) hitachi superscan 15 monitor.  it's 1024x768, up to 72hz at
 that res, and it got a good write-up for image quality in a recent (feb.?)
 issue of pc magazine.  as far as i know, very little fully matches a nec in
 image quality (at least according to the mags -- i can't tell any
 difference between the two!), but i think nec is low emissions on only one
 of the two types.  there's vlf (very low frequency) and elf (i think that's
 extremely low frequency).  the mpr-ii standards set strict limits on both.
 but many comapnies, nec included according to one article i read (i get a
 bunch of mags so it's hard for me to remember which!), which claim "low
 emissions" but not specifically "mpr-ii compliant" or "mpr-ii certified"
 only control for one, usually vlf, and ignore the other.
 	so, the nec probably has higher overall image quality (i consis-
 tently hear it rated as the best or close to the best), but not as low
 emissions as the hitachi.  i like my image quality, but for all i know you
 may be more discerning.  good luck!

 (oh yeah: i got my hitachi superscan 15 from insight for $499.)
