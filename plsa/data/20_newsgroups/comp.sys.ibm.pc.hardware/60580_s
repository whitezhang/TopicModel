 b(>extended operation of my g2k 486-33v with the cover removed
 b(>from the enclosure.  there are a # of reasons i am considering
 b(>this, including quick access to jumpers during complex i/o card
 b(>setups.
 
 b(>my concern is that without a complete enclosure to direct the
 b(>cooling flow of air from the fan, "hot spots" may develop on my
 b(>motherboard or elsewhere.
 
 if you have an adequate supply of air moving over the system (most
 offices or homes have positive ventilation) you can generally run a
 system without the cover for extended periods without a problem. (i'm
 talking about completely removing the cover - not just leaving the slots
 uncovered.) however, the biggest reason you have a cover to begin with
 is rf sheilding. operating a system without the full cover may create
 problems with other equipment such as your neighbor's tv or ham radio
 station - very much a no-no in the eyes of the law.
