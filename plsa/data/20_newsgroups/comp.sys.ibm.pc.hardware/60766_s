 i think it all depends on your motherboard and the cards you have in your system.  your hd stopped boot probably because your hd controller can't handle the faster bus speed.  i have a 486-33dx, i set my bus divider to clk/2.5, that is close to 13mhz.  i can gain singificant performace increase on my video card and harddisk transfer rate when i boost the bus speed.  and my system work flawlessly under this setting.  and you know what, when i go to clk/2(17mhz bus), my hd refuse to boot.  
 
 just my 2 cent.
