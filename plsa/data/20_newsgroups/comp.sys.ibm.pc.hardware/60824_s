 to all netters,
 
   in my last post that concerning about the cyrix 486dlc cpu, i said the
 benchmark program comptest stated there is a bug in cyrix cpus. this is not
 true and i must apologize to the author of comptest. the actual program
 that gives this report is f-prot 2.07, a virus detection and removal
 program. the report stated there is a bug in the cx486slc but not dlc.
 sorry, sorry, sorry...
