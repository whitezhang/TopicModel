 i have come across a old external hard disk and i can't find
 any specs for it anywhere...
 
 it is made by nec (yes i tried tech support.... no help), and it
 has a model number apc-h27c and is labelled "expansion hard disk"
 
 can anyone help me out with figuring out what this beast is.
 the external connector looks like a scsi plug, and the date on the 
 drive chassis is 1984... os it's pretty old.
 
 i just want to see what it is, before i deep six it or rip it 
 apart for bits.
 
 
 
 thanks
