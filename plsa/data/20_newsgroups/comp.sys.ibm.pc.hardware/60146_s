 how about 250mb/s for 64-bit vlb or 350mb/s for quickring {apple's
 implimentation of vlb (byte 10/92:132)} quickring is interesting in that
 it allows interleaving with other card so that the 350mb/s can be divided 
 among many cards at the same time {nubus 90 and mca are about the only card 
 interfaces able to do anything with that kind of speed and even nubus 90
 ditzes around at ~30mb/s with a burst mode: 80mb/s.

 ida can't handle vlb speed never mind quickrings's speed so it is out.
 eisa pokes along at nubus mac ii speeds {~15mb/s burst mode: 33mb/s}
  so vlb and quickring are slowed down by it.
 pci is a competing interface that is still in development.
