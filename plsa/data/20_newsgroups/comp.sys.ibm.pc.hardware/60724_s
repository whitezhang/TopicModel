 too right it does!

 the --very very first-- thing you do is make sure that --all-- files on
 the floppies that you can currently read in the drive, which aren't
 already on your hd or another floppy (if you have -two- floppy drives)
 get copied to your hd (and/or to a floppy in your other drive).
 
 if you don't do this before fixing the alignment problem you have kissd
 those files goodbye.  (well, you can -try- to re-misalign the drive back
 to read your floppies, but don't count on be able to do so!)
 
 generally, head alignment is something i'd only trust to a good repair
 shop (though there are/have been diy guides).
