 can anybody please help me with information on the use of the bi-directional
 printer port.
 
 i have successfully used one on a toshiba laptop by enabling bit 0 of port
 0x37f and controlling bit 7 of port 0x37a for the direction of data flow (ie
 "0" for output, "1" for input).
 
 the same code does not work on my desktop machine. i have heard that i might
 have to use bit 5 of port 0x37a, however this also does not work.
 
 for a parallel port i am using one of those ide super i/o cards and have been
 running a tape backup unit off it via a parallel to scsi converter so i am
 pretty sure that the printer port is bi-directional.
 
 
 any information would be greatly appreasiated.
 
 please post a reply here or email me on

 thanks
 richard muratti.
