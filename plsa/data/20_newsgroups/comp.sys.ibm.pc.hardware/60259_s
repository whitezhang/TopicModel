 we had the same issue plague us for months on our gateway.  i finally
 got tired of it so i permanently interchanged the drives.  the only
 reason i didn't do it in the first place was because i had several
 bootable 5-1/4's and some 5-1/4 based install disks which expected
 the a drive.  i order all new software (and upgrades) to be 3-1/2 and
 the number of "stupid" install programs that can't handle an alternate
 drive are declining with time - the ones i had are now upgraded.  and
 as for the bootable 5-1/4's i just cut 3-1/2 replacements.
 
 if switching the drives is not an option, you might be able to wire up
 a drive switch to your computer chasis.  i haven't tried it but i think
 it would work as long as it is wired carefully.
