 give the new viewsonic 17 a good look.  i have seen it side by side with
 an old viewsonic 7, a mag 17, a nanao 17" (not the trinitron one), and
 a sony oem 17" (which does have a trinitron tube).  the new viewsonic
 beat all of them easily in terms of picture quality, and i think it is
 far superior to the 16" sun that i am staring at now.  the place asks
 $1178 for it; i would have bought it if i had not just bought a 15"
 nanao f340iw a week earlier :(
