 
 i have a sony 1604s 17" monitor and i don't see any lines across
 the screen and am only using the non interlaced mode.
 but because of the hor. lines and poping that i do see and hear
 when i am usinf 800x600x256 and 1024x768x256 modes and switch back
 to anything of less. i would not buy another sony at what ever price.
 oh ya this is i guess a 15" viewing area. it don't impress me one bit!   sam
