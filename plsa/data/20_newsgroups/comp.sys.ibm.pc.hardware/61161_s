 initially, 79 returned to active use, 80 new sectors marked bad, following
 successive runs of spinrite.
 
 i think i need a new esdi hdd controller.
 
 i know that these two will work:
 dtc 6280
 adaptec 2322b
 
 others that might work:
 dtc 6282
 ultra store 12
 wd 1007v
 
 if you own one and will sell it cheaply i'll buy it.
 
 thanks,
