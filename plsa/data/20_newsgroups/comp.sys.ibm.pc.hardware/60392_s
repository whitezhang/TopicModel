 nice of you to delete both your responce and the item that prompted it.

 as i said this is sloppy and dumb {you should resounded by discounting the mac
 not giving "maxtor 245 meg ide drive for $320" example.  by giving an
 example you give the implied consent that for mac info to be included
 in the scsi discusion.}

 ok i will do this v e r y  s l o w l y so you can understand
 reguardless of whether it is a mac or a pc scsi-1 and scsi-2 are different
 from each other as is asynchronous and synchronous scsi-1.  all of these
 have different speeds and costs. lumping them all together as 'scsi' is
 dumb and sloppy.  take again the quote later on as an example of the problem 
 in the pc world {the spec list was so that you knew where the numbers were
 coming from in the article.  it shows the article is correct in it
 staments about scsi but not consitant}.

 with the way this thread has gone how do you tell :-).

 already gave them.  you keep deleting them! so here are the specs
 on everybody again {with some added info}:
 
 scsi-1 {scsi-1 controler chip} asynchronous range: 0-3mb/s
  synchronous range: 0-5mb/s  both common to the pc world; difference is
  mainly in software not hardware.
 
 scsi-1 {scsi-2 controller chip; also called scsi-2 (8-bit)}: 4-6mb/s with 
 10mb/s burst.  this is advertised as scsi-2 in byte 4/93:159 for the
  pc and at these speeds.{not the mac, the pc.}
 
 {i have not seen the following for either the mac or the pc}
 scsi-2 {16-bit/wide or fast mode}:  8-12mb/s with 20mb/s burst
 scsi-2 {32-bit/wide and fast}:     15-20mb/s with 40mb/s burst
 
 on the other interfaces let dxb132@psuvm.psu.edu speak:
 >ide ranges from 0-8.3mb/s.                          
  asynchronous range: 0-5mb/s {infered from byte 4/93:159}
  synchronous range: 0-8.3mb/s.
 >esdi is always 1.25mb/s (although there are some non-standard versions)

 note that i also give the average through put for scsi-2 which holds true
 a mac or ibm/pc clone with the correct hardware and software.
 and since pc adversizements are using theoretical performance figures why 
 cannot we?

 with pc articles like the following it is obvious that the problem is not with
 scsi but with the people who report it! {like you.}
 look at the inconsitant use of scsi in the below quote: 
 (my comments in {})
 "although scsi is twice as fast as esdi,{this is asynchronous scsi-1 with
 a scsi-1 chip} 20% faster than ide..." {this is both asynchronous scsi-1 with 
 a scsi-2 chip and 8-bit scsi-2} pc magazine april 27, 1993:29
 the article is confused, not scsi.  the term is a mess from inconsitant use
 not because the interface itself is a mess.
 
 scsi means "the set of scsi interfaces composed of scsi-1 and scsi-2"
 not 'scsi-1' as some people want to use it.
 
 to read consitantly the quote should read:
 {asynchronous scsi-1 with a scsi-1 chip}
 "although asynchronous scsi-1 is twice as fast as esdi, one third the 
 speed of ide..."
 or {asynchronous scsi-1 with a scsi-2 chip or 8-bit scsi-2}
 "although scsi-1 with a scsi-2 chip and 8-bit scsi-2 are eight times as fast as
 esdi, 20% faster than ide..."
 
 note the nonuse of 'scsi' by itself.  this eliminates ambaguity.
 
 if we are to continue this thread state clearly which scsi you are talking 
 about scsi-1 or scsi-2 or scsi over all {scsi-1 and scsi-2}.  lumping
 everything into scsi as scsi-1 is sloppy, wrong, and dumb.  inconsitant
 scsi-1 and scsi-2 usage is also a problem.  clean it up now or have
 a mess like svga was several years ago because everybody and his uncle
 slapped 'scsa' an their own monitor inteface {scsi is standarized unlike
 svga was years ago except in terminaology.}
