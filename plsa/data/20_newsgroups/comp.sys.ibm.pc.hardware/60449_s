 i have a quick question regarding the rockwell chipset
 that's`come out relatively recently--it supports v.32, v.32bis,
 v.42, group iii fax, and so on...  however, i heard there
 are bugs in the chipset.  i know someone that has a zoom
 14.4 modem that uses the chipset, and he hasn't had a problem.
 
 what's the word on the chipset?  is this a rom bug specific 
 to a specific brand using the rockwell, or is it the rockwell
 chipset itself?  and, if it is the rockwell chipset, what 
 are the chances that if i buy one of these modems (using the
 rockwell chipset), that a) the bug will affect me, b) a rom
 change will fix/compensate for the bug?
 
 please send responses via email...
