 i have a 486dx33 isa system with 4 meg.  i am using a diamond speedstar hicolor
 video card with 1 meg vram and a standard ctx 14-in svga monitor.  when i am
 running windows, and i have overlapping windows (say an application overlapping
 the program manager window), and i close the active application, window erasure
 is very slow.  the part of the window that is not overlapping is erased first,
 very slowly.  this also happens when i iconify an application.
 
 the hicolor card is advertised as a faster-than-standard video card, but it
 does not have an accelerator chip on it.  i am running at 800x600x32k.  is this
 slow speed simply to be expected without an accelerator chip, or is there
 something else that is bottlenecking the system that i am unaware of?
 
 thanks.
