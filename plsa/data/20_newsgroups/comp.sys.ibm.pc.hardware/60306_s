 well, i figured out how the jumpers go.  now i have quite a different
 problem that has me perplexed like you wouldn't know.  i have both drives
 working, the c: system formatted and all of my hardware installed.  only
 problem is, that during the boot up sequence, the computer does not want
 to pass up looking for a system on the a: drive.
 
 reinitialization all goes fine and the bios seems to be configured to
 what is necessary.  all the drive tests work, but when the thing comes
 back around to the a: drive and there is no disk present, it just spins.
 if you insert a disk into drive a with a system however, it works fine
 and boots up (ie how installed all my software)
 
 any additional help on this will be most welcome....
