 most xt ide controllers are responsible for keeping track of the drive
 geometry and getting the information to the computer.  the controller may
 come with software to update its on-board bios, or may be designed to work
 with a particular drive.  seagate drives usually have special controllers
 for use on xt's, and these are tailored to the drive.
 
 also, you cannot low-level format an ide drive.  the low-level format is
 stored on specal magnetic areas on the disk surface called "servos" (not
 like the electronic use of the term) that need a higher recording bias than
 the drive's recording heads can generate.  don't try to low-level format an
 ide drive!
