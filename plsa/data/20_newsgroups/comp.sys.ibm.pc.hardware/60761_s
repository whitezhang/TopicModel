 i think you mean the ethernet numbers.  the 8 byte ethernet id is the unique
 electronic serial number (esn) assigned to each ethernet board in existence.
 this is a "physical layer" concept.  the ip address is a higher layer protocol.
 the analogy to telephone service is the ip address is your phone number, while
 the particular wire pair in the cable on the pole has some (unknown to you or
 i) physical identification scheme (number).
 
 but to answer your question (assuming you indeed meant the ethernet number)
 it is not supposed to be possible to change the number.  of course the
 manufacturer can always retro-fit a board, but there could hardly be a
 reason to ever do that.
 
 if your question is actually referring to the ip address, it is most definetly
 changable.  but it is strictly software.
