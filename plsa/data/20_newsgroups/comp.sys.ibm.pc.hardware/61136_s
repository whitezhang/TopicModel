 which bus???
 
 i think there are several reasons :-
 
 50mhz motherboards are harder to get right
 50mhz need a fast l2 cache - 12-15ns is a good idea
 50mhz needs to be slowed down to make a compliant vesa bus
 66mhz dx2 chips are faster for a lot of things
 
 
 with a good, fast l2 cache a dx2/66 is going be be faster than a dx50...
 
 what do i have?
 
 a dx50 of course!
