 i love it when magazine writers make stupid statements like that re:
 performance. where do they get those numbers? i'll list the actual
 performance ranges, which should convince anyone that such a
 statement is absurd:
 
 scsi-i ranges from 0-5mb/s.
 scsi-ii ranges from 0-40mb/s.
 ide ranges from 0-8.3mb/s.
 esdi is always 1.25mb/s (although there are some non-standard versions)
