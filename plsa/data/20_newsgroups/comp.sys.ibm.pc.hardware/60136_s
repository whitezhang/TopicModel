 i just tried a few experiments. i cat'd a 20261-byte file (471 lines)
 under various scenarios:
 
 pc-xview for dos in a full-screen os/2 window (1024x768x16):    18 sec
 telix (dos) in an os/2 window (1024xs768x256):                  107 sec!
 telix (dos) is a full-screen os/2 window (standard vga):        11 sec
 telix (dos) in a windows 3.1 window (1024x768x256):             30 sec
 uw/win in a seamless os/2 window (1024x768x256):        gave up after 4 min!
 uw/win in windows 3.1 (1024x768x256):           faster, but gave up after 2 min
 uw/win in a seamless os/2 window using pg       30 sec, could have been a
                                                 little faster (i had to keep
                                                 hitting the space bar)
 
 i was using an ati wonder xl video card, by the way.
 
 so pc-xview for dos looks pretty good (and the line-by-line scrolling
 in os/2 desktop looks pathetic, although full-page redraws are pretty
 good).
 
 i tried it under pc-xview using my normal (9x15bold or 10x20) font,
 and with a very small font, and there was no difference in the times.
 the modem receive light was on pretty solidly, so it looks like the
 bottleneck was the 9600-baud modem, not the screen drawing.
