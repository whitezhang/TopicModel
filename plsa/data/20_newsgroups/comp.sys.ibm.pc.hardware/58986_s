 
 howdy,
 
 sorry if this has been covered before:
 
 one of my pc illiterate friends asked me to help him install drdos 6.0 on his
 nec powermate sx (386sx 16).  of course, i said "no problem" and went to work.
 unfortunately, the drdos refuses to recognize the hard drive during 
 installation, even though i am still able to boot off of the hard drive using
 the old dos.  after openning it up i discovered it was using an 8-bit 
 seagate scsi controller on a st-157n scsi 40mbtye drive.  i then booted 
 with drdos 6.0 off of the floppy a second time and ran fdisk to see if 
 i could access the drive.  lo and behold the primary 46.5 mbyte partition 
 was intact (created by dos 3.1 no less, i didn't think you could go over a
 32mbyte partition in the older doses. i could be wrong...).  i then tried 
 to remove the primary partition, which it wouldn't allow me to do.  i am 
 unaware of anything special that has to be done with a scsi drive (i 
 kinda expected it to work just like an ide/mfm/rll drive for dos 
 installations).  any suggestions would be greatly appreciated (except for 
 "throw it in the garbage and buy a new pc")...
 
 thanks in advance,
