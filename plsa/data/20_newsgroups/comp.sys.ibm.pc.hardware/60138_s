 : try a bios level format via the debug command.
 : -g=xxxx:5  where xxxx is the hex address of the hd controller bios
 : location.
 : if this will not work, a last resort would be to take a large magnet
 : to the hard disk, but this has to be done properly or you will cause
 : or could cause more damage than has been done already.
 
 : disclaimer: i am not responsible for your actions by directly applying
 : a large magnet to your hard disk.
 
 : if done correctly the magnet trick will wipe out everything on the
 : hard disk _completely_ and a low level bios format might succeed
