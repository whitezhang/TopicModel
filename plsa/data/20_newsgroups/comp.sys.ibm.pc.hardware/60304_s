 i am looking for an inexpensive vlb card, and have yet to run across any
 real reviews of them. one of the cards the local stores are pushing is
 the genoa 8500 for $125-140. apparently it uses a cirrus logic acc. chip,
 but i don't know which one (gd5426?). one of the shops i've spoken with 
 claims the card out-performs the diamond stealth 24 vl and the orchid
 fahrenheit 1280 plus vl cards (s3 86c805 based), but that can't be true
 if it is using the gd5426. i like the price of the genoa 8500, but if it
 lags in performance behind the s3 cards, i'll pay the extra $50 for one 
 of them.
 
 any info. on low end vlb cards would be appreciated. if i get replies via
 email, i'll post summary info. if anyone else is interested.
 
 thanks in advance,
