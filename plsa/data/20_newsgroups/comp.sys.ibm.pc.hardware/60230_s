 i started a similar thread about a month ago, and got many replies.
 the summary:
 
 ctx 14": nasty, low quality. avoid.
 
 ctx 15" proscan: not as good as some other makes; however, cheap.
   main problem seems poor quality control. some reported pincushioning
   (the problem i had), others poor focus, etc, etc.
 
 i complained about mine and it was 're-tuned' (i dodn't even pay
 shipping) and returned to me in 2 days. 
 
 it's now clear, well-focussed and has no pincushioning or barrel
 distortion at all. i'm very happy with it, and the digital
 controls and mode memory are nice. certainly, a trinitron
 (say) would be much nicer, but that's well out of my price range.
 
 conclusion: if you're on a budget, get one and be prepared to
 send it back if it's not perfect. it probably won't be when you get it,
 but has good potential.
