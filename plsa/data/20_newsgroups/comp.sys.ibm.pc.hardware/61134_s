 actually, the iapx86 family has a halt instruction that causes the cpu to
 cease processing instructions.  the cpu resumes processing either by being
 reset or by receiving an external (hardware) interrupt.  this is different
 from the power management facilities victor mentions.  of course, whether an
 operating system's idle loop uses the halt instruction is another matter
 entirely.
