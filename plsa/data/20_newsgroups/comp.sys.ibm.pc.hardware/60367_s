 then don't complain (maybe it wasn't you) that scsi was so expensive on
 pc's because all we've had until a year or two ago was the isa bus.
 (ie no one buys scsi for isa because isa is slow)
 are you saying that scsi on an isa bus is not an automatic winner when
 compared to ide?

 i get different transfer rates out of my ide when i change my isa bus speed.

 ide is just a variant of the old ibm- mfm at controller.  (at least that's
 how it looks from a software point of view).  it was never meant to be
 an all-encompassing protocal/standard to be implimented across different
 platforms.
 
 is there any argument that 
 ide can (or can't) transfer data from the ide drive at least as fast as the
 drive is able to provide the data?  are scsi versions of ide drives able
 to deliver higher sustained transfer rates to their scsi interface (because
 of a higher rpm platter, different arrangement of heads, etc?)?

 if data is going from one drive to another, and if scsi has the ability to
 perform that transfer without the data having to go through the cpu or main
 memory, then yes, that is the optimal way to do it.  as far as i know, ide
 can't do that.  but when the cpu wants data from both drives (data to be stored
 in main memory) are you saying that scsi can grab data from both drives 
 at the same time *and* store/transfer that data to main memory also at the
 same time?  working off 1 irq and 1 dma channel on an isa (or whatever) bus?

 a friend of mine just got a maxtor 245 meg ide drive for $320.  (that's 245
 million bytes, or 234 mega-bytes).  with the basic $20 interface, he gets
 close to 1 meg/sec transfer on his 286-20.  does your figure include a few
 hundred $$$ for scsi drivers?

 so you're saying that scsi would have been the default interface type,
 considering that the vast majority of pc's don't have cd-rom drives or
 tape backups or etc?  that most pc's only have (or had) 1 hard drive and
 run dos?  that scsi hard drives cost a lot more than mfm or rll drives
 at the time?  (and how common were scsi drives under 80 megs 4 to 10 years
 ago?)  there's a lot more than the lack of a common interface card that
 prevented scsi from becoming the connection medium of choice.

 but on that point, is it faster?  this is what all this is about.  do you
 get more performance for the money.  for all the people that will only have
 a single hard drive in their system (regardless of the os) will the scsi
 choice really give them more performance than ide?

 true, but expandibility can also start on the bus, which means the option
 is there for cd-rom drives or tape backups that run off their own cards.

 no argument.  this is always held up to the first time scsi buyer as the
 best reason.  but how many scsi devices will the first time scsi buyer
 eventually acquire?  again does it make sense to go scsi for a single
 hard drive system?

 with all the postings on the scsi i or ii specs, are you really sure that
 pc and apple scsi hard drives are compatible?  and even if they are, 
 is the data accessible from either machine (ie are there no formatting/
 partitioning or file table differences?)  is it really plug'n'play?

 so the c: drive on the connor becomes a logical d: drive to dos.  is this
 really a problem?

 after having two ide drives in my system for temporary file transfers,
 i have never seen any differences when switching between drives, nor
 have i ever seen any differences when transfering files between drives or
 to/from the same drive.

 that is nice (as long as the power supply can keep up).  i do believe that
 there is the possibility for up to 4 ide drives on a pc.

 but what about "mysterious" (and expensive) drivers to figure out?  at least
 ide doesn't require drivers that consume precious conventional (dos) memory.
