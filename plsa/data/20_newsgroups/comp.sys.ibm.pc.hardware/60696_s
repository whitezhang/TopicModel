 i believe that any vl/eisa/isa motherboard that uses the hint chipset
 is limited to 24-bit eisa dma (where 'real' eisa dma is 32-bit).  the
 hint eisa dma has the 16 mb ram addressing limitation of isa.  for this
 reason i would pass.  i own one of these (hawk vl/eisa/isa) and am look-
 ing to replace it for exactly this reason.
 
 please double-check me on this.  in other words, call the motherboard
 manufacturer and ask them if the motherboard supports true 32-bit eisa
 dma.
 
 other than this limitation, the motherboard works quite well (i am using
 mine with dos 5, windows 3.1, and unix s5r3.2).  also with adaptec 1742a
 eisa scsi host adapter.
