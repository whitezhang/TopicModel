 maybe i should have been clearer.  i have a intel 386dx/25 that i would
 like to use to put together a system however all the motherboards that
 the local vendors are now selling are running either at 33 or 40 mhz.  i
 guess i can cross my fingers and hope the cpu runs at that speed. ;^)
 
 i think i'll take mark's advice and see if any of the boards have
 a socketed oscillator and head down to the local electronics store...
 
 thanks for the info...
 
 =b^)
