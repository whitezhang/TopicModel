 hi, all hardware netters,
 
   i've seen recently on some magazines advertising a ?new? trident
 graphics card call 8900cl. the ad said it's new and *faster*. how is it
 compare to tseng et4000? btw, which is the fastest *non-accelerated* svga
 on the market? any info or benchmark are welcome. thanks in advance.
