 bk>is it possible to plug in 70ns or 60ns simms into a motherboard saying
 bk>wants 80ns simms? 
 
 you shouldn't have troubles.  i have heard of machines having problems 
 with slower than recommended memory speeds, but never faster.  
 
 bk>also, is it possible to plug in simms of different
 bk>speeds into the same motherboard?  ie - 2 megs of 70ns and 2 megs of 6
 bk>or something like that?
 
 sure.  i have 4 70ns simms in one bank and 4 60ns simms in the other ( i 
 have a 486 ).  i wouldn't recommend mixing speeds within a bank, just to 
 be on the safe side.
