 technical problems to work out, or is it just bureaucratic slowdown? thanks!

    do hamsters have a natural habitat anymore (ie: "wild" hamsters)? or does
 their world consists only of a plastic gym that we call their home while they
 call it hell? funny how we like to watch others *sweat while our butts take
 root on the sofa.
    *i'm don't think hamsters sweat. i'll go shave one and get back to you.
