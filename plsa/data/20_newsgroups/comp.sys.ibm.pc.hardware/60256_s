 i am trying to get my system to work with a tandberg 3600 + future
 domain tmc-1660 + seagate st-21m mfm controller. 
 
 the system boots up if the tandberg is disconnected from the system,
 and of course no scsi devices found (i have no other scsi devices).
 
 the system boots up if the seagate mfm controller is removed from the
 system. the future domain card reports finding the tandberg 3660 on
 the scsi bus. the system then of course stops booting because my mfm
 hard disks can't be found.
 
 the system hangs if all three (tandberg, future domain tmc-1660 &
 seagate mfm controller) are in the system. 
 
 looks like there is some conflict between the seagate and future
 domain card. but the funny thing is that it only hangs if the tandberg
 is connected.
 
 i have checked that there are no conflict in bios addresses, irq & i/o
 port. have i missed anything?
 
 i am lost here. any suggestions are most welcomed. thanks in advance.
 
 delman.
