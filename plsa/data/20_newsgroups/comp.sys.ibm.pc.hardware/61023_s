 my 66 dx2 is about a week old and is custom built by me and for me.
 i am using the pc power and cooling cpu cooler.  this one has
 precision ball bearings in the motor.  it has a pretty substantial
 heat sink; so if it happened to fail it would still probably
 dissipate more heat than the bare chip.
 
 it attaches with peel off adhesive.  this is a full size at case, so
 the fan has gravity in its favor.  i would be a little nervous about
 finding the fan at the bottom of a tower case if it happened to let
 go.
 
 all of the cpu fans that i know of are powered from a drive cable.
 there are other "board" type fans which are isa boards with a couple
 of fans mounted on them.  they are powered by the slot.  i  don't
 know how effective they are; maybe someone else could comment.
 
 the cpu is cool enough to touch with the pcp&c unit.
 
 pc-connection at 800-243-8088 has them for 29.95 + 5.00 next day
 delivery.  the y cord is 7.00 if you don't have a spare lead off the
 power supply.  pcp&c make the best power supplies available imho.
