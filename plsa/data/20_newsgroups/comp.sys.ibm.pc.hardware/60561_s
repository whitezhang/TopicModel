 anyone who knows this answer off-hand, please answer me by e-mail 
 quickly ;). 
 
 there is a pair of jumpers on one side, and a set of 3 or 4 on the
 other end.  one is labeled, sync , and one cd, and e0 e1 e2.  
 
 whhich do i need to short, or disconnect to get drive to operate
 in slave mode?  give me a label or "geographic
 label, as they have quite a few jumpers, and i don't wanna try the
 trial and error method... 
 
 i am using ide. i think this drive is scsi compatible too.
