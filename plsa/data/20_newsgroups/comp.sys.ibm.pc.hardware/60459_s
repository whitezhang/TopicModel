 the quantum lps 240at is supposed to have a 256k cache on the ide
 controller built into the card.  yet when i do a dos dir command
 on my system, the disk is always accessed (i can hear the mechanical
 movement of the heads).  why is this happening?  strangely, even
 when i have smartdrive installed, every dir command accesses the
 disk.  did i somehow de-activate the cache?  this is happening on each 
 of two machines with an lps 240at drive.
