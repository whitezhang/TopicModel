 hi!
 	i recently purchased the toshiba 3401 cdrom.  i own an adaptec 1542b
 scsi card, and i have so far failed to get the cdrom to work under dos.  it
 works very well under os/2, so i know that the drive is not faulty.
 in my config.sys, i have aspi3dos.sys, aspidisk.sys, aspicd.sys.  in my 
 autoexec.bat, i have mscdex, which came with dos 6.0.  mscdex seems to find
 and install the drive as drive f:, but when i switch to that drive and try a
 dir, i get an error message telling me the drive is not ready or something
 like that.  the cdrom is locked too, and the adaptec utilities don't seem to
 recognize that i have a cdrom at that point.
 	has anyone ever had this problem?  is there something abvious that i
 am missing?  and finally, i was wondering if anyone using this setup could 
 kindly post his/her config.sys and autoexec.bat.
 
 	thank you very much!
