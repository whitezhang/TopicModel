 i ran into this about six months ago.  my system is a gw2000 486dx/66v,
 8 megs ram, 1meg ati gup vlb. it seems the problem is that the ati
 graphics ultra pro card consumes the com4 port for some reason, so only
 com1-3 are available.  i believe this is documented somewhere in the
 system manuals, but i can't recall where.
