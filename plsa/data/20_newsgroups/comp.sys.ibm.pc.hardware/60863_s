 hello all!
 
 i recently acquired a cd-rom drive, a mitsumi (mfg. feb/93)   [hey, it
 was free :-)   ]    i'm quite pleased with the performance, but it seems
 to crash a lot when i use playcd.exe that came with it a desqview 2.31 -
 thoughts?  this mainly happens when my bbs is running in the background and
 i load the program up.. if i load the program, it doesn't crash, and i start
 the disk, stop the program and start the bbs its ok, but otherwise i have
 big problems.. (ie, they can only be solved with a cold boot).
 
 if -anybody- can mail me to help me, i would be eternally grateful 
 (unfortunately, my feed to this group is a little unreliable so i would appreciate
  if you could mail, but by all means, post it too because i'm sure somebody else 
  would like to know...)
 
 cheers,
 wes
