 	i have one and it is my favorite cd-rom drive so far.  i also have 
 a nec-74 and have had experience with several other drives (various 
 phillips drives)
 
 	the 3401 is faster than the nec, i like its door better (the nec 
 needs 2 hands), the xa handling (the nec needs to be re-booted to go from 
 xa to rom while the 3401 does it on the fly), all in all i am seriously 
 considering replacing my nec with another toshiba.
