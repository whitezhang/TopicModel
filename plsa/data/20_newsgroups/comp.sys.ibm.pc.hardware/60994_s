 a couple of months ago i tried out a hercules graphite card.  a pretty nice
 board.  fairly fast, and seemed quite compatible -- even seemed to handle the
 svga modes i have whined about here on occasion.  at the time i was just
 buying a vlb system, so after checking out the card i sent it back.  i wanted
 a vlb card, and purchased a fahrenheit vlb card.  this card is fairly fast,
 will do 70 hz refresh at 1024x768, but is not compatible with my cd-roms
 (the svga thing -- i think; i have merely conjectured that is the cause of
 an old graphics board being able to run in a higher resolution with those
 programs than the modern boards i have tried.  i have not gotten a straight
 answer out of anybody...).  the monitor i am using it with is a 17" magnavox,
 which also tops out at 1024x768x70 hz so its really a pretty good match.
 
 but...
 
 that is for my wife.  i just purchased a viewsonic 17 for myself, and am
 looking for a graphics card to drive it.  i want > 70hz refresh,
 and would really like it to handle my cd-roms.  i tried the orchid p9000,
 which did neither of those things (though robert at wietek did say that the
 >70hz was possible if i modifed the driver data base).  so my thoughts go back
 to hercules.  they were supposed to be coming out with a vlb version of the
 graphite around the end of march.  i have heard precisely zero about it since
 then.  does anyone know if the card was actually released, and what capabilities
 (and price) it has?
 
 any info would be most appreciated.
