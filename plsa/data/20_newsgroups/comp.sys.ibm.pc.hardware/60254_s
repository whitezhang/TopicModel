 do you happen to know how i can get a serial mouse (9 pins) working on
 an ibm l40 notebook (which has a kind of bus mouse connection besides serial
 and parallel interfaces). the manual doesn't say anything about it.
 
 i've tried two drivers, with the result that left and right buttons are
 recognized, but mouse movement is not. should i cut or shortcut some
 wires to/from the mouse?
 
 thanks for your help.
