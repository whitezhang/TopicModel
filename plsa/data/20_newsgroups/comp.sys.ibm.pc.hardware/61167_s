 due to the large amount of request for 3dbench of et4000/w32,
 i finally can get a 3dbench v1.0 from a ftp site.
 
 the 3dbench of et4000/w32 in my cardex w32 card with 1mb dram
 has superscape benchmark of 26.3 frames/sec.
 
 hope it will satisfy people curiosity of this et4000/w32 performance.
 what other benchmark program result you would want to know? 8-)
