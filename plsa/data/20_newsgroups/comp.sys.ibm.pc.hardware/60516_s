 someone else, could you please comment on that. i have just bought
 a twincom 14.4dfi, which has a rockwell chipset. it wasn't cheap
 so i would like to hear of problems i'm likely to run into.

 phew, i was lucky! the twincom internal version has a 550a and one
 of the rockwell chips is marked rc144dp.
 
 but still i would like to hear more of the above mentioned firmware
 problems.
