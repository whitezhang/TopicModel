 i have tried others, but i think that the adaptec is best value for money.

 i dont think you can mix the two types of drive, unless you have one of the
 scsi/ide cards that is available.  you will have to turn your ide off.

 instructions for drive type are included with the controller.  with some it may be
 a type 1. no matter what the disk is.  with others it may be a type 47.  i had one
 controller that i had to tell the bios that no hard disk was installed.

 do not low level format a scsi unless you have the scsi low level format program. 
 first use fdisk to set the partitions, then use format.
