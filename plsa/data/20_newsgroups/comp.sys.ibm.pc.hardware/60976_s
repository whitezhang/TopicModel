     the irq and interface-select jumpers are pretty straightforward, but i
     don't grok the settings of w10-w18 (also labelled a15 through a18).
     could somebody tell me which settings of these four jumpers correspond
     to what i/o addresses?
     
 the u-b pcnic (also oemed by ibm for a while) is the only ethernet card i
 know of that doesn't use i/o addresses.  it only has interrupts and shared
 memory.  the jumpers you see control bits 15-18 in the base address of the
 shared memory.  i can't recall which is 1 and which 0, but that's easy
 to determine with debug.
