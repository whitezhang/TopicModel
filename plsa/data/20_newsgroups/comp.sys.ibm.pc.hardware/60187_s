 i have wd1007-wa2 esdi controller with rom bios v.1.1.
 it has been working fine until i recently upgraded motherboard to 386-40mhz.
 now, my maxter drive goes crazy making lots of seeking sound even when the
 drive is not accessed.  of course, with numourous hard disk controller errors.
 these symptoms disappear when i switch to non-turbo mode (8 mhz).
 i suspect some timing dependent rom bios routines. (there's a newer version
 2.x) could anybody help me on this?
 by the way, my new mother board has ami bios, 128k cache, 8 mhz bus, and
 works fine with my old mfm drives (i had to dig them up). :-(
 also, i will appreciate it very much if somebody send me the phone numbers
 (tech support/bbs) for western digital.
 many thanks in advance.
