 1. do not do a low level format on an ide drive unless you have the
    executable for doing so supplied by the manufacturer.  these are
    available from bbs's or mail but the mail version costs a nominal
    fee.
 
 2. in addition to the master/slave jumper on an ide drive there is also
    another jumper to indicate whether a slave is present.  get it right!
 
 3. the cabling is not an issue as long as pin 1 goes to pin 1 goes to
    pin 1.  no twisting or swapping on an ide cable.  be sure of pin 1
    on all three components - do not make assumptions (guesses are ok
    but assumptions are bad).
 
 4. if the cable and jumpers are correct, and the cmos setup is correct,
    then you may have to do an fdisk followed by a high level format.
    i have never personally found this necesary, but perhaps there is
    something gone wrong with the data on the disks?  probably not but
    i understand your predicament - you will probably throw salt over
    your shoulders, wear funny clothes and do a spooky sounding chant
    while dancing around the room if someone said it might help.
 
 good luck
