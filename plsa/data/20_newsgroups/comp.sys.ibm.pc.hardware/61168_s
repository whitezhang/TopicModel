 i have a nanao 17" (f560?)  on my ipx. i prefer it to my sun 16"
 trinitron at work with all those vertical jitters and the two
 horizontal shadowmask thingies.
 
 i got it from one of the folks advertising in computer shopper et al
 for $1050 plus about $40 shipping. 
 
 i bought a cable which goes from the sun's 13w3 connector to the
 monitors 4xrgbs for about $50 from a macintosh mailorder shop (relax
 technologies).
 
 i'd do it again. happily.
