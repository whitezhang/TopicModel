 i bought a 386dx33 system a little over 2 years ago, and was satisfied with
 everything about zeos.  that computer went off to grad school with my son and
 i replaced it with a 486dx2/66 pkg 4 (345 mbhd, 16mb ram) with diamond viper,
 128k level 2 cache, and tower upgrades, delete the ctx monitor.  i got a
 17" hp d1193a monitor employee purchase.  this is a *great* system, fast,
 quiet, solidly built, not a single glitch bringing it up.  tech support seems 
 busier now than 2 years ago.  i called with a configuration question, and
 they called back 4 hours later with the right answer.  i think there's a
 slight premium over gateway prices, but imho zeos is worth it. btw they 
 have enough 800 lines that i've never gotten a busy signal calling sales,
 customer service, or tech support. now, you usually wait 5 or 10 minutes to
 talk to someone, but at least you get in the queue and wait on their dime.
