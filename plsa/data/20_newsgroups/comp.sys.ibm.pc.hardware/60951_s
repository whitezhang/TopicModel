 don't even get hyped up.  they are still accepting submissions from the
 members for various proposals of how to implement the standard.
 
 you don't seem to realize that while v32bis was just an extension of
 v32 (which took years to pass, implement, and finally sell at a reasonable
 price), v.fast requires all new technology (not just faster dsp chips, etc.)
 to achieve its performance.
 
 wait until next spring for the final ratification and modems coming shortly
 after that.
