 well, some quick math on my part shows that an 8.3mhz bus, 16 bits
 wide, performing a transfer every two clock cycles will provide 8.3m
 bytes/sec.  someone said that it really takes 3 clock cycles to
 perform a transfer, so that reduces the transfer rate to 5.5mb/s,
 which is the commonly-used figure for isa bus speed.  however, i
 believe a two-clock transfer is possible (0 wait states).

 os/2 2.0 will do for me until amigados for the 386 comes along...
