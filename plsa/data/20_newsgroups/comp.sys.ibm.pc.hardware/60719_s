 i'm in the market to upgrade my bios to a phoenix 1.10 (got a new hard disk,
 discovered my bios doesn't have a "type 47") and i would like know where i
 can purchase one of these things.
 
 i checked with the motherboard manufacturer (for the curious-- it's from
 mylex), and hearing the $60 figure prompted me to at least try to shop
 around...
 
 problem is, i don't know where to shop around for something like this.
 
 i have heard that there's a bios speciality shop in the south bay and it's
 been alleged that they advertise in the microtimes.
 
 did find the microtimes, didn't find the ad or the shop.
 
 so, can anybody help me out on this quest?
 
 to anybody who replies to this-- thanks in advance.
