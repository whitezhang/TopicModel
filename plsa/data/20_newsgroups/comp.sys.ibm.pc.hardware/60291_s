 hi!
 
 i recently switched my 3.5" drive to a:. the problem is, while i can read and
 write to both the new a: and b: correctly, i can't boot from a floppy in a:.
 i've checked the cmos settings; it is set for floppy seek at boot and boot 
 order a:,c:. 
 
 once, i had a floppy that did not have the systems files on it in a:. i got a
 message telling me to put a disk systems disk in the drive. it didn't work.
 when i do have a systems disk in the a: drive, this is what happens:
 1) power-on and memory test;
 2) a: light comes on
 3) b: light comes on, followed by a short beep;
 4) hd light comes on for an instant;
 5) b: light comes on again, then nothing happens
 
 the light goes off, there is no disk activity of any kind, and the screen 
 blanks. i can't even use ctrl-alt-del.
 
 any suggestions.
 
 thanks in advance.
