 km>from any source that i trust, and i sure don't see any ads for dx3/99
 km>machines in computer shopper.  intel is pretty busy with the pentium
 km>right now; i can't seem them introducing their own competition.
 
 i heard the rumor as well, but the story differed.  intel was not coming 
 out with the tripling clock 486, a clone from ibm was.  i got this rumor 
 from a pretty good source ( has designs computer equipment, and hav never 
 been wrong let, but there is a first time for everything. )
 
 ...  i can just hear that rumor-mill turning now ...
