 on my 486dx-50 (really 50, not dx2), my at bus is set to clk/3.
 
 at 16.67 mhz, i have no problems.  soundblaster pro, zoom 14.4 fxm, rll
 controller, etc.  all work fine.
 
 if i set it to 2 (25 mhz), i simply don't get past the post routines.
 
 i doubt you could actually damage much by playing with it.
