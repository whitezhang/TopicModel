 hi,
 
 can anyone tell me the difference between ~30-pin and 72-pin simms?
 i wish to get detailed information about the origin of these two
 different types of simms, preferably a magazine review aricle.
 
 by the way, if there is a faq for this group which covers the simms
 information, please also direct me to it.
 
 any help/information would be very much appreciated.
 
 
 sincerely,
