 i saw in this months pc or pc world an ad for computers using ibm's 486slc.
 so i don't think ibm is restricted in selling their chips, at least not
 anymore. a clock-tripled 486, even without coprocessor would be great,
 especially with 16k on-board cache. make it 386 pin-compatible, and you
 have the chip upgrade that dreams are made of :-)
