 hello all,
 
 you, the net, are my last resort, or i'll just change my job :-)
 this might be a faq (e.g. mixing controllers) but haven't seen any.
 
 sys: 486/33, ami bios, and your run-of-the mill multi-i/o card with
 serials/paral/floppies and 
 	- ide controller "clone" gw2760-ex
 		there are no jumpers affecting the hd or ctrller :-( 
 	- quantum prodrive lps (3" 105m type 47: 755cyl, 16hds, 17spt).
 
 pb: i want to bring in this (2nd hand, neat price):
 	- maxtor xt-b380e (~330m, <15ms, bios type 1, ctrller manages
 		the real geom: 1630cyl, 8hds, 52spt)
 	- western digital wd1007v-se1 esdi ctrller: no floppies.
 		(jumpers set irq 14/15, hw port addr 1f0/170,
 		and bios addr cc00/c800, and other floppy/format stuff)
 
 goal: have the wd esdi as a secondary/controller and have both disks 
 simultaneously working. being able to boot from the esdi too would be 
 a nice bonus but is not expected.
 
 ultimate goal: have room for linux et al.
 ex of scheme i have in mind: boot from ide (hd or floppy) and mount
 the esdi as root. not booting from esdi, or even from hd, is acceptable.
 
 i have tried numerous (all!!) combinations to no avail. they work alone,
 or can coexist witout hang-ups but can't access the esdi or the ide, 
 depending on setup/jumpers.
 
 useful suggestions might be:
 - how do i tell the bios setup about two ctrllers (i guess the 2nd hd
 is expected to hang off the same ctrller as the 1st).
 - do i need some driver to make it work?
 - --- " --- some new bios/chip for any of these cards?
 - do i have to buy another controller to make them hds happy? ide
 is cheaper; esdi is hard to find and rather costly. i'm not 
 rich or i wouldnt' try to scavenge around, so soft slns are preferred.
 - adapters of some sort; i can hold a soldering iron, and can change
 a chip or put a jumper!
 
 also useful:
 - bbs or hot-line of western digital.
 - ftp archives with relevant info.
 - expert stores in toronto, ontario area (that would be a miracle! haven't
 seen any really knowledgeable ppl in a while)
 - any hints into inner workings of the system ... 
 - anything else that helped you in similar situations (prayers :-) )
 
 direct or posted replies are ok.
 	many thanks,
 			cat.
