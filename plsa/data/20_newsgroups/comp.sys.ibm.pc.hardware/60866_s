 
 i need to find how to program the wd7000 faast scsi controller (a 16 bit dma
 scsi controller for the pc (isa bus)). can somebody point me in the direction
 of some low level docs on the net? or will i have to get hold of the
 manufacturers? who did actually make this anyway? who will have the docs?
 
 tia.
 
 ps> i don't ant the bios docs, i want to know how to attack this sucker from
 the ground level (ie send my own scsi commands out it from os/2)
