 
 okay, here is my configuration:
 
 80486-33 gateway 433c micronics isa
 12mb ram 
 wd212mb ide hd ( drive c: )
 st3144a 125mb ide hd ( drive d: )
 adaptec scsi 1542b controller, with scsi bios enabled
 seagate st296n 80mb scsi drive
 
 alrighty, when i boot up i get the adaptec bios message, but it says
 something like:
 
 "drive c: installed"
 "drive d: installed"
 "adaptec scsi bios not installed!"
 
 and i can't get to the seagate drive.
 
 i go into phoenixbios setup, remove the entry for drive d:, and boom, i can
 access the seagate.  is there a way to get two ide drives and the seagate
 at the same time?  i have aspi4dos.sys, but it just hangs the system.
