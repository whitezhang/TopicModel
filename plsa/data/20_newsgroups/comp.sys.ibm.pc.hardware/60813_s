 1) it fixes some problems with microprose games.  after leaving f-15 iii it
 would, in vain, try to find a floppy in drive a:.  this has been fixed.  i
 don't know what other corrections were made.
 
 2) it comes with an image of the original, in case things don't work.
 
 3) download glb05.exe.  format a bootable floppy disk, and don't put a
 config.sys or autoexec.bat.  run the self extracting archive so all the files
 explode to the disk.  run the file fsh.exe.  it should be self-explanatory from
 there.

 p.s.:  i was feeling extraordinarily generous once again, so i uploaded the
 file to ftp.cica.indiana too..
