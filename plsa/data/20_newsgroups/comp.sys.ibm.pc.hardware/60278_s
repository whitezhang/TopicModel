 hi!
 
 i'd like to switch my floppy drives so that my 3.5" b: drive becomes a:, while
 my 5.25" a: becomes b:. i'm having a few problems, though.
 
 i know that the ribbon cable must be switched, as well as the cmos settings, 
 to reflect this change, and i think that i've done that correctly. however, the
 drives do not operate correctly in this configuration. from the c:> prompt, if 
 i type a:, the 5.25" drive light comes on; if i type b:, both the light for the
 5.25" and 3.5" drives come on.
 
 there are some jumpers on each drive:
 5.25"  label   original pos.   pos. i changed it to
         ds0      on               off
 	ds1	 off		  on
 	ds2	 on		  on
 	ds3	 off		  off
 	io	 off		  off
 	ms1	 off		  off
 	d-r	 on 		  on
 	ms2	 on		  on
 	fg	 off		  off
 
 3.5"    ds0	 off		  on
 	ds1	 on		  off
 	ds2	 off		  off
 	ds3	 off		  off
 	mm	 on		  on
 	dc	 on		  on
 	md	 off		  off
 	ttl/c-mo8 on		  on
 
 
 any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
 
 thanks in advance.
