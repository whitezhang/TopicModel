     i am thinking about buying a new motherboard and a cyrix 486dlc 40 or 33 mh
 z.  it will be an upgrade from a 386sx 25.  i was wondering if anybody has any
 facts they can fill me in on.  if anybody has one what do you think about it?
 i will also get a cyrix math co with it.  i have benchmarks for the two chips a
 nd they look very good for the price.  if anybody responds please send me email
  because i usually don't check the mail very often but i check my reader daily.
     thanks for your info, and remember only respond if you have legitimate comp
 laints or praise, not just to cyrix/amd bash.  i know about what byte, computer
  shopper, pc computing and etc... have said and that is why i am considering
 the cyrix chip.  thanks.........
