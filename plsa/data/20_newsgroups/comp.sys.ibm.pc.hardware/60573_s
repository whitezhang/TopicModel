 keith,
 
 i had a problem getting 256 colors (i was stuck with 16) even though
 the flex-stuff said i was at 1024-256.  i solved it by entering
 the 'advanced' window on the flex program pannel and changing the
 'color palette'.  sorry for the vaugeness, i hope it helps some.
 
 btw, i have a gw2000-66v and 1m ati gup.
