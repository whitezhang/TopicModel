 i am using a 8507 ibm monitor (19" greysale) with a trident (1mb) card.
 
 the screen looks great (windows) at 640x480 but total shit at 1024x768.
 there are lots of lines and the image is sorta blurry.
 
 is there anything i can do.  do you think it is the monitor?  i know
 that it is interlaced at that res but still.
 
 thanks for the help
