 >how do you do bus-mastering on the isa bus?
 
 by initiating a dma xfer.  :)
 
 seriously, busmastering adapter have their own dma ability, they don't use
 the motherboards on-board dma(which is *much* slower).
 
 isa has no bus arbitration, so if two busmastering cards in 1 isa system
 try to do dma xfers on the same dma channel the system will lock or 
 crash.(i forget)
 
 their are 8 dma channels in an isa system. 0-7. 0-3 are 8-bit & 4-7 are
 16-bit.
 
 the system uses dma 0, a soundblaster uses dma 1.
 
 i could buy a busmastering xga-2 video card & a busmastering scsi ha.
 
 in order for them to work properly, i would have to find out what dma
 channel the xga-2 card uses and then simply configure the scsi ha to
 use a different dma channel for its dma xfers.
 
 i don't know if multiple dma xfers can go on at the same time on isa.
 i'm not sure if they can on eisa systems either.
 
 i do know that on eisa/mca systems, you can allow bm cards to use the
 same dma channel.
 
 thanks.
