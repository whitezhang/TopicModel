 >what does a 200-400 meg 5 megs/sec scsi drive cost?
 since the quadra is the only mac able to deal with 5mb/s and hard drives start
 at 160mb i have no idea.
 for the mac i have the following {these are all external}
  20mb $299 {$15/mb}
  52mb $379 {$7.3/mb}
  80mb $449 {$5.63/mb}
 120mb $569-$639 {$4.75-$5.33/mb
 210mb $979-$1029{$4.67-$4.90/mb}
 320mb $1499-$1549 {$4.68-$4.84/mb}
 510mb $1999-$2119 ($3.92-$4.31/mb}
 etc
 
 so scsi-1/scsi-2 for the mac goes down in price/mb as hard drive size goes
 up {and i assume the same for the pc world.}

 well scsi is also a floppy drive interface.  in the mac {since scsi is the
 inteface for any non-card, non-modem, not-keyboard device} the id 7 is used
 for the floppy drive {called cpu in all identifiers.}  this allows cross
 drive interfacing as fast as the os, program, cpu, scsi, and drive can handle 
 it{this shows up best in the quatra line}.
 in the ibm that uses scsi for the floppy drive this should happen as well.
 also scsi is not just drives but printers, scanners, expandsion cards 
 {this showed up for the plus as the nubus 'cage'}, cd-rom, etc.
 ide seems to be mainly hard drives.  as for specs nobody has given me any
 and i can't find any.  besides the advertizments call ide the at interface
 {make of that what you will}
 scsi is a jack of all trades and ide is a master of one.
 this alone puts scsi above ide.  scsi-2 blows ide out of the water.
 remember scsi was used in high priced machines until about 18 months ago
 {when the mac prices came down to earth} so the rule of scale still played
 and scsi remained high cost{cheap seems to mean chezzy in the high end
 computer world at times and this more than anything else proably kept scsi
 off into the statosphere price wise}
 scsi came from the high end computer world with multitasking os were the
 standard for the most part.  of all the interface next could have used it
 choose scsi.  in 16-bit and 32-bit mode scsi is a multi-tasking os desined
 interface while ide and 8-bit scsi are braindead run one program interfaces
 {at least the way mac use 8-bit scsi.ugh}
