 buslogic just announced the bt445 fast scsi-2 vlb interface as of
 april 20.  this always happens to me!
 
 i have a one week old bt545s which is the isa version.  i am
 enjoying spectacular performance with a micropolis mc2105 560mb 10ms
 3.5" hh 5200 rpm drive.  i'll be changing to the bt445 very soon,
 though it is difficult to imagine even higher transfer speeds with
 the 32bit vesa support.
 
 you can call buslogic and ask 'em about the nt question. i hear that
 the support is excellent.   i have not had to call them myself yet.
 regards.
