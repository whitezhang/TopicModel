 did i once hear that in order for the date to advance, something, like a 
 clock, *has* to make a get date system call? apparently, the clock
 hardware interrupt and bios don't do this (date advance) automatically. the
 get date call notices that a "midnight reset" flag has been set, and then
 then advances the date.
 
 anybody with more info?
