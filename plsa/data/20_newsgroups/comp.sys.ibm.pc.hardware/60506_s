 no argument on going direct to national (see my previous post on this topic),
 but some info regarding what you said above.  i don't know about the 8250 or
 16450, but ns was the original source for the 16550 series (and i strongly
 suspect that they developed the others first, too).
 
 i can also tell you that i'm one of those who won't buy a uart made by
 anyone other than national semiconductor.
