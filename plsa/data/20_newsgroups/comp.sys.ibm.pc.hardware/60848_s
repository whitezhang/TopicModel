 hi all.
 
 i've been installing a new hard drive recently and have run into several
 terms that i'm not sure about.
 
 1.) hard sectored/soft sectored -- what's the difference?  how do i know
 which to use?
 
 2.) head skew & cylinder skew -- i understand that these are related to
 performance... how do i know what's optimal?
 
 my drive is an esdi drive, if that makes a difference in discussing
 these terms.
 
 		any info/help is greatly appreciated!
