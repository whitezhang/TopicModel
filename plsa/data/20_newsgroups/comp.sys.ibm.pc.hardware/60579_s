 i have been unable to get com 4 to work - diagnostic programs such as msd show
 nothing installed.  i think the software options are ok - is there a known
 hardware conflict and/or workaround for this problemand cd rom
 system is a g2k 486dx2/66 tower with ati video card
 ports are set as follows 
   on board coma = com1 irq4 to external device
   internal modem = com 3 irq5
   dfio port card primary port = com 2 irq3  mouse
   on board com b = com 4 irq 9  <--- does not work
 i have run this from a boot disk with only command.com to eliminate softwar
 
 any suggestions before i call technical support?
