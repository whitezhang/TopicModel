 it first depends on what an idle cpu is doing!
 
 i'm not sure about dos, but many multitasking oss have an loop like this
 
 
 loop:
 	is there anything to do?
 		yes -> do it; goto loop
 		no  -> goto loop
 
 
 the cpu is not doing any work but it is still processing instructions...
 
 it will also respond to interupts...
