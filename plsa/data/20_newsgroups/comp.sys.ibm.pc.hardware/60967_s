 hello,
     i'm trying to use the bios timer interrupts (which occur every .055
 seconds, or 18.2 times a second) to time people's response times, in a
 psychology experiment, and the response times are on the order of .01
 seconds. is there any way i can get better precision than by counting
 ticks? or can i make the ticks occur more frequently? i'm trying to do
 this in dos 5.0 on a 386, and it would be nice if this could also work
 on our old 8086 machines running dos 2.1 (i know, i know, i don't like
 them any more than you do) but this is by no means a requirement, just a
 possibility. 
     so, basically, any information on the bios tick scheme and the
 related inrterruots would be appreciated, as well as any information on
 alternate ways of improving accuracy. email is preferred, as i'm
 planning on posting this to a few boards, and i don't read all of them.
 thanks
 
 joe
