 the only things you'll be able to salvage from the junior are the floppy drives
 and monitor.  the floppies are 360k, and the monitor is cga, but you will need
 an adaptor cable to use it.  the junior does not use standard cards.  unless 
 you're really strapped for cash, you should just junk the thing and buy new 
 stuff.
