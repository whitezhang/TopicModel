 my pc is a 486-33dx (isa) with ami bios and opti chipset. i am thinking of replacing the ami bios chip (dated 6-91) with an up-to-date one (not for any reason, just messing around). my questions are:
 
 1. do i just take out the old one and plug in a new?
 
 2. anything else i have to take care of? what precautions should i take?
 
 3. where can i get the new bios chip, compusa, mailorder or what? (i live in orange county california).
 
 4. what is the most up-to-date version?
 
 5. very important. how much would it be?
 
 thank you for your help.
 
 
 paul.
