 don't believe everything you are told.  i can tell you that mixing them 
 between 'banks' ok, and i can't see why mixing in one bank is not unless 
 they are of different speeds ( e.g. mixing of 60ns and 100ns simms in one 
 bank ).  the two only differ in the type of chips it uses.  assuming that 
 the simms are 1mx9 ( 9 bit wide ), here is the two equivalent 
 configuration.  the 3-chip simm uses two 4-bit wide 4mbit (1m of 4-bit 
 nibbles ) and one 1-bit wide 1mbit chip ( for a total of 9-bit wide 1mbyte 
 ).  the 9-bit simm uses nine 1-bit wide 1mbit chips.  these are equivalent 
 because of the way that it is 'pinned' on the simm board.  at the simm 
 interface, they both act as 9-bit wide 1mbyte simms ( 2*4+1=9*1 ).  [sorry 
 if too techie for ya].

 that sounds correct.  the problem is that if your computer takes 9-bit 
 wide simms, you can not mix different sizes in one bank.  why you ask?  
 simple,  if you understand why there is banks.  assuming you have a 32-bit 
 cpu ( 386dx or 486 ), the data bus (e.g. the mechanism to retrieve data 
 from memory ) is 32-bits wide, so the computer expects to see 32 bits when 
 it asks for data.  to get that bandwidth ( 32-bit wide ), the motherboard 
 links 4 1mx9 ( one bit is not data, but parity, so i will ignore that in 
 this simple explaination ) to get 32bits [ (9-1)*4=32 bits ].  that means 
 that a simm in a bank stores only 1/4 of the 32 bit wide data.  if you 
 have a 16-bit bus, two 1mx9 simms are linked together to get 16-bit wide 
 data, which is the reason why 286 banks are 2 simms wide, and 32-bit banks 
 are 4 simms wide.  if your computer required 1mx36 ( e.g. 32-bit wide data 
 with 4 parity bits, used in some ps/2s and asts ), you could upgrade by 
 one simm at a time.
 
 hope that this message is not over your head, but the answer to your 
 question was not simple.  i could of just said, 'because i said so.'
