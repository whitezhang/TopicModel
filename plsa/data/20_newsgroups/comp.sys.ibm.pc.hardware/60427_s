 the adaptec 1540-series use bus mastering.  this means that the cpu
 doesn't sit waiting for data bytes, it can go off and do other
 computing - if you have an advanced multi-tasking os, that is.  dos
 just sits and waits anyway.

 why don't you start with the spec-sheet of the isa bus first? :-) ide
 was designed to plug into isa virtually unaided - in essence, ide *is*
 isa, on a ribbon cable.  therefore it's specs are the same as isa -
 8mhz clock, 16 bit width, 5mb/sec.
 
 this is why i've concluded that ide on vl-bus is a waste of a fast
 slot.  the card's job would to slow the vl-bus transactions to isa
 speed.  heck, that's what isa slots do - i'll just use one of those
 instead.

 os/2 2.0 will do for me until amigados for the 386 comes along...
