 thanks to all who responded to my original post.  i got the number for
 western digital tech support and determined that i need to upgrade the
 bios to the super bios.  it will handle hard drives with up to 16 read/
 write heads and up to 1024 cylinders.  the upgrade is $15, payable by
 check or money order.  send to:
 
 	western digital corporation
 	technical support group
 	p.o. box 19665
 	irvine, ca  92713-9665
 
 the super bios is for any wd xt hard drive controller card in the
 wd1002 series.
 
 the bios on my system would only handle up to 20mb drives.
 
 the responses to my request for help follow my .sig.  warning: it's long.

      ah, finally a question i can answer.   i mess with this older
 stuff alot.   kinda fun.  8)
 
      first problem i can forsee is that the st-251 will not be
 compadible with that wd card unless it has the right bios rom.  
 
     check the numbers on it.  it should be the only non-smt chip on
 the board.  slightly below center, and left.    the bios should read 
 either :     62-000042-015 or
              62-000094-0x2
 
      if the last 3 digits are 013, you got problems.

     looks right.   w5 and w7 are factory jumped (with a trace) between
 pins 1 and 2 to select the primary controller address.
 
 >the drive jumpers are as follows: ("8" represents jumper)
 
     looks right.

 >here are my questions:
 >
 >1.)	are the drive and controller compatible w/ each other?
 
       i notice you left out the s1 jumper table settings.   those are
 what control what drive the controller thinks it has.   if you have
 the 62-000042-015 rom, set it like this:
 
               5 + +    open
               6 + +    open             
               7 + +    open        
               8 + +    open
               4 + +    closed
               3 + +    closed
               2 + +    open
               1 + +    open
 
     note:   those are how wd runs the numbers on the jumper block.
 top to bottom.   +'s represent the jumper pins.    pins 3,4, and 8
 select the first drive setting (drive 0) and pins 1,2 and 7 select the
 second drive (drive 1).   
 
       if you have the 62-000094 rom, it's a auto-config, and i'll have
 to look up how to do it... i don't have the big book right here.
 
 >2.)	are the jumpers on the card/drive set correctly?
 
       see above.  you might have problems if the s1 jumpers are not
 right.   also,  at the risk of being insulting, make sure the cables
 are on right and good. 8).    on the jumper on the 251, try moving it
 to the opposite side of the drive.    it's one or the other.   
      the narrow data cable goes to j2.   i've thrown it on j3 a few
 times and banged my head for a day.....
 
 >3.)	is my system's bios in need of an upgrade?
 
      dunno.    ibm roms had to be later than 10/27/82.   a quick way
 to check is to boot dos and run debug.   enter:
        
         -d f000:fff5 fffc    (the - is the debug prompt)
    
     this will return the rom date, if it's of any use.
 
 >keith rice
 
       if i oversimplified any of the above, i appologize.     it's
 just hard to know what caliber of person i'm talking to. 8).

 if you are using a twisted 34-way cable then move the jumper 
 on your drive to the neighbouring pins   :8::::::.  make sure that
 the twisted cable is for a hard disk (and not a floppy disk) - the
 coloured stripe (pin 1) should be furthest from the twist.
 
 this may also help.

           when using a western digital xt controller card the system will 
           not "boot."  to solve this problem, one of the rom bios chips 
           must be disabled.  to disable the bios on your western digital  
           xt controller card, you must remove the jumper at position w-3 
           or add a jumper at position r-23 (depending on which model of xt 
           controller you are using).

           note 2:  tandy 1000 systems - the wd1002a-wx1, wd1004a-wx1, 
           wdxt-gen2 and the wd1004-27x can be modified to operate in 
           tandy 1000 series computers, models sx, tx and the original or 
           "a" version.  these computers utilize an interrupt of 2 (irq2) 
           instead of irq5, the ibm standard.  to modify the wd1002a-wx1 or 
           the wd1002-27x to operate in these systems, you must cut the 
           etch between pin 1 and pin 2 at jumper position w-7.  then 
           solder pin 2 and pin 3 at the position (w-7).  to complete the 
           modification, a jumper must be added to position 7 of switch s-1 
           (2 rows of 8 pins).  please note that any physical modification 
           to your western digital hard disk controller voids the warranty 
           on your board.  to modify the wd1004a-wx1, wdxt-gen2 or the 
           wd1004-27x for your tandy 1000 system, a zero ohm resister must 
           be soldered to jumper position w-27.  this will change the 
           interrupt from irq5 to irq2.

                 floppy disk drive that may not be supported by your at
                 system rom bios.  the optional rom bios will also allow
                 this controller card to operate high density floppy disk
                 drives in an xt system.
                 feature f004 supports four floppy disk drives and includes
                 an optional 37-pin control, data and power connector, an

      hard disk controllers for scsi hard disk drives
      
           
           7000-asc - a scsi host adapter that serves as an interface 
           between the at bus and the scsi bus.  all necessary drivers and 
           receivers are included, permitting direct cable connections to 
           the scsi bus through a 50 pin connector and to the at bus 
           through two edge connectors.  the 7000-asc utilizes jumper  
           configurable options that enable the address space, dma channels 
           and interrupt requests to be selected to suit the end user's 
           application.  the board also features word data transfer at 4 
           megabytes per second (synchronous), an on-board floppy disk 
           controller and a rom bios.  please note that the 7000-asc 
           operates using standard dos 3.2 or dos 3.3 only.

           a 50 pin external scsi bus "d" connector with a standard 50 pin 
           internal scsi cable.  the wdatxt-fasst can be used as  both a 
           target and an initiator and it serves as an excellent tool for 
           scsi designers.  it also provides a low cost alternative for end-
           users desiring to install a scsi peripheral device such as a 
           hard disk drive or a tape backup unit. the kit includes an 8-bit
