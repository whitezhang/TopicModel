 i have had a zeos for a couple months.  while the experience was not
 painless or perfect, it was way better than that endured by most (7
 people i personally know) who have ordered gateways.  (of course,
 several of the gateway buyers were rewarded by getting free stuff as
 gateway can't seem to keep track of what it has or hasn't sent
 out...b{) 
 
 i got the 1 mb viper card.  the first one was defective, but zeos
 replaced it with only minor hassles.  this one works fine.  i haven't
 noticed any problems in any of my applications.  i also ordered it
 because of all the complaints about the ati a few months ago.  guess
 you can choose either buggy state-of-the-art stuff, or robust average
 stuff.... 
 
 for my particular configuration (tower, 300 watt supply, pkg#3, no
 monitor, viper, etc.) the zeos was slightly cheaper than gateway,
 austin, etc.  but this can change from month to month.
