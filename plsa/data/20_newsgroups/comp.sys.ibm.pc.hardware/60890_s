 i was having major memory problems a few monthes ago.
 getting parity error - system halted error message in windows.
 i ran qa/plus, check it, diagnose, as well as several shareware
 memory checkers. i had a total of 8 meg simm in my system.
 these store bought/ shareware memory diagnostics either ran fine
 without errors or found an error at some address that i couldn't
 place on a memory chip. out of exahperation i came up with
 the (now deleted) steps to find bad memory chips. i found 2
 (moral : never buy memory stamped "not for sensitive or critical 
 applications" on the back.
         anyway i did filter out all the bad memory chips using 
 combinations of 4 of the 8 meg chips and creating a ram drive to
 test on. although it dodn't alleviate my parity error problems
 in windows. i did manage to find bad memory chips in this manner
 it has never failed to find a bad chip for me. and the commercial/
 shareware have always faild me either not finding the error or
 pointing to an addreww which i have no idea on what chip it is.
 
 p.s. man my typing stinks today and i don't feel like futzing around with 
 this line editor.
