 i recently purchased the then current pkg.# 486dx-33 for $2395 (but changed
 to nec 3fgx monitor upgrade). buy this pkg. #3 now - for $100 more, you now
 get a bigger hd - 340mb with @256 hd cache. 30 days ago, when i bought this
 pkg., it was 245mb with @132k hd cache. this is a great deal although it is
 generally recommended you at least upgrade to the 15' zeos (ctx) monitor for
 $99 more i believe.  whether you also upgrade to the diamond viper video
 card is your choice. i stayed with the diamond speedstar pro. zeos tech
 support is really good - call after normal business hours to get the 
 fastest access. the hardest part about buying a zeos is the wait till it is
 delivered - once you order you can hardly wait to get it! there are quite a
 few good mail order houses around - lots of bang for buck with zeos.
