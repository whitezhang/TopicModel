 
 just taken delivery of a 66mhz 486 dx2 machine, and very nice it is too.
 one query - the landmark speed when turbo is on is 230 or something mhz
 - thats not the problem. the problem is the speed when turbo is off. its
 7 mhz. the equivalent in car terms is having a nice porsche with a button
 that turns it into a skateboard.
 
 does anyone have a clue as to what determines the relative performance of
 turbo vs non-turbo?? i would like to set it to give a landmark speed of
 about 30 or 40 mhz with turbo off.
 
 cheers,
