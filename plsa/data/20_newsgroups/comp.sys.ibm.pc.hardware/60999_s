 
 does anyone know if there are any problems (or if it's possible)
 adding a third hard drive(scsi) to a dos pc.
 
 i currently have a 386 pc with  future domain scsi board  and  2
 maxtor  scsi  drives  installed.  they work great, i haven't had
 any problems!
 
 well, now i want more disk space and went out and  got   another
 (larger)  scsi   hard  disk  thinking all i had to do was add it
 to the chain(50pin ribbon  that  has  3  connectors)   and   run
 the   fdisk   program   to format/initialize the disk.
 
 that didn't happen.  when the pc boots, the  scsi  prom   shoots
 back   the  devices   that   are  attached  to  the board[target
 0/target1/target2].  all three disks are seen.
 
 when i run the dos fdisk program to format the disk, i choose to
 select another  disk(option  5(dos6)) and voila, it's not there.
 the first two disks show up no problem, but the  third  disk  is
 no-where to be found....
 
 
 
 argh!
 
 ideas anyone?????
 
 thanks in advance!
