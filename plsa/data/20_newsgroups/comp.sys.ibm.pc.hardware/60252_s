 i read sometime in the last couple of weeks, an article which desribed how to play pc sound
 through a soundblaster. i didn't save the article and all old articles have been purged from
 our system here. 
 
 would whomever posted the article detailing where to connect the wires please re-post?
 
 specifically, i need to know where to connect wires from the pc speaker to the sb card.
 
 thx in advance, carl
