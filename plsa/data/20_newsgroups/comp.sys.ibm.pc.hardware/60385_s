 the buslogic cards have an os/2 2.0 driver that does work with the march 2.1
 beta. support for the buslogic cards is not included with os/2 2.0 any longer.
 if you wish to install the beta from the cd/rom, you will need to rem out the
 adaptec device drivers, as they have a nasty tendency to crash the buslogic
 cards when os/2 attempts to use them. (thanks adaptec!) 
 
 so you add the buslogic drivers to the config.sys on the cd-rom boot disk, and
 rem out the adaptec drivers.
 
 then you install the whole 1st half of the beta.. and it won't work! ibm
 nicely copies in the adaptec drivers once again. (thanks ibm!) so.. rem out
 the adaptec drivers once more.. and reboot. if you have everything in the
 right order.. it will work.
 
 things are pretty smooth through the rest of the installation.. except os/2
 will try to install the adaptec scsi drivers once again at the end... so.. you
 are off to more rem statements and more fun. 
 
 the bt 542bk comes with drivers and costs the same as the adaptec cards that
 do not come with drivers. the dos drivers work great. this card can easily be
 configured to work with 8 different sets of i/o ports (and you can use
 multiple host adapters in one machine) if you get a new card.. it will also be
 able to support up to 8 gb drives under dos.
 
 hope this helps..
