 this isn't quite true - depending on the number of local bus slots, and
 whether or not the device is integrated into the mother board, it is
 possible to run local bus at up to 40 and 50 mhz. i've also spoken to a few 
 people who run standard local bus video cards at 50 mhz without trouble
 (and a couple of people who couldn't get a lb card to work at that speed).
