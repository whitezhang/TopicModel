 this may be a dumb question, but i need to put a hard drive on my father's
 pc/xt, either mfm, rll, or ide. i know how to hook it up, but how do i tell
 the computer the geometry of the drive. on my 386, you set it in the bios, but
 i doubt that's how it's done on an xt. i thought it might be software with
 the controller card, but the ide card for xt's that i saw didn't come with
 any. also, how do i low level format it once it's on the computer? (assuming
 a drive which needs formatting)
 
 advthanksance,
