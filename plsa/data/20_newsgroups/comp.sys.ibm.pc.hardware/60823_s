 
 
 our university is wanting to buy a couple of servers to provide email
 to students (@ 2300) and faculty (@ 250). two servers are being
 lokked at for one to provide news service and one mail service from a
 proposed internet connection. are there any foreseable problems with
 this proposed set up? provided that ihets is providing an ethernet
 line from a cisco router into our network.
 
 2 x 	486 dx 50 mhz
 	smc elite 32 or 32tp eisa  nic
 	dual duplexed 2.5gb scsi-2  
     	with 5yr parts and labor on everything but the hard drives
 	running univel unix for application servers
 
 we will run cc:mail on a campus wide novell network to access these
 <hopefully>. is there any other aspect i should be looking at?
 
 
 
 which nic do i use? 
 is this enough disk space?
 etc...
 
  
 any help would be greatly appreciated.
