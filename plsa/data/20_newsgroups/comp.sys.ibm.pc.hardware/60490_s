 
 hai,
 
 in a few days i'm going to buy a new motherboard with local-bus(ses).
 it comes with a cirrus logic vlb card which has 2mb ram onboard.
 it can do true-color but i don't know what type of card it is.
 i read that cirrus logic cards aren't exactly the fastes around.
 
 my old system had a tseng 4000. i was pretty pleased with it, so i
 consider buying a w32/tseng card. i'd like to know a few things:
 
 	- how is the speed/performance in dos/windows/unix/os/2
 	  graphics & text (also compared to s3 cards for example)
 	- what resolutions (including no. of colors) does it
 	  support (text & graphics)
 	- how many ram can be installed and what type of ram
 	- compatibility with old tseng 4000
 	- support in software
 
 if anyone has any experience with this card (good or bad) i'd like
 to know. if you have a better alternative than the w32 please tell
 me about it.
 
 
 for the people in holland:
 kan iemand me misschien vertellen waar de w32 in nederland te verkrijg
 is? het liefst in de omgeving van amsterdam!
 
 
 thanks in advance,			erik stel (estel@cs.vu.nl)
