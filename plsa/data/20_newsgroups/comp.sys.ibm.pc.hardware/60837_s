 i need info regarding a miniscribe 3.5" half-height drive. there is a
 sticker on it with the following,
     model   hda    pcba   unique   tda
     8425f   09aa   03ab   03aa     -
 but the sticker on the biggest chip on the mfm interface has this,
     model   pcba   tda
      fxx    03ab
 
 what is the spec of the drive (# of cyl, heads, etc)?
 how fast is this drive? can i use it as a rll drive? 
 i also have a scsi interface that seems to match all the connectors
 for this drive. it has this description,
     model   pcba   e-p   tda
      axx    01a    29a
 can i replace the mfm interface by the scsi interface and use the drive
 as a scsi drive? what would the drive size be? there is a set of jumpers
 on the scsi interface with "6sel" besides it. what is the use of it?
 
 could someone also send me specs for seagate st4096 (5" full-height) drive?
 my e-mail is zhang@whbws.ms.ornl.gov
 thanks
