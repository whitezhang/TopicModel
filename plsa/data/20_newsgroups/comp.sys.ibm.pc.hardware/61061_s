 seeing all these questions about uart types, their availability, and their
 relative merits, wouldn't it be fine, if for internal highspeed modems there
 were a mode of operation bypassing the dull and stupid uart interface and
 instead accessing directly the relatively large send/receive buffers of the  
 modem, thus eliminating all problems with interrupt latencies ?
 just an idea,
