 i just talked to a rep for my at&t mastercard regarding this:  there is no
 maximum claim, and you only have to notify them of the warranty when the 
 item needs repair.  if it can't be repaired, you get the amount you paid
 for it.
 curiously though, the at&t gold mastercard has a limit of $1000 on claims.
 definitely not upgrading to that card...:)
