 | 	maxtor 240mb ide hard drive

 | 486dx2-66 with isa and vlb,  or,   a 486dx-50 with eisa and no vlb (and thus

 having in mind the size of the images, my opinion is to go with vlb.
 it has _much_ more bandwith that eisa, which in fact can be utilized
 by the craphics card. (i have not made measures, so someone else may
 share experience on that.)
 
 also, the dx2/66 is faster in the operations, that run off internal
 cache, slightly slower off the external and about the same off memory.
 so my advice is the 66/vlb.

 have you tried running photostyler without the cache? no need to have
 paging and cache both. (well, you might argue, that the paging is
 cached). my belief (no measurements) is that apps left with more
 memory will manage it better than smartdrv.exe(sys).

 | transfer rates to 160k/sec - still very slow (especially when moving large 
 | images).  is there such a thing as a local-bus ethernet card coming??  will it
 | make a difference?  i'm hoping so, and leaning towards the 486dx2-66 choice 
 | (above), for that reason.
 
 the bandwidth (theoretical) of isa is over 5mb/s, which is far from
 0.15mb/s. i tried my isa ide hard drive (maxtor 213mb) and got the
 same results - 0.65mb/s - regardless of the isa bus speed
 (5.5-8.25mhz). so i guess, that just the card/drivers combination is
 lousy.
 
 | also, are there dx2-100's on the horizon?  what about dx3-99's?  dx3-150's ???!
 
 the rumors are that dx3-99 (if any) is the most likely chip to come
 out. but note, that ibm is closest to the technology an it will only
 sell whole motherboards, so you'll have to upgrade the mb.
 
 | any information is greatly appreciated.
 
 just some view, not much figures.
