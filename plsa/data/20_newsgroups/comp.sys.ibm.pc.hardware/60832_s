 does anybody have a data-sheet handly for the above-mentioned card?  i
 bought one, sans manual at a local surplus shop, and want to try it out
 with the crywyr packet driver suite.  
 
 the irq and interface-select jumpers are pretty straightforward, but i
 don't grok the settings of w10-w18 (also labelled a15 through a18).
 could somebody tell me which settings of these four jumpers correspond
 to what i/o addresses?
 
 is there anything else about this card i should know, before i
 plug&play?
