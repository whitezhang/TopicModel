 i have a maxtor 212mb on an isa ide controller, although my machine is
 dx2/66 vlb. i has the save transfer rate of 0.647 mb/s regardless of
 the variations of the isa bus speed. i tested it with speed between
 5.5mhz and 8.33mhz. not _any_ difference. the problem is not the
 interface between the controller and the memory.
 
 my advice: buy 4megs of ram, save $70 and enjoy performance.
