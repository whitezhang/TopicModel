 ok, here's my results so far....
 
 1: you have to define the monitor as lcd - it doesn't really support
    analogue video input (it works, but isn't very linear...)
 
 2: the incoming sync pulses need inverting. this is best achieved
    with either a cmos xor package or a transistor inverter.
    if you don't know how to do it, don't even contemplate it.. :-)
 
 3: it'll only work in standard vga mode.
 
 ok, having said that, i'm trying to either find a circuit or ic
 which will act as a universal sync decoder.
 
 i want somethikng which basically only detects the leading sync
 pulse edge, and doesn't care about the polarity, outputting
 the -ve going pulses that the atari monitor requires.
 
 there are 2 reasons for doing this
 
 1: vga cards change their sync polarity depending which mode they're
    in - herc emulation is +,- while mvga is +,+ for example.
 
 2: it means i don't have to put a toggle switch on the back of the
    monitor in order to be able to run it off both the atari and my
    ibm. currently i have 3 (yes, 3!) monitors sitting on my desk,
    and i want to get that number down as much as possible.
    being able to use the atari monitor as a paper-white vga
    will cut things down to 2. if i forget about atari colour,
    i can get down to 1.
 
 ultimately, the best course of action is to get a multisync monitor,
 but i'm as pressed for cash as anyone else, so it'll have to wait...
