 as an earlier post noted - through dma.

 any one time means imho a single byte xfer. if i have four sources of
 dma requests ready, the dma would service the one after the other. if
 the bandwidth for the four together is lower than the isa/dma
 bandwidth, this will work.
 
 note that the bus mastering here is the priority mechanism in the dma
 controller.
