 
 i have a gateway 4dx-33v with my 3.5 inch floppy as drive a.  i
 accidentally discovered that if a have a floppy from one particular
 box of diskettets in the a drive when i boot up, rather than getting
 the "non-system diskette" message, the machine hangs and the cmos
 gets overwritten (luckily, gateway sends a print of the standard
 cmos settings with their systems).  this only happens with a box
 of pre-formatted fuji disks that i have, no other disks cause this
 problem.  if i re-format one of the fuji disks, the problem goes away.
 i did a virus scan (scan v1.02) of the disks and found nothing.
 
 anyone have any idea what is going on here?  hardware problem?  a
 virus that can't be detected?  the system reading in garbage from
 the boot sector?
