 
 h e l p !
 
 i have  a problem in which i'm getting increasing frustrated every day...
 
 some background about my pc:
 
 - american megatrend bios (clone 386 sx) with 32m of ram
 - config.sys file:
 
 	device=c:\dos\himem.sys
 	dos=high,umb
 	device=c:\windows\emm386.exe noems
 	files=30
 	buffers=30
 	stack=9,256
 
 - autoexec.bat file is using smartdrv.exe +c
 - cmos set up is running 0 wait state on read and write cache ram.
 
 the problem: application error from win31
 
 i started off with a newly installed win31 and then installed excel.
 run excel, no problem. a permanent swap file of size 18k was in place
 for windows.
 
 ok, i then proceed to install norton desktop
 for windows version 2.0. no problem with the installation. i also
 allow ndw to alter my autoexec.bat(with the nav running on c:).
 the problem came when i try to (bring up excel or if excel is running
 and right in the middle of it - like click a selection with the mouse)
 from the desktop.
 first of all, i always get the application error screen followed by
 another application error screen with various different messages. the
 following are some of them:
 
 - stack fault, by tc1024.drv at address 0001:xxxx where xxxx is some
   number. (tc1024.drv is the vga driver provided by the manufacture)
 - general protection fault, by ndw.exe at the same address
 - segment load failure, by ndw.exe at same address
 
 some how, the address flagged was always 0001:something. what is address
 0001:xxxx means? 
 
 i have absolutely on idea what this mean. i tried commented out the
 tsr programs from autoexec.bat, no help.
 
 is it something to do with the emm386 setup which is not telling
 win31 what it suppose to know. looks like the application is crossing
 memory boundary when it is being loaded or while it is running.
 
 please reply if you have any idea or suggestion. i'm willing to try
 anything.
