 hi,
 vlb is defined for 3 cards by 33mhz
 and 2 cards by 40mhz
 
 there are designs with 50mhz and 2 vlb-slots.
 (s. c't 9.92, 10.92, 11.92)
 
 50mhz and 2 slots are realy difficult to design.
 
 better oss (os/2 & ix) are able to handle more than 16mb of dram,
 if you use eisa-bus.
 has someone experience with vlb ??
 i think of scsi-vlb-busmaster. the problem is the 16bit floppy dma
 controller, which is unable to reach more than 16mb.
