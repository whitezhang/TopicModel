 am amazed at the number of harley riders who are waving even to a lowly
 baby ninja.  let's keep up the good attitudes.  brock yates said in this
 months car and driver he is ready for a war (against those who would rather
 we all rode busses).  we bikers should be too.
 
 it's a freedom that we all wanna know
 and it's an obsession to some
 to keep the world in your rearview mirror
 while you try to run down the sun
