 being a mere female, i have often found i can't really take the big offensive line with asshole car drivers, so i found a more subtle and nastly
 ooops i mean nasty way to get back at them. if somebody cuts you up, just wait till they have pulled out past you, and then gently lean over and
 bend their aerial, every time i have done that it has eventually snapped
 off near the base - which tends to go undetected for a while and is a bummer to replace.
