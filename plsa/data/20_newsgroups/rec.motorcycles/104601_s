 an effort was made to remove the sticker.  it came to pieces, leaving
 most of it firmly attached to the window.  it was dark, and around
 10:00 pm.  the sticker (before being mangled in an ineffective attempt
 to be torn off) warned the car would be towed if not removed.  a
 "reasonable person" would arguably have driven the car.  had an
 accident occured, i don't think my friend's attorney would have much
 trouble fixing blame on the apartment mangement.
 
 as a practical matter, even without a conviction, the cost and
 inconvenience of defending against the suit would be considerable.
 
 as a moral matter, it was a pretty fucking stupid thing to do for so
 paltry a violation as parking without an authorization sticker (btw, it
 wasn't "somebody's" spot, it was resident-only, but unassigned,
 parking).
