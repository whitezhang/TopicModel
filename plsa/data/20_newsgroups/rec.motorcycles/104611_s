 if he's not, i will.  put two riders on identical machines.  it's the
 one who knows what he's doing, and why, that will be faster.  it *may*
 be possible to improve your technique if you have no idea what it is,
 through trial and error, but it is not very effective methodology.
 only by understanding the technique of steering a motorcycle can one
 improve on that technique (i hold that this applies to any human
 endeavor).

 do you consider an understanding of the physics of traction absurd?
 are you seriously suggesting that one can form a traction management
 policy without understanding what it is or what factors increase or
 decrease available traction?  braking?
 
 it is highly unlikely that any biker is going to develop his maximum
 swerving ability without any knowledge of turning techniques.  for most
 of his riding life this may not be a problem, but in an emergency
 situation it is very definately placing him at a disadvantage.

 i disagree.  the existance and immense success of riding courses which
 teach the technique indicate that the concept can be taught in a manner
 that is neither confusing, nor detracts from any other aspects of the
 course.
 
 >and that was my original point.
 
 perhaps, but in the ensuing discussion, you strayed far from that
 point, to claim that knowledge of steering technique is irrelevant to a
 rider's ability.  i find this assertion ludicrous.
