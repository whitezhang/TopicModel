 some will, and others will steer with their tuchuses. i don't know how much
 the teaching of countersteering in the beginner course really helps the
 tuchus steerers. i was one, i guess that i always steered a bicycle that way,
 and i only got the hang of countersteering in normal riding *after* the course.
 i could do the countersteering swerves in the course no problem, but i only
 started using it in my normal riding when i decided that my turning at speed
 (off-ramps and the like) was a lot more difficult that it should have been.
 i knew how it works (although that's currently up for debate) definitely knew
 *that* it works, as i could do it in swerves, but only figured it out later
 in my normal riding. just a data point. i think that it's not a bad idea to
 bring the idea up, but it's best to let everyone tuchus-steer for the first
 lesson or two, so they can learn to shift gears before they have to worry
 about proper handlebar technique.

 i have. in our beginner course we had passenger training. sometime during
 the lesson the instructor would hop on the back of the bike, and the student
 would take him for a ride. if the student did not give the instructor the
 "you are a sack of potatoes" passenger speech, the instructor would steer
 the bike and make a general nuisance of himself. it was amusing to watch,
 i'm just happy that it didn't happen to me.
