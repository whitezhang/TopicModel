 no... you can do this? really? the other morning i went to do a lane change
 on the freeway and looked in my mirror, theer was a car there, but far
 enough behind. i looked again about 3-5 seconds later, car still in same
 position, i.e. not accelerating. i triple check with a head turn and decide
 i have plenty of room, so i do it, accelerating. i travel about 1/4 mile
 staying ~200
 feet off teh bumper of the car ahead, and i do a casual mirror check. this
 guy is right on my tail, i mean you couldn't stick a hair between my tire &
 his fender. i keep looking in the mirror at him a,d slowly let off teh
 throttle. he stays there until i had lost about 15mph and then comes around
 me and cuts me off big time. i follow him for about 10 miles and finally
 get bored and turn back into work. 
 
 i can file a complaint about this? and actually have the chance to have
 something done? how? who? where?
