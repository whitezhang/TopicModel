    my rule of thumb is "don't give rides to people that wear
 a bigger helmet than you", unless your taste runs that way,
 or they are family.friends.
 gee,  reminds me of a *dancer* in hull, just over the river 
 from ottowa, that i saw a few years ago, for her i would a
 bought a bigger helmet (or even her own bike) or anything 
 else she wanted ;->
