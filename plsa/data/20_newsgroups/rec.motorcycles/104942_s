 so let's see what we have on the batdude so far: he has a weird helmet.
 he drags his knee in corners (thanks, cookson, but how does he do it?
 hidden bat-pucks?), and he only takes the bike out in the snow or rain.
 also, he lets robin ride! i think i could have used a bat-mom. would
 have made getting my license a lot easier!
 
 there's a trend here: stylish helmet, stylish knee-dragging, rides only
 in stylish cartoon precipitation. hmm . . . could it be that we're
 dealing with a veritable airborne mammalian poseur? dare i say it, a
 bat-squid?? (huh? bat-squid?) it all adds up now . . .
 
 let's make the b-man an honorary dod dude. all he needs is a dod
 sticker.
 
 actually, anyone have an address for batman's current artists, both
 comic book and animated series? we'll write and ask if batman would like
 to become an honorary denizen! yeah!
 
 special to the kotl: is there a precedent for inducting an imaginary
 member with an imaginary motorcycle? having seen the computers in the
 bat-cave, i think we can safely assume that he also has imaginary
 internet access.
