 okay, here's what to do.   get a drill and a sanding disk. use, say a 
 100 disk and go at it at a very low rpm.  if you don't have a drill, try
 coarse steel wool and brake fluid.  dot 4 has an uncanny knack for removing
 _any_ paint imperfections.
 
 oh, i'm not responsible for misuse or miapplication of either of these
 techniques.
