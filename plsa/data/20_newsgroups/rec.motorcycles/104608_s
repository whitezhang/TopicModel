 one day out riding, my friend and i were passing a field of goats and
 noticed 2 out on the road. as we slowed to pass the ram made a dash at 
 my friend just missing him and then tangling it self up in the barb wire
 fence. being good samaritains and generally nice guys we turned around to 
 untrangle the goat from the barbed wire. as i pulled up next to him
 (seeing him still tangled up), stopped the bike and got off the goat had
 vanished (into the field i guess).
