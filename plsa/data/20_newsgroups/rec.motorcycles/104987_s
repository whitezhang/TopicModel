    i know the roads up there in minnesota are pretty bad, but i doubt that
 they are that bad.  i've never realy tried to watch my back tyre but, my 82
 maxim 750 will pull the front wheel off the ground if i pop the clutch.
 admittedly, it is easier with someone on back, maybe that's what keeps the
 rear tyre down.  ;-)
