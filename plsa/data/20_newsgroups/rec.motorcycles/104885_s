 because i'm a guy and most of my pillions are female. 
 
 also, the other reasons, like having an idea where you passengers
 weight is, it being a more comfortable position for the passenger,
 and it being a more stable configuration all come into it as well.
 
 holding the grab rail is a great idea only for braking, when you
 don't want the pillion to slide forward into you, otherwise i don't
 find it works well.
