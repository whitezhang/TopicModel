 i've seen solar battery boosters, and they seem to come without any
 guarantee. on the other hand, i've heard that some people use them
 with success, although i have yet to communicate directly with such a
 person. have you tried one? what was your experience? how did you use
 it (occasional charging, long-term leave-it-for-weeks, etc.)?
