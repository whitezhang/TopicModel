  you know, i wasn't even going to respond to this typical anti-party
 attitude message. trash was everywhere - reason? not enough dipsy
 dumpsters for the massive crowd. oatman wasn't prepared for the vast
 number of people that showed up.
  btw michael, oatman is the right place & time. it's called a run! maybe
 you didn't read my comment that "they loved us" and i'm talking about the
 merchants and townspeople. the merchants that didn't want us - their shops
 were closed.
   maybe i should have mentioned that when i left - the trash was being
 picked up (aluminum sells) by a crew assigned to the task.
   i think the bottom line here is do they want us back ???!!! they do!
 this 'action' that went on at oatman is typical on a predominatly harley
 run. it's innocent fun.
   so since i enjoy typical harley fun at runs - in your eyes that makes me
 an asshole. i've already admitted i'm an asshole many times on the net.
 all my friends are assholes too (lyrics to a new song?). so, you want a
 dime to call someone that cares?
   it appears we have a difference of opinion. maybe you should look at the
 big picture before you pass judgement on others. 11th annual. that should
 tell you something.
