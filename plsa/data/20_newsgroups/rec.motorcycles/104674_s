 
 i am looking at buying a dual sport type motorcycle. this is my first
 cycle as well. i am interested in any experiences people have with
 the following motorcycles, good or bad.
 
 	honda xr250l
 	suzuki dr350s
 	suzuki dr250es
 	yamaha xt350
 
 most xxx vs. yyy articles i have seen in magazines pit the honda xr650l 
 against another cycle, and the 650 always comes out shining. is it safe
 to assume that the 250 would be of equal quality ?
 
 thanks... joe
