 is (was? :-( ) your hg zipper the nylon-coil type or the kind with
 molded plastic teeth? i've only tried it on the coiled nylon type, and
 it doesn't take much squish to fix the problem. i found i was overdoing
 it (no broken parts, but the zipper was too hard to pull) so after
 spreading the zipper pull jaws again, i tried with vice-grips. no, not
 the usual grip of death technique, i adjusted the closed vice-grips so
 they were snug on the zipper jaws, then released them and tightened the
 adjusting screw a bit. a couple of iterations and i had just the right
 amount of zipper squish (tm).

 i've had two zipper pulls fail on my aerostich suit (actually on the
 accessory ellipse), and they sent me a few replacement pulls free of
 charge. i don't know what brand of zippers hg uses, but parts are
 available for ykk's plastic zippers. replacement was pretty simple, just
 break and remove the plastic knob at the top of the zipper that keeps
 the pull from coming off the top end. slide on the new zipper pull. then
 crimp on (vice-grips again!) a replacement zipper stop.
 
 you might try fabric stores & such and see if they sell replacement
 parts.
 
 oh, for what it's worth, the coil-type zippers on the eclipse tankbag
 are also ykk.
