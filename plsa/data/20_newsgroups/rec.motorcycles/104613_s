 now the bike is off warranty, i finally replaced the stock items on my
 softail custom with the title ones. installation was pretty easy in
 both cases, even for a fairly non-mechanical chemist type dude like me!
  i discovered the limitations of my tool collection, but had fun buying
 and making the requisite tools!
 
 mc ignitions power arc ii single fire ignition: easy to install, but
 read the wiring diagram carefully!  setting the static timing was a
 piece of cake.  once installed, i have found easier starting, smoother
 idle, and more power, plus a more satisfying (to me) bass note in the
 exhaust register...a lovely whompa-whompa-whompa idle  :-)
 the folks at mc ignitions were great in answering my dumb questions on
 the phone..... a very helpful bunch of guys with a great product.
 
 s&s super e carb: installation easy, once i hacked down an allen wrench
 to a small anough reach to get at the intake manifold bolts. tunes like
 a dream, just like they say!  the stock carb (non-adjustable) was so
 lean that it was gasping and spluttering for gas sometimes, and even
 backfiring into the intake manifold. the super e is terrific, no
 hesitation in any gear, and my plugs are a lovely tan color with no
 need to rejet from the factory settings!
 
 i know this may not seem like much to you grizzled veteran wrenchers
 out there, but i had my bike in so many pieces this weekend i began to
 get worried. but it all went back together again, and runs like a
 dream, so i am feeling pretty happy.
 
 now all i have to do is install my bub pipes and try to pass the nh
 noise gestapo test!
