 oh, lord.  this is where i came in.
 
 obcountersteer:  for some reason, i've discovered that pulling on the
 wrong side of the handlebars (rather than pushing on the other wrong
 side, if you get my meaning) provides a feeling of greater control.  for
 example, rather than pushing on the right side to lean right to turn 
 right (hi, lonny!), pulling on the left side at least until i get leaned
 over to the right feels more secure and less counter-intuitive.  maybe
 i need psychological help.
 
 obcountersteer v2.0:anyone else find it ironic that in the weekend-and-a-
 night msf class, they don't mention countersteering until after the
 first day of riding?
