 after failing my state of new hampshire noise gestapo test with my hd
 slash cut pipes i installed my new bubs (which i had been planning to
 do anyway), went to a different in spection station, and passed with no
 problem at about 97 db.
 
 two points:
 
 first, i don't think the first dude did the noise test correctly. 
 holding the meter close to his body probably caused a high reading, and
 doing it inside the garage with the door closed undoubtedly enhanced
 the db level! so if any other nh riders need to get this done, make
 sure the inspection is done outdoors with the meter held well away from
 the body.
 
 second, these bub pipes are bloody terrific. at low revs or cruising
 through town, they as quiet as the stock pipes, but have a sound thats
 a more throaty, purring, rumble.  when you open her up to >3000 rpm
 they emit a wonderfully satisfying rumbling roar. best of both worlds!
