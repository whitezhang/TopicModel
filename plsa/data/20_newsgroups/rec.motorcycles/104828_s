 hi.
 
 i'm not sure what the other guy (can't track down his post for his name)
 was talking about when he made the claim that cobralinks are not adjustable.
 they are.  there's a space between each link where the "teeth" of the 
 locking head notch in.  thus, each link is a possible locking point.
 
 also, (and this is not applicable to hard-core thieves who cart around
 liquid nitrogen and oxy-acetylene torches) the cobralinks "look" a lot
 more effective than kryptonite cable locks (imho) and i think the initial
 appearance effect is more relevant to bored-joyriders-nominally-adept-at-
 cracking-unsecured-bike deterrence, as long as the lock is nominally 
 functional.
 
 finally, i notice that when i ride with my leathers, harness boots, and
 the cobralinks slung across like a bandolier (btw, i've crashed in the rain
 dressed like this and the lock didn't pulverize any vertebrae), cagers give
 me a much wider berth, don't hassle me, and tend to avoid any potentially
 inflammatory action at stoplights.
 
 i love my cobralinks almost as much as i love my pre-80's honda dinosaur.
 (i think i have a pavlovian drool reflex-i put the lock on (i.e., on my
 body) and i can feel the bike already shaking away).
 
 my first post.  what did i do wrong :)?
