 i don't know about the dinky little zephyr's, but the 1100 (now
 the zr1100) looks alot like my '76 z1/ kz900!  the one i drooled over
 at tri-sports in topsham, me was a looker!
 
 yes, mercury axed the zephyr name.  guess a lot of aging republicans
 wanted a zephyr and confused the mercury with the kawasaki :).  oh
 well, they're better off with the kawasaki anyways.  maybe it'll shake the
 stick out of their asses and  make libertarians out of them!
 
 as to the gpz <--> zephyr, the only gpz i've seen had the ball-buster
 gas tank profile, not the smooth saddle - to - gas tank transition.
 _motorcyclist_ claims the zephyr / zr is the modernized z1 (kz) from the
 seventies.
