 hi
 
 i t was very nice out yesterday in the 'burgh, so i rode my bike
 to my gynecologist appointment. when he came in to do the exam,
 he noticed my helmet sitting on a chair. he got excited and picked it up 
 and started asking all sorts of questions about bikes and dealers in the 
 area and the msf course. apparently he rode a friends 125 for a
 while years ago and recently the bug to ride caught him again.
 
 needless to say, i had never before talked about bikes so much in
 such a position, if ya know what i mean :->
