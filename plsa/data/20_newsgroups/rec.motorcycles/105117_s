 apparently the instinct to brake in the face of danger isn't as strong 
 as the instinct to freeze up and do nothing in the face of danger.  hurt
 found that a surprising number of accident-involved motorcyclists hadn't
 used their brakes at all prior to impact.  
 
 i think the only way you'll ever use countersteering reliably and correctly in 
 a crisis is to make it the only conscious method of directional control you
 ever use, and to practice it constantly, even when you have no need to do
 any turning.  if you follow me down a long straight, and i seem to be 
 wiggling back and forth randomly or suddenly without obvious need, it's because
 i'm practicing countersteering and avoiding imaginary obstacles directly in
 my path.  all of this practice may indeed be futile, but if i have even
 milliseconds to react, the most *familiar* tactic available (and hopefully 
 the most automatic) will be countersteering.  the same logic applies to braking
 with the front brake, of course.
