 being related to former trainers, i have come to know that humans do have all the
 advantages (well, at least one anyway). it is a little known fact that a dog will
 involuntarily regurgitate and release an object that is too large to swallow. i
 was told that if i were ever attacked by a dog i should ball my hand in a fist and
 force it down the dog's throat. the dog would naturally gag and release, and become
 momentarily disoriented. this commonly happens to humans when we go to a doctor and
 have our throats examined ( proof positive ). in the time during the dog's
 disorientation, the next move would be to wrap an arm about the dog throat in a 
 choke hold manner and constrict with all your might until the dog lapses into
 unconsciousness ( from lack of oxygen and halting blood flow ). finally, run like
 the wind to get away from the local area should the dog get up again and be really
 pissed.
 
 ooooooopsssss. for a second there i thought i was in rec.beatthelivingcrapoutofadog
 and not rec.motorcycles.
 
 till next time.
