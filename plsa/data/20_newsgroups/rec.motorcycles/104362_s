 my driveway and about half my neighbor's driveways are long enough to
 do a good 80 clicks (50mph for the velocity impaired) if we wanted to.
 granted, i live in the country, however i've seen neighbors whip out
 of their driveways at the above mentioned 30 mph quite a bit- they
 claim they can tell that "there's noone on the road for quite a ways."
 this despite having nearly been hit myself by one of them while driving
 a chev 4x4, and twice taking my 10-speed bicycle over the hood of a
 car that had pulled out, saw me, *then* stopped.  same driver.  same car.
 about two months apart.  
 
 obmoto:  the scary relevant part is that these people and i live on the type
 of twisty two lane that we all favor for riding- and i know damn well
 that they can't see me on my bike, not if they couldn't see me in 
 my pickup.

 	there's nothing like the pitter-patter of little feet,
 	followed by the words "hey- you're not my daddy!"
