 mark,
 
   47k is not too many miles on a vfr750.  i sold my (well maintained)
 '87 vfr700 with 52k miles on it and the engine was in mint condition.
 all that the bike needed was steering head bearings and fork bushings
 and seals.  the guy who bought it had a mechanic pull the valve covers
 to look at the top end, do a compression check etc.  he confirmed it was
 mint.
 
    as for price, $4500 seems a little steep.  i bought my '90 with 12k
 miles on it a year ago (and in absolutely cherry condition) for $4800.
 there is a bluebook, ask your bank or credit union for the going price.
 i've seen a couple of ads for vfr's in the $4500 dollar range.  they all
 said low miles & mint condition but i didn't actually go look at them.
 
    a vfr is a very sweet bike and will last you forever if you maintain
 it at all.  one thing to look for, btw, is a soft front end.  if my
 vfr is any indication, at 12k miles the fork springs were totally shot.
 progressive springs ($55) fixed it right up.
 
 good luck,
