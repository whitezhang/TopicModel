 "teflon" is a dupont-owned tradename for ptfe.  slick-50 does
 indeed use dupont teflon, though some other brands of such
 stuff may use imported ptfe of another brand.
 
 "teflon", being a trade-name, should always by capitalized.
 
 (dupont disclaims any benefits of ptfe in the oil supply of internal 
 combustion engines, btw.)
