 only buy what you need.  it would cost a lot to buy a full set, and
 you won't ever use most of them.  i have had good luck with the
 calculation method.  i have never had to change more than one size
 increment at a time (i never needed a change larger than the next
 size up/down, usually down).  they cost a few $ each for a yamaha.
