 i can't help myself.
 i've tried to be rational, 
 to look the other way,
 but everytime it happens, 
 its uncontrollable.
 
 i hate pre'80s motorcycles.
 
 at first i thought it was a phase.  i though i would
 get used to them.  it didn't happen.  i tried gazing
 at cb750s and 900 customs, but each time i sadistically
 pictured them being hurled off of large precipice
 (i also picture a swarm of german tourists cheering and
 taking holiday snaps, but i can't figure that part out).
 
 what am i to do?  everytime i read a .sig containing 
 some spoked wheel wonder, i shudder and feel pity that
 the poor soul has suffered enough.  i imagine the owner
 scrapping out his (or her) living in a discarded maytag
 refridgerator box, tucked in next to their cx500.
 
 i'm hoping for some deliverance.  i had in the past loathed
 the milwaukee machine, but i can actually begin to understand
 some of the preaching.  there must be hope.
