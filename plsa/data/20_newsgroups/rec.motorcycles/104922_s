 automatic revocation of your license for a year.  i'm not sure it's the
 "toughtest" law around, but nc has absolutely no sense of humor with
 respect to driving laws, anyway.  i think they put you in jail and sell
 your first child into slavery for passing a school bus...
 
 a bill breezed through the nc house to lower the intoxification level
 from .1 to .08.  it faces stiff opposition in the senate.  recently,
 the highway patrol took a few of the opposition senators out and gave
 them some shots, and when they hit .07, put them on a course dodging
 cones.  they failed, and will probably change their votes as a result.
 
 for some bizarre reason, nc is the only state where the governer has no
 veto power over legislation coming out of the state congress, so his
 opinion on the matter is moot.
