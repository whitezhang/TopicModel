 yesss!  you make me proud to
 be an 'merkun.  good thing you
 didn't get shot though. don't
 try that with a good'ole boy in texas.
 i once had a jeep driver south of conroe cut me off (i was 
 in my car) after i had flipped him off for doing something really idiotic
 and senseless.  all 280 lbs of him stretches out of his jeep; he walks
 back (he is blocking all traffic between dallas and houston since the
 freeway has been squeezed into a single lane) and says to me, "stick that
 finger out again and i'll rip it off your hand and shove it down your
 sorry-ass throat."  i stared straight ahead, unblinking.  a hundred
 cars were honking.  eventually he got back into his jeep, face beet-red
 with anger, and all the rest of the way back to houston i tailed him, 
 waving, honking, flipping him off, yelling...  i'm glad he decided 
 not to shoot me.
