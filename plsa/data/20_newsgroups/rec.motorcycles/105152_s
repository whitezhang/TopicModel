 this summer i'm going to use my vacation drivin (riding)
 through the states.
 and i do have some questions that i would like to post here::
 since i'm from norway i was wondering
 how much does it cost to rent a bike in the states?
 
 (i'm probarly going to the san fransisco/san jose area
 the ride around (i'think))
 
 as you might have noticed i still haven't made any plans
 so if you know about places i ought to visit 
 please e-mail me...

 since i hurt my pendulum
 my life is all erratic.
 my parrot, who was cordinal,
 is now transmitting static.
 the carpet died, a palm collapsed
 the cat keeps doing poo.
 the only thing that keeps me sane
 is talking to my shoe.
            -- my shoe.
