 ok, as one last attempt, i'll take a different tack.
 
 we all seem to be in agreement that there are two explanations for why
 one can use the handlebars to lean a moving motorcycle. the question is,
 is one of the effect dominant, and which one is it? the idea would be to
 design an experiment which would seaprate the two characteristics, and
 see which effect produces a similar result to the one with which those of
 us who have bikes are familiar.
 
 let's look at the one that, so far, has sparked no controversy on its
 own, gyroscopic precession. to examine this alone, we would have to
 get rid of the contact patch effect, by not allowing the contact patches
 to transmit any force. the wheels and steering mechanism would have to
 remain, and be attached to a vehicle with about the same weight as a bike,
 through suspension (so that the wheels transmit forces to the bike the
 same way) similar to a bikes. an experiment would be to ride a bike along 
 a dry road to get moving and to get the wheels spinning, then change 
 surfaces to something that won't transmit forces through the contact 
 patches, and try a steering manoeuvre to see if the bike leans. it 
 probably would, since some of us know how easy it is to fall down on ice, 
 but we wouldn't get a good idea of how well or what it feels like 
 because, without the contact patches, we can't turn.  maybe there's a 
 better way. besides, even ice doesn't get rid of the contact patch
 forces altogether, so we'd have to find a really frictionless surface.
 you'd have to try it again with the wheels locked to really know if it
 was the rotation that did it.
 
 looking at the contact-patch effect only, however, is fairly simple.
 now we have to find a vehicle that gets the about the same magnitude and
 direction of cantact patch forces as a motorcycle, and transmits them
 about the same way to the vehicle, but without rotating wheels.
 how it gets the contact patch forces is irrelevant, we're just looking
 for something that has contact patches that can go straight and not
 sideways, and skis or skates would do fine. i don't know of any snow-ski
 or skate bikes, but up here we have the suzuki wetbike that is arranged
 like a motorcycle but has fat water skis where there should be wheels.
 i think the propellor is in front of the rear ski, or something like
 that, but we could try it at a coast to get rid of most of its effect.
 now i admit that this is second hand info (although i'd love to try
 one of these), but the review in the local cycle rag and a guy in
 a bike shop that sells them both say that this machine handles very
 much like a motorcycle, in that you countersteer it to turn.
 so we have contact patches that transmit similar forces to a bike's,
 a similar suspension arrangement, and no gyroscopes, but we do have
 countersteering.
 
 conclusion: you don't need gyroscopes to countersteer vehicles that have
 motorcycle-like contact patch arrangements. we still don't know what
 real effect the gyroscopes have when they're there, but from my observations
 of how handlebar angle, force, etc. relate to steering in general, i'm 
 willing to bet that they're not the dominant factor in countersteering. 
 
 if you don't like this conclusion, then don't accept it, but my motorcycle's
 behaviour is consistent with it. if someone can prove otherwise, go ahead.
