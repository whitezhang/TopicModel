 
 insurance companies sure seem to go for no-fault coverage.  since the
 majority of accidents are the cagers' fault, doesn't this imply that we
 would have to pay much higher rates under a no-fault system?
 
 with a cars-only system, it seems to make sense on the surface: take the
 legal costs out of the system.  but it looks like motorcyclists would
 get screwed.
