 ok -- so we've got a hotly contested bmwoa election and some inept 
 leadership.
 
 my question is the history of the bmw organization that lead to the
 formation of the bmwra. was there something going on in the oa years
 ago that precipitated the formation of two competing owner's groups?
 
 just to stave off flames: i'm a (relatively new) member of both groups
 and besides a difference in the slickness of the magazines, it seems
 the major difference is that the ra guys seem to have more fun. . .
