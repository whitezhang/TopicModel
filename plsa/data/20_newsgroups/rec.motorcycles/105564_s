 i second the commend from dr. speed, get a new tire.  it's like your
 brakes, something you don't want to take chances with.  i waited too long
 to take care of my front tire once and it went flat on me, doing 70 mph
 going down the grapevine towards bakersfield.  at that instance, i would
 of given any amount of money for a new tire.  i'm lucky to be here.
