 aw, c'mon.  the serious overreaction ought to be worth a couple of points,
 not to mention the bit condemning everthing the flamee might ever say.
 the non sequitur about guns and helmets is just the proper flourish.
 
 i personally am of the opinion that there are two types of good flames.
 the first does trade ``quality,'' in the sense you mention, for heat.
 this has a certain surprise value and if done correctly, which i
 contend was done above, is reasonably entertaining.  while it is true that
 the flame i posted does not mention anyone's habitual velocity, friends,
 dinner, or entertainment, it says what it needs to with the appropriate
 flair and it is short.  the weakness of this type of flame is actually
 that it can easily be taken too far, at which point it becomes trite and
 boring.  (witness the infante thread recently....)
 
 the other type of flame, which you seem to be glorifying above, has
 a few weaknesses as well.  in the first place, it can get verbose and 
 tedious in the extreme, particularly if the reader does not already strongly
 identify with one side or the other.  in the second, discussing someone's
 personal qualities, habits, and so forth can quickly become libelous.
 (or is that slanderous?  i can never remember the difference.)  this leads
 to a proliferation of lawyers, which is widely regarded as a bad thing.
 finally, introducing polysyllabic words is problematic.  i can't haul my
 big dic. around on my bike, and it would be bad form to use a word which
 actually turned out to have a meaning, especially one which ran counter
 to my use and flamage in general.
 
 in summary, blaine, your score for that flame is incorrect.  while it may
 be the wunder-flame, the weaknesses you point out are not necessarily
 weaknesses, and your suggested corrections are not always useful nor
 applicable.  you also probably couldn't outrun a tennis ball with a
 flatulent dog stapled to your posterior, and i'll bet you and your 
 motorcycle lean to the outside while turning.  the same goes for anyone
 who looks like you, too.
