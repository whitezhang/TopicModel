 	don't just nab it, pounce on it.  these are fairly rare bikes, and
 they are more than adequate for putting a big brown stripe in your shorts.
 does a 50mph power wheelie appeal to you?  i thought it would...
 
 	only really bad things:  the stock clutch isn't up to the task.
 barnett can take care of this.  the back tire wears quickly (gee, wonder why?),
 and the induction system is a bear to work on.
