 hi boys and girls.  i just bought a beemer r80gs and realized abruptly that 
 i am a grad student.  i first sold my truck yesterday but i need to sell my 
 zephyr too.
 
 if i can sell it this month, great ... insurance and tags both run out in
 a couple of weeks.  otherwise i'll tag and insure it and see what happens.
 
 it's a very sweet bike.  6100 miles, almost all highway (az-wy-co last summer,
 plus some great rides between here and the border.  purchased new exactly
 one year ago (apr '92), it's a '90 model.  it has a good fairing and a
 luggage rack.  red; very clean.  perfect maintenance, no bullshit.   i'll spare
 any further details other than to say (1) i want to keep it, and (2) somebody
 5'7" +/- 5" will fit it like a charm.  not a bike for big people, but not a
 small bike.  standard, upright positioning and good-looking.  smooth power,
 great brakes, good karma.
