    i'm having the roughest time getting a company to cover
 my new bike.  here are some details about her and me:
 
 i'm:
 
   single
   23
   riding with a clean record
   a homeowner
   a 'new' rider accoring to most companies
   not a member of msf or ama yet  
 
 
 
    she's:
  
    a '92 cbr600f2
    got 150 miles
    got temp plates still
    one screamin' bitch of a ride...
 
 
    can you get me some ideas?  we can take them to private
 email to lower the noise on the net.
 
    mrr3@po.cwru.edu is a good mail address.  i need to
 hear something soon so i can keep her on the road...
 
    thanks in advance,
    mark
