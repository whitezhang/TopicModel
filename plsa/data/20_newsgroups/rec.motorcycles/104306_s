 back in my youth (ahem) the wiffy and moi purchased a gadget which heated up
 water from a 12v source.  it was for car use but we thought we'd try it on my
 rd350b.  it worked ok apart from one slight problem: we had to keep the revs 
 above 7000.  any lower and the motor would die from lack of electron movement.
 
 it made for interesting cups of coffee, anyhow.  we would plot routes that
 contained straights of over three miles so that we had sufficient time to
 get the water to boiling point.  this is sometimes difficult in england.
 
 good luck on your quest.
