 shaft: bamboozle, beat, beguile, burn (or flame), deceive, hoax,
        hoodwink.
 
 drive: campaign, crusade, push.
 
 so, 'shaft drive' may be a campaign to decieve or a crusade of beguile,
 efforts where are true to the spirit of this list.
 
 wheel: revolution, swing
 
 crusaders of beguile are innefective in revolutions and they cannot
 swing, either, therefore shaft drives cannot do wheelies.
