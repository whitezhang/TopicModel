 i was privelged enough to experience my first volvo attack this weekend.
 
 i was last in a line of traffic that was about 6 vehicles long, riding
 down rt. 40 in groton ma.  at the side of the road, sitting off on the
 shoulder was the killer volvo in question.  no brake lights, no turn signal,
 nothing.  we were doing about 40 mph and i was following the cage in front
 of me about 2.5-3 sec. back.  well, as said cage passes the volvo, the
 brain dead idiot (tm) behind the wheel decides that she doesn't need to wait
 for me to pass also and turns out perpendicular across both lanes of traffic
 so that she can turn around...  so i get on the brakes in a effort to not
 t-bone it, and the horn in an effort to wake the bdi up.  as she finishes
 the turn, she looks up at me with a completely blank, uncomprehending
 stare.
 
 where can i get rocket launchers for the vfr?
