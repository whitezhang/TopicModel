   well, you can accomplish both goals, actually, if you have a definite
 physical type in mind when you go to these (cough) church meetings..  if
 your tastes tend to smaller, more petite (cough) churchgoers, it is more
 likely that they will have a smaller head, and you can safely get a medium
 or small helmet.
 
   this works for me, and i traded my spare large helmet with my best friend,
 who, at 6'9", tends to look more for women that are over 6'0", and can't
 usually fit into the medium size helmet he previously had...
 
   of course, if you aren't picky what size (*cough*) churchgoers you give
 helpful motorcycle rides to, then ed's advice will hopefully cover any
 eventuality as far as legality is concerned, and a spare handtowel in the
 tankbag makes acceptable padding so the passenger can see out of the viewport
 (rather than the padding above the viewport) in the cases of extreme mismatch.
