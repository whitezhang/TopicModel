 hi, i just have a small question about my bike. 
 being a fairly experienced bmw and mz-mechanic, i just don't know what to 
 think about my honda. 
 she was using too much oil for the last 5000 km (on my trip to daytona bike 
 week this spring), and all of a sudden, she trailed smoke like hell and 
 was running only on one cylinder. 
 i towed the bike home and took it apart, but everything looks in perfect 
 working order. no cracks in the heads or pistons, the cylinder walls look 
 very clean, and the wear of pistons and cylinders is not measurable. all 
 still within factory specs. the only thing i could find, however, was a 
 slightly bigger ring gap on the right cylinder (the one with the problem), 
 but it is still way below the wear-limit given in the clymer-manual for 
 this bike. 
 any syggestions??? what else could cause my problem??? do i have to hone 
 the cylinder walls (make them a little rougher in a criss-cross-pattern) in 
 order to get better breaking in of my new rings??? won't that increase the 
 wear of my pistons??
 please send comments to

 thanks in advance. stef.
