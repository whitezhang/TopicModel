 well, it's been fun. this is my last day at bellcore and
 it will be a while before i have net access again (taking
 time off and scheduling military schools for the summer
 on joint operations, and anything else that looks good).
 i have had a blast reading, responding and commenting on
 things posted here. my final say is 9mm's are inferior
 to .45's errr oh wrong news group. hopefully i'll be back.
 i guess "internet withdrawl" starts around 1pm or so and
 considering i never knew inet existed 2 years ago i am
 really going to miss it. 
 
 oh yea, to the guy who called me this morning about the
 "military issue" boots, good luck, i think you will be
 happy with the tankers boots.
