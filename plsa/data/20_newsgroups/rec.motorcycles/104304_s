 interesting discussion.
 
 i limit myself to *one* 'standard serving' of alcohol if i'm
 going to ride. and mostly, unless the alcohol is something
 special (fine ale, good wine, or someone else's vsop), i usually
 just don't drink *any*.
 
 but then alcohol just isn't really important to me, mainly
 for financial reasons...
 
 at least one of the magazines claims to follow the
 aviation guideline of "no alcohol whatsoever" within
 24hrs of riding a 'company' bike.
 
 don't remember which mag though, it was a few years ago.
