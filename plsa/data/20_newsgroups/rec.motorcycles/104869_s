 	not to start *another* shaft effect discussion, but the twist you
 	feel when revving sitting still is due to the larger fly-wheels that
 	the bmw r-bikes (maybe k's too, dunno) use. if you whack the throttle
 	at stop lights, it'll really rock the bike over (to the right).

 	please post if you come to any conclusion on this. i am thinking

 	time i was under 5,000 rpm :-)
