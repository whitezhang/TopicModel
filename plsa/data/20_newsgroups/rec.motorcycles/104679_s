 hi,
    i'm now in the market for buying a bmw.the ideal would be an r80 rs but i'd be
 interested to here of any r80 for sale .age is not a problem - i'm more
 interested in a good example without a massive amount of miles and one which has
 been well maintained as i intend to keep it well and for some time.
 
    i would also like to know if anyone has any sound advice as regards to
 insurance - 27yr old,licence for 9 years,no accidents/claims/convictions.am i old
 enough to get bmw owners club insurance yet or will i have to wait until next
 year?
