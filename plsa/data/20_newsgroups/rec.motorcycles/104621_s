 well, my driveway is... just keep an eye out for the blue glh turbo that 
 utilizes the "hit-the-ground-running" merging technique. 
 at least i don't have a dog that you need worry about.
 
 last week while entering a sand/gravel covered intersection in the country, 
 i caught something unkosher out of the corner of my eye (you know that 
 disgusting sensation when great, as-of-yet unidentified, evil is about to 
 intimately acquaint itself with you-- kind of like knowing that that darkening 
 shadow around you just cannot possibly be anything even remotely good, because
 it probably has something to do with a boeing 747 behaving, gravitationally
 speaking, much like a brick).  negotiating my way into this intersection that 
 somehow reminded me of daytona beach (sans h2o, sun, & babes) i manage to get a
 glance at my impending destiny.  lucifer's own dog.  hell's secret blend
 of canine-- doberman and rottweiler (it moved with the grace of a doberman,
 yet had the hulk and jowels of the rottweiler-- a creature with a definite
 *wrong* end to be at).  the picture in my mirrors was fuzzy, but there was no 
 mistaking the fangs and saliva trail.  
 to shorten a verbose tale, my burly gaurdian-angels once again performed above
 and beyond the call of duty, carried the bike through the sand-trap (i honestlyhave no idea how), and left the minion of beelzebub with a face that 
 suspiciously resembles a metzler tread.  no blood, though-- rats.
 
 moral: i'm not really sure, but more and more i believe that bikers ought 
        to be allowed to carry handguns.
 
 -erc.
