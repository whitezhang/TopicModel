 	i've already discussed this in e-mail with jonathan.  it's the film
 "the inspector general"  [:-)], with danny kaye, although i can't quote the
 name of the leading lady (because maltin doesn't :-().  jonathan thinks there
 was an earlier russian film; "movies on tv" just says it was based on a gogol
 (yes, jonathan, i looked it up again -- only two o's) story.
