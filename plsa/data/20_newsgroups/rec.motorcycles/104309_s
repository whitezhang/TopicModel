 i was attacked by a rabid hubcap once.  i was going to work on a yamaha
 750 twin (a.k.a. "the vibrating tank") when i heard a wierd noise off to my
 left.  i caught a glimpse of something silver headed for my left foot and
 jerked it up about a nanosecond before my bike was hit hard in the left...

    actually, hubcap attacks are fairly common, most cagers being too
    incompetant to reinstall them properly after changing tires, or
    to check them after collisions.  luckily, few are as heavy as the
    one that got you.
