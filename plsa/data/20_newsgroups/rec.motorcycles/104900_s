 i've only ever done it in an automatic. i was sitting in my olds, in
 the winter, at a light, when i heard screeching behind me. i managed to
 dart into the left turn lane before the sliding jetta wound up half
 where i was and half in the parked car beside where i was. i've never
 had occasion to do it on a bike, but i imagine that it would be even
 easier, because you could slip beside the car in front. giving a gander
 at the mirrors while at a light will give you time to get the clutch
 out smoothly when you notice trouble, instead of waiting for the
 screeching.
