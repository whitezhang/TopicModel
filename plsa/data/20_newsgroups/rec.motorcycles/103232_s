 my old jacket is about to bite the dust so i'm in the market for a new riding
 jacket.  i'm looking for  recommendations for a suitable replacement.  i would
 like to buy a full aerostich suit but i can't afford $700 for it right now.
 
 i'm considering two basic options:
 
 1)  buy the aerostich jacket only.  dunno how much it costs
     due to recent price increases, but i'd imagine over $400.
     that may be pushing my limit.  advantages include the fact
     that i can later add the pants, and that it nearly eliminates
     the need for the jacket portion of a rainsuit.
 
 2)  buy some kind of leather jacket.  i like a few of the new 
     hein-gericke firstgear line, however they may be a bit pricey
     unless i can work some sort of deal.  advantages of leather
     are potentially slightly better protection, enhanced pose
     value (we all know how important that is :-), possibly cheaper
     than upper aerostich.
 
 requirements for a jacket are that it must fit over a few other 
 layers (mainly a sizing thing), if leather i'd prefer a zip-out 
 lining, it must have some body armor similar to aerostich (elbows, 
 shoulders, forearms, possibly back/kidney protection, etc.), a 
 reasonable amount of pocket space would be nice, ventilation would 
 be a plus, however it must be wearable in cold weather (below
 freezing) with layers or perhaps electrics.
 
 please fire away with suggestions, comments, etc...
