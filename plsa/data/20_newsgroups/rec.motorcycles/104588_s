 i need some advice on having someone ride pillion with me on my 750 ninja.
 this will be the the first time i've taken anyone for an extended ride
 (read: farther than around the block  :-).  we'll be riding some twisty, 
 fairly bumpy roads (the mines road-mt.hamilton loop for you sf bay areans).
 
 this person is <100 lbs. and fairly small, so i don't see weight as too much
 of a problem, but what sort of of advice should i give her before we go?
 i want her to hold onto me  :-)   rather than the grab rail out back, and
 i've heard that she should look over my shoulder in the direction we're
 turning so she leans *with* me, but what else?  are there traditional
 signals for slow down!! or go faster!! or i hafta go pee!! etc.???
 
 i really want this to be a positive experience for us both, mainly so that
 she'll want to go with me again, so any help will be appreciated...
 
 thanks,
         -bob-
