 given my desire to stay as far away as possible from farming and ranching
 equipment, i really hate to jump into this thread.  i'm going to anyway,
 but i really hate it.
 
 ed, exactly what kind of mutant horse-like entity do you ride, anyway?
 does countersteering work on the normal, garden-variety, one-necked horse?
 
 obmoto:  i was flipping through the march (i think) issue of rider, and i
 saw a small pseudo-ad for a book on hand signals appropriate to motorcycling.
 it mentioned something about a signal for "your passenger is on fire."  any
 body know the title and author of this book, and where i could get a copy?
 this should not be understood as implying that i have grown sociable enough
 to ride with anyone, but the book sounded cute.
