 well... all the way through a decreasing-radius corner, anyway...

 ok (but i'm right!)  :^)

 if that's the "official line" taught in those rider education classes
 you were refering to, that also don't teach countersteering, i have to
 question the quality of the classes.  the "official line" in msf
 curricula is as i described.  maximum braking is achieved by applying
 both brakes equally, when the weight distribution is nominally even and
 both tires have equal normal forces, and easing off on the rear to
 prevent locking it, and increasing braking on the front, as more
 traction is available to the front due to increased normal force due to
 weight shift.
 
 the "official line" you have been taught seems ineffective on the face
 of it.  applying the rear brake after the front is not taking advantage
 of all the traction available to the rear at time 0, and is halving the
 available braking power by using only the front at time 0.

 not necessarily true.  "chirping" the tire indicates impending lockup
 (on most surfaces), and serves as a good guide to newbies to indicate
 maximum braking.  i agree that totally locking the front occasionally
 makes one a better rider, but it is a manuver best saved for an
 experienced rider, unless you have one of those outrigger bikes like
 code used to use.

 true, but from the point of view of how to best *teach* riding skills
 (which is how this discussion started), "keep both wheels just on the
 point of sliding" is nearly useless information.  you need to teach a
 *technique*, or at least a strategy, to achieve this.
