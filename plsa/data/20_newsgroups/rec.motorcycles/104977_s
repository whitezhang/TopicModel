 like most everyone else, i ended up getting two different sizes for
 the top and bottom.  my top is a 46l and the bottom is a 48l.  for the
 bottom, the waist is far too large, but the thighs fit just right (the
 46 had a better waist, but cut off the circulation in my legs, i have
 large, muscular thighs, and no, i didn't use the thighmaster to get
 them :-).  the jacket fits me ok in the chest, slightly snug at the
 waist, and too small in the arms.  i can't imagine finding a one-piece
 size that would have fit correctly, as even the 2 piece has it's
 problems (strange, since my v-pilot jacket fits great all over, and
 when i tried the matching pants, they fit like a glove as well).
 
 i can only assume the models aero design uses to design its suits are
 in some way different from us real folks.
 
 also, even though it's related to convienience, you look pretty damn
 wierd walking around with the tops and bottoms while running errands.
 i've gotten some really suspicious looks, and sweated a lot while in a
 store wearing the whole suit, since you can't fit the top and bottom
 in any motorcycle storage device yet devised (except the trunk in my
 sidecar rig :-).  with the two piece, i unzip the pants (i generally
 leave the two pieces zipped together, primarily because the pants fall
 down unless i pull the cheesy elastic belt-type band real tight),
 stuff them in one of my spacious bmw saddlebags (the pants just fit),
 and run errands just wearing the jacket.  actually, if i know i'll be
 running errands, i just wear my v-pilot jacket, but that's just me...
 
 as far as crash protection, i'd say that both suits are probably
 equal.  it seems that for weather protection, if anything the 2 piece
 provides a little more because of the jacket overlapping the pants by
 3 inches.  the 2 piece is probably a little less comfortable around
 the waist, just because of the extra layer of stuff, but maybe not.
 
 so i'd have to vote for the two piece.  despite the slightly odd fit,
 i still find the suit the most versatile piece of riding clothing i
 own.  wouldn't go long distance without it.
