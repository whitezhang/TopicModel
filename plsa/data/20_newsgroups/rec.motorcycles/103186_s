 it depends on how badly you want to live.  the faa says "eight hours, bottle
 to throttle" for pilots but recommends twenty-four hours.  the fars specify
 a blood/alcohol level of 0.4 as legally drunk, i think, which is more than
 twice as strict as dwi minimums.
 
 btw, alcohol metabolizes in your blood at a fixed rate -- one beer/hour will
 keep your blood/alcohol level barely street-legal.  coffee, hyperventilation
 and other bar tricks won't speed it up nor will they fool mr. ranger.
