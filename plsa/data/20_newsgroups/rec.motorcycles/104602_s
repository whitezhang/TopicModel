 a traffic citation is an accusation of having committed a crime.
 that's why they have to go through the motions of having a trial if you
 want one, you are still innocent until proven guilty.  cops are not the
 only ones who can accuse people of committing crimes, anyone who
 witnesses a crime can do so.
 
 go to the highway patrol and explain the situation, give them a
 description of the car and the license number, and tell them the
 specific violation of the law which you witnessed and wish to prosecute
 (ie, search the vehicle code and have the section number handy).  fill
 out the ticket and sign it.  it will go through the same system any
 ticket a cop writes goes through.  if contested, you will have to
 appear in court to prosecute.  your word will not carry the same weight
 as a cop's.
