 were on it when i just bought it are old and cracked. i do not have an
 owners manual for it (yet), but the tires listed in the haynes manual are:
 front, 3,50 h 18 ; rear 4.10 h 18, and pressures recommended are 26 front and
 33 rear. oddly, the pressure for the same tire on the t-3 is listed at 29 psi
 instead. anyone know the reason? as i know though, the pressure i should run
 at is that recommended by the manufacturer of the new tires i purchase.
 
 the real question i have is this. the old tires that are on the bike are for
 the front, a metzler touring special, 4.10 h 18, and for the rear an avon
 roadrunner 4.70 h 18, (120/90) h 18 as marked on each tire. both are larger
 than that listed in the haynes manual. what does the owners manual recommend,
 and was it common to go up one size for this bike? also, this will be my first
 motorcycle with innertubes. any comments on the various manufacturers inner
 tube qualities?
 
 the above sizes are inches (except for the additional mark on the current
 rear tire). what is the best metric match? the local bmw dealer thought
 100/90 h 18 on the front and 120/90 h 18 on the back. he also happens to be
 very good at getting close to matching mail order prices.
 
 i am thinking of going with a metzler me33 laser (possibly comp k) on the
 front and me88 on the back, both in mbs variety if possible (the longer 
 lasting belting system). i already use the me33 on both the vision and
 fj for the front, and like it, and i thought that with the shaft drive
 behavior and torque from the guzzi that the me88 might give more predictable
 back end control and sliding behavior than a me55 might, as well as giving
 much better tire milage life. any comments?
 
 a friend told me he thought that my bike had boranni rims which are very
 good, but are relatively soft and have delicate sidewalls. i do not wish to
 mount the tires myself this first time, so aside from warning the shop to be
 careful, any other comments i should make? i havn't looked at the rim to
 check out the make yet, if it is marked. he just told me late yesterday and
 i havn't had a chance to check the rim type.
 
 on another note. i will remove the ugly (but in good shape....anyone want it?)
 vetter fairing, and i will run without a windscreen for a while, but eventually
 i would like a simple rounded cafe' style quarter fairing for it. it could be
 fork/handlebar mounted. any suggestions? is there such a thing as a frame
 mounted quarter fairing of the cafe' style for this bike? how about lower
 bars/clip-ons for it? i would like to restore the bike into a good condition
 runner with a few modern updates, but while not being historically exactly
 accurate still have it reflect relatively well a representation of the cafe'
 style. (yes i know to be picky, that period really predates this bike....it is
 just that this bike has such potential for _that_ look.)
