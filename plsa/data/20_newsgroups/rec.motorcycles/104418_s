 (not that logic has anything to do with it, but...)
 i can see the liability of putting stickers on the car while it was moving,
 or something, but it's the bdi that chooses to start and then drive the car
 in a known unsafe condition that would (seem to be) liable. furthermore, they
 would have had the last chance to avoid an unsafe situation, which is an
 additional factor in attributing "blame".
 
 anyway, stickers on the window are less effective... no one has any problem
 taking a blade to a window to remove a stubborn sticker, but it's a different
 story with that that nice paint job on the door....
