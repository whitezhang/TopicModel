 when your helmetted nogin hits an immoveabe object, there are only four things
 to dissipate the energy: the immoveable object, the helmet shell, the helmet
 liner, the rider's head, the rider's ego (ok, five). assuming that the helmet/
 head assembly takes the same impact, if the shell cracks in one case, then in
 the other the liner must be dented, or the head gets jiggled. if it's the
 the liner that's dented, the helmet is just as toast as if the shell were
 cracked, it won't absorb energy form an impact in that area. if it's the head
 that's getting jiggled, maybe the new gear isn't of as high quality after all?
