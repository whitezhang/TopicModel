 hello all,
 
 on my bike i have hazard lights (both front and back turn signals
 flash).  since i live in nj and commute to nyc there are a number of
 tolls one must pay on route.  just before arriving at a toll booth i
 switch the hazards on.  i do thisto warn other motorists that i will
 be taking longer than the 2 1/2 seconds to make the transaction.
 taking gloves off, getting money out of coin changer/pocket, making
 transaction, putting gloves back on takes a little more time than the
 average cager takes to make the same transaction of paying the toll.
 i also notice that when i do this cagers tend to get the message and
 usually go to another booth.
 
 my question, is this a good/bad thing to do?
 
 any others tend to do the same?
 
 just curious
