 	been a while since you hit the pip? the pavement (at least until around
 	exit 9) is for sh*t these days. i think it must have taken a beating
 	this winter, because i don't remember it being this bad. it's all
 	breaking apart, and there are some serious potholes now. of course
 	there are also the storm drains that are *in* your lane as opposed
 	to on the side of the road (talk about annoying cost saving measures).
 		
 	as for traffic, don't try it around 5:15 - 6:30 on weekdays (outbound,
 	rush hour happens inbound too) as there are many bdc's...
