 dogs will chase anything that moves. i have two dogs and they love
 chasing me when i ride off. they will also chase any car that passes
 , running along the footpath/sidewalk at up to 60kph. they don't
 seem to go after trucks though, the size difference must be a factor.
 
 it also works in my favour though, i can exercise them quite easily
 by riding 1/2 mile up the road and back a few times.
