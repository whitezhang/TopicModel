 i would agree entirely with these three paragraphs. but did the hurt
 study make any distinction between an *ability* to swerve and a *failure*
 to swerve? in most of the accidents and near accidents that i've seen, riders
 will almost always stand on the brakes as hard as they dare, simply because
 the instinct to brake in the face of danger is so strong that it over-rides
 everything else. hard braking and swerving tend to be mutually exclusive
 manouvres - did hurt draw any conclusions on which one is generally preferable?
