 honda:  a "v" designates a v engine street bike. "vf" for v-4, "vt" for v-twin.
 "cb" is a street bike with an parallel twin or inline 4-cylinder engine.
 "r" used to mean race bike, but is now also used to mean sport bike.
 "cl" was for the old steet scramblers-street bikes with high pipes
 "cm" was a "custom" street bike
 "cr" is dirt only two strokes
 "xl" is dual purpose bike
 "xr" was dirt only four stroke, but now can be a dual purpose bike if it has
 an "l" as a suffix.
 "gl" is a touring bike
