 i am looking for advice on buying a susuki gs1100e.  does anyone out there
 know about any inherent flaws the bike may have or problems i should look
 for?
 what about insurance rates (is this bike blacklisted)?
 also, as a person who has never ridden a motorcycle yet is buying a 1100
 to start off with.... am i crazy?  i have been told by some people to start out
 small.... and by others that i am lage enough to handle an 1100 right off from
 the start (6'4" 210 pounds) because some others might be a tad bit small.
 
 oh yeah, one more question.  anybody in the chicago area know of any good
 instruction schools or programs where i could get aquanted before i just go
 buy one and kill myself getting it home.
 
 thanks,
    brian
 
 p.s. please email me direcly because i do not get much of a chance to read your
 group...   thanks again.. :)
