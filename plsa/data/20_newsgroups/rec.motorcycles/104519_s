 several years ago, while driving a cage, a dog darted out at a quiet
 intersection right in front of me but there was enough distance
 between us so i didn't have to slow down. however, a 2nd dog
 suddenly appeared and collided with my right front bumper and
 the force of the impact was enough to kill that scottish terrier.
 
 apparently, it was following the 1st dog. henceforth, if a dog
 decides to cross the street, keep an eye out for a 2nd dog as
 many dogs like to travel in pairs or packs. 
 
 i've yet to experience a dog chasing me on my black gl1200i which
 has a pretty loud oem horn (not as good as fiamms, but good enuff)
 but the bike is large and heavy enough to run right over one of
 the smaller nippers while the larger ones would have trouble
 getting my leg between the saddlebags and engine guards. i'd
 def feel more vulnerable on my '68 trump as that'd be easier
 leg chewing target for those mongrels.
 
 if there's a persistent dog running after bikers despite
 complaints to the owner i wouldn't be adverse to running
 over it with my truck as a dogs life isn't worth much imho
 compared to a child riding a bike who gets knocked to the
 ground by said dog and dies from a head injury. 
 
 any dog in the neighborhood that's vicious or a public menace
 running about unleashed is fair game as road kill candidate.
