 a friend of mine (who's probably reading this right now) just bought a new
 yamaha virago 750.  after spending 1-2 hours very late one chilly evening
 watching him struggle with the bolts (had to remove the right peg, loosen
 the brake pedal, &c. &c.) i've pretty much decided never to get this
 particular model unless he or someone else wants to change the oil/filter
 for me.  compared to the 5-minute change he was used to for his honda, this
 is just a design flaw/oversight in my eyes.
