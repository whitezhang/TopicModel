  went up to visit a friend overnight (about 45 minute ride).. rode up after 
 work, only minor drizzing for the last 5 minutes of the ride... rest of the 
 ride was very zen.
  
  got up this morning, needed to go home and get some disks & stuff to work 
 on her computers with, rainy as all hell. soaked and cold by the time i got 
 home.
  
  since i didn't have another set of thermals which were dry, i said "to heck 
 with it" and drove my cage back up.
  
  lo and behold, those funny blue clouds were up in the sky and this warm 
 yellow thing i haven't seen in quite awhile showed up when i was 10 minutes 
 into the trip.
  
  and me in my cage. oh joy.
  
  
  happily, my right hand mirror finally showed up at the dealer (dropped the 
 bike when i first got it, put on an emgo replacement mirror... hated it the 
 entire time that thing was on my bike because i couldn't see a damned thing 
 through it, plus it's flat instead of convex like the stock mirrors, so you 
 get a narrow angle wobbly blur)... and i got a replacement windshield for my 
 fairing (dropped the original and chipped the front edge... cosmetic but 
 annoying)... so i spent half an hour happily unscrewing things and replacing 
 them this afternoon.
  
  'bout the only thing i still hate about the bike ('75 cb360t) is the damned 
 "2 d-cell flashlight" headlight.
  
  has anyone seen a good source for ~25 watt halogen passing lights? since 
 the charging system on the cb360t can't handle continuous use of a 50w 
 halogen headlight, i was thinking about putting a couple passing lights 
 on... that would give me ~70w of lighting for the rare night riding i do, 
 but wouldn't drain the battery during "normal use" (chiefly day trips and 
 commuting to work and back)...
