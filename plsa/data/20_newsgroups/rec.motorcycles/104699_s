 i bought a yamaha xs850 with 8k miles.  over the last 2 years, i've put 30k
 of commute miles onnit.  valve adjustment intervals are suppossed to be every
 5k.  well every 7.5k or so, i've checked the pad clearences, and they never
 change!  if anything, the clearances seem to be getting a little smaller which
 makes no sense to me with the pad system - the pads should wear until the
 clearances are too great right?  i know that threaded adjusters can tighten 
 up, but i didn't think these kind could.
 
 bottom lines is that i haven't touched my valves for 30k on this bike and
 they are still nice and quiet and if anything, the clearances are tighter...
 what's the deal?  any other yam triple owners notice extremely long valve
 adjustment intervals?
