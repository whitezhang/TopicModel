 an extended ride as a passenger on a 750 ninja.
 
 owww.
 
 well, i hate to be a wet sock, but, well...
 
 i was a passenger on many bikes for the longest time before i started
 riding myelf, and i grew to hate long rides on sport bikes.  the passenger
 seats are not designed for long rides.  the passenger positions aren't
 even usually designed for short rides.  i ended up torturing my knees and my
 back by taking long rides as a passenger on sport bikes.  one of the
 reasons i originally liked my current guythingy so much was becase he had
 a bmw. :)
 
 i'd suggest a shorter extended ride at first -- a short turn in the mountains
 or some such.  then see how much pain she's in, and proceed from there.
 
 the best advice i'd give a beginning passenger:
 
 - don't get on the bike until the rider says its ok, and work out some sort
   signal for the rider to tell you when its ok to get off.  after i get on 
   the bike i squeeze my riders hips to tell that i'm ready, and at the stop
   he nods his head to show its ok for me to get off.
 
 - keep your feet on the pegs at all times.  don't wiggle (unless your rider
   asks you to :)
 
 - the best passengers are those which are unobtrusive.  echo the movements
   and lean of your rider.  look over the shoulder thats most comfortable,
   but during turns look over the shoulder on the inside of the turn.
 
 - get used to your rider's shifting style (riders:  use a reasonably
   consistent shifting style).  avoid "helmet bonk."  helmet bonk is 
   when your rider revs the bike up and then shifts and the sudden change
   in foreward acceleration causes your helmet to bonk his/hers.  it
   gets old real fast.
 
 - when pulling to a stop, put a hand or both hands on the tank to keep
   your weight from pushing your rider up onto the tank.  putting your hands
   on the tank is also a good way to stretch your back if you're in pain,
   but i'm told it gets harder to steer in turns if you leave them there.
 
 - switch your hands to the guardrail to stretch your shoulders, but be 
   sure and squeeze your thighs while you're doing it so your rider knows you're
   still there. :)  the guard rail isn't as safe as holding onto your rider.
 
 - don't be afraid to ask for frequent stops if you're in pain or
   losing feeling in your feet.  passenger seats are not generally designed 
   for comfort.  work out some sort of pull over signal beforehand.
