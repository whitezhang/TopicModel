 nope.  flames should be *interesting*.  around here, guns & helmets
 are the wallpaper.

 not everyone in rec.motoland is so easily amused.  blaine, as an elder,
 has seen the superflamers at their peaks (or depths, if you prefer).  
 with that sort of incendiary backdrop, awarding your faltering bic a
 0.5 was the purest act of charity.

 unless, of course, your audience has only seen several thousand similarly
 uninspiring attempts in this arena.  in that case, the trite & boring
 threshold tends to drift away from where you first set it, as yours will,
 eventually (or not).

 until you can yank the flame out of blaine's internet port before he
 can io_close() it, you are in no position to lecture him, grasshopper.

 oh please (yawn), you're slipping further down the scale with each
 successive attempt.  it's so embarrassing to watch.   say, you're not
 from waco, are you?
