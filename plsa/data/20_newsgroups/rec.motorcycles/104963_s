 i've driven thru soho...manahattan, _i_ know what' you're talking 'bout...

 not that durham, nc is any better...
 
 (well, maybe a little bit anyway, but the nc dot takes more
 money from road taxes and puts it in their own pockets and
 into the pockets of the guys building the large condos that
 need their own roads than they do back into fixing roads, but
 hey, the local paper did a report of this last summer, and 
 boy, am i glad i don't work for the dot, 'cause they got shat
 on, bigtime....wonder who lost their jobs?  ed?  got any idea?)
