 there is a new dod listing. to get a copy use one of these commands:
 
 		finger motohead@cs.colorado.edu
 				or
 		mail motohead@cs.colorado.edu
 
 if you send mail make sure your "from" line is correct (ie "man vacation").
 i will not try at all to fix mail problems (unless they are mine ;-). and i
 may just publicly tell the world what a bad mailer you have. i do scan the 
 mail to find bounces but i will not waste my time answering your questions 
 or requests.
 
 for those of you that want to update your entry or get a # contact the kotl.
 only the kotl can make changes. so stop bothering me with inane mail
 
 i will not tell what "dod" is! ask rec.motorcycles. i do not give out the #'s.
