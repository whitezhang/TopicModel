 i have a 1974 honda cb360t which for most of my purposes runs well. 
 however i expereince a severe power drop at cruising speeds under load. 
 that is, on a mild upgrade @ 50 mph in 4th or 5th i'm lucky if i can
 hold speed.  if i try to add throttle much past 5000 rpm, power drops
 drastically.  put simply, under load, the engine won't rev past 5000
 rpm.  the top third/half of the throttle range is dead.  standing still
 the engine runs fine up to red line (9-10k).
 
 other phenomenology: at about the point that power loss kicks in, the
 engine becomes a little wavery.  that is, at a steady throttle the
 engine speed goes up and down slightly.  the bike has about 13000 miles
 on it and is in good tune, at least until it starts to balk.
 
 i would appreciate any suggestions as to what's ailing the poor beast. 
 my thoughts run toward clogged jets and/or improper spark advance.  i'm
 hoping it's not something more drastic since the bike's not really worth
 the hassle of any major engine work.
