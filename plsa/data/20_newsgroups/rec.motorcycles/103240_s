   i am selling my trusty husky... hopefully to buy a husaberg...  this is
   a very good dirt bike and has been maintained perfectly.  i never had
   any problems with it.
 
   it's a four stroke, 4 valves, liquid cooled engine. it is heavier than 
   a 250 2 stroke but still lighter than a honda xr600 and has a lot better 
   suspension (ohlins shock, husky fork) than the xr. for the casual or non
   competitive rider, the engine is much better than any two stroke.
   you can easily lug up hills and blast through trails with minimum gear
   changes.
   
   the 1992 ignition and the carefully tuned carburation makes this bike
   very easy to start (starts of first kick when cold or hot).  there is a
   custom made carbon/kevlar (light 1 pound) wrap around skid plate to protect
   the engine cases and the water pump.  the steering angle has been reduced 
   by 2 degree to increase steering quickness. this with the suspension tune-up
   by phil douglas of aftershock (multiple time isde rider) gives it a better
   ride than most bike: plush suspension, responsive steering with no head shake.
 
   so if it is such a good bike why sell it???? gee, i want to buy a husaberg,
   which just a husky but 25 pounds lighter... and a tad more $$$.
