 
 on the other side of the fence, i owned a bieffe off-road helmet.
 took what i would consider a minor fall, and had visible damage
 to the shell.  yes, the helmet did its job.  but the damage/impact
 ratio was scary.  i own bell moto-5 now, have taken impacts on
 order of twice the bieffe impact (we do this frequently in mx),
 and don't even have a scratch on it after two seasons.  my
 recommendation is to buy _high_ quality gear.  ymmv.
