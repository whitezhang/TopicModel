 it's normal for the bmw k bikes to use a little oil in the first few thousand 
 miles.  i don't know why.  i've had three new k bikes, and all three used a
 bit of oil when new - max maybe .4 quart in first 1000 miles; this soon quits
 and by the time i had 10,000 miles on them the oil consumption was about zero.
 i've been told that the harder you run the bike (within reason) the sooner
 it stops using any oil.
