 if this is the same as adjusting the shims between cam and valve, i have
 the same question.  do you buy a full set of shims before starting the
 adjustment process, or do you calculate the shims you need and then run
 off to the dealer in the cage to see if the right shims are in stock? 
 obviously the latter would be cheaper (what do shims cost?), but are
 measurements of the shim need reliable enough to buy only the indicated shims?
