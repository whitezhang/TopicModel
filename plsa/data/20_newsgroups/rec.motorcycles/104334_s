  currently there are no "velcro" jump boots as issue in
 the military, there are two other kinds. one is made my
 cochran and sell for $85.00 in either the clothing sales
 store or us cavalry (price match at the cav store) the
 second co is also sold but somewhat cheaper in design.
 actually they don't care what you wear as long is they
 are 10 eyelets high.
 there is another boot called a "tankers boot" this has
 similar construction to a wellington boot except for the
 boot shape and has straps that wrap around for tightness.
 nice boots
