 i'm looking for a sport-cruiser - factory installed fairings (
 full/half ), hard saddle bags, 750cc and above, and all that and still
 has that sporty look.
 
 i particularly like the r100rs and k75 rt or s, or any of the k series
 bmw bikes.
 
 i was wondering if there are any other comparable type bikes being
 produced by companies other than bmw.
 
 thanks for the info,
 jae
