 the ft-500 is a good beginner's bike with:
   *  a reasonable seating position
   *  enough power to get you up and around, but
        not so much it'll scare the bejeebers out of you
   *  tips over well, and easy to pick up
        (don't ask)
   *  simple maintenance
 
 i've had mine for four or so years, and haven't had any
 serious problems with it.  i bought it used for $750 with
 about 8000 miles on it.
 
 just last week, someone in the neighborhood stopped by to
 ask me about it; whether i thought it was a good beginner's
 bike, is it comfortable and powerful enough, blah blah blah...
 seems he found one used for < $500 with about 3600 miles on it.
 
 the reall "trick" mod i've heard was to take the front end from
 a 600 hurricane and slide it in.  this was from a guy who
 campaigns two ascots in sos racing.  he says they do pretty
 well too, once you strip off the starter, lights and other
 assorted street paraphernalia, its a pretty fast and light bike.
