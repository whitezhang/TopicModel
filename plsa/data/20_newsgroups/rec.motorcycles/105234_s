 i don't generally consider police officers "the enemy".  i hope you don't
 think bikers in general have that attitude.  stereotypes suck either way.

 you shouldn't get flamed for being a cop.  i can't promise you won't because
 there are jerks on this newsgroup same as any other, but if you've been 
 lurking for a while you already know that.  you might get lots of flames
 if you try to convince people that you know more than them just because you
 have a badge.  and of course, you will get a moderate amount of flamage
 just for expressing an opinion, no matter what the opinion is *somebody*
 will flame you for it.
    so, have you ordered any official dod paraphenalia yet?  wristwatch,
 bandana, patches?  tell your boss your going undercover with a real
 badass biker gang. :-)
