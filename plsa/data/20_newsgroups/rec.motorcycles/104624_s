 this is very bad advice.  helmets have two major impact absorbing
 layers... a hard outer shell and a closed-cell foam impact layer.
 most helmets lose their protective properties because the inner liner
 compacts over time, long before the outer shell is damaged or
 delaminates from age.  dr. hurt tested helmets for many years
 following his landmark study and has estimated that a helmet can lose
 up to 80% of it's effectiveness from inner liner compression.  i have
 a video he produced that discusses this phenomenon in detail.
 
 puncture compression of the type caused by mirrors, sissy bars, and
 other relatively sharp objects is the worst offender.  even when the
 comfort liner is unaffected, dents and holes in the foam can seriously
 degrade the effectiveness of a helmet.  if you are in the habit of
 "parking your lid" on the mirrors, i suggest you look under the
 comfort liner at the condition of the foam.  if it is significantly
 damaged (or missing :-), replace the helmet.
