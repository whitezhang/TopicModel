 *cough* *choke*  what?!?  if a cop gave me a ticket for "sounding" like
 i was speeding i'd probably show up in court without a lawyer simply
 because "sounding" like speeding is ridiculous.  if i was found guilty
 i'd appeal and then show up with a lawyer.
 
 if a cop doesn't do one of:
 
 vascar (from car or plane)
 radar, lidar, other electronic speed measuring device
 pace me
 
 and i'm within 15mph or so of the limit i'd go to court.  i can accept a
 cop "seeing" me going excessively fast (like 25+ over the limit) but
 "he looked like he was going 70 or so in a 55 zone" is not "beyond a
 reasonable doubt".  granted i may well lose the case but 70 in a 55 measured
 by eye???  take it to court for sure.
