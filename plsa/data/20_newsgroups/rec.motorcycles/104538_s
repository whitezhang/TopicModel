 from what i've seen in my 17 years as an moa member, most of the folks
 in the ra are also in the moa... i guess it's called covering all the
 bases to get some idea of what is really happening.. how else does one
 think the ra gets all the juicey news about what's happen' inside the 
 moa?
 
 nihilism isn't for everyone, not that it really matters!
