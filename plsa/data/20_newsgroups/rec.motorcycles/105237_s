 	no, it is the stock setup.  someone really ought to put an end
 	to the confusion regarding bmw's chain drive boxers.  didn't
 	someone post the faq on this some time ago?  in essence, it
 	describes the problem bmw is having with their decision to
 	settle down to a shaft drive as a standard.  they vacilate
 	and persist in reintroducing the chain drive in various
 	models.  (r/c)  gosh.  well, on with the crusade!
