 that's a twin-cam, right?  there's a steel guard right next to
 the sprocket to keep a broken chain from punching a hole in the
 engine cases, and it's needed.  there's probably not enough room
 to fit a bigger sprocket.
 
 i'd be inclined to take two teeth off the rear for a 5% ratio
 change rather than adding one to the front for about 7%.  if you
 raise the overall gear ratio too much you'll impair the bike's
 rideability, because the gears will be far enough apart that
 there will be only one gear that provides adequate response at
 any given speed.  honda 750s don't have the widest of power
 bands.
