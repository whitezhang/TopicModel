 the experience you describe is why i don't like to sit with my bike in
 gear - i figure there's a chance that i'll be startled in some way and
 stall my bike.  and i figure this is more likely than the chance that
 i'll be unable to escape some situation because of the extra time
 needed to put the bike in gear.
 
 so i concentrate on avoiding situations rather than making split-second
 evasive manuvers.  i split lanes so i'm not at the end of the line.
 (unfortunately this is not legal in most of the country)  if i can't
 split (perhaps there isn't room) then i will stop near one side of the
 lane so i have an easy escape, and leave my bike in gear until the next
 car has stopped.  i watch in my mirrors in the mean time to make sure
 it will!  whether i really would have time to move should a car fail to
 stop, i haven't had to find out yet.  some cars have an annoying habbit
 of racing up behind you before braking heavilly, so it can be hard to
 tell if they are planning to brake or not!
 
 so in summary, position yourself for an easy exit, and then watch your
 mirrors until it's all clear.
