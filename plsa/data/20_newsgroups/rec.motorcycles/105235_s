 i just installed a mc power arc ii, and it seems to run great. i also
 used mc coils, and neither the ignition module or the coils required
 any new mounting holes to be drilled on my 92 fxstc. a little soldering
 and all was fine. static timing was real easy to set too. 
 
 on the other side of the coin, my local wrench, whose opinion i
 invariably seek but don't always adopt, thinks mc power arc is a "piece
 of shit" and says "all them jap chips are gonna fail you one day". 
 needless to say, he doesn't like any electronic ignition modules, and
 recommends the dyna-s system. i think that's the one with the
 hall-effect timing sensor(s), correct?
