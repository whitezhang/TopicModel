 i'll second that!! i saw a list somewhere of all the stuff that it was 
 unwise to buy secondhand - stuff like parachutes, toilet paper, condoms
 and motorcycle helmets...
 
 seriously though, why take the risk? you are extremely unlikely to get
 a good-fitting secondhand helmet, cos life just doesn't work like that!
 and as lisa says, you never know where it's been before...
