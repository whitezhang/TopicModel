 i learned when riding bareback as a kid to "palm-reign", by just 
 pushing on the right side of the horse's neck with your right palm to turn 
 left - a lot like countersteering. so that came pretty easy to me in the 
 transition to motorcycles. it took a while however to break my habit of 
 kicking the rear fender with my heels to go faster.
