 hell, just save your candle stubs and bring them.  light them up, and
 dribble the wax all over the kindling wood and light _that_.  although
 i like the belly-button lint / eggshell case idea the best, if you're
 feeling particularly industrious some eventful evening.  or you can
 do what i did one soggy summer: open the fuel line, drain some onto a 
 piece of rough or rotten wood, stick that into the middle of the soon-to-
 be inferno and carefully strike a match... as kurt vonnegut titled one
 of the latter chapters in cat's cradle, "ah-whoom!"
 
 works like a charm every time :-)
