 ouch. :-)   this brings to mind one of the recommendations in the
 hurt study.   because the rear of the gas tank is in close proximity
 to highly prized and easily damaged anatomy, hurt et al recommended
 that manufacturers build the tank so as to reduce the, er, step function
 provided when the rider's body slides off of the seat and onto the
 gas tank in the unfortunate event that the bike stops suddenly and the 
 rider doesn't.  i think it's really inspiring how the manufacturers
 have taken this advice to heart in their design of bikes like the 
 cbr900rr and the gts1000a.
