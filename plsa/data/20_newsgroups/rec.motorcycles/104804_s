 yes, it was specifically the *ability* or understanding of the
 technique which was absent.  we have made a lot of progress between
 rider education and responsibility over the last ten-twenty years...
 but i am still amazed anytime i teach an erc how many people of many
 year riding experience "discover" countersteering for cornering or
 swerving.

 the specific recommandation cited in the hurt study was that a formal
 "street strategy", like sipde for example, was the most important
 component of any rider education curriculum.  the specific skills of
 emergency braking, cornering and swerving must be taught and practiced
 as well, but more significant was that 35% of rider did nothing
 confronted with a potential accident, and another third collided or
 fell over as a result of rider error.  the choice of specific maneuver
 is much less significant to the outcome than early detection and
 the proper execution of any effective countermeasure.
