 the original battery in an 8-10 year old bmw may be fine.  mine lasted many
 years.  the replacement 30ah battery from bmw was a disaster.  the mechanic
 from comp. acc. told me that ca would warantee replace the bad one with a
 new one of the same evil bad batteries and tell the customer if they have
 problems to bring it back and they'd do it again.  it seems that many of
 those 30ah batteries were doa, near-doa, and always unlikely to be going
 strong by the end of the warantee period on them.  there was a big batch of
 bad ones, and they replaced them with -you guessed it - more bad ones.  bmw
 switched to a 25ah battery that has more cold cranking amps, even if it has
 less total juice.  
 
 i switched to a yuasa that has even more cold cranking amps and cost one
 third fewer dollars.
