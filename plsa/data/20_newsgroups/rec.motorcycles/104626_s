    i need some advice on having someone ride pillion with me on my 750 ninja.
    this will be the the first time i've taken anyone for an extended ride
    (read: farther than around the block  :-).  we'll be riding some twisty, 
    fairly bumpy roads (the mines road-mt.hamilton loop for you sf bay areans).
 
 i'd say this is a very bad idea - you should start out with something
 much mellower so that neither one of you get in over your head.
 that particular road requires full concentration - not the sort of
 thing you want to take a passenger on for the first time.
 
 once you both decide that you like riding together, and want to do
 something longer and more challenging, *then* go for a hard core road
 like mines-mt. hamilton.
 
 in any case, it's *your* (moral) responsibility to make sure that she
 has proper gear that fits - especially if you're going sport
 riding.
