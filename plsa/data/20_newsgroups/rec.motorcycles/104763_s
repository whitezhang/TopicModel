 my reason for saying that was 'cause _i_, if _i_ were a cop
 wouldn't go out of my way to tell people how to break the law.

 the part about honesty was a joke, sorta.
 
 obviously, people have had bad experiences with cops
 lying.  obviously, nobody's perfect and nobody
 _always_ tells the truth about everything.
