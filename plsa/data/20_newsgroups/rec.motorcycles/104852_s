 the ice princess next door makes a habit of flooring her cage out of the 
 driveway when she sees me coming. probably only hits 25mph, or so. (i made 
 the mistake of waving to a neighbor. she has some sort of grudge, now.)
 
 i was riding downhill at ~60mph on a local backroad when a brown dobie came 
 flashing through the brush at well over 30mph, on an intercept course with 
 my front wheel. the dog had started out at the top of the hill when it heard 
 me and still had a lead when it hit the road. the dog was approaching from 
 my left, and was running full tilt to get to my bike on the other side of 
 the road before i went by. rover was looking back at me to calculate the 
 final trajectory. too bad it didn't notice the car approaching at 50+mph 
 from the other direction.
 
 i got a closeup view of the our poor canine friend's noggin careening off 
 the front bumper, smacking the asphalt, and getting runover by the front 
 tire. it managed a pretty good yelp, just before impact. (peripheral 
 imminent doom?) i guess the driver didn't see me or they probably would have 
 swerved into my lane. the squeegeed pup actually got up and headed back 
 home, but i haven't seen it since. 
 
 sniff. 
 
 sometimes fate sees you and smiles.
