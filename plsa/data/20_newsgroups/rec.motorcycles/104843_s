 	yep! i did one yesterday on my shaftie vision... i should mention  
 that i had a pillon that helped rotate the bike over :-) . the wheelie was  
 the result of a necessarily agressive acceleration manouver through an  
 intersection (damn san antonio cagers tend to be really bad drivers).  
 
 	however, i have done one by myself, it just takes a lot of  
 pre-clutch dump rev action.
 
 	just a passing comment
