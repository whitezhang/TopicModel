 seems to me that the driver was driving the vehicle visually impaired.
 isn't that like not scraping ice and snow off your windshield and such?
 
 say, that's another thing that bugs me.  why don't people scrape their
 damn windows?  i've seen people driving cars with *barely* the driver's
 half of the windshield cleared.  nothing else cleared.  this seems
 pretty stupid and isn't there something (probably varies state to state)
 that says a certain percentage of the glass must be clear?  oh, well.
