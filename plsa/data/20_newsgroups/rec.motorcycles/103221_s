 	hmm, sounds like a useful trick -- it'd keep the local cagers at least
 a crutch-length off my tail-light, which is more than they give me now.  but
 do i have to break a leg to use it?
 
 	(when i broke my ankle dirt-biking, i ended up strapping the crutches
 to the back of the bike & riding to the lab.  it was my right ankle, but the
 bike was a gt380 and started easily by hand.)
