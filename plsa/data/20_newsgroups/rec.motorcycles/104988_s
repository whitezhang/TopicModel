 actually, a wera racer, william lumsden, considered running a vmax in 
 a superstock.  he took it out to talladega gpr for a practice day, and
 _really_ annoyed the 600 riders -- they usually got caught behind a 
 sideways vmax in the corners, and if they passed him going in, he'd
 blow by down the straight (usually wobbling).  needless to say, since
 he was 2 seconds faster on a 1977 cb400f, he decided against the vmax.
 
 too bad.
