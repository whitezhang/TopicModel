 a few months ago, in one the the motorcycle mags, there was
 an article that mentioned reflector tape that was supposed to
 be available thru bmw.  the idea was that the tape would look
 black in sunlight, and reflect in other colors at night to
 headlights.  it sounded like a nice way to add nighttime 
 visibility without turning the bike into a carnival attraction.
 
 i talked to the local bmw dealer about this.  i was told that the 
 only thing he had heard about this kind of reflector, was it being 
 used in a coming line of bmw clothing (rainsuits).  he wasn't aware 
 of anything regarding self applied tape.
 
 has anyone come across this from bmw or any other source?
 
 thanks,
