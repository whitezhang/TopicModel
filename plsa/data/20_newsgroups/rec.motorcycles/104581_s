 another good place for your helmet is your mirror (!). i kid you not. if
 you own a typical standard or other bike with fairly average mirrors
 that screw into your handlebars, your helmet should fit over your mirror
 and be fairly stable. i doubt i have to mention it, but this trick isn't
 quite so smart on a goldwing, cbr600, any gsxr, or any bike with
 fairing-mounted mirrors.
 
 i was a little surprised, though, to find that you had your helmet on
 your seat while you were centerstanding your bike. i usually leave my
 helmet on until my bike is parked, if for no other reason than i
 wouldn't want my helmet to be on any surface that i was about to start
 tilting and jerking . . .

 i saw the quote below on a pair of nankai race-replica leathers. i think
 this sort of phrase is typically known as "japlish."
