 responsible and in love?  i believe that's a contradiction

 unless you're really brave (read: "reckless") a 500cc sport
 bike will go way faster than you dare for at least your first
 year of riding.  getting more than that really is overkill,
 as you'll never even want to use it.  the following bikes
 can be bought (and repaired!) cheaply, are easy for a novice
 to manage, and are plenty high performance:
     kawasaki ex-500
     honda vf-500 "interceptor"
     suzuki gs-550e
 
 the 0-100mph time of the ex-500 at full throttle is "way
 sooner than you're ready for it".  :-)  with something
 as small as a 250, you'd probably be wishing for more
 power pretty quickly (unless it's a tzr or rgv :).
 
 now, i'm not saying that you're 100% certain to kill
 yourself immediately with a 600f2 or a gsxr-750.  plenty
 of people have started riding on those bikes and done
 just fine.  what i am saying is that it's a waste of
 money, and a waste of perfectly good plastic when you
 drop the thing learning how to balance while stopping.
 you'll never get the throttle more than half open
 anyway, so why spend the extra 2000 bucks?
