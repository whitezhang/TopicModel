 hey ed, you didn't give me the chance!  sheesh!
 
 the answer is, absolutely!, as ed so eloquently describes:

 herein lies the key to this thread:
 
 kindly note the difference in the responses.  ed (and i) are talking
 about knowing riding technique, while mike is arguing knowing the physics
 behind it.  it *is* possible to be taught the technique of countersteering
 (ie: push the bar on the inside of the turn to go that way) *without*
 having to learn all the fizziks about gyroscopes and ice cream cones
 and such as seen in the parallel thread.  that stuff is mainly of interest
 to techno-motorcycle geeks like the readers of rec.motorcycles  ;^),
 but doesn't need to be taught to the average student learning c-steering.
 mike doesn't seem to be able to make the distinction.  i know people
 who can carve circles around me who couldn't tell you who newton was.
 on the other hand, i know very intelligent, well-educated people who
 think that you steer a motorcycle by either: 1) leaning, 2) steering
 a la bicycles, or 3) a combination of 1 and 2.  knowledge of physics
 doesn't get you squat - knowledge of technique does!
