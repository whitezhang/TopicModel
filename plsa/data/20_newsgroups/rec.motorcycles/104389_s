 	for those of you with motorcycles of the liquid-cooled persuasion,
 what brand of coolant do you use and why?  i am looking for aluminum-safe
 coolant, preferably phosphate-free, and preferably cheaper than $13/gallon.
 (can you believe it:  the kaw dealer wants $4.95 a quart for the official
 blessed holy kawasaki coolant!!!  no way i'm paying that usury...)
 
 thanks,
