 i'd bet the price of the helmet that it's okay...from 6 feet
 or higher, maybe not.

 i'd wear the full facer, but then, i'd be *way* more worried
 about wind blast in the face, and inability to hear police
 sirens, than the helmet being a little damaged.

 well, my next helmet will be, subject to it fitting well, an agv
 sukhoi. that's just because i like the looks. my current one is
 a shoei task5, and it's getting a little old, and i crashed in
 it once a couple of years ago (no hard impact to head...my hip
 took care of that.). if price was a consideration i'd get
 a kiwi k21, i hear they are both good and cheap.

 be *mildly* mildly paranoid about the helmet, but don't get
 carried away. there are people on the net (like those 2% you
 mentioned) that do not consistently live on our planet...
