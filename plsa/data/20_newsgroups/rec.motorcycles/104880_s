 someone once sold heated motorcycle grips via mail order.  the were 
 aftermarket replacement grips that had the heating elements mlded into the 
 grip itself.  wires ran outside of the bars, from the grips to a switch and 
 finaly the battery.  cycle magazine tested them years ago and liked them.  
 dunno if they are still made.  might check with the snowmobile racers.
