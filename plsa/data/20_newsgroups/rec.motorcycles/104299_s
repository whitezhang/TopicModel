 	the word is "subrogation."  seems to me, if you're willing to wait
 for the money from scumbag's insurance, that you save having to pay the
 deductible.  however, if scumbag's insurance is scum insurance, then you may
 have to pay the deductible to get your insurance co.'s pack of rabid, large-
 fanged lawyers to recover the damages from scum insurance's lawyers.
 
 	sad, but true.  call it job security for lawyers.
