 it depends on the bike. once you've found a bike you're interested in, call
 some insurance companies for rates. some bikes are much cheaper to insure than
 you might think (my ex-500 only costs me $127/year in st. louis; i'm 27)

 for a first bike, i recommend 500cc's or less. and a bike short enough to get
 both feet on the ground when you stop.
  
 the one piece of advice everyone will give you is to take a motorcycle safety
 foundation rider's course. see a dealer for details. in some states, completion
 of such a course can give you a break on insurance. it will also teach you
 to ride properly from the beginning, so you won't learn any bad habits.
 
 good luck. riding a motorcycle is the most fun you can have, naked or otherwise.
