 has anyone any experience with the (new?) yamaha cyclelok ?
 
 it looks like it uses the same hardened steel as a kryptonite u lock,
 but unlike a u lock, it is hinged in 5 places and opens out to a large
 rectangle (longer length than any u lock i have seen, plus it folds down
 to real small), so you could lock the rear tire to a steel post for example.
 
 i was curious as to how well the jointed sections would stand up to attack ?
