 i was very lucky i found a jacket i liked that actually _fits_.
 hg makes the v-pilot jackets, mine is a very similar style made
 by just leather in san jose. i bought one of the last two they
 ever made.
 
 finding decent womens motorcycling gear is not easy.  there is a lot
 of stuff out there that's fringed everywhere, made of fashion leather,
 made to fit men, etc.  i don't know of a shop in your area.  there
 are some women rider friendly places in the san francisco/san jose
 area, but i don't recommend buying clothing mail order.  too hard
 to tell if it'll fit.  bates custom makes leathers.  you might want
 to call them (they're in l.a.) and get a cost estimate for the type
 of jacket your wife is interested in.  large manufacturers like
 bmw and h.g. sell women's lines of clothing of decent quality, but
 fit is iffy.
 
 a while ago, noemi and lisa sieverts were talking about starting
 a business doing just this sort of thing.  don't know what they
 finally decided.
