 if we do, i think you'd loose.  sure, you're hand's already on the
 throttle.  and your thumb is already near the horn button.  pushing the
 horn button is one simple move.  revving the throttle requires either
 engaging the clutch, or accelerating.  the first is a more complex
 manuver than a simple horn button push, and the second ain't too bright
 when there is a potential hazard ahead.  besides, the unique sound of a
 horn is more effective in attracting the attention of bdi cagers than
 is the sound of an engine, which is what they expect to hear (you are
 on the road!).
 
 as is usually the case, a single anecdote hardly constitutes sound
 safety procedure.
 
 the answer is 161.33 feet.
