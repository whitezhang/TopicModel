 anyone catch the tv show law & order last night (at least here in
 nyc)?  they "the law enforcement people", needed to catch a member of
 dod (department of doom) for inflicting a computer virus in a
 hospital's mainframe which ended up killing two people because wrong
 amounts of medication were given to them.
 
 anyhow, is "department of doom" on the list?
