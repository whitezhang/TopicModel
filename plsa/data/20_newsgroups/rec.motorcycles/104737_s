 about a year and half ago when i first started riding, i took a msf course. i
 have taken those lessons to heart.  over the past year i have had only a few 
 near collisions with traffic morons on four wheels.  yesterday i got to add
 another to the list but with this one i felt the most helpless.  i am sitting
 at a light about 1 - 2 car lengths behind a car, a wise decsion.  suddenly i 
 hear screeching tires.  i dart my eyes to my mirrors and realize it's the 
 moroon flying up right behind me, in my panic i pop my clutch and stall the
 bike.  luckily the guy stops a foot behind my rear wheel.
 
 i understand why you theoretically stop so far behind a car but can you
 really in actuality avoid such an incident?  suggestions?
