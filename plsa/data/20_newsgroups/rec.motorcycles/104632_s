 
 i just noticed that my halogen table lamp runs off 12 volts.
 the big thinngy that plugs into the wall says 12 volts dc,  20ma
 
 the question is: can i trickle charge the battery on my cb650
 with it?
 
 i don't know the rating of the battery, but it is a factory
 intalled one. 
 
 
 thanks,
 sanjay
