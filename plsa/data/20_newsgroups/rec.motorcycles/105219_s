 ]i was enjoying lunch this saturday at foodies in milford nh with an assortment
 ]of other nedod folks when dean cookson ( yes he has not left the 
 ]country, yet) mentioned that the wiring diagram of the vfr750 
 ]shows that  the light switch is a three position switch. 
 
 ]high beam
 ]low beam
 ]both beams
 
 ]well the actual ergonomics of the switch make it appear to be a
 ]2 position switch, but sure enough as deam expected , when
 ]you balance the toggle switch in the center position both the high
 ]and low beams go on.
 
 ]this provides a very nice light coverage of the road.
 
 ]this is true for the st11 and the vfr750 and i would expect for any 
 ]other late model honda with the standard two position light switch.
 
 ]thanks to dean for reading the schematics, try it you'll like it.
 
 	be a bit careful doing this; i used to balance the switch on my gs550b
 avec cibie' h4 insert so that both beams were on.  i eventually fried the
 main ignition switch, as it wasn't designed to pass that sort of current.
