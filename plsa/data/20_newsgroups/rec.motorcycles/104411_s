 	yup.  unfortunately, as has been pointed out, the cost of insurance
 does not go down with no fault.  the crappiest drivers make out like bandits
 because they no longer have to bear the responsibility of paying for
 insurance that they have boosted in price for themselves by being crappy
 drivers.  the good drivers now pay through the nose to spread the cost of
 the crappy drivers' actions, and that's not fair.
 
 	any plan that caps rates for crappy drivers is inherently a piece of
 shit, because the rest of us end up paying more.
 
 	any plan that uses speeding tickets as a basis for raising rates is
 also a piece of shit as it is based upon the lie that faster drivers are
 inherently less safe than slower drivers, and the nhtsa disproved that two
 years ago now.
