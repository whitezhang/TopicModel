 > can someone recommend how to ship a motorcycle from san francisco
 > to seattle?  and how much might it cost?
 
 i shipped my k75s from portland oregon to daytona for this years
 bike week (i rode it back!).  the company i used is the federal co's.
 you can reach them at 1-800-747-4100 ex 214.  you either have to be
 a ama member, or maybe it is just a discount for ama, not sure.
 (call 1-800-ama-join to become an ama member)
 
 the shipping cost is based on the number of miles.  it cost me about $500
 for portland to orlando.  $80 of that was insurance.  all i had to do is
 ride it to the shipping dock and siphon the gas out.  i think they can
 also pick up the bike from any business.  the bike arrived on-time at
 orlando.  all i had to do was adjust the mirrors and add gas.  the bike
 was in perfect shape!
