 i really didn't mean to imply that my ninja was any better than a duc.  
 i have to talked to a few duc owners (750ss owners in particular) who
 say that the power is something less than overwhelming.  that said,
 i would love to have a 900ss.  i guess i should have been a bit more
 specific.  if you have something that weighs that same as the 750, go 
 for the extra cubes.  
 
 i think that fact that i own a gtv-6 shows that i don't care about maximum
 power (it's no slug though) to the exclusion of everything else.  the note 
 and the handling are more important to me.  i just bought a ninja because i 
 couldn't afford a duc.
 
 didn't mean to ruffle any feathers, i'll probably be getting a 900ss next
 year...
