 my kawasaki kz 750 l4 has 2-3 millimetres of play on the gearchange
 pedal axle, in other words, i can move the axle sideways & up-and-down
 for few millimetres to each direction. this doesn't bother me when
 riding, but i guess fixing it wouldn't hurt. last summer i took the
 bike to a shop to have the valves adjusted, and the mechanic mentioned
 that it should be an easy job. all i would have to do is to remove the
 front sprocket cover and replace a bushing or a seal that i would find
 there. well, upon a closer inspection i discovered that the gearchange
 axle doesn't even run through the sprocket cover. it seems that, in
 addition to removing the cover, i would have at least to remove the
 sprocket and then the cover that is behind the sprocket.
 
 question : would removing this small cover from the left side of the
 engine enable me to lay my hands on that bushing/seal (don't know the
 exact term in english, sorry) ?
 
 question : has anybody done this disassembly job for this or some
 other purpose ? does the oil, for example, stay inside the engine ?
 
 thanks !
