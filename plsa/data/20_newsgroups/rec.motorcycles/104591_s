 hey, man, you brought it up.  i agree completely, driving drunk is really
 stupid, and i understand and appreciate that you feel bad about it.  but
 dwi is endemic in our society.  it is a real problem.  and we, as 
 motorcyclists, can be in the worst of vulnerable positions around a drunk
 driver.  (alert readers might remember that last year i witnessed a dwi
 accident (right bloody in front of me), and was unable to save the life 
 of one of the participants, as i reported here.)  also, drunk driving by
 motorcyclists is a prime cause of their injury and death, which raises the
 insurance rates, forces stupidly restrictive laws, and turns the public
 against those of us who ride responsibly.
 
 in my view, drunk driving should carry a mandatory prison sentence.
 it is one of the traffic offenses which is not a public funds issue,
 but a genuine safety issue.  so if you bring up the subject on rec.moto,
 admitting having been caught dwi, and looking for sympathy over the 
 consequences, don't expect people to respond with warm wishes.
