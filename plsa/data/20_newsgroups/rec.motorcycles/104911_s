   when the bugs are splatting on the side of my helmet instead
   of the faceshield.  when semis are on their side in the downwind
   ditch.  when i can't see the road for all the tumbleweeds rolling
   past.  when the airborne sand/gravel is sandblasting my paint job.
   when all of the above is happening at once in the middle of wonderful
   wyldoming.
 
   well, it *was* gusting to 87 mph.
 
   cheers,
