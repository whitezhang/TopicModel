 jim,
 
 i hope you never drive (or ride) when:
 
 you have been drinking 
 you have been taking prescription drugs
 you didn't get enough sleep the night before
 you are upset with your girlfriend
 you just didn't feel like your brain was talking to your body
 you think you are at laguna seca and want to break the lap record
 
 any of the above situations have the potential for harm (read death)
 people make mistakesif you have never endangered someone else by driving a vehicle in an
 unsafe manner, then go right ahead and bitch about mr infante misuse
 of a motor vehicle.  otherwise, think about your own driving responsibilities.
 
 i am sorry about the loss of your friends, but it could just as well
 been the idiot who bought a volvo because he has problems falling asleep at the
 wheel.
