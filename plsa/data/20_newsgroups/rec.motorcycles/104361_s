 in three years of riding in the cities of san jose,
 santa clara, and sunnyvale i never came into any
 conflict with the local police over my lane splitting
 habits (all three of these cities were listed earlier
 as being anti-splitting in one way or another).  i
 can't say whether this was due to luck, police
 kindness, or there not actually being any ordinances
 against it in these cities, so i continue.....
