 to maintain my senses at their sharpest, i never eat a full meal
 within 24 hrs of a ride.   i've tried slim fast lite before a 
 ride but found that my lap times around the parliament buildings suffered 
 0.1 secs.   the resultant 70 pound weight loss over the summer
 just sharpens my bike's handling and i can always look
 forward to a winter of carbo-loading.
