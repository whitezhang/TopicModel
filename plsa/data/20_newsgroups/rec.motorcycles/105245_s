 
 i'm just starting out with motorcycles,  i've read up on the subject a bit,
 talked to many of my friends who own/ride bikes and encourage me to do the
 same.  but when i ask about what kind of bike i should be looking at... i get
 varied answers.
 
 
 i'm 6'3", about 230#, large/athletic build...  i suppose that would help to
 determine the size bike i'd want.  i want something that's going to be fast and
 powerful enough to satisfy certain cravings once i'm used to it.  i also want
 something that is not going to be like a bronc my first time out.  any ideas?!
