 it is heavy, the 91 is mid 600's dry, that is the one major drawback
 of the st.

 can you say " tourque monster" the test drive sold me on the bike, 
 lot's of bite anywhere above 2500 in any gear.

 this is the essence of the bike, move the throttle and itr accelerates 
 any gear anywhere anytime, i frequently find myself at the dod min 
 during a casual passing maneuver.

 this is a function of the weight, you have to be aggresive with the brake
 squeze, actually as tested by cycle world and an expert rider the st
 stopped faster then the comparable models from bmw, and yamaha even with 
 the extra weight and gas .

 you must countersteer the st for every turn and movement short
 of the classic pothole wiggle. just forget ever leaning into a 
 turn again. it must be countersteered into every turn and then 
 responds nicely.

 faster then i've ever gone, i 'd hate to buy this bike after your 
 short "break in period"

 not true, the side stand is well designed for the weight and will hold 
 the bike nicely on dirt. i am able to easily get the bike up on
 the center stand, just step down on the stand instead of pulling
 up on the bike.

 keep looking the 91 left overs if available are going for 72-7700.
 i love mine and i haven't found a better value then the st for 7500.
 remember you get 3 years unlimited mileage warranty.
