 bzzzt.  the 750ss is 40 pounds lighter than the 900ss.  i personally,
 and recently, witnessed my 750ss do a stoppie with a larger-than-
 average rider aboard.  he said it took two fingers on that measely
 single front disk to accomplish the task.  how much more brake do
 you need?

 i haven't gone over 4000 rpm yet (still in break in) and haven't
 had a problem with the 750ss being too slow.  the limited steering
 lock can be a problem if you aren't prepared for it.  the mirrors
 are very good, imho.  someone forgot to tell their designer about
 the "whazza behind you, she no matta" philosophy.
