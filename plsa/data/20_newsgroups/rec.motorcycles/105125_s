 	final drive(27/8)

 	all brackets, brake hdware, footrests etc.
 	the colour scheme used is the original bmw optional bristol grey
 	items not painted are: earles rigid section(needs straightening,
 		this rigid section was bent when i received it, not from 
 		being mounted to the r60us frame),earles swingarm and the 
 		headlight shell. i have the paintthat was used and can 
 		finish the non-painted items if desired. the striping 
 		was done by holt design.
 	not included: engine, gearbox, electrics, seat.
 
 this is a clean and tidy project. the project was terminated due to lack of
 	time and the r69(35hp) engine that was to be used was transferred 
 	to another project. i would prefer to sell the package as whole.
 	i am negotiable as to what can be included in the package, i will
 	not separate any of the painted items. i am willing to take /2
 	spares in trade.
