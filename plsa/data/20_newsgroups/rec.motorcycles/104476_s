 i didn't say there was no value - all i said was that it is very confusing
 to newbies.

 bill, you are kidding yourself here. firstly, motorcycles do not steer
 themselves - only the rider can do that. secondly, it is the adhesion of the
 tyre on the road, the suspension geometry  and the ground clearance of the
  motorcycle which dictate how quickly you can swerve to avoid obstacles, and
 not the knowledge of physics between the rider's ears. are you seriously
 suggesting that countersteering knowledge enables you to corner faster
 or more competently than you could manage otherwise??

 formal training in this country (as far as i am aware) does not include
 countersteering theory.  i found out about countersteering about six years ago,
 from a physics lecturer who was also a motorcyclist. i didn't believe him
 at first when he said i steered my bike to the right to make it turn left,
 but i went out and analysed closely what i was doing, and realized he was 
 right! it's an interesting bit of knowledge, and i've had a lot of fun since
 then telling others about it, who were at first as sceptical as i was. but
 that's all it is - an interesting bit of knowledge, and to claim that
 it is essential for all bikers to know it, or that you can corner faster
 or better as a result, is absurd.
 
 formal training is in my view absolutely essential if you're going to
 be able to ride a bike properly and safely. but by including countersteering
 theory in newbie courses we are confusing people unnecessarily, right at
 the time when there are *far* more important matters for them to learn.
 and that was my original point.
