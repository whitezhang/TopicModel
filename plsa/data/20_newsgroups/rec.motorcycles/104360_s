 the problem is that squids and badassbikers can't recognize
 each other's waves.  when you're riding a cruiser, you "wave"
 by lifting two or three fingers of the left hand, without
 first removing that hand from the handlebar.  when you're
 riding a crotch rocket, you lower the left hand to about
 ankle level, palm forward, and call that a wave.
 
 generic bike riders actually seem to raise the hand entirely
 off the handlebar and wave it around, so it's easy to tell
 when they're waving.
