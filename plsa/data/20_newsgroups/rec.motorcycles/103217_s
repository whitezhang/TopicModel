 what a great day! got back home last night from some fantastic skiing
 in colorado, and put the battery back in the fxstc. cleaned the plugs,
 opened up the petcock, waited a minute, hit the starter, and bingo it
 started up like a charm! spent a restless night anticipating the first
 ride du saison, and off i went this morning to get my state inspection
 done. now my bike is stock (so far) except for hd slash-cut pipes, and
 all went well with my new hampshire state inspection (meaning all my
 lights worked ok) until the dude produces a decibel meter and tells me
 about the new nh law about mc noise.....huh?  sez i....and he has me
 start her up and rev to about 3000 rpm....i fail cuz i register 120 db,
 and the max allowed is 110! if i fail with these pipes, there are gonna
 be a whole lotta seriously pissed off bikers round here when they go
 for inspection.

 but hey, its a new experience! i have never really felt like a menace
 to society before! i parked, dismounted and walked in to my building
 with a slight swagger to my step, and a narrow lidded look... i sensed
 my faculty colleagues unease with my new intimidating status...and
 women's glances seemed to linger just a little longer....or perhaps
 that was my imagination.......*sigh*
 
 now i need to install my new bub pipes and single fire ignition....i
 wonder how i will do after that!?
