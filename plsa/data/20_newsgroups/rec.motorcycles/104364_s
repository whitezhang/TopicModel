 not too hard to remember, i bought a gs1000 new in '78. :-) it was
 3rd place in the '78 speed wars (behind the cbx & xs eleven) with a
 11.8 @ 113 1/4 mile, and 75 horses. that wouldn't even make a good 600
 these days. then again, i paid $2800 for it, so technology isn't the
 only thing that's changed. of course i'd still rather ride the old gs
 across three states than any of the 600's.
 
 i guess it's an indication of how much things have changed that a 12
 second 400 didn't seem too far out of line.
