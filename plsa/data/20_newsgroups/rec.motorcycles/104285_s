    watch out.  often when some scumbag steals the cover, that means
    that they were or are looking to steal the bike.  in my case, i
    had a faded cover stolen off a bmw r100rs that was stashed in an
    apartment carport and not visible from the street.  they evidently
    decided the beemer wasn't worth stealing, but did try the next night to
    steal a honda hurricane 600 parked in the next apartment building.
    a neighbor heard them wheeling it out and called the cops.
 
 
 i know this is just setting myself up, but this is actually one of the
 things that is really good about bmw bikes.  from all accounts i've
 heard practically no one steals bmws. probably it is similar for moto
 guzzis and other relative "exotics" since there isn't a large demand
 for parts and the bike would be much easier to track down. it seems
 that the most stolen bikes are harleys and 600cc jap sport bikes.
