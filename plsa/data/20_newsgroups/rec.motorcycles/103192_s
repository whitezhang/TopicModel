 i took an alcohol server's class a few years ago.  (what the hey- my employer
 paid for it...)
 
 we were told that the 1 drink / hour rule was written with 80 proof booze
 and a 195 pound person in mind.  drinking cuervo gold, weighing in @ 140,
 i obviously will get drunk faster than the theoretical person mentioned
 above.  worse, imagine rum & coke made with bacardi 151...
 
 mind you all, that's for getting too drunk to drive a car.  i may only
 have been riding for a month or so, but i plan my evenings with a very
 rigid exclusive or statement: either don't drink, or don't ride.
 pretty simple.
