 um, you gotta understand these "salesdroids" as you call them.  they look at
 it this way: burn lotsa tire; make lotsa money.  i'm sure s/ he knew how
 stupid the "hg" was.  would you seriously stop them from burning off 
 a seasons worth of tire??  the squids probably would buy metzelers or some
 good low profile tire anyhow...
 
 yep.  them droids sure a sneaky bastards! ;)
