 sigh.   that's music to my ears, after all the complaining lois did
 about the seat on my bmw...
 
 >the best passengers are those which are unobtrusive.  echo the movements
 >and lean of your rider.  look over the shoulder thats most comfortable,
 >but during turns look over the shoulder on the inside of the turn.
 
 i've found that the phrase "sack of potatoes" works pretty well in
 describing to a passenger how s/he should act.
 
 >switch your hands to the guardrail to stretch your shoulders, but be

 >still there. :)  the guard rail isn't as safe as holding onto your rider.
 
 on a long ride with my ex-girlfriend nancy, i would notice her
 drifting off every so often (we were droning down highway 101 to la).
 i probably wouldn't have been aware of this if she hadn't been in the
 habit of squeezing my butt with her knees to hold on.   good advice.
