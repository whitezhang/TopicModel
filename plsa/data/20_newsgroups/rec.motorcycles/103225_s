 yeah, hypothermia is much more detrimemtal to your judgement and reactions
 than people realise. i wish i had the patience to stop when i should. one
 day i'll pay for it....
 
 if you  begin to shiver - stop and warm up thoroughly. if you leave it
 till the shivering stops, this doesnt mean you're ok again, it means 
 you're a danger to yourself and everyone else on the road - your brain
 and body are working about as fast as a tree grows. you will not realise
 this yourself till you hit something. the next stage is passing out. 
 this usually means falling off.
