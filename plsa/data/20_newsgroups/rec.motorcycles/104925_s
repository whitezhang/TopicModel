 i have an '89 kawasaki kx 80.  it is in mint condition and starts on the first
 kick every time.  i have outgrown the bike, and am considering selling it.  i
 was told i should ask around $900.  does that sound right or should it be
 higher/lower?
     also, i am looking for a used zx-7.  how much do i have to spend, and what
 year should i look for to get a bike without paying an arm and a leg????
     thanks for the help!
