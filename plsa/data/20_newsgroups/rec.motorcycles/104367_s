 if i remember right, i heard that in the last election, only 18% of the
 members actually cast votes. i wonder if the current board and their
 friends and relatives make up 18% of the membership :-) :-)  i certainly
 plan on staying with the club long enough to vote and to see the results.

 i wouldn't support the moa becoming politically active in that sense.
 the ama already knows how to do that and i'd rather see the moa support
 the ama in a manner that the *ama* needs. i think that more could be
 accomplished from one strong front rather than two not neccessarily 
 coordinated ones.
