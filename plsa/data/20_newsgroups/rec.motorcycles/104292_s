   not with a hub cap but one of those "lumber yard delivery
 trucks" made life interesting when he hit a 'dip' in the road
 and several sheets of sheetrock and a dozen 5 gallon cans of
 spackle came off at 70 mph. it got real interesting for about
 20 seconds or so. had to use a wood mallet to get all the dried
 spackle off me, the helmet and the bike when i got home. thanks 
 to the bob tail kenworth between me and the lumber truck i had
 a "path" to drive through he made with his tires (and threw up
 the corresponding monsoon from those tires as he ran over
 what ever cans of spackle didn't burst in impact). a car in
 front of me in the right lane hit her brakes, did a 360 and
 nailed a bridge abutment half way through the second 360.
 
 the messiest time was in san diego in 69' was on my way
 back to the apartment in ocean beach on my sportster and
 had just picked up a shake, burger n fries from jack in
 the box and stuffed em in my foul weather jacket when the
 milk shake opened up on nimitz blvd at 50 mph, nothing
 like the smell of vanilla milk shake cooking on the
 engine as it runs down your groin and legs and 15 people
 waiting in back of you to make the same left turn you are.
