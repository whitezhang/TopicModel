 	i must have missed the article on the spagthorpe viking.  was
 that the one with the little illuminated dragon's head on the front
 fender, a style later copied by indian, and the round side covers?

 	you can forget this line of reasoning.  when an animal
 decides to take you, there's nothing you can do about it.  it has
 something to do with their genetics.  i was putting along at a
 mere 20mph or so, gravel road with few loose rocks on it (as in,
 just like bad concrete), and 2200lbs of swinging beef jumped a
 fence, came out of the ditch, and rammed me!  when i saw her jump
 the fence i went for the gas, since she was about 20 feet ahead
 of me but a good forty to the side.  damn cow literally chased me
 down and nailed me.  no damage to cow, a bent case guard and a
 severely annoyed rider were the only casualties.  if i had my
 shotgun i'd still be eating steak.  nope, if 2200lbs of cow
 can hit me when i'm actively evading, forget a much more
 manueverable dog.  just run them over.
