 
 there was an article in one of the u.k. dailies this week
 about a soccer goalkeeper who had to be carried off the
 field after a collision with a ford sierra cage.
 
 seems the cage driver wanted to turn around, but needed to
 drive onto the pitch to do this, so he waited till the ball
 and most of the players were up the other end. unfortunately,
 as soon as he started his manouvre someone booted the ball back down
 the pitch, the goalkeeper ran backwards towards his goal, straight
 into the cage!
