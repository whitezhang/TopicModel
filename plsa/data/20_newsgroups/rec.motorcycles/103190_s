 
 
 as summer approaches, the usual preparations are being made...
 
 me was thinking of going for some overnite camping trips in the local
 state forests. for that i was planning to get a backpack/rucksack. 
 the next question is how shall i carry the thing on the bike, given
 the metal frame and all. i have a big backrest (approx 12" high) and
 was hoping that i would be able to bungee cord the backpack to the backrest.
 
 any one have any experiences on such experimentation?
 
 taking the idea further, what would happen if the backpack was fully
 loaded with a full load (40lbs). is the load distribution going to 
 be very severly affected? how will the bike perform with such a load 
 clinging to the back rest. if i really secure it, with no shifting, 
 do i still increase my chances of surfing?
 
 
 collective r.m. wisdom requested.  
 
 
 p.s. i really can't afford leather pants. boots and jeans are
 all i can make do with. what you think of the knee protectors
 which rollerbladers use - the one l.l.bean and like sells. is 
 that a bad idea (tm). are there any equivalents?
