 oh yeah, all the time.  on a nice spring/summer day, i roll down the window
 and drive around looking for bikes.  when a bike motors by in the opposite
 direction, i stick my arm out and hi5'em.  my arm feels like a million 
 bucks when i'm doing this a 60km/h.  i do the same thing with cyclists.
 the only problem with hi5ing a cyclist is their always in the right hand lane.
 i hafta roll down the other window and hi5 them on the back.  oh well, i 
 think they appreciate the thought. 
 
 regards, ted.
