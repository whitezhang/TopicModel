 would anyone out there in dodland be able to help me out in giving me
 a contact to purchase a pair of military air-borne combat boots (9 1/2
 d in size).  these boots (so i have read here on rec.moto) are calf
 height boots that use only velcro for enclosure.  i have phoned around
 and nobody seems to carry such an item.  i admit i have not gone into
 the deepest bowels of nyc yet for the search but i have made some
 calls to several of the bigger army/navy type stores with no luck.
 
 anyone out there know of a place that does carry such an item as well
 as does mail order?  any help would be appreciated.
