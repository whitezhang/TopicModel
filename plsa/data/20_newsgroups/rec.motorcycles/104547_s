 if you do make it into new york state, the palisades interstate parkway is a
 pleasant ride (beautiful scenery, good road surface, minimal traffic).  you
 may also want to take a sidetrip along seven lakes drive just off the parkway
 for the same reasons plus the road sweeps up and down along the hills with
 sweeping turns under old forest canopy.
