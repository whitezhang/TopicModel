 i got a male mallard duck in the chest once.
 
 it was like being kicked by my karate instructor.
 
 no accident, but my eyes were tearing so hard, and i was wheezing
 so loudly, that it's quite remarkable that i was able to come
 to a stop with the rubber side up.
 
 the duck, btw, lived, and seemed quite healthy, though we both
 sat by the roadside and shook our heads for a few minutes.
 
 the bruise went from my right collar bone all the way down to
 my belly button.
 
 regards, charles
