 
 i recently sold my nighthawk in order to upgrade to a zippy little sport
 bike.  i am, however, partial to the bigger zippy bikes like the gsx-r 750.
 
 there is only one in my town for sale, and he is not sure whether he wants
 to part with it or not!
 
 please send me email if you would like to sell yours, know of one for sale,
 or could just offer details on the performance of yours even if you wouldn't
 sell.
 
 i appreciate any help!
