 	per gallon (bushel) perhaps. unfortunately they eat the same amount
 every day no matter how much you ride them. and if you don't fuel them they
 die. on an annual basis, i spend much less on bike stuff than amy the wonder
 wife does on horse stuff. she has two horses, i've got umm, lesseee, 11 bikes.
 i ride constantly, she rides four or five times a week. even if you count 
 insurance and the cost of the garage i built, i'm getting off cheaper than 
 she is. and having more fun (imho).
