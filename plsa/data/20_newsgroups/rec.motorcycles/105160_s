 yup. do it whenever i am in the cage (which is not often if its riding weather
 ... ie no snow). i find arm out and down and kinda finger wave works best for
 sport bikes and arm out/up works best for harleys. similar to how i wave when
 i am on the bike.

 done what? why jody we would never, ever even dream of assuming that a young
 lady of such refined breeding and taste would even consider such things. i mean
 some matters do not even have to be discussed, by civilized beings...
 
 but, in confidence, just between the "two of us", not even once. or perhaps
 got excited thinking about it. i know that i do... ;->
