 because riding a passenger doesn't really depend on the type of bike.
 the things you want a passenger to do/not do is the same.  ergo, if he's
 asking advice, i reasoned he doesn't have much practice, period.  if
 you say he does, fine.  i still wouldn't take the uninitiated up a
 road that's all switch backs and reverse/center/uncrowned roadway, not
 to mention the bdcs and squids who will also be on that particular
 road.  he asked for advice, and even though it wasn't what he meant,
 i still consider it some of the best i've read.
