 i think most people see your intended humor, i do, i liked the article.
 you seem to forget that you've stepped into the political arena. as well
 intentioned as you may intend something you're walking through a china
 store carrying that /2 on your head. everything you say or do says something
 about how you would represent the membership on any given day. you don't
 have to look far in american politics to see what a few light hearted
 jokes about one segment of the population can do to someone in the limelight.
 
 obmoto: i did manage to squeak in a reference to a /2 ;-)
