 in shreveport, back when i was riding the purple water buffalo, i jumped an 
 intersection in front of a cop who was waiting for the light!  the side of 
 the street he was on was hidden buy a building on the corner and i didn't 
 see him till i was airborne in the middle of the intersection.  i was 
 parked, had my helment off and my liscence out before he turned the corner.  
 he chewed my ass out and let me go!  i will be the first to admit it was a 
 very squidly thing to do, jumping the intersection like that.  the cop 
 should have nailed me.  i find that if you are polite, respectfull and 
 honest, they will normaly let you get away with a lot of stuff.
 
 p.s. the shock mounts folded up the next day.  i guess i deserved that!
