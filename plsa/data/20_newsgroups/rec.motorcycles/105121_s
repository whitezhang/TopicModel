 doesn't sound like they attended, though, does it?  in fact, if we riders
 need friends, it sounds a lot like we might have a whole townfull from 
 lynn's description, especially if the same crowd gets invited back
 to party some more year after year.

 you seem to be one of very few bent out of shape over these "lesser
 indiscretions".  if the towns-people aren't ruffled by the
 "indiscretions" and the partyers aren't either, maybe the "indiscretions"
 don't amount to anything more threatening or damaging than harmless 
 good-natured rowdiness among consenting adults.  the only thing that 
 really bothered me about the description was the knee-deep empty beer cans 
 in the street, but maybe the town had a plan to deal with that since they 
 helped set up the party in the first place.  if i lived there and the
 bikers' previous visits had established a record of mutual cooperation
 and good intentions, i'd certainly rather they stick around and party
 than go riding off into the night impaired and maybe get hurt or killed.

 if it doesn't hurt anyone, and all the parties to the party benefit
 and consider the entire activity to be benign and harmless, then who 
 needs to "permit" or "justify" it?  you?  why do *you* need to do that?

 ironically, these particular townsfolk probably are in the minority that
 don't happen to fit the stereotype you describe.  they've developed a
 friendly long-term mutually-beneficial relationship with a group of 
 motorcyclists, and aren't as burdened with mc-ignorance as is the general
 population because of it.

 if such a need exists, it surely must come from within.

 well, you got the "self-righteous wusses" part right, anyway.
