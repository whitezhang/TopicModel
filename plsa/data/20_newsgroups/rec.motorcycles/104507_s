 the following numbers are approximate, and will no doubt get me flamed:
 
 helmet (new, but cheap)					$100
 jacket (used or very cheap)				$100
 gloves (nothing special)				$ 20
 motorcycle safety foundation riding course (a must!)	$140
 
 that leaves you between $900 and $1000 (depending on the accuracy
 of my numbers) to buy a used bike, get it registered, get it
 insured, and get it running properly. i'd say you're cutting
 it close. perhaps if your parents are reasonable, and you indicated
 your wish to learn to ride safely, you could get them to pick up
 the cost of the msf course and some of the safety gear. early
 holiday presents or whatever. those are one-time (well, long-term
 anyway) investments, and you could spend your money on the actual
 bike, insurance, registration, and maintenance.
