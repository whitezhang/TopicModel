 heavy for a beginner bike it is; 415 pounds it isn't, except maybe in
 some adman's dream.  with a full tank, it's in the area of 550 lbs,
 depending on year etc.

 the 1980 and '81 versions had a much better seat, imo.

 my regulator lasted over 100,000 miles, and didn't overcharge the battery.
 the wiring connectors in the charging path did get toasty though,
 tending to melt their insulation.  i suspect they were underspecified;
 it didn't help that they were well removed from cool air.
 
 battery access on the earlier bikes doesn't require tank removal.
 after you learn the drill, it's pretty straightforward.

 having bought replacement parts for several brands of motorcycles,
 i'll offer a grain of salt to be taken with dale's assessment.
