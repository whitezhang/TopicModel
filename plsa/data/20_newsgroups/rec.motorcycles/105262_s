 the first few times i pillioned someone whose safety was a great concern to
 me (as opposed to brothers, etc.), i almost got us both killed on several
 occasions.
 
 i was surprised to discover that it is much safer to just drive than to
 distract yourself by trying to be unusually cautious and concerned.  abruptly
 adopting a novel set of thought patterns and riding strategies while piloting
 a bike is just asking for trouble.
