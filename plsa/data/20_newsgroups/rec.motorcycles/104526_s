 hello everyone.  i'm new to motorcycles so no flames please.  i don't
 have my bike yet so i need a few pieces of information:
 
 1)  i only have about $1200-1300 to work with, so that would have 
 to cover everything (bike, helmet, anything else that i'm too 
 ignorant to know i need to buy)
 
 2)  what is buying a bike going to do to my insurance?  i turn 18 in 
 about a month so my parents have been taking care of my insurance up
 till now, and i need a comprehensive list of costs that buying a 
 motorcycle is going to insure (i live in washington dc if that makes
 a difference)
 
 3)  any recommendations on what i should buy/where i should look for it?
 
 4)  in dc, as i imagine it is in every other state (ok, ok, we're not a 
 state - we're not bitter ;)), you take the written test first and then
 get a learners permit.  however, i'm wondering how one goes about 
 learning to ride the bike proficiently enough so as to a) get a liscence
 and b) not kill oneself.  i don't know anyone with a bike who could 
 teach me, and the most advice i've heard is either "do you live near a
 field" or "do you have a friend with a pickup truck", the answers to both
 of which are no.  do i just ride around my neighborhood and hope for 
 the best?  i kind of live in a residential area but it's not suburbs.
 it's still the big city and i'm about a mile from downtown so that 
 doesn't seem too viable.  any stories on how you all learned?
 
 thanks for any replies in advance.
