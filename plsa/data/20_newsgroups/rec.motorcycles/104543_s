 i was posting to alt.locksmithing about the best methods for securing 
 a motorcycle.  i got several responses referring to the cobra lock
 (described below).  has anyone come across a store carrying this lock
 in the chicago area?
 
 any other feedback from someone who has used this?
 
 thanks for any info.,
 
 steve
