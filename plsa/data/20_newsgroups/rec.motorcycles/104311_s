 searched without luck for a faq here.  i need a left 85 aspencade
 mirror and honda wants $75 for it.  now if this were another piece
 of chrome to replace the black plastic that wings come so liberally
 supplied with i might be able to see that silly price, but a mirror
 is a piece of safety equipment. the fact that honda clearly places
 concern for their profits ahead of concern for my safety is enough
 to convince me that this (my third) wing will likely be my last.
 in the mean time, anyboby have a non-ripoff source for a mirror?
