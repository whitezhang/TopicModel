 i first heard it about academic politics but the same thought seems to
 apply to the bmwmoa
 
 "the politics is so dirty because the stakes are so small."
 
 who cares? i get my dues-worth from the ads and occasional technical
 articles in the "news". i skip the generally drab articles about someone's
 trek across iowa. if some folks get thrilled by the power of the bmwmoa,
 they deserve whatever thrills their sad lives provide.
 
 btw, i voted for new blood just to keep things stirred up.
