 i spoke to a sales dweeb in 3x, a ducati dealer here in blighty, and he had
 nothing good to say about them... it appears they are waaaay underpowered,
 (basically, it's the 750/900 with a 400cc engine), and there have been some
 quality problems (rusty _frame_ !!).  save your pennies... buy the 900 :)
