 you made to the bike? a stage three kit from k/n or dynojet?

 	new carbs??? why would that fix it? you still have to get the 
 jetting right to match what seems to be a extremely overly lean condition.
 you added a more free flowing exhaust, and then higher flowing filters. 
 chances are it's to lean. but! this may not be,that's the big fun with 
 carb tuning. it's _very_ tricky. 
 
 	your one and only choice (unless you want to spend many hours
 fiddling with the carbs) is to take it to a guy witha  dyno and have he
 tune the carbs for your current set up. otherwise you'll be playing
 a guessing game for a long time...
