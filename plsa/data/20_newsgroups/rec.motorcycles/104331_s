 what y'all been talking about, but i have a few comments:

 there are a number of other factors that are very important, the three
 biggest being air velocity, air momentum and shock waves.
 velocity stacks have been used for years and are now being used inside
 of stock airboxes on a number of bikes.  at a tuned engine rpm, the
 stacks can greatly increase the speed, and thus momentum of the air
 rushing in.
 air momentum is critical in getting good air intake: the momentum of
 the air stack outside the combustion chamber will force its way inside
 long after the piston has begun its compressive up-stroke.
 shock waves are used to induce air intake and to prevent fresh air from
 escaping out the exzhaust ports.  shock waves are the product of expansion
 chambers or any other means of presenting a 'wall' (opening or closing)
 to the air in motion.  beyond this i am lost in the mystery of how they
 design for shock waves.
