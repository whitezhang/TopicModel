 we heard about this from a newspaper article.  journalists and editors
 always pick out the most interesting and sensational "facts" for our
 delectation.  as the editor of the sun once said: "we never let the
 facts get in the way of a good story".  you must have noticed how
 motorcyclists get treated by the press.  they thrive on hysteria,
 ignorance, sensationalism and one-upmanship.  unfortunately there's
 not enough salt to keep taking a pinch of.
