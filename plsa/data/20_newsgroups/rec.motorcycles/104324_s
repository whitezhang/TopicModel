 let's see how the weather is saturday or sunday. it sucks
 today. what time is good?
 you're welcome to give any of the ones i have a try.  as
 for the gargoyles, if you want mine you can have 'em.  i
 think the bridge of my nose holds them too far from my face.
 same deal for the two of my friends who tried them. for
 people who use them with a full face helmet, all bets are
 off. sorry if they fit you well and took my complaint
 personally. yes the oakleys are much more desirable squid
 attire. also the gargoyles aren't that ugly, even in my
 opinion, or i wouldn't have tried them.
