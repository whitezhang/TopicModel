 just in case the original poster was looking for a serious answer,
 i'll supply one.
 
 yes, even when steering no hands you do something quite similar
 to countersteering.  basically to turn left, you to a quick wiggle
 of the bike to the right first, causing a counteracting lean to
 occur to the left.  it is a lot more difficult to do on a motorcycle
 than a bicycle though, because of the extra weight.  (ok, so my
 motorcycle is heavy.  maybe yous isn't.)
