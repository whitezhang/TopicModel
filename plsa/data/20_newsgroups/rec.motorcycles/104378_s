 hi. i have been thinking about buying a motorcycle or a while now and i have
 some questions:
 
 -is there a buying guide for new/used motorcycles (that lists reliability, how
 to go about the buying process, what to look for, etc...)?
 -is there a pricing guide for new/used motorcycles (blue book)?
 
 also
 -are there any books/articles on riding cross country, motorcycle camping, etc?
 -is there an idiots' guide to motorcycles?
 
 any related information is helpful. please respond directly to me.
 
 thanks a lot.
