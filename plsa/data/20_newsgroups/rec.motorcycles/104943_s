 my previous posting on dog attacks must have generated some bad karma or
 something. i've weathered attempted dog attacks before using the
 approved method: slow down to screw up dog's triangulation of target,
 then take off and laugh at the dog, now far behind you. this time, it
 didn't work because i didn't have time. riding up the hill leading to my
 house, i encountered a liver-and-white springer spaniel (no relation to
 the springer softail, or the springer spagthorpe, a close relation to
 the spagthorpe viking). actually, the dog encountered me with intent to
 harm.
 
 but i digress: i was riding near the (unpainted) centerline of the
 roughly 30-foot wide road, doing between forty and sixty clicks (30 mph
 for the velocity-impaired). the dog shot at me from behind bushes on the
 left side of the road at an impossibly high speed. i later learned he
 had been accelerating from the front porch, about thirty feet away,
 heading down the very gently sloped approach to the side of the road. i
 saw the dog, and before you could say sipde, he was on me. boom! i took
 the dog in the left leg, and from the marks on the bike my leg was
 driven up the side of the bike with considerable force, making permanent
 marks on the plastic parts of the bike, and cracking one panel. i think
 i saw the dog spin around when i looked back, but my memory of this
 moment is hazy.
 
 i next turned around, and picked the most likely looking house. the
 apologetic woman explained that the dog was not seriously hurt (cut
 mouth) and hoped i was not hurt either. i could feel the pain in my
 shin, and expected a cool purple welt to form soon. sadly, it has not.
 so i'm left with a tender shin, and no cool battle scars!
 
 interestingly, the one thing that never happened was that the bike never
 moved off course. the not inconsiderable impact did not push the bike
 off course, nor did it cause me to put the bike out of control from some
 gut reaction to the sudden impact. delayed pain may have helped me
 here, as i didn't feel a sudden sharp pain that i can remember.
 
 what worries me about the accident is this: i don't think i could have
 prevented it except by traveling much slower than i was. this is not
 necessarily an unreasonable suggestion for a residential area, but i was
 riding around the speed limit. i worry about what would have happened if
 it had been a car instead of a dog, but i console myself with the
 thought that it would take a truly insane bdi cager to whip out of a
 blind driveway at 15-30 mph. for that matter, how many driveways are
 long enough for a car to hit 30 mph by the end?
 
 i eagerly await comment.
