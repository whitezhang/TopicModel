 easy rider (harleys, drugs, rednecks, new orleans), mad max (violence, dod 
 wanna-be's), time rider (honda thumper, time travel), on any sunday 
 (documentary about dirtbike racers, great!), the (great?) escape (steve 
 mcqueen, nazis), rebel without a cause (james dean, future dod'ers).  i 
 think the last two are right, they are old movies i haven't seen in years.
