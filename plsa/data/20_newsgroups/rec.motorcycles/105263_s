 sure don't know what bike was being worked on but it sure wasn't a
 virago.  i've owned both the 750 and 1100 and you can do the filter
 change in about 5 mins and nothing has to be removed.  obviously the
 "new" bike was modified as the stock machine is simple to work on.
   watching for imitators!!
