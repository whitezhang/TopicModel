 i have a cheap solar charger that i keep in my car.  i purchased it via
 some mail order catalog when the 4 year old battery in my oldsmobile would
 run down during summer when i was riding my bike more than driving my car.
 knowing i'd be selling the car in a year or so, i purchased the charger.
 believe it or not, the thing worked.  the battery held a charge and
 energetically started the car, many times after 4 or 5 weeks of just
 sitting.
 
 eventually i had to purchase a new battery anyway because the winter sun
 wasn't strong enough due to its low angle.
 
 i think i paid $29 or $30 for the charger.  there are more powerful, more
 expensive ones, but i purchased the cheapest one i could find.
 
 i've never used it on the bike because i have an e-z charger on it and
 keep it plugged in all the time the bike is garaged.
