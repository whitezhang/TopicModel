 an even better strategy is to leave less of a buffer between you and
 the car in front, but enough to manuver around it.  keep the bike in
 1st gear with the clutch handle squeezed in (how's that for
 engaged/disengaged?), until there are two cars stopped behind you.
 
 when the next bdi cager comes screaching in, simply ride up along side
 of the car in front of you.  you don't need to panic and do it, or you
 will pop the clutch and stall the engine.  do is smoothly, just
 rapidly.  the cage in front of you will provide much better protection
 than anything else (particularly empty road).
