 there seems to be some confusion between rednecks and white trash.
 the confusion is understandable, as there is substantial overlap
 between the two sets. let me see if i can clarify:
 
 rednecks: primarily use their backs instead of their minds to make a
 	living. usually somewhat ignorant (by somebody's standards,
 	anyway) because they have never held education above basic
 	reading/writing/math skills to be that important to their
 	eventual vocation. note i did not say stupid, just ignorant.
 	(they might be stupid, but then so are some high percentage
 	of any group).
 
 white trash: "white trash fit the stereotype referred to by the
 	word 'nigger' better than any black person i ever met, only
 	with the added 'bonus' that white trash are mean as hell."
 	-- my father. genuinely lazy (not just out of work or under-
 	qualified), good-for-nothing, dishonest, white people who are
 	mean as snakes. the "squeal like a pig" boys in _deliverance_
 	may or may not have been rednecks, but they were sure as hell
 	white trash.
 
 white trash are assuredly intolerant of anything outside of their
 group or level of understanding. rednecks may or may not be.
