  
  grf. dropped my shoei rf-200 off the seat of my bike while trying to rock 
 it onto it's centerstand, chipped the heck out of the paint on it...
  
  so i cheerfully spent $.59 on a bottle of testor's model paint and 
 repainted the scratches and chips for 20 minutes.
  
  then, while it was drying, i realized that i was out of smokes and that my 
 cage is not currently running... so i "had to" take my bike down to the 
 store. not wanting to mess up my paint job, i said "well, heck. i can just 
 use my old helmet".... this is your standard el cheapie openface... 
   
  i didn't notice a big difference when i switched to the shoei, but 
 switching back was really bad... 
  
  1) doesn't fit worth a damn, too wide in the sides, too short front to 
 back...
  2) with a faceplate, it's still bloody windy... with the shoei, i normally 
 ignore the face shield until i get up to about 30ish... with this one, 
 taxiing to the end of the driveway was too smegging much wind. 
  
   
  
  the question for the day is re: passenger helmets, if you don't know for 
 certain who's gonna ride with you (like say you meet them at a .... church 
 meeting, yeah, that's the ticket)... what are some guidelines? should i just 
 pick up another shoei in my size to have a backup helmet (xl), or should i 
 maybe get an inexpensive one of a smaller size to accomodate my likely 
 passenger?
