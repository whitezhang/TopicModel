 	good advice.

 	my ol'lady taps me on the shoulder to let me know she is 
 	uncomfortable.  i, in turn, am prepared for her to move about on the 
 	back of the bike.
 
 >- trust is essential. ... 
 	we had 1 bad crash (nail in rear tire on left hand sweeper at crest 
 	of hill on pavement/pea-gravel road) and her actions helped lessen 
 	the severity of it.  as we were crashing, she stayed upright in the 
 	saddle with her feet on the pegs and her hands about my waist.  i was
 	able to get the bike slowed down 10-15mph before we were high-sided.
 	she got off with a fair case of road rash and i had to have the doc 
 	remove a lot of rocks from my knee.  had she panicked we would have 
 	probably crashed at greater speed causing greater injury.
 	btw, as soon at the tire went flat, we went into violent tank-
 	slappers.  this is what she rode out in a "normal" riding posture!
