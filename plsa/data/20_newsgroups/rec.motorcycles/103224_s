 hell! this is warm. i retired my fleece from under the aerostich last 
 month when the temperature got aboce 40. try living a couple of years 
 on the dole, so you cant afford any heating. you put the gear on in
 october, abd you take it off again in may. getting out on the bike 
 seems like a luxury in comparison cos oyur usuallu going somewhere 
 warm. 
 
 its all relative.
