 (note: this is not about the l.a. or ny times)
 
 a few times a year, a funny thing happens: the bike engine runs
 perfectly.  completely smooth.  not that it runs poorly normally, but
 on these days, it is exceptional.  my theory is that the air density
 and moisture content of the air are such that i get complete
 combustion.  needless to say, it puts me in a great mood.
 
 the mood lasted for about 20 miles.  heading north on the 405
 freeway, about a mile or two south of the 10, my throttle stopped
 responding.... and i was between lanes.  nothing to do but make 
 my way over 4 lanes to the shoulder... initially by gliding, then
 by pushing.  at least traffic was heavy enough so that cars did
 not mind stopping for me.
 
 turned out to be a screw unscrewed inside my mikuni hs40 
 carb.  i keep hearing that one should keep all of the screws
 tight on a bike, but i never thought that i had to do that
 on the screws inside of a carb.  at least it was roadside
 fixable and i was on my way in hardly any time.
