 no. not at all. the viking was a trick little unit made way back when
 (forties? fifties?) when spag was trying to make a go of it in racing.
 the first iteration (the springer) was a boxer twin, very similar to max
 friz's famous design, but with an overhead "point cam" (see below for
 more on the valvetrain). the problem was that the thing had no ground
 clearance whatsoever. the solution was to curve the cylinder bores, so
 that the ground clearance was substantially increased:
 
 
       ==@==   <-springer motor (front)
                  viking motor (front) ->   \=@=/
 
 this is roughly the idea, except that the bores were gradually curved
 around a radius, as the pistons were loath to make a sharp-angled turn
 in the middle of their stroke. the engine also had curved connecting
 rods to accomodate the stroke.
 
 the engine stuck out so far because of its revolutionary (and still
 unique) overhead cam system. through the use of clever valve timing and
 and extrordinarily trick valve linkage, only a single cam lobe was
 required to drive both overhead valves.
 
 just as revolutionary was the hydraulic valve actuation, which used a
 pressurized stream of oil to power the "waterwheel" which kept the lobe
 spinning over. one side effect that required some rather brutal
 engineering fixes was that until the engine's oil pressure came up to
 normal, the engine's valve timing would be more or less random,
 resulting in some impressive start-up valve damage. the solution was a
 little hand crank that pressurized the cases before you started the
 beast, remarkably similar to the system used in new porsches to
 pressurize the oil system before the car is started (the cage, however,
 uses an electric oil pump. wimps).
 
 despite this fix, the engine had a nasty propensity for explosively
 firing its valves into the pistons when a cylinder would temporarily
 lose a bit of oil pressure in a corner. the solution was to run even
 higher oil pressures and change the gaskets and seals regularly. this
 was feasible because it was a racing engine.
 
 with just a single overhead lobe, and no pushrod/shaft/chain towers
 because of the hydraulic system, the head of the engine came to an
 almost perfect point:
 
                     /\
                    /()\   <-lobe
                   / xx \  <-complex linkage (not shown due to
  valvestems ->   / \  / \    complexity)
                 |  |   | |
                 |  |===| |
                     =0=  <---piston
                      |
                              note that the tip was not truly vertical
                              (it was at about a 70 degree angle to the
                              ground, and this drawing doesn't show the
                              curvature because there was none in the
                              head itself. the bore curve would start
                              about where the cylinder bore disappears in
                              this diagram
 
 
 the effect of the pointy heads on top of a pair of gently (pundits of
 the day even said sensuously) curved cylinders was much like a pair of
 finned viking horns poking out from beneath the gas tank. thus, the
 name.
 
 the vik was a moderately successful racer, lightning fast when it
 worked, but plagued by problems relating to its revolutionary
 technology. eventually, it was dumped when spag finally realized that
 racing was not where the spagthorpe name would be made. the machines
 were raced for another year or two by privateers, and their fate
 (approximately six vikings were made, plus one or possibly two
 springers. confusing the issue is one old spag staffer who swears up and
 down that this machine was tooled for production, and that as many as
 twenty or thirty machines may have come off the line. however, no modern
 record of a production viking has survived, and most motorcycle
 historians discount this story.
