 one of my brothers had spent a lot of time practicing bizzare tricks on
 his megabuck/micromass bike. he said he once repelled a dog attack by
 picking up the rear of the bike and smacking the dog in the side of the
 head with the rear wheel. the dog had _no_ idea what hit him, and he
 fled quite rapidly. then again, he could jump garbage cans without a
 ramp, so i don't think i'd care to try this one on a motorcycle.

 that's almost unfair, i've never seen a dog that could use a phone. :-)
