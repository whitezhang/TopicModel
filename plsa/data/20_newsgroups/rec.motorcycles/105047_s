 any lock including the kyptonite utypes are easy to break into if the person has
 the proper supplies and/or motivation. 3 minutes and your bike is gone!
 i would be glad to explain but i dont want to contribute to any unlawful
 activities. especially since i have a bike that i would hate to see ripped off
 by such a trival tactic. warning no lock alone is a safe deterent against theft,
 the thief doesnt need to be a locksmith or a lock-picker to walk away with your
 property!  i personally think motion alarms in combination to a lock
 of this type is the way to go if in fact you are that concerned.
