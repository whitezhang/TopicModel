 
 after reading the service manual for my bike (suzuki gs500e--1990) i have
 a couple of questions i hope you can answer:
 
 when checking the oil level with the dip stick built into the oil fill
 cap, does one check it with the cap screwed in or not?  i am more used to
 the dip stick for a cage where the stick is extracted fully, wiped clean
 and reinserted fully, then withdrawn and read.  the dip stick on my bike
 is part of the oil filler cap and has about 1/2 inch of threads on it.  do
 i remove the cap, wipe the stick clean and reinsert it with/without
 screwing it down before reading?
 
 the service manual calls for the application of suzuki bond no. 1207b on
 the head cover.  i guess this is some sort of liquid gasket material.  do
 you know of a generic (cheaper) substitute?
 
 my headlight is a halogen 60/55 w bulb.  is there an easy, brighter
 replacement bulb available?  where should i look for one?
 
 as always, i very much appreciate your help.  the weather in philadelphia
 has finally turned warm.  this weekend i saw lotsa bikes, and the riders
 all waved.  a nice change of tone from what philadelphia can be like. . . .
