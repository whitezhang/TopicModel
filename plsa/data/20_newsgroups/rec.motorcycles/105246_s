 it's a "make before break" type of switch.  if not required, it ought to be
 for high-low beams.  
 
 there might be a wee problem with this.  if you use both filaments at the
 same time, the bulb is tossing out a great deal more heat than normal.
 possibly enough to shorten it's life span.  my honda crx cage [a cage that
 really wanted to be a bike] had wimpy stock lights.  so we used to run
 around with both beams on.  made a mucho big difference - until both low
 beam filaments died nearly simultaneously!  this was two weeks after
 finding out how nice it was to use both beams.  i replaced the lights with
 quartz-halogen lights and that ended the problem.
