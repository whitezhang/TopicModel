 	when i'm riding my 900rr, my goodies are already up
 	against the tank, because the design of the corbin seat
 	tends to move you forward.
 
 	wouldn't the major danger to one's cajones be due to
 	accelerating into and then being stopped by the tank?  if
 	you're already there, there wouldn't be an impact
 	problem, would there?
