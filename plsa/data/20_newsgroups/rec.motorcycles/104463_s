 yes.  unfortunately, there is also the concept that the owner of a car
 is not responsible for the actions of any (authorized) user of the car.
 that's one of the biggest arguments against photo-radar ticketing

 trouble with that is, you then have no recourse if a mis-issued ticket
 or a clerical error on a computer follow you around.  the city of chicago
 (the informal motto of which being "the city the works") issues dozens

 in the city.
