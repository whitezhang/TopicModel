 you and the beav should lighten up (esp the beav).  i agree that
 dui/dwi is serious.  we should have reasonable laws, strict
 enforcement, and tough sentences.  but, andrew did not
 post "looking for sympathy over the consequences."  he posted
 asking for advice because he had an extremely high quote.  his
 post was obviously valid because he later found insurance for less.
 he noted why he was in his predicament but did not defend in
 any way drunk driving (and has renounced drunk driving).  there
 are too many repeat offenders to worry about and other bdc.
 why try to make this person who is no longer part of the problem
 an outcast?  he has paid his debt to society.  step off the high
 horse.  we have all been irresponsible in the past.
 
 with that said, i'm guilty of the same type of hostility towards
 rapists.  i think it comes because i feel the punishment is not
 severe enough.  the same may be true of dwi/dui. if that is the
 case, then it is our stinkin' gubment we need to change.  if 
 we had a reasonable law about dwi/dui with a stiff penalty
 then fewer people would do it.  
 
 at any rate, andrew as paid his debt as defined by the law.
 if you think that debt is actually greater than the law mandates, 
 tell your 'representatives'.
