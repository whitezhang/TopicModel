   nice ridin' tex. i use the california dmv recommended technique:
 slow as you aproach said dog and wick it up as you pass. i've often
 contemplated putting the boot in said dog's muzzle as i open the 
 throttle, but have never tried that. i figgure the impact would 
 unballance me and i'd dump the bike. a bicycling technique i've
 employed was to use my frame mounted tire pump to fend off dog
 attacks. on one occasion i was attacked by a pack of four dogs at
 once while peddaling up a steep hill. i lost my right sock, but no
 blood. i complained to the local animal control department (after
 complaining to the owner of the dogs to no affect) about the dogs;
 no more dogs, no more attacks. the telephone worked much better
 than the tire pump.
