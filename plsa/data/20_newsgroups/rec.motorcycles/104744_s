 when it's too windy to stand.
 
 when you're on the road in high winds, stay alert.  even more alert
 than your "alert 'cause you're on a motorcycle and they're out to kill
 you" kind of alert.  be aware of the terrain, and how it may funnel
 wind in sudden gusts (well, not gusts to somebody standing there, but
 it's gusty 'cause you ride through it).  if you are riding in a steady
 crosswind, be aware of a hill that will block the wind, and adjust your
 lean angle.  be aware of passing trucks to your windward side, your
 lean angle will change dramatically both as you enter and as you leave
 their turbulance cone.  reducing your profile may help, ie, lean on the
 gas tank and kiss the triple clamp.  keep a nimble hand on the
 steering, be ready to countersteer into and out of sudden wind bursts.
 keep a larger than usual buffer zone, both ahead and behind, and to the
 side, you can easily be blown half a lane over before you can react by
 countersteering.  keep a close eye on traffic in your mirror, if
 someone is coming up wanting to pass, get out of their way early.  stop
 often for short brakes, extensive riding in high winds is both mentally
 and physically fatiguing.
