 anti freeze
 
 i was wrong, still had the issue of "street rodder" in
 my last pile. in the february 1991 issue on page 24 there
 is an advirtisement for anti freeze.
  
 and it makes a great party mixer
 the neo synthetic oil company has a reputation for
 developing overkill priducts the protect and extend
 the life of mechinical things, and here is there latest
 development. propylene glycol, probably the finest radiator 
 coolant available. after 100,000 miles of testing, they find
 it has a boiling point of 365 degrees (much higher than
 conventional coolants)- which helps elminate detonation and 
 pinging, it allows the use of smaller radiators in race cars,
 it will not damage aluminum blocks or heads, and it is 
 environmentally safe. yep, this is the good stuff.
