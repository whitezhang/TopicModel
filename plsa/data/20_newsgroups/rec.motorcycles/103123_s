 i was raised in the south, and i can attest that this is true.  why, on
 one particularly hot day, as i was walking along the road, some good
 ole boys in a truck tossed me a cold beer!  of course, they were going
 50 mph at the time...

 bikers wave to bikers the world over.  whether or not harley riders
 wave to other bikers is one of our favorite flame wars...
