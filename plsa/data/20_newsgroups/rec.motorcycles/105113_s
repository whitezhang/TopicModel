 if possible, i split lanes. even if you don't get all the way to the
 head of the line, at least you won't rear-ended. i always worry more when
 i'm in the lane, at the front of the line, and no one in behind me. then you
 have to keep an eye on your mirrors. i also get ready to pull a hard right,
 *just in case*.
