 some of us not-so judgmental little shits don't drive/ride when we're
 impaired.  i stopped doing that sort of thing when a good friend of
 mine got killed by a drunk driver who failed to stop for a red and
 drove through the side of her volvo in his '72 caddy.
 
 then again, i suspect most of the responsible adults on the net don't
 bother posting in flame wars on rec.moto.

 he also owned slaves, kept some as forced concubines, and had enough
