 help!  i've got a friend shopping for her first motorcycle.  this is great!
 unfortunately, she needs at most a 28" seat.  this is not great.  so far,
 the only thing we've found was an old and unhappy-looking kz440.
 
 so, it's time to tap the collective memory of all the denizens out there.
 anybody know of models (old models and used bikes are not a problem)
 with a 28" or lower seat?  and, since she has to make this difficult ( 8-) ),
 she would prefer not to end up with a cruiser.  so there's bonus points
 for listing tiny standards.
 
 i seem to remember a thread with a point similar to this passing through
 several months ago.  did anybody keep that list?
 
 thanks!
