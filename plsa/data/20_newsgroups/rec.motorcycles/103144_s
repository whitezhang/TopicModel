 no need to appologise, as a matter of fact
 this reminds me to bring up something i
 have found consistant with dogs-
 
 most of the time, they do not like having
 me and my bike anywhere near them, and will
 chase as if to bite and kill. 
 
 an instructor once said it was because the 
 sound from a bike was painfull to their 
 ears. as silly as this seams, no other options
 have arrizen. 
 
 net.wisdom?
