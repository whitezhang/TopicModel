   so, in short, the 3/8" cables seems to be pretty useless, i would guess.
 
   the larger cable seems to be a much better unit.
 
   i've got the larger cable - about 5/8" inch in diameter (actually, i think
 its larger), about 4 feet long which coils into a 8 or 9 inch coil, with the
 tubular key lock like the u-locks.  it has worked fine for me for two years
 now, and *seems* (to me, anyway) that it is very secure.  it doesn't have the
 weaknesses that the u-locks have other than the liquid nitrogen trick
 supposedly, is much easier to store in my tankbag than a u-lock, and more
 versatile.  i got mine from one of the mail-order houses (motorcycle accessory
 warehouse, i beleive), for $42.
 
   in combination with an ignition disable, and a couple of other deterrents,
 all i *usually* worry about is vandalism.
