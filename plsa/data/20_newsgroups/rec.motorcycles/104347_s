 this is pretty damned complicated. i just make a "back off" motion with
 my hand/arm, and the second or third time even the most braindead cager
 backs off. if they don't back off then, i find a way to get the hell out
 of there -- the cager is either psychotic, drunk, or just a complete
 asshole. in any case, i don't want to be anywhere near, and especially
 not in front.
