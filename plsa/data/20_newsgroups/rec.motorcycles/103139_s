 i remember seeing an artical on large-engine oil 
 requirements, and one of the ways of prolonging
 the life of the oil was to run through a heated
 un-presurized chamber to allow water and volitiles
 to boil off. this made such long-term usage of 
 oil practical.
 
 isn't the discovery channel great!?!
