 yes, matt, dear newbie, best advice is read here foe a few days.
 this is your best source of info.
 
 (kinda makes me glad that i discovered r.m well after i got into riding--
  could i have possibly sounded like *that* otherwise?  --eesh.)
 
 btw matt, despite the insults you are destined to face, great move 
 on taking the msf course.  it will save your butt.
 
 good luck,
