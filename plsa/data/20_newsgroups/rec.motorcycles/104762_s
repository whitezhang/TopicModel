 what worked for me on my rd350 was to lean towards the dog as i modulated
 throttle to keep my ankle just ahead of his teeth.  after a few seconds of
 warm pipe firmly wedged on his shoulder he turned his face sideways to see
 what was so warm and got his mouth/nose/muzzle burned on the pipes.  one
 yip and he veered away, never to chase me again.
