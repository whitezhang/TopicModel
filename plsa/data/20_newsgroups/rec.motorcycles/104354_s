  i hate to  admit this but there does seem to be some sort of twisted logic
 to this approach. it's the bikers against the world and the dogs are just 
 another worthless adversary. so remember to wear at least calf height leather
 boots, ( in case the dog gets lucky and sinks his teeth into your
 attacking foot) and go for the gusto, if that dog doesn't retreat from the
 street with his tail between his legs next time you see it then you really
 haven't done your bit for all your fellow bikers.

 sorry i can't go this far, a dog against and armored cage just doesn't
 seem like a fair fight.
