 that plastic bodywork is useless. that torque, and an upright riding position is
 better than a slightly or radically forward riding position combined with a high-rpm
 low torque motor.
 
 to a cruiser-motorcyclist, chrome has some importance. to sport-bike motorcyclists
 chrome has very little impact on buying choice.
 
 unless motivated solely by price, these are the criteria each rider uses to select
 the vehicle of choice. 
 
 to ignore these, as well as other criteria, would be insensitive. in other words,
 no one motorcycle can fufill the requirements that a sport-bike rider and a cruiser
 rider may have.(sometimes it's hard for *any* motorcycle to fufill a person's requirements)
   
 you're fishing for flames, dave.
 
 this difference of opinion is analogous to the difference
 between sports-car owners, and luxury-car owners. 
 
 this is a moot conversation.
