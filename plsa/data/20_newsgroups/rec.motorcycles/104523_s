   actually, i beleive "dwi" normally means "driving while impaired" rather
 than "intoxicated", at least it does in the states i've lived in...

   one can be imparied without necessarily being impaired by liquor - drugs,
 not enough sleep, being a total moron :-), all can impair someone etc...  i'm
 surprised this got her off the hook...  perhaps dwi in lousiana *is* confined
 to liquor?
