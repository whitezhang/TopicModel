 three, actually.  i believe i discussed countersteering a horse
 before.
 
 basically, there are two ways to steer a horse, plow-rein and
 neck-rein.  plow-reining steers him by keeping the reins separate, and
 you pull in the direction you wish to go.  neck-reining steers a horse
 by holding the reins together in one hand, and pulling against the
 horse's neck in the direction you wish to go.  when training a
 plow-steering horse to neck-rein, one technique is to cross the reins
 under his necks.  thus, when neck-reining to the left, the right rein
 pulls against the right side of the neck, but the left side of the bit
 (which the horse is used to from his plow-reining days).
 
 are you sorry you asked yet?
