 hey folks--
 
 i've got a pair of dunlop sportmax radials of my zx-10, and they've been
 very sticky (ie no slides yet), but all this talk about the metzelers has
 me wondering if my next set should be a lazer comp k and a radial metzeler
 rear...for hard sport-touring, how do the choices stack up?
