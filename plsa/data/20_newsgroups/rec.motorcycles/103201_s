 i think i've seen this bike.  is it all white, with a sea-green stripe
 and just 'honda' for decals, i've seen such a bike numerous times over
 by sewall hall at cu, and i thought it was a race-prepped cbr. 
 i didn't see it over at the ec parking lot (i buzzed over there on my 
 way home, all of 1/2 block off my route!)  but it was gone.
 
 is a single sided swingarm available for the cbr?  i would imagine so, 
 kinda neccisary for quick tire changes.  when i first saw it, i assumed it
 was a bike repainted to cover crash damage.
