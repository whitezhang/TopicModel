 yes, yes, yes.  motorcycling is slightly different to each and every one of us.  this
 is the nature of people, and one of the beauties of the sport.  
 
 |cruiser-bike riders have a different view of motorcycling than those of sport bike riders
 |(what they like and dislike about motorcycling). this is not closed-minded. 
 
 and what view exactly is it that every single rider of cruiser bikes holds, a veiw
 that, of course, no sport-bike rider could possibly hold?  please quantify your
 generalization for us.  careful, now, you're trying to pigeonhole a whole bunch
 of people.
