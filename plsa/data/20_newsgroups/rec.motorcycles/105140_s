 	i'm not sure how far standardisation went, but on two of my bikes (the
 gs550b and, i think, the gt380m) i was able to pop a cibie' insert directly
 into the original housing (held in by those roughly w-shaped springs).  the
 inserts used 55/60w halogen bulbs, and were great, although mr bill later
 indicates that this may be too much of a drain on your charging system.
