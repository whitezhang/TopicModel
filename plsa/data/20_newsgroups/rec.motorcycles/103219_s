 according to bbc radio this morning, uk, denmark, portugal & a few
 others have vetoed a proposal to limit ec-sold bikes to 100 bhp.  the
 reason is that such a limit is not supported by accident statistics - a
 rare example of governmental wisdom.  the limit has a five year
 moratorium on it, and "specialist" manufacturers will be exempt anyway. 
 any suspicion that this is a crafty trick to restrict that end of the
 market in europe to triumph, norton (who? :-)), bmw, cagiva & ducati is
 the sort of dangerous rubbish which stalls gatt talks.
 
 you heard it here first.
