 i had the same inconvenience when i bought my ex-500; only i could at least
 go 50 mph during the initial break-in.
 
 despite the high quality of motor oils and motorcycle engines these days,
 i would follow the instructions, and just keep to city street riding for
 the first 500 miles. heck, those miles go by fast, and it's worth it to
 know you haven't possibly screwed up your engine.
 
 at the same time, this has all the makings of a 6-week-long thread debating
 the whole break-in topic.
