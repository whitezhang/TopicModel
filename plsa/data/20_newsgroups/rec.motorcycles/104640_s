 hey, what do we look like, a parts store?  has it ever occurred to you to
 visit your dealer and fork out the bucks for a new one?  what are the
 chances of someone happening to have a '92 part laying around, much less
 one in working condition?  sheesh, some edu's.  
 
 besides, i only have the right side inverted gsx-r fork.  it's already been
 converted into a floor lamp.
