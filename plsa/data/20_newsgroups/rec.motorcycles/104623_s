 as i won't be able to make the joust this summer (job related time 
 conflict :'^{   ), i plan instead on going to the rider rally in 
 knoxville.
 
 i'll be leaving from chicago. and generally plan on going down along
 the indiana/illinois border into kentucky and then tennessee.  i would 
 be very interested in hearing suggestions of roads/routes/areas that 
 you would consider "must ride" while on the way to knoxville.
 
 i can leave as early as 5/22 and need to arrive in knoxville by 6pm
 on 5/25.  that leaves me a pretty good stretch of time to explore on 
 the way.
 
 by the way if anyone else is going, and would like to partner for the 
 ride down, let me know.  i'll be heading east afterward to visit family, 
 but sure don't mind company on the ride down to the rally.  depending on 
 weather et al. my plan is motelling/tenting thru the trip.
 
 from the rally i'll be heading up the blue ridge parkway, then jogging
 into west va (i-77) to run up 219 -> marlington, 28 -> petersburg, 
 55e -> i-81/i-66e.  after this point the route is presently undetermined
 into pennsylvania, new york?, and back to chicago (by 6/6).  suggestions 
 for these areas would be of great interest also.
 
 many thanks for your ideas,
 
 enjoy,
