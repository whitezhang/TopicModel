 continuously, on this forum, and on the street, you find quite a difference
 between the opinions of what motorcycling is to different individuals.
 cruiser-bike riders have a different view of motorcycling than those of sport bike riders
 (what they like and dislike about motorcycling). this is not closed-minded. 
 to not recognize this, is in effect, close-minded.

 i scan it for information, a lot of it is noise and pointless flame-age.
 (it's why i used trn, instead of rn)
 
 if you have a problem with that, i'm really sorry for you..
