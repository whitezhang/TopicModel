 
 hi, someone is selling his bmw r65 ( i think it's an '84 ) w/ 15k
 miles for $2200. he says it's in great condition and perfect shape.
 it's got the 2 hard saddle bags, too. 
 
 is this a good deal? seems like an awesome deal. is it - assuming that
 everything he says is true ?
 
 thanks,
 
 jae
