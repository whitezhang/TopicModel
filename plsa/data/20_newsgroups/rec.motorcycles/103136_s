 if you can remember to tuck properly, the bits that are going to take most 
 punishment with the gear you have will probably be your feet, then hips and 
 knees. get boots then  trousers. the gloves come last, as long as you've the 
 self control to pull your arms in when you tuck. if not, get good gloves 
 first - hands are very easily wrecked if you put one down to steady your 
 fall at 70mph!! the other bits heal easier.
 
 once you are fully covered, you no longer tuck, just lie back and enjoy the 
 ride.
 
 best of all, take a mean of all the contradictory answers you get.
