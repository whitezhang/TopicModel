 oh boy, a little k-bike versus /2 scuffling? grow up! and that goes for

 i think that he is a crook, and i am suprised that it has taken this long
 for anything to be done (though obviously, it ain't over yet)

 i'm not sure that i want to be in bed with any of the wackos running.
 throwing $20.oo down a rathole might be more effective than sending it in
 to the club. you wouldn't get anything, but you don't get anything now.
 
 the magazine you say? ever since the moa politburo installed don it has
 lacked any sort of panache it may have had. 
 
 ah, but what would i know? i own a /6 and a k-bike
