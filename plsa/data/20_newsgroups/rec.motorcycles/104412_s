 	do i have to be the one to say it?
 
 	don't be so stupid as to leave your helmet on the seat where it can
 	fall down and go boom!
 
 	that kind of fall is what the helmet is designed to protect against.
 if you fall with the helmet on and you hit the same spot the helmet landed
 on during the drop, the helmet may not protect your head as well as it was
 intended to do.  conservative rec.moto'ers will recommend that you replace
 the helmet.  if you want to be sure that it will protect you adequately, you
 should.
 
 	helmets go on the ground, on a table, on a chair, on a shelf, or on
 	any other surface that is large enough to support them so that they
 	will not easily be knocked down.
 
 	jeezus.  my new shoei would be $340 to replace.  you think i'm going
 to leave it to chance?
 
 	cripe.
 
 later,
