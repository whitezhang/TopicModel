 to follow-up, i had a bad experience w/ a krypto lock too...
 
 last year i bought a krypto cable ii (3/8"x3-4' long, something like that)
 that by all standards seemed like a decent piece.  until i used it anyway...
 before i ever used it for security purposes, i used it for entertainment
 (minds out of the gutter, please), which is to say that i sat fiddling w/
 it while watching tv (the night i got it).  after three minutes of mindless
 fiddling (of course it was mindless, remember i was watching tv) the entire
 tumbler mechanism came out on the key!  not unlike that old georgie-porgie
 nursery rhyme.  this left a very empty cylinder and a very non-secure 
 (read "swingin' in the breeze") cable lock.
 kinda makes me wonder about any flat key-style lock.  one yank w/ a 
 slide-hammer and viola-- i'm making an insurance claim.
 
 anyone else have a similar experience (w/ the kryptos, not bike theft)?
