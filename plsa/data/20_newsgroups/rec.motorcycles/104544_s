 i was just wondering if there were any law officers that read this.  i have
 several questions i would like to ask pertaining to motorcycles and cops.
 and please don't say get a vehicle code, go to your local station, or obvious
 things like that.  my questions would not be found in those places nor
 answered face to face with a real, live in the flesh, cop.
 if your brother had a friend who had a cousin whos father was a cop, etc.
 don't bother writing in.  thanks.
