 isn't that one of those self-evident things like, "how do you decide that
 you're out of gas"?
 
 i have never experienced wind so severe it physically precluded operation
 of a motorcycle.  it's more a matter of deciding whether the aggravation
 is more trouble than it's worth.  this of course, depends entirely on your
 own particular circumstances and personal disposition.
