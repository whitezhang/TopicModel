 sure, i can. the illustrated encyclopedia of motorcycles, edited by erwin 
 tragatsch, was published by the hamlyn publishing group limited, 
 astronaut house, hounslow road, feltham, middlesex, england.
 
 it was first published in 1977, and mine was reprinted in 1978. cost then 
 was pounds 5.95 in the uk, though i paid 18.50 for it in canadian 
 dollars. i have no idea whether it's still in print. perhaps you could 
 let the net know.
