 this is a periodic posting intended to answer the frequently asked
 question: what is the dod? it is posted the first of each month, with
 an expiration time of over a month. thus, unless your site's news
 software is ill-mannered, this posting should always be available.
 this witdodfaq is crossposted to all four rec.motorcycles groups in an
 attempt to catch most new users, and followups are directed to
 rec.motorcycles.
 
 last changed 9-feb-93 to add a message from the kotl, and a bit of
 halon.

 			how do i get a dod number?
 
 if the most frequently asked question in rec.motorcycles is "what is the
 dod?", then the second most frequently asked question must be "how do i
 get a dod number?" that is as simple as asking the keeper of the list
 (kotl, accept no substitue keepers) for a number. if you're feeling
 creative, and your favorite number hasn't been taken already, you can
 make a request, subject to kotl approval. (warning, non-numeric, non-
 base-10 number requests are likely to earn a flame from the kotl. not
 that you won't get it, but you _will_ pay for it.)
 
 oh, and just one little, tiny suggestion. ask the kotl in e-mail. you'll
 just be playing the lightning rod for flames if you post to the whole
 net, and you'll look like a clueless newbie too.
 
 by now you're probably asking "so who's the kotl already?". well, as
 john sloan notes below, that's about the only real "secret" left around
 here, but a few (un)subtle hints can be divulged. first, it is not myself,
 nor anyone mentioned by name in this posting (maybe :-), though john was
 the original kotl. second, in keeping with the true spirit of unix, the
 kotl's first name is only two letters long, and can be spelled entirely
 with hexadecimal characters. (2.5, the kotl shares his name with a line-
 oriented text utility.) third, he has occasionally been seen posting
 messages bestowing new dod numbers (mostly to boneheads with "weenie
 mailers"). fourth, there is reason to suspect the kotl of being a
 dead-head.
 
 ***************** newsflash: a message from the kotl ******************
 
 once you have surmounted this intellectual pinnacle and electronically
 groveled to the kotl, please keep in mind that the kotl does indeed
 work for a living, and occasionally must pacify its boss by getting
 something done.  your request may languish in mailer queue for (gasp!)
 days, perhaps even (horrors!) a week or two.  during such times of
 economic activity on the part of the kotl's employers, sending yet
 another copy of your request will not speed processing of the queue (it
 just makes it longer, verification of this phenominon is left as an
 excersize for the reader).  if you suspect mailer problems, at least
 annotate subsequent requests with an indication that a former request
 was submitted, lest you be assigned multiple numbers (what, you think
 the kotl *memorizes* the list?!?).
 
 ***********************************************************************
 
 one more thing, the kotl says that its telepathic powers aren't what
 they used to be. so provide some information for the list, will ya?
 the typical dod list entry contains number, name, state/country, &
 e-mail address. for example:
 
 0111:ed green:ca:ed.green@east.sun.com
 
 (ps: while john mentions below that net access and a bike are the only
 requirements for dod membership, that's not strictly true these days, as
 there are a number of denizens who lack one or both.)

             "denizens of doom", by bruce tanner (dod 0161)
 
       [road rider, august 1991, reprinted with bruce's permission]
 
 there is a group of motorcyclists that gets together and does all the normal 
 things that a bunch of bikers do.  they discuss motorcycles and  
 motorcycling, beverages, cleaning fluids, baklavah, balaclava, caltrops,  
 helmets, anti-fog shields, spine protectors, aerodynamics, three-angle valve
 seats, bird hits, deer whistles, good restaurants, racing philosophy, 
 traffic laws, tickets, corrosion control, personalities, puns, double 
 entendres, culture, absence of culture, first rides and friendship.  they 
 argue with each other and plan rides together.
 
 the difference between this group and your local motorcycle club is that, 
 although they get together just about everyday, most have never seen each 
 other face to face.  the members of this group live all over the known world 
 and communicate with each other electronically via computer.
 
 the computers range from laptops to multi-million dollar computer centers;  
 the people range from college and university students to high-tech industry 
 professionals to public-access electronic bulletin-board users.  currently, 
 rec.motorcycles (pronounced "wreck-dot-motorcycles," it's the file name for 
 the group's primary on-line "meeting place") carries about 2250 articles per 
 month;  it is read by an estimated 29,000 people.  most of the frequent 
 posters belong to a motorcycle club, the denizens of doom, usually referred 
 to as the dod.
 
 the dod started when motorcyclist john r. nickerson wrote a couple of 
 parodies designed to poke fun at motorcycle stereotypes.  fellow computer 
 enthusiast bruce robinson posted these articles under the pen name, "denizen 
 of doom."  a while later chuck rogers signed off as dod nr. 0003 keeper of 
 the flame.  bruce was then designated dod nr. 0002, retroactively and, of 
 course, nickerson, the originator of the parodies, was given dod nr. 0001.
 
 the idea of a motorcycle club with no organization, no meetings and no rules 
 appealed to many, so john sloan -- dod nr. 0011 -- became keeper of the 
 list, issuing dod numbers to anyone who wanted one.  to date there have been 
 almost 400 memberships issued to people all over the united states and 
 canada, as well as australia, new zealand, the united kingdom, france, 
 germany, norway and finland.
 
 keeper of the list sloan eventually designed a club patch.  the initial run 
 of 300 patches sold out immediately.  the profits from this went to the 
 american motorcycle heritage foundation.  another amhf fund raiser -- 
 selling denizens of doom pins to members -- was started by arnie skurow a 
 few months later.  again, the project was successful and the profits were 
 donated to the foundation.  so far, the denizens have contributed over $1500 
 to the ama museum.  a plaque in the name of the denizens of doom now hangs 
 in the motorcycle heritage museum.
 
 as often as possible, the dod'ers crawl out from behind their crts and go 
 riding together.  it turns out that the two largest concentrations of 
 dod'ers are centered near denver/boulder, colorado, and in california's 
 "silicon valley."  consequently, two major events are the annual assault on 
 rollins pass in colorado, and the northern versus southern california 
 "joust."
 
 the ride-and-feed is a bike trip over rollins pass, followed by a big 
 barbecue dinner.  the concept for the joust is to have riders from northern 
 california ride south; riders from southern california to ride north, 
 meeting at a predesignated site somewhere in the middle.  an additional plan 
 for 1991 is to hold an official denizens of doom homecoming in conjunction 
 with the ama heritage homecoming in columbus, ohio, in july.
 
 though it's a safe bet the the denizens of doom and their collective 
 communications hub, rec.motorcycles, will not replace the more traditional 
 motorcycle organizations, for those who prowl the electronic pathways in 
 search of two-wheeled camaraderie, it's a great way for kindred spirits to 
 get together.  long may they flame.
 
 
 "live to flame -- flame to live"	[centerbar]
 
 this official motto of the denizens of doom refers to the ease with which 
 you can gratuitously insult someone electronically, when you would not do 
 anything like that face to face.  these insults are known as "flames";  
 issuing them is called "flaming."  flames often start when a member 
 disagrees with something another member has posted over the network.  a 
 typical, sophisticated, intelligent form of calm, reasoned rebuttal would be 
 something like:  "what an incredibly stupid statement, you spandex-clad 
 poseur!"  this will guarantee that five other people will reply in defense 
 of the original poster, describing just what they think of you, your riding 
 ability and your cat.

           _the denizens of doom: the saga unfolds_
 
                   by john sloan  dod #0011
 
 periodically the question "what is dod?" is raised. this is one of
 those questions in the same class as "why is the sky blue?", "if there
 is a god, why is there so much suffering in the world?" and "why do
 women inevitably tell you that you're such a nice guy just before they
 dump you?", the kinds of questions steeped in mysticism, tradition,
 and philosophy, questions that have inspired research and discussion
 by philosophers in locker rooms, motorcycle service bays, and in the
 halls of academe for generations. 
 
 a long, long time ago (in computer time, where anything over a few
 minutes is an eternity and the halting problem really is a problem) on
 a computer far, far away on the net (topologically speaking; two
 machines in the same room in atlanta might route mail to one another
 via a system in chicago), a chap who wished to remain anonymous (but
 who was eventually assigned the dod membership #1) wrote a satire of
 the various personalities and flame wars of rec.motorcycles, and
 signed it "the denizen of doom". not wishing to identify himself, he
 asked that stalwart individual who would in the fullness of time
 become dod #2 to post it for him. dod #2, not really giving a whit
 about what other people thought and generally being a right thinking
 individual, did so.  flaming and other amusements followed. 
 
 he who would become the holder of dod membership #3 thought this was
 the funniest thing he'd seen in a while (being the sort that is pretty
 easily amused), so he claimed membership in the denizens of doom
 motorcycle club, and started signing his postings with his membership
 number. 
 
 perhaps readers of rec.motorcycles were struck with the vision of a
 motorcycle club with no dues, no rules, no restrictions as to brand or
 make or model or national origin of motorcycle, a club organized
 electronically.  it may well be that readers were yearning to become a
 part of something that would provide them with a greater identity, a
 gestalt personality, something in which the whole was greater than the
 sum of its parts.  it could also be that we're all computer nerds who
 wear black socks and sneakers and pocket protectors, who just happen
 to also love taking risks on machines with awesome power to weight
 ratios, social outcasts who saw a clique that would finally be open
 minded enough to accept us as members. 
 
 in a clear case of self fulfilling prophesy, the denizens of doom
 motorcycle club was born. a club in which the majority of members have
 never met one another face to face (and perhaps like it that way), yet
 feel that they know one another pretty well (or well enough given some
 of the electronic personalities in the newsgroup). a club organized
 and run (in the loosest sense of the word) by volunteers through the
 network via electronic news and mail, with a membership/mailing list
 (often used to organize group rides amongst members who live in the
 same region), a motto, a logo, a series of photo albums circulating
 around the country (organized by dod #9), club patches (organized by
 #11), and even an mtv-style music video (produced by #47 and
 distributed on vhs by #18)! 
 
 where will it end? who knows? will the dod start sanctioning races,
 placing limits on the memory and clock rate of the on-board engine
 management computers? will the dod organize poker runs where each
 participant collects a hand of hardware and software reference cards?
 will the dod have a rally in which the attendees demand a terminal
 room and at least a 386-sized unix system? only time will tell. 
 
 the dod has no dues, no rules, and no requirements other than net
 access and a love for motorcycles. to become a member, one need only
 ask (although we will admit that who you must ask is one of the few
 really good club secrets). new members will receive via email a
 membership number and the latest copy of the membership list, which
 includes name, state, and email address. 
 
 the denizens of doom motorcycle club will live forever (or at least
 until next year when we may decided to change the name). 
 
                   live to flame - flame to live

                       the dod
 
               by the denizen of doom    dod #1
  
 welcome one and all to the flamingest, most wonderfullest newsgroup of
 all time: wreck.mudder-disciples or is it reak.mudder-disciples? the
 names have been changes to protect the guilty (riders) and innocent
 (the bikes) alike. if you think you recognize a contorted version of
 your name, you don't. it's just your guilt complex working against
 you. read 'em and weep. 
 
 we tune in on a conversation between some of our heros. terrible
 barbarian is extolling the virtues of his hopalonga puff-a-cane to
 reverend muck mudgers and stompin fueling-injection: 
 
 terrible: this hopalonga is the greatest... beats bmws dead!! 
 
 muck: i don't mean to preach, terrible, but lighten up on the bmw
      crowd eh?  i mean like i like riding my yuka-yuka fudgeo-jammer
      11 but what the heck.  
 
 stompin: no way, the bmw is it, complete, that's all man.
 
 terrible: nahhhh, you're sounding like heritick ratatnack! hey, at
      least he is selling his bmw and uses a hopalonga intercorruptor!
      not as good as a puff-a-cane, should have been called a
      woosh-a-stream.
 
 stompin: you mean wee-stream.
 
 terrible: waddya going to do? call in reinforcements???
 
 stompin: yehh man. here comes arlow scarecrow and high tech. let's see
      what they say, eh? 
 
 muck: now men, let's try to be civil about this.
 
 high tech: hi, i'm a 9 and the bmw is the greatest.
 
 arlow: other than my b.t. i love my bmw!
 
 terrible: b.t.???
 
 arlow: burley thumpison, the greatest all american ride you can own.
 
 muck: ahhh, look, you're making terrible gag.
 
 terrible: what does bmw stand for anyway??? 
 
 muck, arlow, high: beats me, wilhelm.
 
 terrible: actually, my name is terrible. hmmm, i don't know either.
 
 muck: say, here comes chunky bear.
 
 chunky: hey, hey, hey! smarter than your average bear!
 
 terrible: hey, didn't you drop your bmw???
 
 chunky: all right eh, a little booboo, but i left him behind. i mean 
      even villy ogle flamed me for that! 
 
 muck: it's okay, we all makes mistakes.
 
 out of the blue the west coasters arrive, led by tread orange with
 dill snorkssy, heritick ratatnack, buck garnish, snob rasseller and
 the perenial favorite: hooter boobin brush! 
 
 heritick: heya terrible, how's yer front to back bias?
 
 terrible: not bad, sold yer bmw?
 
 heritick: nahhh.
 
 hooter: hoot, hoot.
 
 buck: nice tree hooter, how'd ya get up there?
 
 hooter: carbujectors from hell!!!
 
 muck: what's a carbujector?
 
 hooter: well, it ain't made of alumican!!! made by tilloslert!!
 
 muck: ahh, come on down, we aren't going to flame ya, honest!!
 
 dill: well, where do we race?
 
 snob: you know, chunky, we know about about your drop and well, don't
      ride! 
 
 muck: no! no! quiet!
 
 tread: bmw's are the greatest in my supreme level headed opinion.
      they even have luggage made by sourkraut!
 
 high: my 9 too!
 
 terrible, heritick, dill, buck: nahhhhh!!!
 
 stompin, tread, high, chunky, snob: yesss yessssss!!!
 
 before this issue could be resolved the hopalonga crew called up more
 cohorts from the local area including polyanna stirrup and the
 infamous booster robiksen on his cavortin! 
 
 polyanna: well, men, the real bikers use stirrups on their bikes like
      i use on my hopalonga evening-bird special. helpful for getting
      it up on the ole ventral stand!  
 
 terrible: hopalonga's are great like polyanna says and yuka-yuka's and
      sumarikis and kersnapis are good too! 
 
 booster: i hate cavortin.
 
 all: we know, we know.
 
 booster: i love cavortin.
 
 all: we know we know.
 
 muck: well, what about mucho guzlers and lepurras?
 
 snob, tread: nawwwwww.
 
 muck: what about a tridump?
 
 terrible: isn't that a chewing gum?
 
 muck: auggggg, waddda about a pluck-a-kity?
 
 heritick: heyya muck, you tryin' to call up the demon rider himself?
 
 muck: no, no. there is more to mudder-disciples than arguing about make.
 
 two more riders zoom in, in the form of pill turret and phalanx lifter.
 pill: out with dorsal stands and ventral stands forever.
 
 phalanx: hey, i don't know about that.
 
 and now even more west coasters pour in.
 road o'noblin: hopalonga's are the greatest!
 
 maulled beerstein: may you sit on a bikejector!
 
 suddenly more people arrived from the great dark nurth:
 kite lanolin: hey, bmw's are great, men.
 
 robo-nickie: i prefer motorcycle to robot transformers, personally.
 
 more riders from the west coast come into the discussion:
 aviator sourgas: get a burley-thumpison with a belted-rigged frame.
 
 guess gasket: go with a bmw or burley-thumpison.
 
 with a roar and a screech the latest mudder-disciple thundered in. it
 was none other that clean bikata on her hopalonga cabammerxorn. 
 clean: like look, hopalonga are it but only cabammerxorns. 
 
 muck: why??
 
 clean: well, like it's gotta be a 6-banger or nothin.
 
 muck: but i only have a 4-banger.
 
 clean: no good!
 
 chunky: sob, some of us only have 2-bangers!
 
 clean: inferior!
 
 stompin: hey, look, here's proof bmw's are better. the bimmer-boys
 burst into song: (singing) beemer babe, beemer babe give me a
 thrill... 
 
 road, terrible, polyanna, maulled, dill etc.: wadddoes bmw stand for? 
 
 heritick, stompin, snob, chunky, tread, kite, high, arlow: beat's me,
      wilhem! 
 
 road, terrible, polyanna, maulled, dill etc.: oh, don't you mean bmw? 
 
 and so the ensuing argument goes until the skies clouded over and the
 thunder roared and the greatest mudder-disciple (g.m.d.) of them all
 boomed out.
 g.m.d.: enough of your bickering! you are doomed to riding
      bigot & suction powered mini-trikes for your childish actions. 
 
 all: no, no, no!!! puhlease.
 
 does this mean that all of the wreck.mudder-disciples will be riding
 mini-trikes?  are our arguing heros doomed?  tune in next week for the
 next gut wretching episode of "the yearning and riderless" with its
 ever increasing cast of characters.  where all technical problems will
 be flamed over until well done.  next week's episode will answer the
 question of: "to helmet or not to helmet" will be aired, this is heady
 material and viewer discretion is advised.

           script for the denizens of doom anthem video
 
                 by jonathan e. quist   dod #94
 
 
 [scene:  a sterile engineering office.  a lone figure, whom we'll call
 chuck, stands by a printer output bin, wearing a white cdc lab coat,
 with 5 mechanical pencils in a pocket protector.] 
 
 (editor's note: for some reason a great deal of amusement was had at
 the first annual dod uni-coastal ironhorse ride & joust by denizens
 referring to each other as "chuck". i guess you had to be there. i
 wasn't.) 
 
 chuck:  i didn't want to be a software systems analyst,
  cow-towing to the whims of a machine, and saying yessir, nosir,
  may-i-have-another-sir.  my mother made me do it.  i wanted
  to live a man's life,
 [music slowly builds in background]
  riding nortons and triumphs through the highest mountain passes
  and the deepest valleys,
  living the life of a motorcyclist;
  doing donuts and evading the police;
  terrorizing old ladies and raping small children;
  eating small dogs for tea (and large dogs for dinner).  in short,
 
 	i want to be      a denizen!
 
 [chuck rips off his lab coat, revealing black leather jacket (with
 fringe), boots, and cap.  scene simultaneously changes to the top of
 an obviously assaulted rollins pass.  a small throng of hell's angels
 sit on their harleys in the near background, gunning their engines,
 showering lookers-on with nails as they turn donuts, and leaking oil
 on the tarmac.  chuck is standing in front of a heavily chromed fat
 boy.] 
 
 chuck [sings to the tune of "the lumberjack song"]:
 
 i'm a denizen and i'm okay,
 i flame all night and i ride all day.
 
 [hell's angels echo chorus, surprisingly heavy on tenors]:
 he's a denizen and he's okay,
 he flames all night and he rides all day.
 
 i ride my bike;
 i eat my lunch;
 i go to the lavat'ry.
 on wednesdays i ride skyline,
 running children down with glee.
 
 [chorus]:
 he rides his bike;
 he eats his lunch;
 he goes to the lavat'ry.
 on wednesdays he rides skyline,
 running children down with glee.
 
 [chorus refrain]:
 'cause he's a denizen...
 
 i ride real fast,
 my name is chuck,
 it somehow seems to fit.
 i over-rate the worst bad f*ck,
 but like a real good sh*t.
 
 oh, i'm a denizen and i'm okay!
 i flame all night and i ride all day.
 
 [chorus refrain]:
 oh, he's a denizen...
 
 i wear high heels
 and bright pink shorts,
  full leathers and a bra.
 i wish i rode a harley,
  just like my dear mama.
 
 [chorus refrain]
 
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
                     why you have to be killed.
 
 well, the first thing you have to understand (just in case you managed
 to read this far, and still not figure it out) is that the dod started
 as a joke. and in the words of one denizen, it intends to remain one.
 
 sometime in the far distant past, a hapless newbie asked: "what does dod
 stand for? it's not the department of defense is it?" naturally, a
 denizen who had watched the movie "top gun" a few times too many rose
 to the occasion and replied:
 
 "that's classified, we could tell you, but then we'd have to kill you."
 
 and the rest is history.
 
 a variation on the "security" theme is to supply disinformation about
 what dod stands for. notable contributions (and contributers, where
 known) include:
 
 daughters of democracy (dod 23)		doers of donuts
 dancers of despair (dod 9)		debasers of daughters
 dickweeds of denver			driveway of death
 debauchers of donuts			dumpers of dirtbikes
 
 note that this is not a comprehensive list, as variations appear to be
 limited only by the contents of one's imagination or dictionary file.
 
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
                      the rec.moto.photo archive
 
 first a bit of history, this all started with ilana stern and chuck
 rogers organizing a rec.motorcycles photo album. many copies were made,
 and several sets were sent on tours around the world, only to vanish in
 unknown locations. then bruce tanner decided that it would be appropriate
 for an electronic medium to have an electronic photo album. bruce has not
 only provided the disk space and ftp & e-mail access, but he has taken
 the time to scan most of the photos that are available from the archive.
 
 not only can you see what all these folks look like, you can also gawk
 at their motorcycles. a few non-photo files are available from the
 server too, they include the dod membership list, the dod yellow pages,
 the general rec.motorcycles faq, and this faq posting.
 
 here are a couple of excerpts from from messages bruce posted about how
 to use the archive.
 
 **********************************************************
 
 via ftp:
 
 cerritos.edu [130.150.200.21]
 
 via e-mail:
 
 the address is server@cerritos.edu.  the commands are given in the body of the
 message.  the current commands are dir and send, given one per line.  the
 arguments to the commands are vms style file specifications.  for
 rec.moto.photo the file spec is [dod]file.  for example, you can send:
 
 dir [dod]
 send [dod]bruce_tanner.gif
 send [dod]dodframe.ps
 
 and you'll get back 5 mail messages; a directory listing, 3 uuencoded parts
 of bruce_tanner.gif, and the dodframe.ps file in ascii.
 
 oh, wildcards (*) are allowed, but a maximum of 20 mail messages (rounded up to
 the next whole file) are send.  a 'send [dod]*.gif' would send 150 files of
 50k each; not a good idea.

 a couple of comments: bruce has put quite a bit of effort into this, so
 why not drop him a note if you find the rec.moto.photo archive useful?
 second, since bruce has provided the server as a favor, it would be kind
 of you to access it after normal working hours (california time).

                       patches? what patches?
 
 you may have heard mention of various dod trinkets such as patches &
 pins. and your reaction was probably: "i want!", or "that's sick!", or
 perhaps "that's sick! i want!"
 
 well, there's some good news and some bad news. the good news is that
 there's been an amazing variety of dod-labeled widgets created. the bad
 news is that there isn't anywhere you can buy any of them. this isn't
 because of any "exclusivity" attempt, but simply because there is no
 "dod store" that keeps a stock. all of the creations have been done by
 individual denizens out of their own pockets. the typical procedure is
 someone says "i'm thinking of having a dod frammitz made, they'll cost
 $xx.xx, with $xx.xx going to the ama museum. anyone want one?" then
 orders are taken, and a batch of frammitzes large enough to cover the
 pre-paid orders is produced (and quickly consumed). so if you want a
 dod doodad, act quickly the next time somebody decides to do one. or
 produce one yourself if you see a void that needs filling, after all
 this is anarchy in action.
 
 here's a possibly incomplete list of known dod merchandise (and
 perpetrators). patches (dod#11), pins (dod#99), stickers (dod#99),
 motorcycle license plate frames (dod#216), t-shirts (dod#99), polo shirts
 (dod#122), zippo lighters (dod#99) [ltf ftl], belt buckles (dod#99), and
 patches (dod#99) [a second batch was done (and rapidly consumed) by
 popular demand].
 
 all "profits" have been donated to the american motorcyclist association
 motorcycle heritage museum. as of june 1992, over $5500 dollars has been
 contributed to the museum fund by the dod. if you visit the museum,
 you'll see a large plaque on the founders' wall in the name of "denizens
 of doom, usenet, the world", complete with a dod pin.
 
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 here's a letter from the ama to the dod regarding our contributions.
 
 ~newsgroups: rec.motorcycles
 ~from: arnie skurow <arnie@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu>
 ~subject: a letter from the motorcycle heritage museum
 ~date: mon, 13 apr 1992 11:04:58 gmt
 
 i received the following letter from jim rogers, director of the museum,
 the other day.
 
 "dear arnie and all members of the denizens of doom:
 
 congratulations and expressions of gratitude are in order for you and the
 denizens of doom!  with your recent donation, the total amount donated is
 now $5,500.  on behalf of the amhf, please extend my heartfeld gratitude
 to all the membership of the denizens.  the club's new plaque is presently
 being prepared.  of course, everyone is invited to come to the museum to 
 see the plaque that will be installed in our founders foyer.  by the way,
 i will personally mount a denizens club pin on the plaque.  again, thank 
 you for all your support, which means so much to the foundation, the
 museum, and the fulfillment of its goals.
 
                                 sincerely,
 
 
                                 jim rogers, d.o.d. #0395
                                 director
 
 p.s.  please post on your computer bulletin board."
 
 as you all know, even though the letter was addressed to me personally,
 it was meant for all of you who purchased dod goodies that made this
 amount possible.
 
 arnie

 		other rec.motorcycles information resources.
 
 there are several general rec.motorcycles resources that may or may not
 have anything to do with the dod. most are posted on a regular basis,
 but they can also be obtained from the cerritos ftp/e-mail server (see
 the info on the photo archive above).
 
 a general rec.motorcycles faq is maintained by dave williams.
 cerritos filenames are faqn.txt, where n is currently 1-5.
 
 the dod yellow pages, a listing of motorcycle industry vendor phone
 numbers & addresses, is maintained by bob pakser.
 cerritos filename is yellow_pages_vnn, where n is the rev. number.

 (loki jorgenson loki@physics.mcgill.ca) has provided an archive site
 for motorcycle and accessory reviews, here's an excerpt from his
 periodic announcement.
 
 **********************************************************
 
 	the rec.motorcycles.reviews archives (and world famous llama
   emporium) contains a veritable plethora (tm) of bike (and accessories)
   reviews, written by rec.moto readers based on their own experiences.
   these invaluable gems of opinion (highly valued for their potential to
   reduce noise on the list) can be accessed via anonymous ftp, email
   server or by personal request:
 
   anonymous ftp:		ftp.physics.mcgill.ca (132.206.9.13)
 					under ~ftp/pub/dod
   email archive server:		rm-reviews@ftp.physics.mcgill.ca
   review submissions/questions:	rm-reviews@physics.mcgill.ca
 
   note: there is a difference in the addresses for review submission
       and using the email archive server (ie. an "ftp.").
 
   to get started with the email server, send an email message with a line
   containing only "send help".  
 
   note: if your return address appears like
 	domain!subdomain!host!username
       in your mail header, include a line like (or something similar)
 	path username@host.subdomain.domain 
 
 	if you are interested in submitting a review of a bike that you
   already own(ed), please do!  there is a template of the format that the
   reviews are kept in (more or less) available at the archive site .
   for those who have internet access but are unsure of how anonymous
   ftp works, an example script is available on request.
 
 **********************************************************
 
 reviews of any motorcycle related accessory or widget are welcome too.

             updated stats & rec.motorcycles rides info
 
 some of the info cited above in various places tends to be a moving
 target. rather than trying to catch every occurence, i'm just sticking
 the latest info down here.
 
 estimated rec.motorcycles readership: 35k  [news.groups]
  
 approximate dod membership: 975  [kotl]
 
 dod contributions to the american motorcyclist association motorcycle
 heritage museum. over $5500  [arnie]
  
                         organized (?) rides:
 
 summer 1992 saw more organized rides, with the joust in its third
 year, and the ride & feed going strong, but without the rollins pass
 trip due to the collapse of a tunnel.  the east coast denizens got
 together for the right coast ride (rcr), with bikers from as far north
 as nh, and as far south as fl meeting in the blueridge mountains of
 north carolina.  the pacific northwest crew organized  the first great
 pacific northwest dryside gather (gpndg), another successful excuse for
 riding motorcycles, and seeing the faces behind the names we all have
 come to know so well.  [thanks to ed green for the above addition.]
 
 also worth mentioning are: the first rec.moto.dirt ride, held in the
 moab/canyonlands area of southern utah. riders from 5 states showed up,
 riding everything from monster bmws to itty-bitty xrs to almost-legal
 2-strokes.  and though it's not an "official" (as if anything could be
 official with this crowd) rec.moto event, the vintage motorcycle races
 in steamboat springs, colorado always provides a good excuse for netters
 to gather.  there's also been the occasional labor day gather in utah.
 european denizens have staged some gathers too.  (your ad here,
 reasonable rates!)
