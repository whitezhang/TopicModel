 personally, i think jeffy-poo was still smarting more from the third degree
 burns he suffered after april 1st last year rather than the supposed burns
 that he suffered in "the joke".  granted i was one of those people that were
 taken in by it and i was certainly concerned...and then pissed at him for 
 pulling such a thing (which i made known to him).
 
 but then again, for an april fool "joke" i would also go on record as saying
 that it was the best orchestrated one i've ever seen and it certainly sucked
 a lot of people into believing it 8-( 8-| 8-\ 8-)...
 
 "sick" - "twisted"??? who in this group could ever be accused of such a thing?
 
 i tip my twisted lid to thee jeffy 8-).
