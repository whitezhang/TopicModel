 what about the new yamaha "cyclelok" ?
 from the photo in motorcyclist, it looks the same hardened steel as a 
 kryptonite u lock, except it folds in five places.
 it seems to extend out far enough to lock the rear tire to the tube of
 a parking sign or similar.
 
 anyone had any experience with them, how easy is it to attack the lock
 at the jointed sections ?
