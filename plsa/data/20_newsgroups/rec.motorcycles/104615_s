 in regards ot some of the posts concerning bias in articles of k bikes
 versis /2's or boxers of a later date or whatever.. jeezzz, lighten up!
 i wrote the slash two blues for a bit of humor which seems to be lacking
 in the moa owners news, when most of the stuff is "i rode the the first
 day, i saw that, i rode there the second day, i saw this" 
 any body out there know were the sense if humor went in people?
 i though i still had mine, but i dunno...
