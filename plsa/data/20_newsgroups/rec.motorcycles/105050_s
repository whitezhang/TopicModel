 	sorry to be contradictory, but... i've had my nighthawk at 45 degress
 with the horizon and i wasn't banked over in a turn...  
 	the hard part is getting the front in off the ground.  i rev to about 
 7,000 at drop the clutch.   even harder is keeping it from coming up to far--
 i use the back brake as well as the throttle.  once its up, it'll wheelie just
 like any other bike.
