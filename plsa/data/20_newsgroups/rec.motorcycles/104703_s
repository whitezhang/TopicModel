 my best advice would be to contact a local dealer (see the yellow
 pages under "motorcycle dealers") and ask for the address of the local
 section bmw owners club.  the local bmw dealer will give you details
 of the bmw insurance terms and the club will help you with all
 details.  getting a bike from the dealer is the best bet, if you can
 afford it.  the warranty is fairly handy as bm bits are made from
 solid gold, apart from the parts made from ruby and platinum.  apparently.
