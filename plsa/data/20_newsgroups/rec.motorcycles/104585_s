 oh yes they do! but considering i never wash my bmw (unless i need
 to work on it) i never get cuts untill the tools come out.....
 altho the best scar (now faded) was from the exhaust piper,
 while try to change the oil, after overheating the engine (watch
 out for idiot drivers that won't let you pass in the mountains
 when you have a rider, case of oil (it was on sale), and case of 
 beer), with a drain bolt that decided to seize.
 
 just how does everyone else clean out the area under the transmission
 on a bmw r bike? they only way i have found is to remove the
 engine and transmission. that and the clutch arm are impossible to
 clean (which is wear one of the ec (s&m) are located).
 
 
 laz
 ps anyone know where i can get the heads polished and ported
 cheap. also how much should that run.
