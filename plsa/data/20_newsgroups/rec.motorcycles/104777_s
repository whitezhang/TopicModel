 i have a '72 cl350 which i stopped riding about 2 years ago (i upgraded
 to an '84 sabre 750).  i parked it in the corner of my parking lot, and planned
 on draining the gas, spraying oil in the tank, etc. to get it ready to store.
 well, after a lot of procrastination, all i ended up doing was throwing a 
 tarp on it.
 
 well, now i have to move and want to clean up the 350.  i tried starting it
 (with someone else's battery) and had no luck.  my first guess is that it is
 the gas and so i plan on draining it and replacing it with new gas (i can only
 pray that i didn't trash the carbeurators).  the question is, what do i do
 with this old gas?  i am not going to run it in my sabre, and i think that
 there is enough that i don't want to burn it (campus police don't think
 too kindly about bonfires).  dumping it isn't a great idea.        
 
 thanks for any ideas,
 george heinz

 win the $1,000,000 question -- what does this c code do? (no fair compiling it)
 
 int a[1817];main(z,p,q,r){for(p=80;q+p-80;p-=2*a[p])for(z=9;z--;)q=3&(r=time(0)
 +r*57)/7,q=q?q-1?q-2?1-p%79?-1:0:p%79-77?1:0:p<1659?79:0:p>158?-79:0,q?!a[p+q*2
 ]?a[p+=a[p+=q]=q]=q:0:0;for(;q++-1817;)printf(q%79?"%c":"%c\n"," #"[!a[q-1]]);}
