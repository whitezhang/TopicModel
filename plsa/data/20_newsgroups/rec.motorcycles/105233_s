 
      quite right, your batteries should be perfectly alright and retain
 most of their charge if drained and dried well, but i'd throw out the
 electrolyte and buy some more when you need it.
 
 
      and before anyone says i'm wrong, remember that new batteries almost
 always come ready charged and dry, and they are perfectly ok even after
 several years' storage at the shop.
