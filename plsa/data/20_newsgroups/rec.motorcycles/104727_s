 apparently that last post was a little hasy, since i
 called around to more places and got quotes for less
 than 600 and 425.  liability only, of course.
 
 plus, one palced will give me c7c for my car + liab on the bike for
 only 1350 total, which ain't bad at all.
 
 so i won't go with the first place i called, that's
 fer sure.
