 this summer (~july 20) my wife (michelle) and i will be in boston
 attending my brother's wedding.  after the wedding we are planning
 to motor up to bar harbor, maine to visit some relatives for a few
 days.  our summer would be *made* if we could find a bike (or bikes)
 to borrow or rent to ride up to bar harbor and back.
 
 here's some important details:  i've been riding for ~11 years,
 (my own bikes for the past 7 years), michelle has been riding for the
 past 6 years (her own bikes), i've only been involved in one accident
 which was caused by a cage driver running a stop sign, i currently own
 a bmw r90, michelle owns a yamaha virago 700, we prefer cruising over
 racing, we've toured a fair amount, we're both licensed and insured,
 and we're nice people.
 
 so, if anyone has a bike (or bikes :-), but the second one would have
 to be a virago or something else with an equally low seat) that they
 would be willing to loan us for 3-4 days in july, michelle and i would
 be eternally grateful. in addition to our friendship, you would also
 have the use of our bikes should you ever pass through minneapolis.
 in exchange, we would be happy to take you and a guest out for dinner
 and an evening of wild bike stories, or we might even be willing to
 cough up some money for improvements to the bike(s), like new tires or
 something.
 
 also, any information about bike rentals in the boston area would be
 greatly appreciated.
 
 thanks,
 scott brandt
