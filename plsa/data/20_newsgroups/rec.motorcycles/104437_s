 hey... i'm pretty new to the wonderful world of motorcycles... i just
 bought
 a used 81 kaw kz650 csr from a friend.... i was just wondering what kind of
 
 saddle bags i could get for it (since i know nothing about them)  are there
 bags for the gas tank?  how much would some cost, and how much do they
 hold?
 thanks for your advice!!!  i may be new to riding, but i love it
 already!!!!
 :)
