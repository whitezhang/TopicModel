 i have had this happen to me often enough that i always look for it.
 on my ride to work in the morning i come to a stop light where there are
 3 lanes in my direction.  one for left turns, one for straight through, and
 one for right turns.  all clearly marked.  plus there is a clearly marked 
 bicycle lane.  i ride into the right turn lane with my signal on and stop at 
 the stop line.  looking left to see if i can make a "right turn on red" and
 when i start to move discovered that some idiot has pulled into the bike
 lane and is trying to pass me on the right.  grrr.
    i always do a head check on bike lanes.  not always for bicycles. . .
