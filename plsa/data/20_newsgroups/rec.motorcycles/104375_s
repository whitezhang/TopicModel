 this tactic depends for its effectiveness on the dog's conformance to
 a "psychological norm" that may not actually apply to a particular dog.
 i've tried it with some success before, but it won't work on a charlie manson
 dog or one that's really, *really* stupid.  a large irish setter taught me
 this in *my* yard (apparently his territory) one day.  i'm sure he was playing 
 a game with me.  the game was probably "kill the very angry neighbor" before 
 he can dispense the terrible punishment.
