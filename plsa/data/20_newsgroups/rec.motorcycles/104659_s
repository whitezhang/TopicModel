 ordered 2 fork seals and 2 guide bushings from ca for my fzr.  two weeks later
 get 2 fork seals and 1 guide bushing.  call ca and ask for remaining *guide*
 bushing and order 2 *slide* bushings (explain on the phone which bushings are
 which; the guy seemed to understand).  two weeks later get 2 guide bushings.
 
 *sigh*
 
 how much you wanna bet that once i get all the parts and take the fork apart
 that some parts won't fit?
