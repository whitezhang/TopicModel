 greetings netters,
 
 steve writes ... <about cobra locks>
 
 well i have the mother of all locks. on friday the 16th of april i took
 possesion of a 12' cobra links lock, 1" diameter. this was a special order.
 
 i weighs a lot. i had to carry it home and it was digging into my shoulder
 after about two blocks.
 
 i have currently a kryptonite rock lock through the front wheel, a hd
 padlock for the steering lock, a master padlock to lock the cover to two
 front spokes, and the cobra links through the rear swing arm and around a
 post in an underground parking garage.
 
 next friday the 30th i have an appointment to have an alarm installed on
 me bike.
 
 when i travel the cobra links and the cover and padlock stay at home.
 
 by the way. i also removed the plastic mesh that is on the cobra links
 and encased the lock from end to end using bicycle inner tubes (two of
 them) i got the from bicycle dealer that sold me the cobra links. the
 guys were really great and didn't mark up the price of the lock much
 and the inner tubes were free.
 
 later.
