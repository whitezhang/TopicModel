 : formal training is in my view absolutely essential if you're going to
 : be able to ride a bike properly and safely. but by including countersteering
 : theory in newbie courses we are confusing people unnecessarily, right at
 : the time when there are *far* more important matters for them to learn.
 : and that was my original point.

 i am in complete concordance with you there, mike.  i was a silver starrider
 instructor, for a while.  i learn't about countersteering last year
 and i have been riding bikes since 1976.  we were never told about
 countersteering when being taught to instruct.  it doesn't seem to have
 affected me or my friends or pupils.  we just rode in blissful ignorance.
