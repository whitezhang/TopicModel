   when did *you* go out and change the laws of physics? :-)  according to some
 numbers i used to see bandied around, shaft drive is on the order of 95-97%
 efficient, while chain drive is closer to 99%...   seems to me that this makes
 *chain* drive more efficient, hmmmmm???
 
   and granted, shaft has a lot less maintenance, which is fine, if you don't
 mind less performance... :-) :-)
