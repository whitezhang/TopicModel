 hi there kids and kidlets...
 
 
 it your ol' pal the kotpm  (keeper of the pin money!)
 
 
 i've got good new and bad news...
 
 	good news - i got laid..er...
 	the pins will be coming, to use the computer software phrase,  "real
 	soon now"
 
 	bad news - right after we placed our order, the company upped its
 	minimum order for manufacturing.  we got in under the wire (with
 	an order of 115 or so pins), but as a result of the low number of
 	pins, we were relegated to the "we'll get to it in-between other
 	runs" bin.  as a result, it seems that it may be another 4 or 5 weeks
 	until your beloved geeky is guiding you along the blacktop..  (and
 	we thought madonnas on the dashboard were foolish; hmmm, now, if that
 	were madonna sitting on my dashboard, that could be dangerous...hell.
 	i'm tough.)
 
    so...please continue to be patient.  as soon as they arrive, i'll post
    	the grand announcement, and rush our messiah on his way directly
 	to your abode.  in the meantime, if you need revised versions of the
 	holy word of geeky, please send $15.95 cash or money order (no cod's)
 	to:
 
 	ranch apocalyp...er......ashram geeky, 305 cyberspace place...
 
 	i'm off to msf class...hope it's not too boring...my wife made me go
 	with her!
