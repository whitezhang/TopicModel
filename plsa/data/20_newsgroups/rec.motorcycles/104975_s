 well, just got all the parts replaced that needed replced
 (sprokets+chain) and notice that engine still taps like it did before.
 all our local 'experts' say it's the tappits that need some adjusting so
 i am soon to attempt that.  i would like any advice anyone had.  i do
 not have a shop manual but have read about the procedure in chiltons and
 in a few other places.  is there anything i need to be particularaly
 carful of?  any problems anyone else has encountered?
 
 i ride a 1981 yamaha exciter 250cc (stop laughing, it's tiny, but it's
 shiny)
