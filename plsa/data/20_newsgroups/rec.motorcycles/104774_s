 while shopping for a passenger helmet, i noticed that in many cases the
 external dimensions of the helmets were the same from s through xl.  the
 difference was the amount of inside padding.
 
 my solution was to buy a large helmet, and construct a removable liner 
 from a sheet of .5" closed-cell foam and some satin (glued to the inside
 surface).  the result is a reasonably snug fit on my smallest-headed pillion
 with the liner in, and a comfortable fit on my largest-headed pillion with
 the liner out.  everyone else gets linered or not by best fit.
