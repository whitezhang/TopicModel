 i got a sample of black reflector material, maybe from "conspicuity"?
 it is black but reflects silver if the angle of incidence is shallow.
 whoever it was i got it from sold/sells kits that fit bmw (and other
 brands?) of luggage and fenders. don't know what i did with the sample;
 the kits seemed too expensive, as i recall.
