 hola amigos,
 
 quiero... i need an answer to a pressing question.  i now own two
 bikes and would love to keep them both.  one is a capable and
 smooth street bike, low and lightweight with wide power and great
 brakes; the other is a beemer g/s, kind of rough for the city but
 great on the long road and backroad.  a good start at a stable, but
 i don't think it's going to work.  unfortunately, insurance is going
 to pluck me by the short hairs.  
 
 unless... some insurance agent offers a multi-vehicle discount.  they
 do this all the time for cars, assuming that you're only capable of 
 driving one of the things at a time.  i don't think i'll ever manage
 to straddle both bikes and ride them tandem down the street. (turn left...
 accelerate the zephyr; turn right... accelerate the beemer.)  does
 anybody know of an agency that makes use of this simple fact to
 discount your rates?  state farm doesn't.
 
 by the way, i'm moving to the bay area so i'll be insuring the bikes
 there, and registering them.  to ease me of the shock, can somebody
 guesstimate the cost of insuring a zr550 and a r800gs?  here in tucson
 they only cost me $320 (full) and $200 (liability only) for the two,
 per annum.
 
 muchas gracias,
 			enrique
