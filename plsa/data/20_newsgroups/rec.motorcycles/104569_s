   sure you can do wheelies with a shaft drive bike. i had a bmw r100rs
 that was a wheelie monster! of course it didn't have the initial power
 burst to just twist it into the air - i had to pop the clutch. i also
 had to replace front fork seals a few times as well. the fairing is a 
 bit heavy to be slamming down onto those little stantion tubes all the
 time. but let me give you fair warning: i trashed the ring/pinion gear
 in the final drive of my k75 (i assume) doing wheelies. and this was 
 no cheap fix either!! there is some kind of "slip" device in the shaft
 to prevent it from breaking. unfortunately, it didn't save the gears!
 
   on the topic of wheelies, the other day i saw a kid on a big hurricane
 do a "stoppy"(?), or rear wheelie. man, he had the rear end on this bike 
 up about 2 feet off the ground at a traffic light. i don't recommend these
 activities anymore (now that i'm an "old guy" with kids of my own) but
 it looked damn impressive!!
 
   if you can't keep both tires on the ground, at least have 'em pointed
 in that direction! :-)
 
 cheers,
