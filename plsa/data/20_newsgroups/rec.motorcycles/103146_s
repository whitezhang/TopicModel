 i'll put in a vote for the latter. a bike
 takes a lot of involvement, and i for one
 do not want any accident to be my fault.
 
 i remember one artical where the reviewer
 tried the radio on the bike, not having had
 one on any of his. he stated that the bike
 tended to go faster when the music was 
 good. i agree, having felt like this my self,
 and this was not a physical imparement, like
 drinking, just the emotional lift from music.
 
 first rule of ecology: there is never only one side-effect.
 
 ride well-
