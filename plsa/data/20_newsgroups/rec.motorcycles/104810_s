 a few random thoughts on riding with a passenger:
 
 there's no substitute for a bike with sufficient power, having taken
 passengers very occasionally on the small (125 etc) bikes i used to
 ride in the uk it was hard ! i'm now riding a gs1100 and that's great,
 even moving from my freinds gsx600 i was riding recently. this may be due
 in part to the fact that neither i, nor my regular passengers, are
 particularly slimline !
 
 i always tell passengers, stay in line with the bike on corners, that makes
 their movements predictable.
 
 my regular passengers both tend to hold either the rack or nothing at all,
 i don't really like having a passenger hold onto me except for short periods.
 again that may be biased by the fact that i've had a couple of new passengers
 (a friend recently for her first time on a bike) who hold on to me real tight,
 making any kind of maneuvering difficult.
 
 i've also discovered that on longer trips i prefer a passenger who moves and
 shifts their weight a bit. i recently took a work collegue to a meeting (about
 a 1 hour ride) and he sat totally still the whole way which left me also
 sitting very still and getting a sore back.
 
 we have a code system for turns, stop and for 'i need to shift position'.
