 i was able to avoid an accident by revving my engine and having my
 *stock* harley pipes make enough noise to draw someones attention.
 
 i instinctively revved my engine before i went for my horn. don't know
 why, but i did it and it worked. thats rather important.
 
 i am not saying "the louder the pipes the better". my harley is loud
 and it gets me noticed on the road for that reason. i personally do
 not feel it is to loud. if you do, well thats to bad; welcome to 
 america - "home of the free, land of the atlanta braves".
 
 if you really want a fine tuned machine like our federal government
 to get involved and pass db restrictions; it should be generous
 enough so that a move like revving your engine will get you noticed.
 sure there are horns but my hand is already on the throttle. should we
 get into how many feet a bike going 55mph goes in .30 seconds; or
 how long it would take me to push my horn button??
 
 and aren't you the guy that doesn't even have a bike???
