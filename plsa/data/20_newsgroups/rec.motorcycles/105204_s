 maybe they are riding around an ever-decreasing circle of lies which
 eventually leads to the truth....

 me too, though unfortunately the "official line" is the one that you
 have to adhere to if you want to get a full licence. the examiner's
 guidelines are laid down by the government, and the basic rider education
 courses have no choice but to follow them. it surprises me that none of the
 rider groups here, either mag or the bmf make much noise about the fact that
 the riding test requires you to ride three feet from the kerb all the time
 in order to pass, that the front brake must be applied before the rear, that
 you have to keep looking over your shoulder all the time (instead of just
 when it is justified) - there's probably a few more too, which i can't
 think of for the moment. if the riding test could be rejigged a bit 
 to include more of the real-world survival skills and less of the 
 woefully simplistic crap that it contains now, then the accident figures
 would (imho) reduce still further.
 
 don't think we should include countersteering knowledge in our test though...
