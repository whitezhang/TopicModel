 greg,
 
 i'm very new to motorcycles. haven't even bought one yet. i was in the same
 position about you. how do you learn if you've never ridden.
 
 i took a class put on by a group called the motorcycle safety foundation
 in california. they might have something similar in washington.
 
 try calling a motorcycle dealer in your area and asking. it's a good first 
 start on how to ride a motorcycle correctly.
