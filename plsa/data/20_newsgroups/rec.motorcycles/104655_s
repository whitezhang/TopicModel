 	i'm thinking about becoming a bike owner this year
 w/o any bike experience thus far.  i figure that getting a 
 decent used bike for under $1k the thing would pay for itself
 while i'm at grad school (car permits are $$$ where i'm going
 and who want's to ride a bus).  i'm looking for advice
 on a first bike - best models/years.  i'm not looking for
 an old loud roaring thing that sounds like a monster.  the
 quit whirring of newer engines is more to my liking.
 
 apprec any advice.
 
 thanks,
 
 bs
