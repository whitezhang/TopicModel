 i don't want to do this, but i need money for school.  this is
 a very snappy bike.  it needs a little work and i don't have the
 money for it.  some details:
 
 	~19000 miles
 	mitsubishi turbo
 	not asthetically beautiful, but very fast!
 	one of the few factory turboed bikes... not a kit!
 	must see and ride to appreciate how fun this bike is!
 
 i am asking $700 or best offer.  the bike can be seen in
 bennington, vermont.  e-mail for more info!
 
 thanks,
 chris
