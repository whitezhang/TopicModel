 hmmmm i noticed sometime ago that i could do the same on my virago, and
 since i don't read many schematics, i didn't really think aobut it too
 much.   yes it does provide excellent coverage, but i figured it would
 probably draw a little too much current.  i also figured that it was 
 overlapped just to prevent a blank spot of no headlight.  are you saying 
 that these switches are designed for the hi/lo combination?
