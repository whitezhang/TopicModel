 	it is available through some dealerships, who in turn have to back
 order it from the manufacturer directly.  each one is made to order, at least
 if you get a nonstandard length (standard is 5', i believe).

 	see below

 	i have a 6' long cobralinks lock that i used to use for my harley (she
 doesn't get out much anymore, so i don't use the lock that often anymore).  it
 is made of 3/4" articulated steel shells covering seven strands of steel cable.
 it is probably enough to stop all the joyriders, but, unfortunately,
 professionals can open it rather easily:
 
 	1) freeze a link.
 
 	2) break frozen link with your favorite method (hammers work well).
 
 	3) snip through the steel cables (which, i have on authority, are
 		frightfully thin) with a set of boltcutters.
 
 	for the same money, you can get a kryptonite cable lock, which is
 anywhere from 1/2" to 7/8" thick steel cable (looks like steel rope), shielded
 in a flexible covering to protect your bike's finish, and has a barrel-type
 locking mechanism.  i don't know if it's adjustable, but my source says it's
 more difficult to pick than most locks, and the cable tends to squish flat
 in bolt-cutter jaws rather than shear (5/8" model).
 
 	all bets are off if the thief has a die grinder with a cutoff wheel.
 even the most durable locks tested yield to this tool in less than one minute.
 
 	fyi, i'll be getting a krypto cable next paycheck.
 
 later,
