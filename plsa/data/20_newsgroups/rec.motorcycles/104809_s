 a squid is the guy i saw back in december on cool 40 degree morning on my way
 to work. he was wearing knee-length pants, light jacket, no gloves, though he
 was going considerably slower than dod nominal.
 
 a poser squid was the guy i saw yesterday on my way home.  similar attire as
 above sans jacket (it is april in texas ya know), but he is riding down the
 freeway, left hand on his side (kinda robinhoodlike), with his body turned
 slightly left.  brings a whole new meaning to the term poser.
