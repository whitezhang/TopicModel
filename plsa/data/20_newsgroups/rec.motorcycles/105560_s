 a few weeks ago i was in the dmv with ken. i was standing in a mile long 
 line waiting for some really bored looking person to fleece a bunch of 
 people from some dough. ken was sitting on a chair next to our helmets 
 wondering why everybody there looked to be about the social calibur of 
 people you would find at a laundromat when some young woman walked in who 
 required our conferring attentions. he came over and stood in line with me 
 while we watched her fill out some forms and then we noticed a little kid 
 about 4 years old reach over the bench and touch our helmets, one at a time. 
 i didn't particularly mind, and neither did ken (that the kid was touching 
 our helmets that is). but the helmets weren't on the most stable of 
 platforms, so ken scooted over there to resettle them and as soon as he 
 touched the helmets, mother of said child started shrieking at her kid "you 
 stay away from those you shit!" and whopped the tyke brutally about the head 
 and shoulders.
 
 i suppose it was our scary "sex drugs and unix" t-shirts that sent such 
 bouts of terror through her body.
