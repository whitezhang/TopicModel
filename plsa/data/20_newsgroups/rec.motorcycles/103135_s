 damn right. i was late for a climbing meet one morning, so i got
 out of bed without bothering that my right foot was still asleep.
 it reminded me by folding underneath with a crunching of metatarsals.
 lucky the brake's on the right, but i got funny looks riding thru 
 london with one leg held aloft.
 
 (climbing wasnt a problem - the best splint in the world is a tight
 climbing shoe.)
