 step 1) join the ama (american motorcycling association).  call 1-800-ama-join.
 
 step 2) after you become a member, they will ship your bike, uncrated to 
 just about anywhere across the fruited plain for a few hundred bucks.
 
 i have used this service and have been continually pleased.  they usually
 only take a few days for the whole thing, and you do not have to prepare
 the bike in any way (other than draining the gas).  not to mention that
 it is about 25% of the normal shipping costs (by the time you crate a bike
 and ship it with another company, you can pay around $1000)
