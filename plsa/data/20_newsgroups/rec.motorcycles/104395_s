 anyone in europe got any advice for a us citizen whose going to be living
 and working in italy for a year and wants to buy a motorcycle there?  an
 italian friend just arrived here in washington state to work for two years,
 and she's finding it very very difficult to obtain car insurance.  so i
 thought i'd ask...
 
 i have a us license, with motorcycle endorsement (unlimited displacement),
 and have had for 30 years.  i am also a washington state motorcycle safety
 instructor, if that info might help.
 
 i will post a summary, even if it's just of my own personal experience in 
 buying a bike and getting it insured after i get to italy.
