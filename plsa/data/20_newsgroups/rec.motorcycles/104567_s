 look, guy, i doubt anyone here approves of drunk driving, but if
 he's been caught and convicted and punished maybe you ought to
 lighten up? i mean, it isn't like most of us haven't had a few
 and then ridden or driven home. *we* just didn't get caught.
 and i can speak for myself and say it will *never* happen again,
 but that is beside the point.
 
 in answer to the original poster: i'd insure whatever vehicle
 is cheapest, and can get you to and from work, and suffer
 through it for a few years, til your rates drop.
 
 and *don't* drink and drive. i had one friend killed by a 
 drunk, and i was rear ended by one, totaling my bike (bent
 frame), and only failing to kill me because i had an eye
 on my mirror while i waited at the stoplight.
