 
 
 i am in hte market for a new bike (been without for a few years).
 the two main bikes i'm looking at seriously are
 the yamaha virago 535 and the honda shadow vlx 583. 
 i am leaning towards the yamaha for its shaft drive, the honda is chain.
 insurance in fla. is more costly than i thought, so i am staying in this
 power range. thanks in advance for any opinions and or experiences
