 well, it's closer to bryce than bryce is to arches. i'd spend a lot
 of time studying the maps, there's a lot of "you can't get there from
 here" in that area. you might want to hit the grand canyon on the way
 up from california, loop around to canyonlands/moab/arches, and then
 back down towards bryce & zion on the way home.
 
 make sure you ride us 12 between capitol reef and bryce, it's been on a
 number of "top 10 roads" lists.
 
 
 a nice booklet detailing a lot of interesting paved (byways) and unpaved
 (backways) roads can be ordered from the utah travel council. i think
 you can also get a state map from them just for asking.
