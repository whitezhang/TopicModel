 what's the problem here?  back in 1958 i rode a puch 175 from paris to
 barcelona and back.  that was a two stroke, and back then it was representative
 of the size of bikes on the road.  a 350 was considered a big bike, and the
 superbikes of the day were 500cc or 600cc.  anything bigger was real rare.
