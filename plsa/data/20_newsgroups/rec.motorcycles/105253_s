 seriously, though, putting a helmet on a mirror is inadvisable because
 you are then resting the weight of the helmet on the fragile foam
 liner that is expected to cushion your noggin.  and once crushed, that
 foam never pops back.
 
 a variation of mirror hanging thing is what i do; with the bike on the
 sidestand (hey, the centerstand is for maintenance) i turn the wheel to
 the stop (left) and can hang the helmet by the chin-bar on the right
 grip.  there is no crushable foam in the chin-bar, and it is pretty
 secure on there (as long as the forks are locked).  if i have to leave
 the helmet with the parked bike (and the bags aren't on/full), that is
 about the most stable place.
