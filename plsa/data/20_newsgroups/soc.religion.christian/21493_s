 i would like to see his reasoning behind this.  you may have gotten 
 "burned" by natural disaster prophecies down there, but that
 does not mean that every natural disaster/judgement prophecy is
 false.  take a quick look at the book of jeremiah and it is obvious
 that judgement prophecies can be valid.  here in the us, it seems like
 we might have more of a problem with positive prophecies, though i
 am sure there may be a few people who are too into judgement.
 
 sometimes god does give words that are difficult to swallow.  the
 relative positiveness of a prophecy is not necesarily grounds to
 dismiss it.  much of the ot is not happy stuff.
