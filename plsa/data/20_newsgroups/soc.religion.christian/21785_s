    i guess i would react rather strongly to this line of thinking carried 
 out!  when you think "your army" is stronger than "mine", you would 
 "righteously" take my children and baptize them, doing what you know is 
 really "best" for them.
    you cannot possibly put this kind of action, nor the crusades into the 
 context of the teachings of jesus/god.  i think he advocated a different 
 approach that was *by design* made to be appealing, to those called by him, 
 not chosen by a church practice.
    it seems to me you have the cause and effect switched, the change comes 
 and then you get baptized.
