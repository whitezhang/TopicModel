 
   are there any members of conservative, religious, politically active groups
 (such as the christian coalition) out there?  i come from a very liberal 
 background, and i'd like to talk to some conservative people out there in a 
 public forum (such as this one.)  i frankly can't understand the rationale or
 christian basis for much of the conservative position, and i'd like to try and
 learn more about this movement--after all, we're part of the same church.  is
 anyone interested in explaining a bit about the conservative viewpoint?
   thanks.
