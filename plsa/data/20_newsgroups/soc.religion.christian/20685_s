 one can feel physical pain by having a body, which, if you know the
 doctrine of the resurrection of the body, is what people will have after
 the great judgement.  "we look for the resurrection of the dead, and the
 life of the world to come."  - nicene-constantinopolitan creed.  you
 will have both body and soul in hell - eventually.
