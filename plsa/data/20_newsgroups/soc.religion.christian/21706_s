    rex, there are literally hundreds of thousands of 32nd degree
 masons in this country, and thousands of 33rds. if nasty stuff was
 really going on, don't you think you'd have more than a couple of
 disgruntled members "exposing" it? heck, if what you say is true, then
 rev. norman vincent peale is an osiris worshiper.

 long quote from someone named hislop (source not given) deleted. i'm
 attempting to extract from it the relevent points: 
 
   * osiris is actually nimrod, a babylonian deity. 
 
   * "it is admitted that the secret system of free masonry was originally
     founded on the mysteries of the egyptian isis, the goddess-mother, or
     wife of osiris."
 
   * the babylonian nimrod and osiris are both connected with the building
     trade, ie, with masonry.
 
   * nimrod, as the son of cush, was a negro. [isn't this refering to a 
     biblical nimrod, rather than the babylonian god?]
 
   *  ...there was a tradition in egypt, recorded by plutarch, that 'osiris
      was black'.
 ...]
 
      there is a long tradition in masonry of claiming ancient lineage
 for the order, on the flimsiest of grounds. this dates right back to
 the constitutions of 1738, which cite adam as the first mason. i've
 seen other claims which place masonry among the romans, greeks, and
 egyptians, and atlanteans. i even have a book which claims to prove
 that stonehenge was originally a masonic temple. 
 
     claims prove nothing. where's the beef, rex?

    i'd have to check this. the tomb paintings i remember don't show
 this.

    can you give ancient citations for this? the druids were suppressed
 over 2000 years ago. what's your point?
 
    this whole "leopard skin" business sounds bizarre.  i have not yet
 gone through the scottish rite (which contains all of those "higher
 degrees" anti-masons get so excited about, and which was invented in
 the 1750's), but i know enough people who have (and who are good
 christians), that i reject your claim.

 not so much a 'slap in the face' as 'a weary feeling of deja vu'. i'm
 going through a very similar argument over on soc.culture.african.american.

     why don't you try reading some serious books on masonic history, such
 as hamill's "the craft"?
 
 >why are you now separating yourself from this which not many years ago,
 >was freely admitted?
 
    because we got honest. if you can come up with actual evidence that
 masonry existed prior to 1390, i'd be very impressed (actually,
 anything earlier than 1630 would be pretty good.)
