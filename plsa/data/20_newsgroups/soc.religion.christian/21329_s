           perspective.
 
     iv)   to emphasize and discuss the similarities between ahmadi 
           muslims and followers of other religions of the world and 
           to explore how understanding and respect for each other's

           erance and malice among people of all religious and phil-
           osophical traditions.
           
     v)    to look into the origin and teachings of all religions in
           general and of islam and ahmadiyya muslim movement in par-
           ticular, and to use the commonality of origin to foster
           better understanding among ahmadi muslims and other people
           and to promote an acceptance of universality of fundamental
           rights to the freedom of conscience.

           to these problems, as offered by different religions and 
           systems of ethical philosophies.

           with particular emphasis on the ahmadi muslim perspective,
           but with openness to dialogue with people of all religions
           and philosophical traditions with reasoned positions as to
           the relationship between religion and empirical science,
           logic, and scientific ethics. 
           
     viii) to exchange important news and views about the ahmadiyya
           muslim community and of other religions.
 
     ix)   to add diversity to the existing religious newsgroups pre-  
           sent on usenet in the interest of promoting a forum for
           decorous dialogue. 
 
     x)    to inquire why religious persecution is on the rise in the
           world and suggest solutions to remedy the ever deterior-
           ating situation in the world in general and in the islamic
           world in particular. 
 
     xi)   to commemorate the contributions to humanity, society and
           world peace made by the founders and followers of all
           religions in general and by the international ahmadiyya
           muslim community in particular.
 
 
 type: 
 ====
 
 the group will be moderated for orderly and free religious dialo-
 gue. the moderation will not prevent disagreement, dissent, or 
 controversy based on a difference of beliefs or doctrine; rather,
 the moderators will seek mainly to discourage gratuitously deroga-
 tory, abusive, or squalid language, and the introduction of issues
 which are irrelevant based on the provisions of this charter. 
 
 the moderators have been chosen through personal e-mail and through
 a general consensus among the proponents by discussion in news.groups.
 the following moderators have been proposed and agreed upon:
 
 moderator:     nabeel a. rana  <rana@rintintin.colorado.edu>
 co-moderator:  dr. tahir ijaz  <ijaz@ccu.umanitoba.ca>
 
 
 
 a  brief  description  about  ahmadiyya  islam:
 ===============================================
 
 
         the ahmadiyya movement in islam, an international organi-
 sation, was found in 1889 in qadian, india. the founder of this
 movement, hazrat mirza ghulam ahmad (1835-1908), was proclaimed to 
 be the promised reformer of this age as foretold in the scriptures
 of almost all major religions of the world. he claimed to be the 
 fulfillment of the long awaited second comming of jesus christ
 (metaphorically), the muslim mahdi, and the promised messiah.
 
         the claims of hazrat ahmad raised storms of hostility and
 extreme opposition, which are often witnessed in the history of 
 divine reformers. even today this sect is being persecuted especial-
 ly in some of the muslim regimes. the right of ahmadi muslims to 
 openly practice their religion and to define themselves as muslims
 has been severely restricted in many muslim countries. the united
 nations, human rights organizations such as amnesty international
 and top leaderships of some countries have voiced their concerns 
 against this denial of basic human and civil liberaties to the
 members of this movement, but so far to no avail.
 
         despite the opposition and persecution, the movement cont-
 inues to grow with a current membership of millions from around the
 world in over 130 countries, who come from diverse ethnic and cul-
 tural backgrounds.
 
         the movement is devoted to world peace and strives towards
 developing a better understanding of all religions. ahmadi muslims
 have always been opposed to all forms of violence, bigotry, reli-
 gious intolerance and fundamentalism.
 
         among its many philanthropic activities, the sect has es-
 tablished a network of hundreds of schools, hospitals, and clinics
 in many third world countries. these institutions are staffed by
 volunteer professionals and are fully financed by the movement's
 internal resources. the movement stresses the importance of educa-
 tion and leadership. its members have included a high number of
 professionals as well as world class individuals.
 
         the ahmadiyya mission is to bring about a universal moral
 reform, establish peace and justice, and to unite mankind under
 one universal brotherhood.
 
 
 newsgroup creation: 
 ==================
 
         the  discussion for this proposed newsgroup has now offi-
 cially ended. voting will be held for three weeks. if the news-
 group gets 2/3rd majority and 100 more "yes/create" votes than
 "no/don't create" votes; the newsgroup shall be created. 
 
 
 about the vote-taker: 
 ====================
 
         mr. anthony lest has been asked by the proponents of
 this newsgroup to act as an official impartial vote-taker for the
 proposed newsgroup. he has no objection to  use his workstation
 for the purpose of vote-taking. neither the university of colora-
 do, nor anthony lest has anything to do with the proposal of the
 newsgroup.  they are just collecting the votes as a neutral third
 party.
