 how about:
 
 	the holocaust
 	the spanish inquisition
 	jonestown
 
 (just to name a few) ?
 
 authorities sometimes tell people to do evil things.  people who "just
 follow orders" have tortured and killed others in very large numbers,
 and protest their innocence afterwards.
 
 when your authority starts telling you to do things, you should ask
 questions.  except for situations of pressing need ("i said shut the
 hatch because the submarine is filling with water!"), any reasonable
 authority should be able to give at least some justification that you
 can understand.
 
 just be sure to listen when authority answers.
 
 (if anybody is interested in questions of psychological pressure and
  following orders, you might want to read about a study done by solomon ashe
  in 1951 on conformity, and another done by stanley milgram in 1963 on
  obedience.  both should be in any good book on psychology/sociology.  the
  results are both fascinating and terrifying.)
