     |your logic is falty.  if christianity is a drug, and once we die we  
     |die, then why would you be reluctant to embrase this drug so that    
     |while you are alive you enjoy yourself.

 pardon the harshness that follows...
 
 once, i told a cradle christian: please do not take advantage of jesus
 or anybody for the sake of your own (selfish) realization or search
 for true faith/religion/belonging/'being in'/fear of hell/vanity/etc.  
 instead of serving yourself, _we must be serving him_.  
 *until you have comprehended this truth, you are only doing things for your 
 own egoism.*
 
 let us not use jesus, our religion, the bible, anything or
 anybody as a means of escape or getting ecstatic or high.
 we are god's children and we must have a true and authentic
 relationship with our father with obedience, faith, hope and 
 love and works (the last as the most important).
 
 beware of our 'materialistic', 'worldly' and 'selfish' motives.  
 atheists have this ground against us and i believe they are right about
 *some* who call themselves 'christians'.
