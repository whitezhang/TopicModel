 	the way you are interpreting those passages is your opinion.  you make
 	it sound as if your opinion is somehow an undisputable fact.
 
 	many would interpret the passages you cite very differently.
 
 	(many have--several of the great theologians you mentioned do that 
 	very thing.  these were people who had much more expertise in the
 	interpretation of scripture than you or me or probably anyone reading
 	this newsgroup.  to say that all of them are wrong and you are right
 	is, in my opinion, (notice those last three words) coming pretty darn
 	close to the sin of pride.  
 
 	in the future i would suggest you not be so absolutist in your 
 	interpretations, especially when contradicting highly respected
 	doctors of christianity.
