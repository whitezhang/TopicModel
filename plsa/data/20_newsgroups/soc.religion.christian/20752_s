 i haven't followed whatever discussion there may have been on these
 people, but i feel that c. s. lewis is an excellent apologist and i
 see no reason for embarrassment.  if you think that errors and flawed
 arguments are a reason for dismissing a thinker, you must dismiss
 nearly every thinker from descartes to kant; any philosophy course
 will introduce you to their weaknesses.

 i said nothing about "the masses."  however comparing "the masses" in
 our day and in aquinas' day really *is* odd.  read ortega y gasset on
 this.
 
 i'm talking about the familiar experience of arguing all night and
 winning on logic and evidence, only to discover your opponent to be
 unaware, even intuitively, of things like entailment (let alone
 pragmatics).  (i am assuming that both parties are college graduates
 or better...)  myself, i don't bother any more.
