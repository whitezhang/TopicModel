 maybe i'm a little tired but i can't seem to follow the logic here. if 
 whatever is held true on earth is held true in heaven how is it that a priest
 (rc only apparently) is required. 
 
 in fact if i read the next verse correctly (matthew 18:19) i understand that
 for a marriage to take place only two are required to agree on earth touching
 one thing and it shall be done.

 [unfortunately i haven't been able to find any completely precise
 statements about what is needed.  (as usual, the current edition of
 the catholic encyclopedia is frustratingly vague.)  i do know that the
 priest is viewed as a witness, and thus in some sense would not be
 required.  however part of the purpose of formal marriage is to avoid
 any ambiguity about who has and has not taken on the commitment.  the
 community provides support to marriage, and in cases of problems are
 involved in helping to make sure that the people carry out as much of
 their commitment as possible.  thus marriage must be a public
 commitment.  the presence of a priest is required for a regular
 marriage.  where i'm not clear is exactly where the boundaries are in
 exceptional cases ("valid but irregular").  ne temere (1907) says that
 no marriage involving a catholic is valid without a priest (according
 to the oxford dictionary of the church), and they imply that the new
 canon law retains this, but i'd rather see a more recent and
 authoritative source.  note that while a catholic priest is required
 for catholics, the catholic church does recognize marriage between
 baptized non-catholics as valid without a priest.  --clh]
