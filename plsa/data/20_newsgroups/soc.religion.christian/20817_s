 yes, i agree.  what i'm trying to point out is that, in matters of faith
 (i.e. tenets which are not logically persuasive), one may be convinced
 of the truth of certain things through, for instance, personal
 revelation.  and its certainly fine to share that revelation or those
 beliefs with others.  and i don't think that its arrogant, persay, to
 accepts matters of pure faith as truth for oneself.  where i think the
 conflict arises is in assuming that, where disagreements on beliefs
 arise, all others *must* have been given the same truth, and that god 
 must reveal his truth to everyone in such a way that all would 
 honestly agree.  i think this can lead to the conclusion that anyone 
 who disagrees with you are being sinful or dishonest; that they are 
 rejecting something they *know* to be truth because it is inconvenient 
 for them, or because they wish to spurn god.
 
 i would say that this is equivalent to assuming that *all* truths one 
 holds are universal and absolute.  and the problem i see with this is 
 that it negates the individuality of humans and their relationships with
 god.  this does not mean there is no absolute truth; just that some areas
 of doctrinal disagreement may be areas where god has not established or 
 revealed that truth.
