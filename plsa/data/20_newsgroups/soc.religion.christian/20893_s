 in a cell church, the fundamental building block is the "cell group" -- a
 small group of no more than 15 believers.  the small groups are responsible
 for the ministry of the church: evangelism and discipleship.  the emphasis
 is on relationships, not on programs, and both the evangelism and the
 discipling are relationship-based.
 
 this will probably raise more questions than it answered, but that's it in
 a nutshell.
