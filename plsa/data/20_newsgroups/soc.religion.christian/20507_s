 this is one of the differences between ot prophecy and nt prophecy.  in the
 nt, it is expected that when believers gather,
   - people will prophesy
   - the prophecy must be judged (1 cor 14:29)
 there is nothing about killing someone who makes a mistake.

 scripture is scripture; there is no "gift of scripture".  and i don't know
 about you, but i know that _i_ have made mistakes while filled with the
 spirit.  if you don't give grace to allow people to make mistakes, they
 will never grow in the use of the spiritual gifts!
 
 when we minister in my small group, i encourage people to speak out any
 impressions or images they think might be from the lord.  only by trying
 will they know whether they were right or wrong -- and in either case,
 they'll have a better handle on it the next time.
 
 didn't you fall when you were learning to ride a bicycle?  but you kept on
 trying, and you learned both from your failures and your successes.
 spiritual gifts are no different -- you get better with experience.

 the canon of scripture is complete.  does this mean that god no longer
 speaks?  i have heard his voice -- not audibly (though some have), but
 clearly nonetheless.  is what i heard equivalent to scripture?  no.  i have
 never heard contemporary prophets claim that what they receive from the
 lord is on the same level as scripture; on the contrary, those who are
 mature obey the scriptures by submitting their prophecies to fellow
 believers for judgement.  and the most reliable yardstick for judging
 prophecies is, certainly, the scriptures themselves.  the canon is closed
 -- but god is not silent!

 does it matter what it is called?  the question is not how to label it, but
 how to receive it.  words of knowledge, incidentally, are similar to
 prophecy (and sometimes the two overlap), but generally it is supernatural
 knowledge of some fact that could not be known otherwise.
