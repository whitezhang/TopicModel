 short reply:  we can never achieve perfect health, yet we always strive for it.  
 we don't seek to do god's will because we're forced to, we follow his way 
 because his way is best.  the reason it's hard is because we are flawed, not 
 because he's unreasonable.  but we seek to follow his way because we want to 
 improve ourselves and our lives.
