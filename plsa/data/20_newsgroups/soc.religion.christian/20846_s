 exactly. 
 
 c. s. lewis has taken a couple of pretty severe hits in this group lately.
 first somebody was accusing him of being self-righteous and unconvincing.
 now we are told that we christians should be embarrassed by him. (as well
 as by josh mcdowell, about whom i have no comment, having never read his
 work.)
 
 anyone who thinks that c. s. lewis was self-righteous ought to read his
 introduction to the problem of pain, which is his theodicy. in it, he
 explains that he wanted to publish the book anonymously. why? although he
 believed in the argument he was presenting, he did not want to seem to
 presume to tell others how brave they should be in the face of their own
 suffering. he did not want people to think that he was presenting himself
 as some kind of model of fortitude, or that he was anything other than what
 he considered himself to be -- "a great coward." 
 
 ofm has adequately handled the question of whether we ought to be
 embarrassed by lewis' liar/lunatic/lord argument (which, by the way, is
 part of a *much* bigger discourse.) i would just like to add that, far from
 being embarrassed by lewis, i am in a state of continual amazement at the
 soundness and clarity of the arguments he presents.
