 it is just as christ said about his return:
 
 "some will say, 'he is in the desert.' or some will say, 'he is in the
 wilderness.'  but do not believe them.  for as lightning flashes east to
 west so shall the coming of the son of man be."  
                                          { my paraphrase - i think the
 verse is
                                            somewhere in john }
