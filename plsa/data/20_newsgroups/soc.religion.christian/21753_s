    "questions arise as we begin to think about logos and what his inner
 consciousness was composed of. we need to clarify the two natures of christ
 briefly.  the divine nature, which has existed eternally, did not undertake any
 essential changes during the incarnation which would cause a conflict with the
 attributes of god, the foremost of these being his immutability.  this would
 mean that it remained impassable, that is, incapable of suffering and death,
 free from ignorance and insusceptible to weakness and temptation.  in the realm
 of the divine nature it is better to say that the son of god became that which
 was not absolute-and in himself.  the result of the incarnation was that the
 divine logos could be ignorant and weak, could be tempted and suffer and die,
 not in his divine nature, but by the derivation of his possession of a human
 nature.
      this would mean that both the properties of the divine nature and the
 human nature are properties of the person, and therefore ascribed to the
 person. by this reason we can say that the person can be omnipotent,
 omniscient, and omnipresent, yet at the same time be also a man of limited
 power, knowledge, a man of sorrows, subject to human wants and miseries.  there
 is, however, no penetration of one nature into the other.  deity can no more
 share the imperfections of humanity than humanity can share in the essential
 perfection of the godhead.
      we are not to assume that there is a double personality due to the
 possession of the double natures.  christ's human nature is impersonal, in that
 it attains self-consciousness and self-determination in the personality of the
 god-man.  we must now differentiate between the person and the nature of the
 man. nature is defined:
 
 "the distinguishing qualities or properties of something; the fundamental
 character, disposition or temperament of a living being, innate and
 unchangeable."
 
      nature is then, in essence, the substance possessed in common, in as such
 the trinity have one nature.  there is also a common nature of mankind. 
 personality, on the other hand, is the separate subsistence of nature, with the
 power of consciousness and will.  it is for this reason that the human nature
 of christ has not, nor ever had, a separate subsistence, that it is impersonal.
  logos, the god-man, represents the principle of personality.  it is equally
 important to see that self-consciousness and self-determination do not, as
 such, belong to the nature.  it is for this reason that we can justifiably say
 that jesus did not have two consciousness or two wills, but rather one.  it is
 theanthropic, an activity of the one personality which unites in itself the
 human and the divine natures, being that neither the consciousness nor the will
 are simply human or simply divine."
 
 
 [the quotation given above is not identified, and it's not entirely
 clear to me what position loren is taking on it.  just for clarity,
 let me note that the view expressed in it is one of the classic
 christological heresies -- monothelitism.  that's the position that
 christ's two natures were not complete, in that there was only one
 will.  in most cases (which i think includes this example), it was the
 human will that was regarded as missing.
 
 normally people who talk about christ's human nature as being
 "impersonal" mean it in a somewhat more abstract sense.  that is, they
 are using "person" as hypostatis, not in the usual english sense of
 personality.  in this use, the doctrine is called "anhypostasia".
 personally i think anhypostasia is just a more sophisticated way of
 denying that the logos took on humanity fully.  however it has never
 been formally ruled a heresy, and in fact has been held by influential
 theologians both ancient and modern (e.g. athanasius).  but the
 quotation above appears to be going farther than even athanasius went,
 into the realm of the overtly heretical.
