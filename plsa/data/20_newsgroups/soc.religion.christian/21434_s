      it bugs me when i see this kind of nonsense.
 
      first, there is no reasonable evidence linking masonry to ancient
 egypt, or even that it existed prior to the late 14th century (and
 there's nothing definitive before the 17th).
 
      second, worship of osiris is not, nor has it ever been, a part of
 masonic practice (we are strictly non-denominational).
