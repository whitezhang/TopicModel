 i'm very grateful for scott's reflections on this oft-quoted phrase.  could
 someone please remind me of the scriptural source for it?  (rom. 12.9 doesn't
 count, kids.)  the manner in which this little piece of conventional wisdom is
 applied has, in my experience, been uniformly hateful and destructive.
