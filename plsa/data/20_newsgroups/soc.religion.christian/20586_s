 if possible (last i heard, it was out of print but they were considering 
 reprinting) read barbara hambly's _search the seven hills_.  it is 
 historical fiction, set in rome at the time of the early church.  she 
 captures the weirdness of the early christians and yet gives glimpses of 
 the holiness too.  some of their odd views make a lot more sense in the 
 context of the society they lived in.  i found it a remarkably positive 
 view of christianity considering that the author is not a christian 
 herself.  another plus is that each chapter begins with an 
 original-source quote so that it makes a good starting point for serious 
 research.
