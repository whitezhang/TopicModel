    just a quick question. if mary was immaculately concieved, so she
    could be a pure vessel, does this mean that she was without sin
    and, therefore, the perfect (meaning sinless) female human being?
    is this why she is held so highly in the catholic church despite
    it's basically patriarchical structure?
 
 she was immaculately conceived, and so never subject to original sin,
 but also never committed a personal sin in her whole life.  this was
 possible because of the special degree of grace granted to her by god.
 
 she is regarded so highly because of her special relationship to god,
 and everything that flows from that relationship.
 
 the catholic church sees her as the new eve.  (the fathers in the
 early church use this particular figure a lot.)
 
 eve is the mother of all the living in a genetic sense.  mary is the
 mother of all the living in the order of grace.  as sin came through
 eve, so grace -- jesus christ -- came through mary.
