   this neatly eliminates the need for a savior and "proves" that we can be
 saved by works alone!  if we have no original sin, then it is possible for
 us to save ourselves by not sinning.  i understand the reasoning behind your
 argument, but it leads to sheer folly.  original sin is the reason we need
 faith to be saved.
