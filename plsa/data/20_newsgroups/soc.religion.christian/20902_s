 i am asking you to believe in things not visible. i don't know if this is
 believeing blindly or not. i'm not sure how blindness comes into it. i do
 not deny reason, indeed i insist upon it, but reason only draws conclusions
 from evidence. if you decide in advance that your reason will act only on
 the evidence of the five physical senses, then you cut reason off from any
 possibility of reaching a conclusion outside the physical sphere (beyond the
 rather provocative, if inconclusive, conclusion that the physical sphere
 is not self explanatory). 
 
 christians claim that they have received a different kind of evidence, 
 which they call faith, and which is a gift of god. that is, this evidence
 is the evidence of a thing which chooses to reveal or hide itself. the 
 evidence of the senses cannot tell you is such a ting exists. reasoning
 on the evidence of the senses won't help either. but christians do reason
 of the evidence of faith, and do claim that this evidence is wholly
 consistent with the evidence of the other senses, and indeed, that the
 evidence of these other senses is part of god's revelation of himself
 to us.
 
 it is not necessarilly the case however that knowledge of a god must come
 through this route. there may be other senses than the physical ones
 providing evidence of non-physical realities. (there may, of course, be
 physical realities of a type for which we have no corresponding senses, for
 all we know.) these senses, if they exist, may provide valid evidence for
 reason to work on. and, as with all senses, these senses may be impaired
 in some people, that is, they may be spiritually blind. in this sense,
 belief in god becomes an act of sight, and it is disbelief which is blind.

 faith, as i have said, is not opposed to reason, it is simply a new source 
 of evidence on which reason may operate. it is clear that human beings
 have many systems for explaining the evidence of the physical senses, and
 similarly there are many systems for explaining the evidence provided by
 faith. religious believers in general, and christians in particular, use
 reason to help sift through the evidence to come to a clearer understanding
 of the evidence provided by faith. science claims, with good reason, to be
 the most valid system for explaining the physical universe, and christianity
 claims, also with good reason, to be the most valid system, possessed of the
 best evidence, for explaining gods revelations of himself to man.
 
 if you doubt that christians use reason, read this newsgroup for a while
 and you will see rational debate aplenty.
