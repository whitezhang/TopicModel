 i read somewhere, i think in morton smith's _jesus the magician_, that
 old lazarus wasn't dead, but going in the tomb was part of an initiation
 rite for a magi-cult, of which jesus was also a part.   it appears that
 a 3-day stay was normal.   i wonder .... ?
 
 [i haven't read that book, but another one by smith in which similar
 claims were made about jesus.  while i'm sure smith knows more about
 early chrisitanity than i do, i found his arguments similar to those
 of books like "holy blood, holy grail" -- building conjectures on top
 of other conjectures.  there was no direct evidence.  if you'd like
 to summarize the argument for us, i'd be happy to see it.  but in
 doing so, i'd like you to pay careful attention to the nature of
 the evidence.  --clh]
