 the moderator of the general assembly, the rev. john fife, visited our
 church about a week ago (just 4 days after rev. spahr--it's been a busy
 week for our small church!!).  he was asked specifically about the issue
 of homosexuality and what he thinks will happen at the ga meeting next
 month.  evidently, there are 15-20 known resolutions pending that range
 the gamut from "outlawing" homosexuality altogether to "legalizing" it
 completely.  he will readily admit that this is probabaly the most difficult
 issue that the church has had to deal with since the presbyterian church
 split in two over the issue of slavery more than 100 years ago.  without
 question, the issue may split the church again after we've been reunited
 for all of a dozen years or so.  he is hopeful that it will not and is
 pushing the same attitude that helped the church deal with the abortion
 issue last year as a solution.
 
 he is hoping to pass a resolution that more or less states that we, the
 members of the church "agree to disagree" on the issue, admitting that
 both sides have honestly studied the scriptures and had the spirit lead
 them to different conclusions.  it worked last year when the abortion
 issue threatened to do more or less the same thing, and he is hopeful that
 the ga can foster a loving and caring attitude about people who disagree
 with their own view.

 [it's going to be hard to agree to disagree.  if we allow
 disagreement, then some presbyteries and churches are going to ordain
 people that others will not recognize.  that's a difficult situation
 in a connectional church.  i could live with it, but i think a lot of
 people would not be willing to.  note that the church was not willing
 to live with this kind of compromise with ordination of women.  the
 one thing that will definitely prevent a person from becoming a
 presbyterian minister is if they indicate that they don't accept
 ordination of women.  the argument is that we can't have half the
 church not accepting the leaders of the other half.  maybe people will
 decide to live with it in this case when they didn't in the other, but
 i wonder.  i admit that my own presbytery submitted an overture to the
 ga that would have exactly this effect, and we considered the
 ambiguity better than the current situation.  --clh]
