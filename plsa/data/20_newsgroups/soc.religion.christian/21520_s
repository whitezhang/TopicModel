 	my feeling on baptism is this:  parents baptize their baby so that the
 	baby has the sanctifying grace of baptism (and thus removal of original
 	sin) on its soul in the event of an unexpected death.
 	
 	that is, the parents speak on behalf of the child which is too young
 	to speak on its own.  this should not surprise anyone:  don't parents
 	*always* do what they believe is the best for their baby?  why would
 	that apply to the baby's physical needs only but not his/her spiritual
 	needs to have god's grace?
 	
 	the purpose of confirmation is for the baby (now young adult) to 
 	decide to re-affirm for himself/herself the promises that his/her
 	parents made at baptism.  that is where accepting jesus into your
 	heart comes in.  in baptism, the parents ask jesus to come into their
 	baby's heart; at confirmation the child repeats that request 
 	independently.
 	
 	(by the way, these are my personal feelings, though i believe they are
 	pretty close to what the doctrinal position of the catholic church on
 	this issue.  can anyone out there back me up or correct me?
