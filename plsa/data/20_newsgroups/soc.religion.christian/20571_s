 no one was ever flogged, beaten, burned, fed to the lions, or killed in any
 other way because of a belief in the resurrection - sorry to disappoint you.
 the idea of resurrection is one which can be found in a host of different
 forms in the religions of antiquity.  the problem was not the resurrection
 which was a mediorce issue for a tiny fragment of the jewish population 
 (the saducees) but was a non issues for everyone else.  the real problem was
 that christians were pacifist and preached there was only one god.  when the
 state operates by a system of divinitation of the emperor -  monotheism 
 becomes a capital offense.  the jews were able to get exemption from this,
 and were also not evangelistic.  christians were far more vocal, and gentile,
 and hence dangerous and were therefore targets of persecution.  also since
 christians were a relatively powerless group, they made good scapegoats as is
 seen by nero's blaming them for the burning of rome.  let's not cloud the
 issues with the resurrection.

 [i agree with you that christians were not persecuted specifically
 because they believed in resurrection.  however the beliefs that did
 cause trouble were dependent on belief in the resurrection of jesus.
 of course the problem with it is that there are alternatives other
 than a great conspiracy.  the most common theory among non-christians
 scholars seems to be that the resurrection was a subjective event --
 in effect, a delusion.  --clh]
