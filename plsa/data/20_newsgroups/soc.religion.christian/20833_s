 i won't even recommend books from my congregation.  what you ask sounds
 attractive but it is dangerous.  as a new christian you don't want to be
 contaminated with other people's interpretation.  steep your self in
 scripture, and discuss with other christians.  read if your must but
 remember that what other people write is their interpretation.  god has
 promised to give you light, so ask for it.

 don't wait too long before attaching yourself to church.  just remember to
 always compare what they teach you with scripture like the bereans did.
