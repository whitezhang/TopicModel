 i remember a couple of times when my ex-girlfriend said that she thought she
 was blessed because of her son (whom she loved dearly). in fact, i've heard
 people refer to someone as being blessed quite a few times. it's a common
 figure of speech. considering that elizabeth was just another human, i think
 this passage offers nothing towards justifying the "blessedness" of mary.
