 i don't know why it is so obvious.  we are not speaking of acts of the 
 flesh.  we are just speaking of emotions.  emotions are not of themselves
 moral or immoral, good or bad.  emotions just are.  the first step is
 not to label his emotion as good or bad or to numb ourselves so that
 we hide our true feelings, it is to accept ourselves as we are, as god
 accepts us.  it seems that paul's anger he has accepted and channeled
 it to a plea to all of us to refrain from passing judgement on those
 afflicted with a disease and to reach out to others.  give in?  calling
 his arguments foolish, belittling them to only quarrels, avoiding action
 because of fear to give others a bad feeling, he's not forgiving?
 
 re-think it, aaron.  don't be quick to judge.  he has forgiven those with
 aids, he has dealt with and taken responsibility for his feelings and made
 appropriate choices for action on such feelings.  he has not given in to
 his anger.
