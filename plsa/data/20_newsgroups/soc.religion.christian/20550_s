 adam, i just finished a study on this, not only looking at the
 prophecies themselves, but where they were fulfilled.  while going only
 through the ot, i found 508 references.  after starting to show their
 fulfillment, i found out that i had missed some, so needless to say i
 cannot post them here.  however, the study i did i intend to publish (i
 am in the process of organizing and showing the fulfillments, then i
 will be ready to write and send it to a publisher).  with any luck
 (and/or free time) i should have it finally done sometime around
 september (i hope).
