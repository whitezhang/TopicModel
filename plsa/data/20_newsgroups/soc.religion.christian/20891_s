 let me carry that a step further.  most doctors would not claim to be 
 infallible.  indeed, they would generally admit that they could conceivably
 be wrong, e.g. that in this case, a blood tranfusion might not turn out to 
 be necessary after all.  however, the doctors would have enough confidence
 and conviction to claim, out of genuine concern, that is is necessary.  as
 fallible human beings, they must acknowledge the possibility that they are
 wrong.  however, they would also say that such doubts are not reasonable,
 and stand by their convictions.
