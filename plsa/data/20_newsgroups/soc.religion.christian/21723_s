    yes, mary is fully human.  however, that does not imply that she was
 just as subject to sin as we are.  catholic doctrine says that man's
 nature is good (gen 1:31), but is damaged by original sin (rom 5:12-16).
 in that case, being undamaged by original sin, mary is more fully human
 than any of the rest of us.
 
    you ask why god cannot "repeat the miracle" of mary's preservation
 from original sin.  a better way to phrase it would be "why _did_ he
 not" do it that way, but you misunderstand how mary's salvation was
 obtained.  like ours, the blessed virgin mary's salvation was obtained
 through the merits of the sacrifice of christ on the cross.  however, as
 god is not bound by time, which is his creation, god is free to apply
 his sacrifice to anyone at any time, even if that person lived before
 christ came to earth, from our time-bound perspective.  therefore,
 christ's death and resurrection still served a necessary purpose, and
 were necessary even for mary's salvation.
