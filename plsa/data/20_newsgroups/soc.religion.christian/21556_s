 hello, brycen ?!
 i'm a norwegian journalist student - and also a christian. thanks for your 
 testimony! but i want to ask you one question: what do you think of heavy 
 metal music after you became a christian? you know there are christian bands 
 like barren cross, whitecross, bloodgood and stryper, that play that kind of 
 music. i like some of it, i feel like it sometimes. of course i listen to 
 the lyrics too. i don't listen to any christian band, but it's better than 
 listening to secular music anyway. 
 hope you're still going strong - with christ!!
