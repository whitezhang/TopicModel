 i can't speak for mr. cavano, but i understood his comment to refer to 
 the idea that unrecognized pantheism is dangerous to christians.  if we 
 unthinkingly adopt pantheistic ideas that are opposed to christianity, 
 we can pervert our faith.  when we clearly recognize pantheism when we 
 encounter it we have the opportunity to embrace what is consistent with 
 christianity and reject what isn't.    
 
 we need to be alert, always thinking and questioning.  we must examine 
 the underlying assumptions of every book we read, tv program we watch 
 and socio-political movement we participate in.  ideas are important.  
 philosophies and doctrines are what give form to the events of our 
 lives.  they are the basis from which we live our lives of love and 
 service.  the command to love god with all one's mind means no fuzzy-
 headed drifting from idea to idea.

 one christian who acknowledges this is the pope.  it is a frequent theme 
 in his writings.  indeed, thoughtful christians from most traditions 
 recognize that consumerism has no place in the lives of christians.  it 
 too is a perversion and dangerous to our faith.  thank you, jack, for 
 pointing out the parallel.
