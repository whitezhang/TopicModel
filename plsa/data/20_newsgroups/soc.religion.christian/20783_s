 hey...
 
 i may be wrong, but wasn't jeff fenholt part of black sabbath?  he's a
 major brother in christ now.  he totally changed his life around, and
 he and his wife go on tours singing, witnessing, and spreading the
 gospel for christ.  i may be wrong about black sabbath, but i know he
 was in a similar band if it wasn't that particular group...
 
 how great is th love the father has lavished on us, that we should be
 called children of god!  and that is what we are!  (1 john 3:1)
 
 grace and peace to all, (i'll see you all someday!)
