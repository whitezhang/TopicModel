 well, since my wife is (in your gentle term) a "bastard", i can
 probably speak with a bit of authority on this. any "stigma"
 associated with children conceived and/or born out of wedlock rests
 solely upon the parents--they've committed a sexual transgression for
 which they should repent. the child itself has no a priori limitations
 on him or her; indeed, the concept of blaming the child for the
 parents' sins is one most mormons would find appalling; note that lds
 theology rejects original sin, as the term is usually defined, and the
 subsequent need for infant baptism (cf. moroni 8 in the book of
 mormon).  indeed, lds doctrine goes one step further and in some cases
 holds parents responsible for their children's sins if they have
 failed to bring them up properly (cf. d&c 68:25-28; note that this
 passage applies it only to members of the lds church).
 
 also note that there is no "big genealogical book in salt lake city".
 the lds church has a massive storage facility in the nearby mountains
 containing (on microfilm) vital statistic records (birth, christening,
 baptism, marriage, death) gathered from all over the entire world. i
 may be misremembering, but i believe they have records for some 2
 billion people in that vault. at the same time, the lds church is
 building up an on-line genealogical database. in neither case is there
 some kind of "worthiness screening" as to whether someone can be
 entered in. the only potential issue is that of establishing who the
 parents were, and that would apply only in the case of the database.

 [the following arrived as a separate posting --clh]
 
 a follow-up to my own follow-up--lest anyone misunderstand, the term
 "bastard" is one which i have never in 25 years of lds church
 membership heard applied, formally or informally, to a child born out
 of wedlock, and indeed would (rightly) be considered a vulgar,
 offensive term. i would not have echoed the expression in my reply,
 except in hopes that the poster would recognize the offensive nature
 of the word in the given context. unfortunately, after posting my
 reply, i remembered that subtle points are often lost on the 'net, and
 figured i'd better spell it out.  ..bruce..
