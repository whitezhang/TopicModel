 there has been some talk recently of latin rites from the early church used to
 bless same-sex unions.if anyone has any idea where copies of these rites
 exist (in whole or in part), please notify me by e-mail.  (i understand that
 similar ceremonies written in slavonic exist as well.  let me know where i can
 find these.)  it doesn't matter whether the latin rite is in the original or a
 translation.  however, i would prefer to have an english version of the slavon-
 ic rite, if it exists.  thanks in advance.

 [we've had questions about this in the past.  the only source i know
 of is claims by john boswell in some talks.  he is said to be working
 on publication, but as far as i know, nothing is published yet.  i
 haven't heard of any other source.  if anyone knows of another source,
 please tell us.  but i think we're going to have to wait for boswell's
 publication to appear in order to see what he's really talking about.
