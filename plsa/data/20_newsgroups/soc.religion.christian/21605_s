 so do other parts of the bible when taken literally - i.e. the psalms
 saying the earth does not move, or the implication the earth is flat
 with four corners, etc.  the bible was written to teach salvation, not
 history or science.

 what ones?  paryers for the dead or the intercession of saints? (which
 are taught in 2 maccabees, sirach, and tobit)

 by your own subjective judgement.  this falling short is your judgement,
 and you are not infallible - rather the church of jesus christ is (see 1
 timothy 3.15).

 more subjective feelings.   this is not a proof of anything more than
 one persons feelings.

 as i have written time and again, the hebrew canon was fixed in jamnia,
 palestine, in 90 ad.  60 years after the foundation of the one, holy,
 catholic, and apostolic church.  furthermore, the opinons of jerome do
 not count.  he was neither the church, or the pope, or an ecumenical
 council, or a council in general, or an insturment of the magisterium of
 the church.  he was a private individual, learned admittedly, but
 subject to erro of opinion.  and in exlcuding the deuterocanon, he
 erred, as pope damsus, and the council of carthage, and the tradition of
 the fathers, clearly shows, as i pointed out in my previous post.

 i suggest you take heed of the last part of the statement, if you want
 to take it in the sense you are taking it, that taking away from the
 book will cause you to lose heaven.

 the order of the canon is unimportant, it is the content that matters. 
 none of jesus' statments exlcude the deuterocanon, which were
 interspersed throughout the canon.  and remeber, there are some
 completely undisputed books, ezra, nehemiah, esther, ecclesiatses, song
 of songs, job, etc. that are not quoted in the new testament, which is
 not taken as prejudicial to their being inspired.
