 in response to alleged circular reasoning concerning the morality of      
 homosexuality, clh poses the following challenge:
 
 >in order to break the circle there's got to be some other
 >reason to think homosexuality is wrong.
 
 i answer,
 
 the circle is simple to break.   the church teaches that homosexual
 behavior is immoral.  this teaching is raw, impassionate, unassailable
 dogma.  that closes the argument for me.

 [right.  i understand that people have other reasons for not
 accepting homosexuality.  the point i was making was that the
 specific argument given wouldn't stand on its own.  --clh]
