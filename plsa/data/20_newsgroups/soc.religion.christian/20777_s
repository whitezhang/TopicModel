 actually, there was very little to the book.  first of all looking at
 the titles of her other books, i would personally consider her 
 to be engaged in a bizarre form of christian-like mysticism
 heavily influenced by eastern philosphies (great titles like 
 _the_astrology_of_the_4_horsemen_).
 
 however, other than the chapter one into, there's nothing original,
 biased, or even new this book.  it is basically a collection of previously
 published works by those who claim that there exist buddhist and hindu
 stories that christ visited india and china (he was known as issa) 
 during the period from late teens to age 30.
 
 conclusion:  the book actually lets you come to your own view by presenting
 a summary of various published works and letters, all of which you
 could verify independently.  it includes refutations to such works as
 well.  therefore, even if you think she is theologically warped, this 
 book is a nice reference summary for the interested.
