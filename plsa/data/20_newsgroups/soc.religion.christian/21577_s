 i'm a little confused about the difference between this "weak atheism",
 as you put it, and agnosticism.  is agnosticism not believing or
 necessarily disbelieving in anything, or what is it?  i used to be
 agnostic (by this definition) -- but if weak atheism includes not
 necessarily believing in god, then i guess i was one of those.  ???
 
 actually what i have a hard time understanding is people who do not
 ever decide what they believe.  i am constantly in a state of
 self-examination, as it would appear many others are as well (including the
 atheists, of course -- i'd assume that's why they're here!).  i guess
 some people don't really consider it important to think about the
 answers to "life, the universe and everything" -- any comment?  just
 wondering....

 tough call, as these things seem to be based on faith -- wish i could
 help you, but i already tried once with someone who was a
 self-professed agnostic-thinking-of-becoming-a -christian, and it
 didn't work too well!  especially tough as i'm still mulling over
 whether or not i believe in miracles (looks like another email to my
 chaplain is coming up....).  all i can do is wish you the best of
 luck, and please do post what you find.
 
 >and i told you that i find faith to be intellectually dishonest. note that

 hmm, how so?  i guess i really don't understand.  there are times, of
 course, when i say to myself "of course i have absolutely no way of
 knowing that what i believe in is true except the satisfaction and
 sense of peace i get from it -- which of course could just be
 psychological".  somehow i live with this anyway -- is this what you
 mean?
 
 the only "proof" i have is that i believe god spoke to me once --
 which could of course be my own imagination.  the odd thing is,
 though, that if you don't at some point start believing in something,
 after a while it all gets sort of ridiculous.  maybe it's just a
 question of where you draw the line.

 i'll only add one question -- have you read pascal?  what did you
 think of him if you did?
 
 also you may (or may not) be interested by cslewis/ _surprised by
 joy_.  i'd be interested in knowing what you think of him, no sarcasm
 at all intended.  (i just say this because one can never know how
 one's written words will be interpreted.  i am not interested in
 converting you, since i don't seem to have whatever it would take --
 proof -- to do so.  i'm just interested in learning.)
