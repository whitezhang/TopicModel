 you should remember that in adam's transgression, all men and women
 sinned, as paul wrote.  all of humanity cooperativley reblled against
 god in adma's sin, thus, all are subject to it, and the sin is
 transmitted from generation to generation.

 the rest of humanity, but i did not cooperatively rebell against anything.
