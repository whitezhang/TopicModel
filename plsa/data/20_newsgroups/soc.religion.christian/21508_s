 thanks for the responses so far. i hope that i have 
 sparked some thought (which is more my intent than 
 to restart one of the reformations).
 
 i'm just going to tug on two threads:

 i was simply observing that as a non-jew, i am not in that community
 which might be bound by such a decision (i don't know much about
 the council of jamnia, but i have heard that it is not well-attested
 historically). 'faithless' has nothing to do with it, and i prefer
 not to speculate about motives.

 i wish the dialogue_with_trypho were a real transcript of a real
 dialogue,, but i think it a fictional effect on justin's part.
 putting that to one side, justin's point may be evidential; one
 would want to know- 'which books?'
 
 >protestants apparently prefer to think that god's revelation was limited 
 >by a decree of the jews [...]
 
 perhaps the reformers were traveling in all the light (ms evidence)
 they had. let's stick to the issues. again, i prefer not to speculate
 about motives. one would need quotes from luther, calvin, etc. to
 evidence this 'preference'.

 is this the principle: 'any (bc) text not quoted by christ cannot
 be counted as scripture' ? think well about this- job, ruth...?

 meaning what? do you affirm the principle (that the d.c's can be
 excluded since they contain 'false doctrine') or do you deny it? 
 if affirmed (as is implied in your statement) how does one determine 
 that doctrine x is false? do you affirm every teaching in _ecclesiastes_?

 if so, it may be a test that cannot be applied. the orthodox
 faithfully believe that psalm 151 is canonical. how can my
 faith say 'not!' ? all i hear here is the *a priori* i mentioned
 before.

 this is contrary to fact.

 can this be elevated to a principle? how is 'spiritual quality'
 measured? i'll take the 'spiritual quality' of most of sirach over 
 joshua or chronicles, any day.
 
 >i do not believe the church that added these
 >books was guided by the spirit in so doing.  
 
 what can i say? you believe what you believe- i'm asking for
 a consistency check. i don't see that the books were added- in any
 construction this formulation begs the question. no one can validly
 ask me to 'have faith' that these books are noncanonical.

 qotd:
 
 "christianity is not a doctrine, not, i mean, a theory about what has
  happened and will happen to the human soul, but a description of something
  that actually takes place in a human life.  for `consciousness of sin' is a
  real event, and so are despair and salvation through faith.  those who speak
  of such things (bunyan, for instance) are simply describing what has happened
  to them, whatever anyone may want to say about it." -- ludwig wittgenstein
