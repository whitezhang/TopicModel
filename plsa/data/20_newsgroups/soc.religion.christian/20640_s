 that is not necessarily unorthodox.  when christians call god 'father', 
 we are using a metaphor.  the bible in one place refers to god as being
 like a mother.  god is neither a father nor a mother in the literal
 sense; god has some of the attributes of both; the father metaphor is
 usually used because (for most people at most times) it is the less
 misleading of the two possibilities.
