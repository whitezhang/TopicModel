 
      i used to be a marriage commissioner for the alaska court
 system (sort of a justice of the peace).  i had great difficulty
 with that duty.  i used to pray earnestly in the courthouse
 bathroom before the ceremonies, mostly asking that the couples
 would come to appreciate and fulfill the true holiness and
 divine purpose in marriage--couples who obviously didn't realize
 that marriage is god's institution, not the state's.  gradually,
 however, i came to conclude that because i was acting in a
 strictly secular, public capacity, established as such by both
 the state and the expectations of the couples involved, i was
 really conducting a purely secular, legal civil event, with no
 greater moral or religious implications than if i had been
 conducting a civil trial (the couple who told me, mid-ceremony,
 to "please hurry it up" may have helped me to this conclusion). 
 
      i thought i had neatly rationalized a clear and sharp
 distinction between marriage before god, and "marriage" before
 the state, until i had to deal with my own divorce.  keeping
 matthew 19:6 in mind, i felt that the state had no business
 dissolving my marriage established before god, but of course it
 assumed jurisdiction nonetheless.  
 
       i would ask those of you proposing answers to this
 question to consider this issue's logical extension: if
 intercourse, or the mental intent of the parties, or the
 ceremony of the church, or any combination thereof, establishes
 marriage, then at what moment is it dissolved?
