 i appreciated the follow-ups and replies to my earlier query.  one reply, which
 i have lost, suggested several parishes in new york that have good masses, one 
 of which was corpus christi in downtown manhattan.  by coincidence, last week's
 _america_, the national jesuit magazine, carried an interview with fr. myles 
 bourke, corpus christi's pastor emeritus.  fr. bourke also directed the nt 
 translation in the new american bible.  he noted "...certain practices have 
 been introduced into the mass in such a manner that an atmosphere of banality, 
 and sometimes of hilarity, has trivialized the liturgy."  i note that at my 
 parents' parish on easter, helium filled balloons were distributed at the 
 offertory, apparently to aid in understanding the word "risen".  this was not a 
 kiddie mass, either, but the well-attended 11:00 mass.
 
 i wanted to note the generous spirit behind the replies.  this newsgroup as a
 whole offers generally moderate (perhaps because it's moderated) conversation
 on topics that often lead people to extreme behavior (including myself).
 sometimes people do go over the top, but the remarkable thing is how that is
 the exception, i think.  benefits of the doubt are generally granted.  it seems
 so...christian?
