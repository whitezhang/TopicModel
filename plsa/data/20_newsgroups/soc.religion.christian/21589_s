 does anyone know of an english language edition that does not show the
 verse (or even chapter) numbers.  i have always thought that such an
 edition would be very useful - although hard to navigate around.
 
 i have a scots nt that doesn't show verse numbers, and it is great to
 read, particularly longer narrative passages, but my scots isn't quite
 up to doing proper study from this edition - i tend to use it to get a
 "feel" for a story, particularly in the gospels, and then use an
 english edition to look for details.

 [the original neb put verse numbers only in the margin.  the
 jerusalem bible does the same, though they put a dot to mark the
 boundaries between verses.   --clh]
