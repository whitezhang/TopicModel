 if i don't think my belief is right and everyone else's belief is wrong,
 then i don't have a belief. this is simply what belief means. where does
 the authority for a belief come from? nowhere, for a belief is itself
 authoratative. if i produce authority for a belief, where will i find
 authority for my belief in the legitimacy of the authority. in short, 
 the mind has to start somewhere. (by the way, the majority of christians,
 i.e. catholics, believe in the authority of the church, and derive the
 authority of the bible from its acceptance by the church.)
