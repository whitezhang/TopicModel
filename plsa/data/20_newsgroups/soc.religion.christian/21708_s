 q. should teenagers have the freedom to choose what church they go to?
 
 my friends teenage kids do not like to go to church.
 if left up to them they would sleep, but that's not an option.
 they complain that they have no friends that go there, yet don't
 attempt to make friends. they mention not respecting their sunday
 school teacher, and usually find a way to miss sunday school but
 do make it to the church service, (after their parents are thoroughly
 disgusted) i might add. a never ending battle? it can just ruin your
 whole day if you let it.
 
 has anyone had this problem and how did it get resolved?
