 what you call "the trinity and the catholic church's definition
 of it" is precisely the result of the first christians getting
 together and trying to find an acceptable answer to your
 question "what is a christian?". i can't see what you are
 objecting to: someone is saying what historians of all beliefs
 would agree on, and you are calling him a closed-minded bigot?
 
 you really ought to say what you mean by "belief in jesus
 christ". it is not a wording that is sufficient to describe a
 christian. muslims believe in jesus christ although they
 believe he was a prophet and not the incarnated son of god. but
 followers of eastern religions might be quite happy to say that
 jesus was the incarnation of god - along with large numbers of
 other historical and mythical figures.
 
 so perhaps you ought to rephrase your question and say
 precisely what it is in the traditional definitions of what it
 is to be a christian, as handed down by the universal church,
 you object to but regard as unnecessary for being a christian.
