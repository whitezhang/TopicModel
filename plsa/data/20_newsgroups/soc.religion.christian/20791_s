 i see some irony here. jesus was willing to go through torture to free
 you from the definite promise of hell (based on adam/eve's fall from grace)
 but rather than allow him to stand in your place, you would give up
 your redemption to stand with those who do not accept his grace.
 god would rather have none in hell, which seems to put the burden of 
 choice on us. of course, this is all fictional anyway since you reject him
 also.
 
 my former sociology professor once told us at the beginning
 of our term, "you all start out with an a...what you do with that during
 the course of this term is up to you". in the beginning...adam and eve
 were given an a.
