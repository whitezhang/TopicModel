 yes, those who apply it hatefully would be better served if they if
 they could alter the bible to reflect their views:
 
 scene 1:  a well in samaria:
 
 woman:  but i have no husband.
 jesus:  yo!  everybody!  listen up!  get your rocks ready!  we'll have
         some good biblical fun.  here she is whispering to me that
         she doesn't have a husband, yet i know by my secret powers that
         she has had five of them!  (you know how these samaritans are!
         and worse, she's living with a guy now that she's not even married
         to.  now i believe in loving her, and if you'll just raise up
         those rocks like the bible allows and threaten her with a good
         stoning, she'll understand how much we hate the sin but love
         the sinner.   we must keep our priorities strait, lest folks
         2,000 years from now misunderstand me and believe i canceled
         all sin!
 
 scene 2:  golgatha
 
 2nd thief:  you got a raw deal, man.  they didn't catch you doing anything
             wrong like they caught me.
 
 bleeding jesus:  now, son.  let me be real clear.  you say you did something
             wrong, but are you repenting?  i need to be absolutely certain
             cause if you repent, i have a nice room for you in heaven,
             but if you think you might go thieving again, i have to
             cancel your reservation.  it is nice of you to have pity on
             me while i'm hanging here, but you must understand, this is
             all an act; i'm not really hurting.  i'm god, you see.  and
             the point of all this is to teach you to be perfect like me.
             if you think a simple kind remark to me in suffering is going
             to get you any favors, you'd better think twice!  but if you
             will just repent, you will become a fundelical in good 
             standing.
 
 from all such bad news, you have delivered us, good god!  thank you!
 thank you!  thank you!
