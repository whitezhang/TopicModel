 : you might want to re-think your attitude about the holocaust after
 : reading deuteronomy chapter 28.
 
 on the contrary, after the holocaust, i would be _very_ cautious about my
 interpretatoin of deuteronomy 28.  not everything that happens is in
 accordance with god's will.  (you might guess which side of the
 predestination issue i am on.)  i will never _assume_ that evil is 
 punishment by god, especially when i am speaking of the evil that falls on
 _someone else_.  for my own life, i will work to discern the hand of god
 in the evil that befalls _me_.
 
 see the discussion earlier on luke 13.
