 [4) "nothing unclean shall enter [heaven]" (rev. 21.27). therefore,
 babies are born in such a state that should they die, they are cuf off
 from god and put in hell, which is exactly the doctrine of st. augustine
 and st. thomas.  of coures, having only original sins on thier souls,
 they suffer the lightest punishment, the loss of the vision oand
 presence of god, but that does not change the undeniable fact that they
 cannot possibly come to a forgivenss of original sin, nor can they
 inherit eternal life.  "that," as st. augustine said, "is what the
 pelagian heretics taught."  which is why he said later, "if you want to
 be a christian, do not teach that unbaptized infants can come to a
 forgivenss of original sin."]
 
 doesn't the bible say that god is a fair god?  if this is true, how can this
 possibly be fair to the infants?
