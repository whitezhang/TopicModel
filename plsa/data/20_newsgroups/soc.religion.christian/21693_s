 this has troubled me for a long time and needs to be dealt with.
 
 from a long article available through an individual on this newsgroup.
 
 about scripture being against homosexuality:
 ------------------------------------------
 when we  are
 less homophobic we will see that what we know as gay and lesbian  people,
 engaging in loving, voluntary erotic relations with each other, aren't  even
 mentioned. [in the bible, tk]
 ------------------------------------------
 
 this frightens me (not in the homophobic sense, but intellectually),
 especially because it was written by someone from a homosexual church.
 
 so, if my interpretation is different than theirs, i am homophobic!  this
 can't be right. disagreement in interpretation of the bible and/or rejection
 of homosexual acts is not tantamount of homophobia.
