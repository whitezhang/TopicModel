 protestants love to play up jerome for all he is worth. they should
 remeber that after the decree of pope st. damsus i, jerome did not
 hesitate in accpeting the deuteroncanon, and quoted them as scripture in
 his later writings.  and as i have already pointed out, in a previous
 letter on this subject, the catholic church has accepted the
 deuterocanon from the beginning.  and the protestants in the 1500's all
 of a sudden revived the old theory of some, condemned by pope, council,
 and church, that the deuterocanon were not inspired.
 
 again, why must the church of jesus christ adopt the canon of the
 unbelieving jews, drawn up in jamnia in 90 ad, in countering the
 christian use of the septuagint.                 ^^^^^
