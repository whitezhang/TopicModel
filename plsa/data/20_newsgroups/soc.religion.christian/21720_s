 i have noticed that newspapers don't even know what a fundamentalist is;
 at the least, they confuse new evangelicals and fundamentalists.  in this
 news group, the liberals don't even know what a fundamentalist is (crying
 out "legalist" at anyone who believes and obeys god's word). a fundamentalist
 would train their children in the way god proscribes, not in the way that
 man proscribes.  this would not include life threatening beatings but would
 include corporal punishment. 
 
 to the liberals, i cry out infidel at anyone who does not believe god's word.

 [as most people here know, i believe fundamentalist is sufficiently
 ill-defined that i advise using some more specific term.  i think many
 people use it to cover people who believe in inerrancy and a number of
 related concepts (e.g. denial of evolution).  while the original
 fundamentals movement was somewhat more specific, i would think most
 people who accept inerrancy would actually support the whole original
 agenda.  (it included a list of key traditional doctrines, e.g.  the
 virgin birth.)  the term is now being used by the press to describe
 aggressive conservative religions in general, most typically those who
 are attempting to legislate religion.
 
 legalism is yet another ill-defined term.  however there is some
 reason for its use in this context.  in fact the common theological
 definition is the believe that salvation is through the law.  i hope
 no one here believes that our conservative contributors hold this
 view.  however there is a basic difference in approach over what we
 expect to get out of the bible.  the conservative approach expects to
 find specific behavioral rules.  generally the posters advocating this
 approach talk about the relevant passages from paul's letter as god's
 law.  the liberal approach expects to find general principles, but it
 regards specific behavioral rules subject to change depending upon the
 culture and other things.  it's easy to see why a liberal would regard
 the conservative approach as legalism.  it's hard to know quite what
 other term to use.  the issue in this case is not inerrancy, because
 no one is saying that paul made a factual error.  rather, the question
 is whether his statements are to be taken as law.  calling the
 positive answer legalism seems obvious enough terminology.  i haven't
 seen any good alternative.
