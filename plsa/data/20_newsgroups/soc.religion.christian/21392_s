 homosexual christians have indeed "checked out" these verses.  some of
 them are used against us only through incredibly perverse interpretations.
 others simply do not address the issues.
 
 you would seem to be more in need of a careful and spirit-led course
 in exegesis than most of the gay christians i know.  i suggest that
 you stop "proof-texting" about things you know nothing about.
