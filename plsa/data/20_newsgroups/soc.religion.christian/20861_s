 i disagree.  people marry each other.  when they commit fully to each
 other as life partners, they are married.  the ceremony may assist in
 emphasizing the depth of such a commitment, but is of itself nothing.
 god knows our hearts.  he knows when two have committed themselves to
 be one, he knows the fears and delusions we have that keep us from fully
 giving ourselves to another.  the way i see it, you'd have to be living
 together in a marriage for somewhere between 10 and 100 years before anyone
 knew if a marriage really existed, but god knows.  i don't think god keeps
 a scorebook.
