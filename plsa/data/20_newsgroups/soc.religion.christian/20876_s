 there is some controversy in my denomination as to what authority is vested 
 in the pastor.  i am still forming my opinion.  i am solicing opinions, and 
 references for what that is, how much, and how it should be used.
 
    as a general reference, i would not exclude responses from different 
 denominations based on biblical teachings, but you have to understand our 
 church is independent, protestant and likely to be much different from those 
 that follow ecclesiastical authority in the church.  we may need to discuss 
 the roles of deacons and elders.
 
 thanks for your replies.
