 it is interesting that you posted those lyrics, because just the
 other day i was thinking of doing the same.  i like those lyrics,
 since whenever i am approached by judgemental, pharisitical,
 evangelical fundamentalists who throw the bible at me because
 i have long hair, wear a black leather jacket, and listen to black
 sabbath, i have something to throw back.  usually their chins drop
 and they come up speechless over those not very satanic lyrics.
 
 it just goes to show that there are more important evils in the
 world to battle than rock lyrics...........
