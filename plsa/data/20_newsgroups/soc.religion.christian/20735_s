 i have seen jeff fenholt speak and i didn't find him judgemental.  i think
 that the wording for that add was certainly inappropriate, but i think they
 were trying to say that headbangers would like the program.  but i would
 not put headbangers in the same class as alcholics, etc.  it is
 condescending.  and i believe that jeff was wearing black when i saw him.
 
 by the way, fenholt played jesus in jesus christ superstar.
 
 personally, i'm a headbanger at times too, but i have a hard time with what
 most of the secular metal groups promote.  free sex and drugs (my opinion
 that many promote these) aren't my thing.  i have found several good
 christian metal groups that i like.

 we drew a circle and took him in.
