 sorry for taking this off of sharon's resp, but i'd also like to add
 some more verses to that and perhaps answer the second q.
 
 verses:
    1 corinthians 6:9-10
    colossians 3:5-10
 
 as for knowing when, that's a bit tricky.  people normally have
 consciences which warn them about it.  however, as in my case, a
 conscience can be hardened by sin's deceitfulness (hebrews 3:12:13) so
 that the person has no idea (or doesn't care about it) that they are
 sinning.  of course, there are those sins which we do when we don't know
 that they're sinful to begin with.  those take searching and examining
 of scripture to find out that they are sinful and then repent and
 change.  the best question to ask in every circumstance to judge sinful
 possibilities is:  "would jesus wholeheartedly do this at this point in
 time?"  i know, it sounds like a cop-out, but it truly is a stifling
 question.
