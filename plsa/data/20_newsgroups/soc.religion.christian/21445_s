 that depends on how this verse is read.  there are at least two
 meanings of the word "once".  1) only one time, and 2) at some
 other time (i.e. once upon a time).  note that in the previous
 verse, the word "once" is used with the second meaning, and also
 in the following verse, "once" is again used with the second meaning.
 the greek, i am sure, uses different words for each of the two meanings
 for the english word "once".  i am not a greek scholar, but i'm sure
 someone here can verify which greek word is used here for this meaning.
 if the second meaning is being used, that verse can be interpreted as:
 
   - for it was once given for men to die (beginning with adam), but 
     after this [gift of atonement offered by jesus christ] the judgement
     [is made available], for now there is no longer death, but life
     with christ.
