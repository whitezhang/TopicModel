 whether there is a "why" or not we have to find it. this is pascal's(?) wager.
 if there is no why and we spend our lives searching, then we have merely
 wasted our lives, which were meaningless anyway. if there is a why and we
 don't search for it, then we have wasted our potentially meaningful lives.
 suppose the universe is 5 billion years old, and suppose it lasts another
 5 billion years. suppose i live to be 100. that is nothing, that is so small
 that it is scary. so by searching for the "why" along with my friends here
 on earth if nothing else we aren't so scared.
 
 what if you woke up at a party, with no memory, and everyone was discussing
 who the host might be? there might not be a host, you say. i say let's go
 find him, the party's going to be over sometime, maybe he'll let us stay.
 
 because we recognize our own mortality we have to find the "why".

 this is a good point. but more of a good point for studying religion
 than ignoring it. some christians disagree with me, but it is worthwhile
 to study different religions and philosophies and glean the truth from
 them. to quote (of course out of context) "test everything and keep what is
 true."
