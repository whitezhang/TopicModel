 if you want to live with someone, you can.
 if you don't want to have a civil marriage, don't.
 if you don't want to have a wedding in a church, don't.
 if you want to call that a marriage, go right ahead.
 
 i hope that the young people that are around you, don't follow your example.

 [if the original message claims that marriage is not discussed in the
 bible, i have to disagree.  various aspects of marriage are discussed
 in some of paul's letters, ephesians 5 sees marriage as a symbol of
 god's relationship with the church.  if it means specifically that the
 marriage ceremony isn't described, then that seems to be true.  but i
 think what most people mean by christian marriage is not so much that
 it takes place in a church as that the parties undertake the various
 commitments to each other that are associated with marriage in the
 bible.  --clh]
