 really?  you may be right, but i'd like proof.  as far as i know (and
 i am not a div school student!) the catholic church does not seem to
 accept predestination.  my chaplain told me "beware of greeks bearing
 gifts" with reference to this doctrine: it seems to have the curious
 result that human beings are not held responsible for their own
 actions!  i'll answer how you deal with this in a minute.

 right.  that doesn't really seem like predestination to me, but i'll
 continue with what you're saying....

 this is really confusing to me, especially since i still believe that
 christ jesus died for all of us.  preknowledge of obstinacy seems
 like an awfully convoluted way to account for a couple of verses.  but
 then, i am not really biblically supported in this opinion -- or am i?
 others?

 so god uses grace like margarine: he only spreads it where it's needed
 and not where it isn't?  and so there are the saved and the not-saved,
 and nothing in between.  hmmmm.

 although i realize this doctrine was not originally intended to cause
 social problems, it ends up doing just that -- if there is supposed to
 be some sort of "sign" that someone is elect, like lots of children or
 success at work, then those who have a good life on earth will go
 around thinking that those who don't are doomed to hell.
 
 in a way, though, this sounds like the opposite idea -- those doomed
 to hell will have a great life on earth.  that's almost like the
 converse of what i believe -- responsibility for what we do now will
 be punished after we die.  you're saying what we get after we die has
 a direct bearing on how we live now?  strange....

 so sin is either punished now or later -- and not both?  what if it's
  sort of half-punished?  are there any grey areas in this doctrine?

  the idea (well, my idea) would be that you would intervene to
  establish peace and stop the atrocities.  i'm not suggesting wwiii.  i
  don't really understand what you mean by a "just war".  of course i am
  not an isolationist, although i see some merit in not jumping in at
  the first opportunity (can you say kuwait?).  we happen to be a big
  country with a lot of resources (as well as a lot of debt), and this
  gives us some responsibility in the world, whether we like it or not.
  flashbacks of wwii, as well as vietnam, should be haunting us.
 
  yet another difference of opinion.  so be it.

  thank you for answering; i hope you don't take any of my comments as
  flames, but instead as expressions of interest.
