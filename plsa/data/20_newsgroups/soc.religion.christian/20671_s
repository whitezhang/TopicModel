 christ that often causes christians to be very critical of themselves and other
 christians. we are supposed to grow, mature, endeavour to be christ-like but we
 are far far far from perfect. build up the body of christ, don't tear it down,
 and that includes yourself. jesus loves me just the way i am today, tomorrow and
 always (thank god ! :-).
