 where exactly does it say that?

 i think we do see an exception in the case of cornelius and his
 household, mentioned in acts. of course, they were baptised, but only
 after "god showed that he accepted them by giving them the holy
 spirit". this means they were already acceptable to god before their
 baptism, and had they suddenly died they would have gone to heaven.
 
 in case that seems far-fetched - an ancestor of mine was a missionary
 who worked among the hereros in namibia. some of the tribesmen were
 jealous of christianity, and they poisoned the first convert before he
 could be baptised. surely he still went to heaven? i'm inclined to
 agree with a comment recorded at the time: "it is not the neglect of
 baptism, but its contempt, that condemns."
