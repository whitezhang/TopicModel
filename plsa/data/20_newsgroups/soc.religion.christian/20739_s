 ok, god has the disclaimer, reserves the right to judge individual
 cases.  if we believe him to be loving, then we also believe him to be
 able to serve justice to all.  don't worry if a jew, or athiest is
 going to heaven or hell, for that is god to judge (although truly
 if you were concerned you could only worry abput those who refuse to
 believe/satisfy gods decrees) as much as keeping yourself straight.
 if you see something going on that is wrong, discuss it and explore it
 before making summary judgement.  people have enough free will to choose
 for themselves, so don't force choices on them, just inform them
 of what they're choices are.  god will take care of the rest in his justice.
