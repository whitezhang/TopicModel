 hello src readers,
 
 again the misconception that copts among other oriental orthodox
 churches believe in monophysitism pops up again. we had a discussion
 about it a while ago.

 with my appreciation to the moderator, i believe that further elaboration
 is needed. this is an excerpt from an article featured in the first issue
 of the copt-net newsletter :
 
 under the authority of the eastern roman empire of constantinople (as opposed
 to the western empire of rome), the patriarchs and popes of alexandria played
 leading roles in  christian theology.  they were  invited everywhere to speak
 about the christian faith. st. cyril, pope of alexandria, was the head of the
 ecumenical council which was held in ephesus in the year 430 a.d. it was said
 that the bishops of the church of alexandria did nothing but spend  all their
 time in meetings. this leading role, however, did not fare well when politics
 started to intermingle with  church affairs.  it all started when the emperor
 marcianus interfered with matters of faith in the church. the response of st.
 dioscorus, the pope of alexandria who was later  exiled, to this interference
 was clear: "you have nothing to do with the church."  these political motives
 became even more  apparent in chalcedon  in 451, when the coptic  church  was
 unfairly  accused of following  the  teachings of  eutyches, who believed  in
 monophysitism. this  doctrine maintains that the  lord jesus christ  has only
 one nature, the divine, not two natures, the human as well as the divine.
 
 the coptic  church   has never  believed  in  monophysitism  the way   it was
 portrayed in the council of chalcedon!  in  that council, monophysitism meant
 believing in one  nature.  copts   believe that the lord   is perfect in  his
 divinity,  and he   is perfect in  his humanity,  but  his  divinity  and his
 humanity were united in one nature called "the nature of the incarnate word",
 which was reiterated by st. cyril of alexandria.  copts, thus, believe in two
 natures "human" and   "divine"  that are   united in   one "without mingling,
 without confusion, and without alteration" (from the  declaration of faith at
 the end of the coptic divine liturgy).  these  two  natures "did not separate
 for a moment or the twinkling of an eye" (also from  the declaration of faith
 at the end of the coptic divine liturgy).
 
 the  coptic church was  misunderstood in the 5th century  at the  council  of
 chalcedon.  perhaps the council  understood   the church correctly, but  they
 wanted to exile the  church,   to  isolate it  and to  abolish the  egyptian,
 independent pope. despite  all of this,  the coptic church  has remained very
 strict  and steadfast in its faith.   whether it was   a  conspiracy from the
 western churches to exile the coptic church  as a  punishment for its refusal
 to be politically influenced, or whether pope dioscurus  didn't  quite go the
 extra  mile to  make the  point that  copts  are not  monophysite, the coptic
 church has always felt a mandate  to reconcile "semantic" differences between
 all  christian  churches.   this is   aptly  expressed by the  current  117th
 successor  of  st. mark, pope shenouda iii:  "to the  coptic church, faith is
 more  important  than  anything, and   others  must know that  semantics  and
 terminology are of  little importance to us."  throughout this  century,  the
 coptic church has played  an important role  in the ecumenical  movement. the
 coptic church is one of the founders of the world council of churches. it has
 remained a member of that  council  since 1948 a.d.   the coptic church is  a
 member  of the all  african council of churches  (aacc)  and the  middle east
 council of  churches (mecc).  the church    plays an  important role   in the
 christian   movement   by   conducting dialogues   aiming  at  resolving  the
 theological differences with the  catholic, greek orthodox, presbyterian, and
 evangelical churches.
 
 [...]
 
 as a final note, the oriental orthodox and eastren orthodox did sign
 a common statement of christology, in which the heresey of monophysitism
 was condemned. so the coptic orthodox church does not believe in
 monophysitism.
 
 peace,

 [as i mentioned in a brief apology, the comment quoted above from me
 is confused.  i appear to say that nestorius was monophysite.  as
 andrew byler correctly stated it, the nestorians and monophysites were
 actually opposite parties.  the point i was making, which nabil
 explains in some detail, is that some groups that have been considered
 heretical probably aren't.
 
 chalcedon was a compromise between two groups, the alexandrians and
 antiochenes.  it adopted language that was intended to be acceptable
 to moderates in both camps, while ruling out the extremes.  i agree
 that there were extremes that were heretical.  however in the course
 of the complex politics of the time, it appears that some people got
 rejected who didn't intend heresy, but simply used language that was
 not understood or even was mispresented.  and some seem not to have
 jointed in the compromise for reasons other than doctrine.  there are
 groups descended from both of the supposedly heretical camps.  this
 posting discussed the descendants of the alexandrians.  there are also
 a remaining nestorians.  like some of the current so-called
 monophysites, there is reason to believe that the current so-called
 nestorians are not heretical either.  they sheltered nestorius from
 what they saw as unfair treatment, but claim they did not adopt his
 heresies, and in fact seem to follow more moderate representatives of
 the antiochene tradition.
