  > what is the objection to celebration of easter?
  
        the objection naturally is in the way in which you phrase it. 
 easter (or eashtar or ishtar or ishtarti or other spellings) is the pagan
 whore goddess of fertility.  therefore, your question to me is "what is
 the objection to celebration of the pagan whore goddess?"  when phrased
 that way i suspect (or at least i would hope) that it becomes immeadiately
 apparent what my objection to "celebrating" her would be.
  
  > it is celebration of the resurrection of jesus.
  
       no, you are thinking perhaps of "ressurection sunday" i think. 
 (though i'm not too crazy about the word "sunday", but i certainly like
 this phrasing much better than envoking the name of the whore goddess.)
      for that matter, stay biblical and call it omar rasheet (the feast of
 first fruits).  torah commands that this be observed on the day following
 the sabbath of passover week.  (sunday by any other name in modern
 parlance.)  why is there so much objection to observing the resurrection
 on the 1st day of the week on which it actually occured?  why jump it all
 over the calendar the way easter does?  why not just go with the sunday
 following passover the way the bible has it?  why seek after unbiblical
 methods?

       so what does this question have to do with easter (the whore
 goddess)?  i am all for celebrating the resurrection.  just keep that
 whore out of the discussion.

        yes, i have heard of your newspapers speaking of the need to repave
 streets with "afro-canadiantop".  <grin> (i still think "blacktop" sounds
 better though.)

        fine by me.  and while we are at it, the left-handed people are
 both "sinister" and "gauche" so we probably will have some objections from
 that quarter as well.

       yes, that sounds much better to me.  is there anyone out there would
 thinks that phrasing sounds worse?

       read the letter to philemon.  now tell me, was philemon's "slave"
 returned to him?  were there different rules upon the slave than upon
 philemon?  how about male and female?  are there different "rules" that
 apply to them as well?  or if there is no more "male and female" can adam
 and steve get married to each other in your congregation?  yes, there are
 differences in form and function.  but the way we come to salvation in
 messiah remains the same no matter what our position in life.
  
 ---------------------------------------
 
 [i am in general not in favor of continuing this discussion, as it
 seems repetitive, but this particular point is one that i believe is
 new -- the objection is not to having a holiday but to its name.
 
 i'd like to suggest that people think very carefully about this
 argument.  words often change their meaning over time.  the days of
 the week are of course originally based on pagan gods.  some
 christians prefer to refer to "first day", "second day", etc.  however
 the majority of christians have not been persuaded.  the question
 seems to be whether it makes any difference what the dictionary shows
 as the derivation of a word, if what people mean by it and think when
 they use it is different.
 
 indeed i'd like to suggest that postings like this could themselves be
 dangerous.  suppose people in general use easter to mean the
 celebration of christ's resurrection.  postings trying to convince
 them that they really mean a celebration in honor of some godess run
 the risk of creating exactly the situation that they claim to oppose.
 they are doing their best to *create* a linkage in people's minds
 between their celebration and the pagan goddess.  it's not clear that
 this is a healthy thing.
