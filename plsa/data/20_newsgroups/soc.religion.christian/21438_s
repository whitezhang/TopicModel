 i'm atheist
 just because
 there is no supreme being
 there is the world as we know it
 and it's wonderful and incredible
 and there is love between people
 and these things are everything
 i don't believe in a god that made this all
 i believe in the amazing and beautiful
 teaming with life world i live in
