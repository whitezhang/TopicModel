 i would put it stronger than that.  i consider it nonsense.
 
 simply put, i do not see any way that a "platonic essence" could have
 any *real* existance.  "essence" in the platonic sense does not have
 any referent as far as i can tell - it is just an imaginary concept
 invented to provide an explanation for things better explained in
 other ways.
 
 so, to attribute an 'essence' to god is to attribute to him something that
 does not exist!!  thus the orthodox platonic formulation seems to leave
 the unity of god in limbo, since it is based on a non-existant 'essence',
 thus failing to avoid the very problem it was supposed to address.
 
 thus, to me, the unity of god must be primary, and the triality must be
 secondary, must be modal or aspectual (relating to roles, or to modes
 of interaction), since otherwise there is no meaning to saying god is one.

 [i think one can read augustine as saying something consistent with
 your comments.  his "de trinitate" -- which has been very influential
 in the west -- defines the distinction among the persons relationally.
 you're probably at one extreme of orthodox views, but i'm not sure
 your views are necessary incompatible with the trinity.  --clh]
