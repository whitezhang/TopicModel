 joe;
 
 your logic excapes me. 
 
 if the papacy is infallible, and this is a matter of faith, then the 
 pope cannot "be wrong!"  if, on the other hand, this is not a matter 
 of faith, but a matter of church law, then we should still obey as the
 pope is the legal head of the church.
 
 in other words, given the doctrine of infallibility, we have no choice
 but to obey.

 [you might want to look at the faq on infallibility.  the doctrine on
 infallibility does not say that the pope is always right.  all
 catholic theologians acknowledge that there have been a number of
 occasions when the pope was wrong.  there appear to be two aspects to
 infallibility.  one is a general concept that in the long run the
 church is protected from serious error.  however this does not mean
 that it's impossible for it to take wrong turns at one time or
 another.  the more specific concept of papal infallibility is that in
 very specific circumstances a papal statement can be known to be
 infallible.  however a relatively small fraction of statements meet
 those criteria.  this does not absolve catholics from the duty to obey
 even "ordinary" teachings of the pope.  however only a few teachings
 are made in a way that is explicitly infallible.  --clh]
