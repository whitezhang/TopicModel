 i'll take a try at this...
 
 from the discussions i have been in, and from how *i* have interpreted
 the bible, i feel that one can pray either way.  but remember this,
 before jesus, the people talked to god (no other way) and he talked 
 back.  (audible and dreams, etc.)  today we have the bible to know 
 gods will, and we have his son you died for us.  he was given as our
 savior, and while we still do things according to gods will, we pray
 through his son.  in the bible it says that if we are not known to 
 jesus, we are not known to god.  (sorry i do not have the verses
 with me)  so, if we are to be granted eternal life, we must present
 ourselves to jesus first, who will then present us to god.
