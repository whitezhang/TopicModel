 i don't think we should draw borders around newsgroups, christians
 are free to read and post entries on the atheist newsgroups, and 
 muslims are free to so so in other groups as well.
 
 it's up to each individual to define their time schedule concerning 
 postings. the problems we all have noticed on various newsgroups
 is the evangelistical method of telling that 'i am right, and you are
 wrong'. this is true of both theists and atheists.
 
 hopefully a more constructive dialogue between the groups 
 would help concerning assumptions and colorization of views.
 
 cheers,
 kent
