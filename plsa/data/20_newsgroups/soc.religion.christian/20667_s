 hello.  firstly, what do you exactly mean by "fundamentalist"?  i will
 for the time being assume that what you mean is that your friend believes
 that the bible is god's word to mankind?  i suspect that what happened
 to him is what he'll call being "born again"?  anyway, was that recent?
 if the answer is "yes" to all the questions above, it is quite
 understandable.  however, imo, i'ld rather give advice to your friend!
 i think i've been through something similar to him, and one thing i can
 say is that the basic problem is that each of you are now trying to
 communicate from different worldviews.  why he talks about those things
 is because they are now "obvious" to him.  what is "obvious" to him is
 not obvious to you.  secondly, why he may be very persuasive is because
 from his point of view, he has been on "both sides of the fence".  this
 i mean that before he turned "fundamentalist", you two are agreeable
 because both of you see things from the same side.  if suddenly, as if
 a new world of reality has suddenly opened up to him, it is like the
 discovery of let's say a new continent, or a new planet.  to him, he's
 got to tell you because he has seen something much more wonderful than
 where he was, and what he thinks is much better than where you are now.
 you have got to realise that from his point of view, he means well to
 you, eventhough he may end up offending you.  to him, it is worth that
 risk.  nevertheless, it is really up to him to respect where you stand
 and listen to you as well.  at this moment, it may be difficult because
 he is either very excited or feel it is too urgent to keep quiet about,
 however, he may not realise that he's really putting you off.

 so far, i've only been trying to explain things from his side.  however,
 i do understand how you feel too, because i wasn't a christian for a good
 part of my life as well.  i was quite turned off by christians or
 "fundamentalists" who were really all out and enthusiastic about their
 faith.  they really scared me, to tell you the truth.  unfortunately,
 "religious belief" is a very personal thing, just as your agnosticism
 is also a very personal thing to you.  since the christian belief is
 inevitably at odds with anything non-christian (religious or otherwise),
 it will be a touchy matter.  like all friendships, it will take both
 sides to do their part to make it work.  in this matter, maybe you can
 do your part by telling him nicely that you are not able to dig what he's
 trying to convince you about, that it's beyond you or not your concern
 "for now".  don't tell him it's nonsense, because to him it is reality -
 and that would be a real insult.  he'll also have to be careful not to
 insult where you stand too.
 
 like i said before, i wish i could give your friend some advice too.
 i'll admit that i did similarly to some of my friends when i became a
 christian.  in some ways, i wish i could have done things a little
 differently.  however, it was difficult then because i was so excited
 and just blabbered away about what i've found!  to me, it was too good
 not to know.  to some, i was crazy, and i didn't really care most of
 the time what they thought.  you will probably think he's crazy too -
 but god is very real to him, as real as you are to him.  keep that in
 mind.  and he thinks he can convince you because since god is so real
 to him, he doesn't see why god can't be real to you too.
 
 i don't know how helpful this is to you.  but all the best anyhow -
 this is quite a challenge for you to face.  by the way, personal
 conviction: nobody is "beyond saving" except the one we call the 
 devil and his hosts.
