 i have discussed this with my girlfriend often.  i consider myself married,
 though legally i am not.  neither of us have been with other people sexually,
 although we have been with each other.  we did not have sexual relations
 until we decided to marry eventually.  for financial and distance reasons,
 we will not be legally married for another year and a half.  until then,
 i consider myself married for life in god's eyes.  i have faith that we
 have a strong relationship, and have had for over 4 years, and will be
 full of joy when we marry in a church.  first, however, we must find a
 church( we will be living in a new area when we marry, and will need to
 find a new church community).
 
 anyway, i feel that if two people commit to marriage before god, they are
 married and are bound by that commitment.
