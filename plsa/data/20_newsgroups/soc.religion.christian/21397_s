 hi damon,  no matter what system or explanation of creation you wish
 to accept, you always have to start with one of two premises, creation
 from nothing, or creation from something.  there are no other
 alternatives.  and if we accept one or the other of those two
 premises, then again there are two alternatives, either creation was
 random, or was according to some plan.
    if it was random, i am unable to accept that the complex nature of
 our world with interrelated interdependent organisms and creatures
 could exist as they do.  therefore i am left with creation under the
 control of an intelligence capable of devising such a scheme.  i call
 that intelligence god.
    i also prefer the "creatio ex nihilo" rather than from chaos, as it
 is cleaner.
    there is obviously no way to prove either or neither.  we are and
 we must have come from somewhere.  choose whatever explanation you
 feel most comfortable with, damon.  you are the one who has to live
 with your choice.
 shalom,                                  len howard
