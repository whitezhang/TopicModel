 romans 8:28 (rsv)   we know that in everything god works for good with those 
 who love him, who are called according to his purpose. 
 
 murphy's law:  if anything can go wrong, it will.
 
 we are all quite familiar with the amplifications and commentary on
 murphy's law.  but how do we harmonize that with romans 8:28?  for that
 matter, how appropriate is humor contradicted by scripture?
