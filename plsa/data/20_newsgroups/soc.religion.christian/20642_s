 i agree with what darren has to say here, but would like to add a 
 personal observation.  what i see as arrogance and the problem i have 
 with it is not a sense of personal certainty, but a lack of respect for
 others who come to differing conclusions.  clearly, this is not just 
 christian vs. non-christian; there is a whole spectrum of belief systems
 within christianity.  i do not tend to argue with others about matters
 of personal faith because, like aesthetics, it is not demonstable by
 objective means.  
 
 choosing what to believe and rely on are important areas of personal 
 sovereignty.  what bothers me is when others suggest that, in these 
 matters of faith, their specific beliefs are not only true to them 
 but are absolute and should be binding on others.  it follows from this
 that god must give everyone the same revelation of truth, and thus 
 anyone who comes to a different conclusion is intentionally choosing
 the wrong path.  this is the arrogance i see; a lack of respect for the
 honest conclusions of others on matters which are between them and god.
 even a personal certainty leaves room for the beliefs of others.  it is
 universalizing those matters of personal faith, coupled by a proud
 notion that one's relationship with god is superior to other's, that
 leads to arrogance.  in my honest (and nonuniversal) opinion. :-)

 [it is certainly reasonable to ask for some humility about our own
 ability to know the truth.  there are also different paths in some
 areas of practice.  but i'd like to see more clarification about what
 you mean when you reject the idea of saying "their specific beliefs
 are not only true to them but are absolute and should be binding on
 others."  if something is true, it is true for everyone, assuming that
 the belief is something about god, history, etc.  of course something
 of the form "i believe that it's best for me not to xxx" could be true
 for some people and not others.  i have suggested in the past that god
 may be less concerned about doctrinal agreement than many people are.
 but that doesn't mean i doubt that there is a difference between
 true and false, nor that i think there is no benefit in finding out
 what is true.  --clh]
