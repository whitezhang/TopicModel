 if this is true than why in the genesis story is god concerned that
 adam and eve might also eat from the tree of life and live forever and
 be like gods?  eating of the tree of life would not take away the
 effects of eating of the tree of knowledge.  is there any reason to
 assume that they had already eaten of the tree of life and so had
 already attained to eternal life?  if so, what basis is there for
 saying that this was taken away from them?  to me the wages of sin are
 a spiritual death, not necessarily a physical death.  i
 can attest to the truth of this interpretation from my own experience.
 i suspect that many others could attest to this as well.
