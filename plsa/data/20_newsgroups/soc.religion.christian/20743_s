 this is an annual time of prayer organized by the focus on the family
 organization.  if you have not heard about it on your christian radio
 station or at your local church, call them and they may be able to
 give you the information.
 
 many cities in the san francisco bay area have local coordinators
 organizing the time and the place to meet to pray.  in san francisco,
 oakland, berkeley, san jose, people will be meeting at ~12:15pm at
 each city's city hall.
 
 last year, i attended at the mountain view city hall.  it was a very
 quiet and meaningful time of prayer.
