 of course if this question was asked in a group dealing with economics,
 the answer would be that the cause of war was economic. my observations
 over the past 30 years (and not withstanding a little history reading
 beside) is that while religious differences do play a part in many of
 the conflicts, so does (unfortunately) race, economics and any other
 items that identify one group of men as being different from another.
 
 if we want to couch the cause of conflict in christian terms, i would
 put it while christ died for our sins, we are yet sinners. while some
 individuals assume "christlike" natures, most of us do not even
 come close.
 
 i realize that in many ways this is a trite answer, but i guess that
 it is my way of rationalizing man's constant (or so it seems)
 conflict.
