 i'd like to field this one, if i may.  although i am a believer in and follower
 of christ, my experiences with religion haven't been all that positive.  in
 fact, there was one point in my life when, for about three days, i simply
 _couldn't_ believe in the existence of god.  anyway, when i look back upon the
 troubles i've had, they seem to fall into two categories -- impulses to
 unbelief that resulted from logical contradictions, and impulses to unbelief
 that resulted from frustration with god.
 
 the first category doesn't occur to me much anymore, as i have worked through
 most of the arguments for the non-existence of god.  but way back when, these
 would cause me some problems, and i would have to struggle with my faith to
 continue to believe.  i can see where others less stubborn than i (and i do
 mean stubborn.  stubborness has often been the only thing standing between
 me an atheism from time to time) would fail.
 
 the second category arises out of some long-term personal difficulties and
 the struggle to live my life as god would have me live it without living my 
 life as others would tell me how god would have me live it.  a good example of
 this is my struggle with the more radical christians i meet.  i am not, nor
 have i ever been, "on fire for chirst," and i don't think i ever want to be.
 nevertheless, i am not "lukewarm" about my faith, so i don't really
 fit in with the mainstream either.  quite naturally, i feel a lot of anxiety
 about my dislocation within christian society, and it can lead to a lot of
 internal tension, when i want to do what i _know_ is right,
 but when another part of me believes that what i want to do is wrong because
 all the other christians think so to.  quite naturally, this tension has a
 destructive effect on my relationship with god, and during all of this internal
 strife, there's atheism sitting there like the promised land -- no rules, no
 responsibilities, no need to live up to anyone's expectations but my own.
 complete freedom.  of course, it's all an illusion, but nevertheless, it's a
 very appealing illusion, especially when the so-called "people of god" are
 behaving like total twits.  i can easily understand why someone would go
 that route, and would be hostile to ever coming back.
 
 imho, many of the former-christians-turned-atheists-who-are-now-actively-
 hostile-to-christianity are so because their experience with christ and god
 wasn't a very peaceful one, but one of mind-control and "shut-up-and-do-what-
 you're-told-because-we-know-what's-best-for-you-because-it's-god's-will-and-
 you're-to-young-to-know-what-god's-will-is-yet" courtesy of some of christ's
 more overzealous followers.  
 
 a final reason why people become atheists is because christians do not have a
 very good reputation right now.  one of the things that attracted people to
 christianity in the ancient days was the love that christians obviously had
 for one another and the world around them.  unlike the rest of the world,
 christian communities actively cared for their poor, and the christian rich
 did not trod on the backs of their poorer brothers, but bent down to help
 them.  christians were known for living exemplary lives, even if they were
 thought to be traitors to the state because they wouldn't sacrifice to the
 emporer.  nowadays, courtesy of the media and some christian leaders who lost
 christ on their way to power, people see christians as sexually-repressed
 hippocritical busibodies who want to remake society into a facist version of 
 their own moral view.
 
 there are a lot more reasons why people become atheists, but i don't have time
 to go into them right now.
