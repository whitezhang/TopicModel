 there is a certain truth to this statement. only i would use the word
 "medicine" instead of drug.  with regard to the condition of the human
 soul, christianity is first and foremost a healing medicine.  it also
 strengthens and enables one, as healing takes hold, to grow in new
 strength and health to live and be and to do that for which god created 
 us.

 christ's medicine, rightly allowed to work, brings one nearer to
 reality and offers the clarity of understanding and the strength
 of spirit with which to meet it in a healthy human way.
