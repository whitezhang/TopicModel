 from the june newsletter of the latin liturgy association:
 
 there is a new e-mail discussion group: latin-l, a forum for people
 interested in classical latin, medieval latin, neo-latin; the languages of
 choice are latin (of course) and whatever vulgar languages you feel
 comfortable using.  please be prepared to translate on request.  the field
 is open -- name your topic!  in order to subscribe, bitnet users should
 send an interactive message of the form "tell listserv@psuvm sub latin-l
 [your name]".  internet users should send a message (without a subject
 line) to the address listserv@psuvm.psu.edu.  the message should read "sub
 latin-l [your name]".  once subscribed, one may participate by sending
 messages to latin-l@psuvm or latin-l@psuvm.psu.edu.
