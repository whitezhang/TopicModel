 in many places, christians were sucessful in their attempts
 to get the films banned, or at least given a very restrictive 
 showing.
 
 i have no problem with christians burning their own pieces of
 art (though i find it a tragic waste). i do however have a 
 problem with their attempts to censor what i may or may not
 view.
