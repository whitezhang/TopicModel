 terms are being used in a loaded way here.
 
 "logical proof" is an extremely messy thing to apply to real
 life. if you think otherwise, try to construct a proof that
 yesterday happened. obviously it did; anyone old enough to be
 reading this was there for it and remembers that it happened.
 but *proof*? a proof starts with axioms and goes somewhere.
 you need axioms to talk about logical proof. you can say that
 you remember yesterday, and that you take as axiom that anything
 you clearly remember happened. i could counterclaim that you
 hallucinated the whole thing.
 
 to talk about proofs of historical events, you have to relax the
 terms a bit. you can show evidences, not proofs. evidences of the
 resurrected jesus exist. proofs do not.
 
 i think christianity goes down in flames if the resurrection is
 ever disproved. i also think that this will not happen, as
 the evidence for the resurrection is quite good as these things
 go. it is not entirely fair to claim that you can only take
 the resurrection on faith. there are reasons to believe it
 that appeal to the mind, too.
