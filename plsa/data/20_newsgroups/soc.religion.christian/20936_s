 
           the sophomore
           (romans 1:22)
 
 the sophomore says, ``what is truth?''
 and turns to bask in the admiration of his peers.
 
 how modern how daring how liberating
 how modern how daring how liberating
 they chant
 
 the sophomore, being american
 doesn't know
 that his ``question''
 
    modern
        skeptical
            cynical
 
 was asked before, by a
 
    modern
        skeptical
            cynical
    urbane cosmopolitan
 
 politician (appointed not elected)
 who happened to live two thousand years ago.
 
 like many politicians he cared
 
     less about ideals
          than results
 
     less about ends
          than means
 
     less about anything
          than keeping his job
               (and his head).
 
 we might call him
 a bit brutal
 though `firm' would be kinder
 (and no doubt stalin, who let nobody go, laughed at his laxness)
 he didn't like his job; perhaps he no longer hoped for better
 (nor feared worse, except regarding his head).
 
 and when these wily jews
 with their heads-i-win, tails-you-lose
      conundrums
 brought forth their madman,
 his first impulse was to play the roman:
 ``i find nothing wrong with him,
   see to it yourselves.''
 
 but when they mentioned `king' and `caesar'
 his heart froze.
 
 if he killed their madman
     he'd start a riot
          and lose his job
              (and his head)
 
 if he saved the king of the jews
     he'd piss off caesar
          and lose his job
              (and his head)
 
 and when his wife told him to have
    nothing to do with the righteous lout
 she didn't tell him anything
    he hadn't already figured out.
 
 so he punted.
 
 ``not my jurisdiction!  take him to see herod!''
 (who just happened to be in town....)
 
 herod appreciated the courtesy
 but wasn't worried
         and sent the sharp-tongued fool
      (who suddenly didn't have much to say,
     funny how people lose it under pressure....)
   back
 in the attire proper
   to his royal state.
 
 his ass is covered---if herod has no problem,
 caesar certainly won't.  the fool can be king
 of whatever world he wants
 as long as it's not caesar's.
 
 ``i'm letting him go,'' he said with a shout.
 (looks like he'll last this one out....)
 
 the crowd's reaction puzzled him.
   they really wanted him dead.
 they didn't want the king of the jews,
   they wanted barabbas instead
 (and, as josephus records, they got him)
 
 oh well, he thought,
 they all look the same to me.
 and we'll get barabbas next time.
 
 and if i can get them to say
    ``we have no king but caesar!''
    by killing a madman,
 hell, i'll kill ten a day.
 
 and then pilate had his fun
   a little joke
     short
       to the point
         trilingual
 
 and all this
 went as it always does
 when someone gets caught
 in the gears of government
 
 and there's a scientific explanation
      (no doubt)
 for the superstitious rumors
      (persisting to this day)
 that it didn't all end
 with a tomb
 and a roman squadron on guard.
 
 our sophomore doesn't know about this
 he doesn't recognize his kindred spirit
 (or truth either, as he admits).
 
 i guess we haven't learned much
 in two thousand years.
