 please note that god commanded adam to work before the fall:
 
 "the lord god took the man and put him in the garden of eden to work
  it and take care of it." (gen 2:15, niv).  
 
 work was god's design from the beginning.

 kind of labor imposed after the fall, but the statement as it
 stands is misleading.  --clh]
