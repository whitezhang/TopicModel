 gifts of the spirit should not be seen as an endorsement of ones behavior.
 a lot of people have suffered because of similar beliefs.  jesus said
 that people would come to him saying "lord, lord," and proclaiming
 the miraculous works they had done in his name.  jesus would tell
 them that they were workers of iniquity that do not know him, and to
 depart from him.  
 
 that is not to say that this will happen to everyone who commits a homosexual
 sin.  if the holy spirit were only given to the morally perfect, he would
 not be given to me, or any of us.  god can forgive any sin, if we repent.
 but people should be careful not to think, "god has given me a gift of
 the spirit, it must be okay to be gay."  that is dangerous (see also hebrews
 6 about those who have partaken of the holy spirit and of the powers of 
 the world to come.)

 jesus doesn't ask us to change our own nature.  we cannot lift ourselves
 out of our own sin- but we must submit to his hand as he changes our
 nature.  practicing homosexual acts and homosexual lusts violates the
 morality that god has set forth.  
 
 if you don't believe that, and think those of us who do are just ignorant,
 then at least consider us weak in the faith and be celebate for our sake's.
 is practicing homosexuality worth the cost of a soul, whether it be the
 homosexual's or the one considered "ignorant?"
