 perhaps it would be useful to ask whether those doing the ethnic
 cleansing could be said to be loving those they are killing in the very
 act of killing.  does it reflect the attitude of god, who sends rain to
 both the just and the unjust?  if not, then christians should be
 uncomfortable with it.  jesus gave his followers the law of love to
 follow and it is by exhibiting this that disciples will be known. 
 doctrinal (or political) correctness is not the standard, so i don't see
 why christians should be moved against the serbs because their ancestors
 converted from christianity to islam.  it seems to me that as a
 christian you _should_ be troubled by the ethnic cleansing.
