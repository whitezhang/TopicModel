 joe, just 'cause you say they aren't subject to interpretation doesn't
 necesarily make it so.  that's *your* *interpretation* of these texts.

 2 peter 1:20-21
 but know this first of all, that no prophecy of scripture is a matter 
 of one's own interpretation, for no prophecy was ever made by an act of
 human will, but men moved by the holy spirit spoke from god.
 
 the study notes in my bible offer three possible meanings for verse 20.
 apparantly it's not as clear to charles ryrie as it is to you.
 
 2 timothy 3:16-17
 all scripture is inspired by god and profitable for teaching, for
 reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; that the man of
 god may be adequate, equipped for every good work.
 
 galations 1:11-12
 for i would have you know, brethren, that the gospel which was preached
 by me is not according to man.  for i neither received it from man, 
 nor was i taught it, but i receieved it through a revelation of jesus
 christ.
 
 when i read these passages, it was not immediately clear to me what
 every phrase meant.  i had stop and think about the possible
 connotations of words, what the intent of the author may have been,
 wonder if the translator used the correct english word to convey the 
 same meaning: i had to interpret.  if you want to believe that your 
 are not interpreting scripture as you read, there's probably nothing 
 i can say to change your mind.  but i think it's naive to think that 
 our culture, experiences, education, do not affect everything we read.

 in college, i took an entire course in biblical interpretation.  go to
 any christian bookstore, there are scores of books on interpreting and
 understanding scripture.  if interpretation is unnecessary, there are 
 an awful lot of misguided christians out there wasting a lot of time 
 and energy on it.
