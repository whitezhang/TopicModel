    still, the angel gabriel's greetings was:
    "hail mary, full of grace, the lord is with you.
    blessed art thou amongst women".
 
    even mary was confused about this greeting.
 
 there are various explanations for her reaction to the angel's
 greeting.  one is that she grasped what the angel was getting at, that
 she was to be the mother of the messiah.  and knew what this entailed,
 all the suffering.  this gave her a moment's pause.
