 i'll pose a question here that's got me thinking:  what distinguishes
 "true" religion from cults (i'm speaking generally here, not specifially
 about christianity)?  jerry falwell was on good morning america on 
 tuesday ostensibly to answer this question.  basically, he said that
 true religion follows a message whereas a cult follows a person.
 but, then, christianity is a cult because the message of christianity
 is the person of jesus.  so what distinguishes, for example, the
 branch davidian "cult" from the presbyterian "church"?  doctrinal
 differences don't answer the question, imho, so don't use them as
 an answer.

 [there have been some attempts to characterize "cult".  most commonly
 it uses characteristics involving high pressure, brainwashing
 techniques, etc.  but some people characterize it by doctrinal
 error.  in the end i'm afraid it becomes a term with no precise
 meaning that's used primarily to dismiss groups as not worthy
 of serious consideration.  that doesn't mean that there aren't
 groups that do highly irresponsible things and have serious
 doctrinal errors.  but past discussions have not suggested to me
 that "cult" is a very helpful term.  --clh]
