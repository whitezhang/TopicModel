 i have been looking at some of the recent productions on homosexuality
 and decided that i was interested in videotaped copies of these.  if
 anyone can help me out here, i would very much appreciate it.
 
 here is what i am looking for:
 
 * - "the gay agenda" produced by ty beeson's group the report.
 
 * - john ankerberg's recent series "understanding homosexuality and
 experiencing genuine change."
 
 * - james kennedy's special on homosexuality which aired this week,
 and the portion of the previous week's program which discussed "the
 gay agenda."
 
 i will not pay money for copies, since this is copyrighted material
 and that would be illegal.  i will pay for return postage.  if
 somebody can think of something they would desire in trade, please let
 me know and i'll see what i can do.
 
 oh, btw, i'm watching the march on washington right now on c-span. 
 other than the fact that i'm generally repulsed by what i'm watching,
 i found one thing of interest.  general david dinkins just finished
 speaking, and remarked that the new york city delegation consists of
 about 200,000 people.  funny, i don't see 200,000 people out there,
 period.  must've been quite the party scene last night.  or maybe
 their exaggerations were just too much.

 [i don't suppose you'd be interested in hearing about the homosexual
 agenda from homosexual christians?  these portrayals of the homosexual
 agenda are regarded by some as being somewhat akin to trying to
 understand fundamentalist christianity by looking at the branch
 dividians.  you might also want to look at some outside evaluations of
 the groups claiming to change homosexuals.  when our church (the
 presbyterian church (usa)) looked into this issue, even the
 conservative members of the committee were concerned about how real
 and long-lasting the changes were.  i'll be interested to get reports
 from police and the press about the number of people participating
 today.  presumably we'll have a better idea by tomorrow.  --clh]
