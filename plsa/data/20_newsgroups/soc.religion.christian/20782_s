 yes, in fact peter is now at wycliffe hq in the u.k., and is a member of my
 church. i would fully endorse the above -- peter is a very godly man, with a
 passion for serving christ.
 
 on one occasion he specifically addressed the issue of ``cultural
 interference'' in a sermon, presumably from his experience of allegations
 directed at wycliffe. (perhaps i could find the tape...?)
