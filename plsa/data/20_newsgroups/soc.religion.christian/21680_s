 the difference is that straight members are given the choice of
 abstaining or not, and celibacy is recognized as a gift, given only
 to some.  gays are told that, as a condition of acceptance, they
 _must_ be celibate.  i don't believe that god gives me a forced choice
 between having a relationship with god and expressing my heterosexuality
 (within the context of a faithful relationship).  nor do i believe
 that god gives that forced choice to gays.  sex or christianity is a
 false dichotomy.
 
 : to tell the truth, gay churches remind me a lot of henry the viii
 : starting the church of england in order to get a divorce (or is
 : this a myth).  note that i am not denying that gay christians are
 : christian.
 
 for my part, gay churches remind me of blacks starting their own churches
 either because they were not allowed at all in the white churches, or, at
 best, only with special restrictions that did not apply to white members.
