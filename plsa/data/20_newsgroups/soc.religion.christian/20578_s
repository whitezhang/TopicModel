 dear netters:
 
 a new religious newsgroup "soc.religion.islam.ahmadiyya" was pro-
 posed  on  oct  16,  1992. the discussion about this new proposed
 newsgroup went on in various related groups.  the  proposal,  was
 supposed to enter a vote during the last week of november 92. due
 to a false call for votes, by some opponent, the voting had to be
 canceled.  i  quote  here  a  statement  from  the  moderator  of
 new.announce.newgroups:
 
 
 "the current call for votes (cfv) for an ahmadiyya newsgroup
  is being canceled. a new call for votes will be issued within
  a few weeks, possibly with a new impartial vote  taker.  discus-
  sion on the proposal is still open until the new vote is called..."
                                 -- by lawrence, nov 20, 1992.
 
 
 a lot of confusion arose among the netter as  to  whom  to  vote.
 therefore  it was decided to give a cool down period, so that all
 confusions are over. it has been over 4 months  of  that  instant
 and now we are again attempting to create this newsgroup. a fresh
 rfd is hereby being issued. please! take part in  the  discussion
 under the same  title heading  and in  "news.groups"  or at least
 cross-post it to "news.groups".

 a brief description about ahmadiyya/islam:
 =========================================
 
 
         the ahmadiyya movement in islam, an international organi-
 sation, was founder in 1989 in qadian, india. the founder of this
 sect, hazrat mirza ghulam ahmad (1835-1908), proclaimed to be the
 promised reformer of this age as foretold in almost all the major
 religions of the world today (islam, christianity, judiasm,  hin-
 duism).  he  claimed  to  be  the  long awaited second comming of
 jesus christ (metaphorically), the muslim mahdi, and the promised
 messiah.  he  claimed that the prophecies contained in almost all
 the great religions of the world about the advent of a  messenger
 from god have been fulfilled.
 
         the claims hazrat ahmad raised storms  of  hostility  and
 extreme  oposition from many priestlike people of muslims, chris-
 tians, jews and hindus of that age. such opposition is often wit-
 nessed  in  the history of divine reformers. even today this sect
 is being persecuted specially in  some  of  the  muslim  regimes.
 dispite  the  opposition  and persecution, this sect has won many
 adherents in 130 countries. it has over 10 million followers, who
 come from a diverse ethnic and cultural background.
 
         the sect is devoted to world peace and in bringing  about
 a better understanding of religion, and the founders of all reli-
 gions. its mission is to unite mankind into one universal  broth-
 erhood  and  develop  a  better  understanding  of  faith. ahmadi
 muslims have always been opposed to all kind of violence and spe-
 cially religious intollerance and fundamentalism.
 
         among its many philanthropic activities, the sect has es-
 tablished  a network of hundreds of schools, hospitals, and clin-
 ics in many third world countries. these institutions are staffed
 by  volunteer  professional  and are fully financed by the sect's
 internal resources.
 
         the ahmadiyya mission is to bring about a universal moral
 reform,  establish  peace and justice, and to unite mankind under
 one universal religion.
