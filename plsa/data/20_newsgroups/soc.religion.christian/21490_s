    this idea, that the reformers somehow were the first to bring the
 bible to the people in their own language, is a myth.  many vernacular
 translations of the bible existed long before the reformation.  the
 vulgate bible, which is still the official version of the bible for the
 catholic church, was itself a translation in the common (i.e. vulgar ==
 vulgate) tongue of its day, latin, and had existed for about a millenium
 before the reformation.
 
    it might also be noted that the printing press was not even invented
 until the same century as that in which the reformation occurred.
