 jesus isn't god ? when jesus returns some people may miss him ?  what version of
 the bible do you read mike ?
 
 jesus is god incarnate (in flesh) . jesus said, 'i and the father are one.' 
 jesus was taken up to heaven after his 40 day post-resurrection stint and the
 angels who were there assured the apostles that jesus would return the same way
 and that everyone will see the coming. that's why jesus warned that many would
 come claiming to be him but that we would know when jesus actually returns. 
 
 these are two very large parts of my faith and you definitely hit a nerve :-)
