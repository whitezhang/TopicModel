 you might visit some congregations of christians, who happen to be homosexuals,
 that are spirit-filled believers, not mcc'rs; before you go lumping us all
 together with troy perry.  
 
 the lord is working in our community (the homosexual community, that is).  he's
 not asking us to change our sexual nature, but he is calling us to practice
 the morality that he established from the beginning.
 
 isn't satan having a hayday pitting christian against christian over any issue
 he can, especially homosexuality.  let's reach the homosexuals for christ. 
 let's not try to change them, just need to bring them to christ.  if he
 doesn't want them to be gay, he can change that.  if they are living a moral
 life, committed to someone of the same sex, and god is moving in their lives,
 who are we to tell them they have to change?
 
 that's my two cent.
 
 god bless you all
