 i wrote that i thought that 2 peter 1:20 meant, "no prophecy of
 scripture (or, as one reader suggests, no written prophecy) is
 merely the private opinion of the writer."
 
 tony zamora replies (sat 8 may 1993) that this in turn implies that
 it is not subject to the private interpretation of the reader
 either. i am not sure that i understand this.
      in one sense, no statement by another is subject to my private
 interpretation. if reliable historians tell me that the athenians
 lost the pelopennesian war, i cannot simply interpret this away
 because i wanted the athenians to win. facts are facts and do not go
 away because i want them to be otherwise.
      in another sense, every statement is subject to private
 interpretation, in that i have to depend on my brains and
 expereience to decide what it means, and whether it is sufficiently
 well attested to merit my assent. even if the statement occurs in an
 inspired writing, i still have to decide, using my own best
 judgement, whether it is in fact inspired. this is not arrogance --
 it is just an inescapable fact.
