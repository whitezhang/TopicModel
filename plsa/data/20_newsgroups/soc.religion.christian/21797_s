 it's not scriptural, but comes from the patristic age, i think:
 something about "amare errantem, interficere errorem", which sounds
 more like "love the errant, slay the error".  no doubt someone else 
 will know in particular who minted the phrase.  if i had to guess, i'd
 blame :-)  st augustine, who seems to have had a gift for aphorism.
