 i would recommend "essential truthes of the christian faith" by rc sproul.
 it is copywrited 1992 from tyndale house publishers. sproul offers concise 
 explanations, in simple language, of around 100 different christian 
 doctrines, grouped by subject. i think it would be particularly good for
 newer christians (and older christians suffering spiritual malnutrition),
 as it gives a biblically sound basic treatment of the issues, avoiding 
 long in-depth analysis that can wait until after you know the basics.
