   i have found that this isn't a very effective argument.  most atheists are
 perfectly willing to acknowledge the existence and ministry of jesus--but are
 quite capable of rationalizing the miracles and the resurrection into 
 misunderstandings, hoaxes, or simple fabrications.  they can always make an
 analogy with the _iliad_, a book that tells the story of the historical trojan
 war, but also talks about gods and goddesses and their conversations.
   i don't think it's possible to convince atheists of the validity of 
 christianity through argument.  we have to help foster faith and an
 understanding of god.  i could be wrong--are there any former atheists here who
 were led to christianity by argument?
