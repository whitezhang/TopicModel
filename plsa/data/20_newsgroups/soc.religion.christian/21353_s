 let me tell you my story.
 i grew up catholic. up until i was 14, it wasn't an issue for me. then i met
 a born-again christian, a very sweet person, not proseletyzing(sp?), not 
 imposing. i tried to get into being as christian as i could, as i felt i 
 'should'.
 
 but the more i tried, the more depressed i got. i felt guilty for some of my
 own personal, honest feelings. i tried so hard to reconcile this conflict.
 until i was 23.
 
 then i taught myself to think rationally. i read a lot of books, pro and con 
 religion in general and, specifically, catholicism. i came to a crisis point,
 then it finally clicked and now i am a staunch atheist. 
 
 this is a very loose explanation, but it's the gist of it.
 
 now, (at 26) i feel better about myself, better self-esteem, a generally 
 stronger person. i have well-defined goals. i have a strong and stable sense 
 of morals and values. i am not a neo-nazi or a corrupt politicain, etc. i 
 believe in human rights and 'live and let live' among other things. i am very 
 anti-violent and anti-hatred. (this is to debunk the myth that atheists are
 depraved.)
 religion has no place in my system.
 tough.
 
 bertrand russell said that we cannot *know* god doesn't exist, we can't prove 
 it. so, in that sense, we can only truly be agnostic. but, for all practical
 purposes there is no god.
