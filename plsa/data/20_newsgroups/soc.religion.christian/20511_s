 firstly, i am an atheist. i am not posting here as an immature flame
 start, but rather to express an opinion to my intended audience.
 
 the meaning of my existence is a question i ask myself daily.  i live 
 in fear of what will happen when i  die.   
 
 i bet some of you are licking your lips now, because you think that
 i'm a person on the edge of accepting jeezus.             
 
 i was raised in a religious atmosphere, and attended 13 years of
 religious educational institutions..  i know the bible well. so well
 i can recognize many passages from memory.  
 
 <<****strong opinions start here...****>>
 
 1) the human being is an _animal_ who has, due to his/her advanced
 mental facilities, developed religious as a satisfiable solution to
 explain the unexplainable.  (for example the ancient greeks believed
 that apollo drove his chariot across the sky each day was real.  due
 to the advancement of our technology, we know this to be false.  
 
 christianity is an infectious cult.  the reasons it flourishes are 
 because 1) it gives people without hope or driven purpose in life
 a safety blanked to hide behind.  "oh wow..all i have to do is 
 follow this christian moral standard and i get eternal happiness."
 for all of you "found jeezus" , how many of you were "on the brink?"
 
 but i digress...   the other reason christianity flourishes is its
 infectious nature.  a best friend of mine breifly entered a christian
 group and within months, they set ministry guidelines for him which
 basicaly said this -->priority #1 spread the word.
 
 
 we are _just_ animals.  we need sleep, food, and we reproduce.  and we
 die.      
 
 religion (especially christianity) is nothing more than a drug.
 some people use drugs as an escape from reality.  christians inject
 themselves with jeezus and live with that high. 
 
 it pities me how many millions of lives have been lost in religious
 wars, of which christianity has had no small part.
 
 when christians see a "non-believer", they say that person is blind
 to the truth, but they cannot realize that it is _they_ who live
 with this mask of fakeness each day.  jesus was just prophet #37696 
 who happened to have a large influence because at that time the romans
 were (circa 69ad) dispersing the jewish population and communities
 needed some sort of cohesive element to keep them strong in that time
 of dire need.
 
 i must go.  these are but a few of my thoughts on christianity.
