 eric ("damien"?) was presenting his views on christianity; i'll
 respond to a few of his points:

 this is certainly a valid objection to religion-as-explanation-of-
 nature.  
 
 fortunately for the convenience of us believers, there is a class of
 questions that can never be reduced away by natural science.  for
 example: why does the universe exist at all?  after all, the time-space
 world didn't have to exist.  why does *anything* exist? and: is it
 possible for persons (e.g. man) to come into being out of a purely
 impersonal cosmos?  these questions which look at the real mysteries of
 life -- the creation of the world and of persons -- provide a permanent
 indicator that the meaning of life in the material world can only be
 found *outside* that world, in its source.

 when you say that man is *only* an animal, i have to think that you are
 presenting an unprovable statement -- a dogma, if you will.  and one
 the requires a kind of "faith" too.   by taking such a hard line in
 your atheism, you may have stumbled into a religion of your own.
 
 but before you write off all christianity as phony and shallow, i hope
 you'll do a little research into its history and varieties, perhaps by
 reading paul johnson's "a history of christianity".  from your remarks,
 it seems that you have been exposed to certain types of christian
 religion and not others.  even an atheist should have enough faith in
 man to know that a movement of 2000 years has to have some depth, and
 be animated by some enduring values.
 
 with best wishes,
