 here is another way of looking at it.
 
 when we die we are released from the arc of time, and able
 to comprehend our lives in toto.  to visit each moment in
 time sequentially or all at once, but not able to alter the
 actions thoughts or feelings we had/have/will have in this 
 life.
 
 from that perspective, i posit that all will have direct knowledge
 of god, and be able to recognize at each moment of time wether
 we were doing what we ought.  that the experience of having
 lived a life far from god will be an eternal torment.  that 
 having lived a life of grace, will be an eternal joy.  that the 
 resurrection of the body comes not from any physical reconstitution
 of our present forms, but knowledge of our present forms by our
 fully cognizant souls.
 
 as an aside:  if we were to be restricted for all time to
 our present form, would you opt for immortality?
