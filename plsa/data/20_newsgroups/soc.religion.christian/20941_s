 true to a point.  if you were to ask a buddhist atheist...

 actually, yes and no, hell is eternal death.  actually, the way 
      i've had it related to me, it's more of an eternal damnation,
      where sinners will feel the licking flames of hell.  if i
      supposedly can feel these flames, i would assume i'm still
      alive, but suffering and away from god.

 i believe jehovah's witnesses have a similar view, where the body
      sleeps for ever...
 
 i don't have a problem with being condemned to hell either.  the
      way i see it, if god wants to punish me for being honest in
      my skepticism (that is, for saying he doesn't exist), he
      certainly wouldn't be changing his nature.  besides, i would
      rather spend an eternity in hell than be beside god in heaven
      knowing even one man would spend his "eternal life" being
      scorched for his wrongdoings...
