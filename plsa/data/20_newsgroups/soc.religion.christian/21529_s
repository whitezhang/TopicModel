 gerry palo wrote that there is nothing in christianity that excludes
 the theory of a succession of lives.
 
 i wrote that the apostle paul, in romans 9, speaks of god as
 choosing jacob over esau, and adds that this is not as a result of
 anything that either child had done, since they had not been born
 yet.
 
 clearly, paul does not believe that they had had previous lives, nor
 does he suppose that his readers will believe it. for if they had
 had previous lives, it would not make sense to say, "neither of them
 has done anything good or bad as yet, since they are not yet born."
 
 daniel cossack writes to ask whether it is fair for god to hate
 easau when esau has done nothing bad?
 
 i reply that in hebrew it is standard usage to speak of hating when
 what is meant is simply putting in second place. as an example,
 consider the saying in matthew 6:24
 
  + no man can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one
  + and love the other, or....
 
 now, it is obviously false that a man with two masters must hate one
 of them. but it is obviously true that he must put one of them in
 second place. a dog that always comes when either billy or bobby
 calls will have a problem if they stand in different places and call
 simultaneously. it cannot give first priority to both. one must take
 second place. in our original example, second place means that
 jacob, not esau, is chosen to bear the covenant blessing and
 obligation, and to be the ancestor of christ.

 eugene bigelow mentions matthew 11:14 which says of john the
 baptist:
 
  + and if ye will receive it, this is elijah, who was to come.
 
 i take this to mean that john was an elijah-like figure, dressing
 and living like elijah, preaching like elijah, and fulfilling the
 prediction that elijah would prepare the way for the messiah.  i do
 not think that he was elijah in a literal sense, and, appareently,
 neither did he (john 1:21).
