 sorry, but i think this interpretation of the matthew 13 parables is
 nonsense. i.e.,
 
 > 'yeast' - *always* stands for sin/corruption/heresy. for example 'beware
 > of the yeast of the pharisees'. ...
 
 matthew 16:12 explains that by "leaven of the pharisees" jesus was simply
 referring to their teaching; not sin/corruption/heresy.
 
 jesus gaves his apostles the keys of the kingdom and said that
 the gates of hell would not prevail against his church.
