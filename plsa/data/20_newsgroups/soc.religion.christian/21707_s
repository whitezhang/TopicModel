 note that "scientific evidence" in this area does not prove any conclusions.
 there has been evidence to suggest that a certain part of homosexual's
 brains are different from heterosexuals- but that proves very little.
 
 also notice that the apostles did not have with them the "scientific
 evidence" linking certain genes with alcoholism, or stealing with certain
 genetic problems.  even if they did have scientific evidence, i doubt it
 would have stopped them from communicating the teaching from the holy 
 spirit that these things are sinful.
 
 this reminds me of a conversation with a professor of mine.  he said 
 something very true.  christianity teaches that we should not give in
 to our every inclination.  most people do give in to their leanings.
 in christianity, we have the concept of struggling with the flesh,
 and bringing it into submission.  one person may have a problem with
 his temper, and having a murderous heart, another may have a problem
 with homosexuality, another may be inclined to greed.  but god offers
 us the opportunity to be more than conquerers.

 the preying mantis bites the head off of her mate after she mates
 with him.  is it natural for a woman to do the same thing to her husband?
 the bible is concerned with human morality, and only touches on animal
 morality as it relates to humans.
