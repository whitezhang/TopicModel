 well said, michael!
 
 the catholic traditon has a list of behaviours called the spiritual 
 works of mercy:
 
 admonish the sinner
 instruct the ignorant
 counsel the doubtful
 comfort the sorrowful
 bear wrongs patiently
 forgive all injury
 pray for the living and the dead (yes, i know there is some controversy 
                            on this and i don't want to argue about it.)
 
 these are all things that have a direct application to usenet.  people 
 ask questions and express doubts.  some are in need of comfort or 
 prayers.  imagine what would happen to flame wars if we bore wrongs 
 patiently and forgave injuries.   i would add that it is probably more 
 appropriate to do any admonishing by private email than publicly.
