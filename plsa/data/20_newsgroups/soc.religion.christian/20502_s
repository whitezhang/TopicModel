 i seldom see any posts in this group. is anyone out there in christendom
 listening? if so, why don't we get some dialog going here?
 
 here's a topic to get things started. my daughter's christian school sends
 home a weekly update on school related topics. this week they sent
 something *very* interesting. it was an article written by the leader of a
 national (us) christian school organization about a trip he recently made
 to jerusalem. while there, he was introduced to one of the rabbis who is
 working on a project to rebuild the temple at jerusalem. the article
 included photos of the many furnishings that have already been made in
 preparation for furnishing the rebuilt temple according to the
 specifications given in the bible. 
 
 what was even more striking is the fact that the plans for the temple are
 complete and the group is only awaiting permission from the israeli
 government before beginning the building. the other startling fact is the
 very recent archeological discovery that the original site of the temple is
 unoccupied and available for building. previously it has been thought that
 the original site was underneath what is now a mosque, making rebuilding
 impossible without sparking a holy war. 
 
 now it appears that nothing stands in the way of rebuilding and resuming
 sacrifices, as the scriptures indicate will happen in the last days.
 although the israeli government will give the permission to start, i think
 it is the hand of god holding the project until he is ready to let it
 happen. brothers and sisters, the time is at hand. our redemption is
 drawing near. look up!
