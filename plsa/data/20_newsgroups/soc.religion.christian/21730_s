 (dear moderator: would you add this to the bcc faq?)
 
 in case there are any ex-members of the "boston church of christ"
 looking for a support organization, here's the number of "bostonex" in
 burlington, ma: 617-272-1955.

 s.r.c readers in new england may be interested in seeing a series of
 news reports about the bcc in the 6 pm nightly news on channel 5
 (wcvb, boston), for the next few days (starting wed, 5/19).
 
 for viewers outside the boston area, the same telecasts will also be
 aired on the "new england cable news" channel at 8 pm.
