     i am sorry you find these charges amusing, mark. i understand your
 frustration though--it can be kind of scary to find your assumptions
 challenged. some of the specific cultural interference to which i refer
 includes linguistic manipulation, for instance, their tzotzil-spanish
 dictionary removed both spanish and tzotzil words for concepts which are
 threatening to the ruling ideology, e.g., class, conquer, exploitation,
 repression, revolution, and described words which can express
 ideological concepts in examples like "boss--the boss is good. he treats
 us well and pays us a good wage." as some of my students would say,
 "not!"  
      your tone implies that you are unlikely to believe me--indeed, why
 should you? if you are interested enough to do some further research
 though, and you sound as if you are, here are some references for you.
