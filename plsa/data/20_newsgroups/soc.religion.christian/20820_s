 i would be a bit more specific in looking at this verse in regard to
 'blocking' prayer.  i have trouble thinking that god would allow
 anything to block our access to him in prayer, especially if we have
 sinned and are praying for forgivenenss.
     i can see, however, how our prayer life might be hindered by our
 sin, if we are concentrating on what is causing the sin or what has
 happened, we may not be thinking about prayer, thus our prayers are
 'hindered' by our own actions.
     but i don't think anything can 'block' the transmission, or
 reception of prayer to god.
 shalom,                                      len howard
