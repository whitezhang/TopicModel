 this seems to be a pretty arogant definition of belief.  my beliefs
 are those things which i find to be true based on my experience of the
 world.  this experience includes study of things that i may not have
 experienced directly.  but even then, i can only understand the
 studies to the extent to which i can relate what i study back to what
 i have experienced.
 
 which means that by beliefs about god are directly related to my
 experience of god.  having experienced god, i try to make sense of
 that experience.  i study religion and read the bible.  i find things
 that echo what i have already experienced.  out of this i build my
 beliefs.  i also find things that don't match my experience.  that
 doesn't make them false.  they just don't match my experience.  maybe
 i will understand that stuff later.  i don't know.  maybe all of my
 beliefs are wrong.  i can change my beliefs.
 
 if someone else has beliefs that are different from mine, so what.
 neither of us are necessarily wrong.  someone else is making sense out
 of a different set of experiences.  even though we have different
 explanations and beliefs, if we talk we might even discover that the
 underlying experiences are similar.
 
 some people approach religion as a truth that can only exist in one
 form, and usually has a single revelation.  the more dogmatic and
 inflexible the belief system, the more arrogant it will appear to an
 outsider.  there is another approach possible, however.  god is a
 mystery.  i am trying to solve the mystery, so i look at the evidence
 available to me.  i try to arrive at the best understanding that i can
 based on the evidence.  new evidence may cause me to change my
 understanding.  when i encounter someone with a different belief than
 my own, it isn't a threat, it is an opportunity to perhaps discover
 something new about this mystery i can never fully comprehend.
