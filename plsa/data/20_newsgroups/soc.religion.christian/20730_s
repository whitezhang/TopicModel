 so your are saying to rely on our feelings and experiences (since
 this is the only other source of information left to us).
 how can you then convince somebody that your "feelings and experiences"
 are the correct ones then if you can't show somebody visible and
 measurable effects?  if my experiences say that "there exists no god"
 and yours says there does, where does that leave us?  since we are only
 going on experiences, then both of us are correct within our own personal
 realities.
 
 furthermore, the trouble with "feelings and experiences" is that they
 can lead you astray, as the tragic outcome of waco illustrates.  i
 am sure that many of koresh's followers really believed in him but
 i think that you and i will agree that they were being misled.
 
 finally, how on earth do you come to the conclusion that the physical
 sphere is not self-explanatory when you only rely on the five senses?

 you must be using a definition of "evidence" that i am not familiar with.
 to me, evidence is something you can show others -unambiguously- that
 what you are saying is true.
 
 however, i agree with you that belief in a diety is a matter of faith.
 it is not something you can share around - others must experience it
 independantly.  unfortunately, as i have explained above, this puts
 belief down to a matter of experience.  my impression is that christians
 do not have the monopoly on reason, evidence and faith as far as any of
 these things can go.

 at the risk of repeating my argument : as i have explained previously, 
 the trouble is that moslems, buddhists, jews, etc will all say that they
 claim, with good reason, to be a valid system, possessed of the best
 evidence, for explaining gods revelations to man (for buddhists it
 should read "for explaining the non-existence of god").  so not only
 must you "prove" your own case, you have to "disprove" theirs.
 
 (alt.messianic is a good place to see people strong in the belief
 of their own faiths ... and with their own good reasons)

 i know that all people can use reason ... i never claimed that they don't.
 i just wish to make sure that their arguments are well-founded.  it goes
 without saying that if i make a blunder that i expect people to correct
 me.  once we have all gone through this process of removing the 
 non-essential and contradictory bits, we should (hopefully) have made
 some progress towards the truth.
