 please, leave heaven out of it.  for his own sake, i pray that dan does
 take it literally because that's how god intended it to be taken.  dan,
 your view of many groups appears correct from my point of view.
 however, i have found a group which is truly meeting requirements laid
 down by the bible on what it means to be a disciple of jesus.  i have no
 clue where wwc is, but please mail me.  i'd really like to get you in
 touch with them.

 dan, i'm familiar with this one.  you've got a point, though.  there are
 some who don't want to turn over everything and be a disciple, some have
 no clue about it because they've not been taught, some have done exactly
 that and turned over everything to follow jesus, some are blocked by
 difficult doctrine taught by uncaring pharisees and teachers of the law.
 however, jesus pointed out what it takes to follow him and to be his
 disciple in luke 9:23-26 and luke 14:25-33.  my question is:  why do
 people ignore the command and treat it as optional?  i certainly don't
 have an answer to this.

 my parents had nothing to do with it.  god had and has everything to do
 with it.  as for these attacking responses, i must say that i disagree
 with your tone and what appears to be some very judgmental statements
 (possibly to the point of slander) when talking about people, not what
 they do.  please, if you have a response, state it instead of flying off
 the handle on some discourse which may have nothing truly to do with
 what is being discussed.  i'm sure both dan and i would have a much
 happier time with your responses.
