 arguably, it is both. since authority is a matter of both
 communicator and recepiant we can say that, for example "jesus
 is lord" whether the world at large accepts the authority or
 not. thus the bible can be considered for its authoritative
 content whether or not it is accepted (this issue is at the
 heart of pilate's pragmatic question "what is truth?" to jesus
 when our lord was brought before him. jesus' reply was to appeal
 to the authority of his father)
 you also might like to consider the claimed authority
 represented by the statements "thus says the lord" in the bible,
 which claim to put across the exact words of god.
 
 you fall into the danger of relativism with your rejection of
 inherant authority and claim that it lies only in the "community
 of faith" - does something become truth because it is accepted?
 the main thrust of my argument is that there is a godward
 direction as well as a manward (which is where the reference to
 rev 22 came in.)

 if we narrowed it down to the predictive elements - which will
 cut out some of the 39 accepted ot books as well - we
 nonetheless have criteria for determining the validity of the
 book: jesus' standards were that "scripture cannot be broken".
 can you name a single prophecy that fits the bill in the apocrapha?
 (ie definitely fulfilled after it has been written)

 does it have a subjective 'ring of truth' about it - and does
 other evidence that has come to light contradict or confirm the
 authenticity? (archaeological, other textual evidence for
 example)

 what this is getting at is the relationship between text and
 reader. it is to do with the quality of writing, which should
 have the ability to fire the mind, affect our thought life and
 cause us to act in a certain way - there is something of this
 in jesus' quote: "man does not live by bread alone, but by every
 word that proceeds from the mouth of the lord". (matt 4.4)

 does the catholic church give the same authority to the
 apocrapha as to the accepted 66 books? certainly it is not as
 widely used as the ot and nt.

 think about what i have said above. you may want to revise your
 conclusion. in addition think about other 'sacred writings', eg
 the koran, the book of mormon and how and why you would
 categorise them using the above principles. one word of caution
 - you may find some 'reflected glory' in some of these books: in
 that the 'inspired quality' may be derived from the bible.
 remember that lucifer is quite capable of appearing as an angel
 of light and quoting scripture.

 we've lost the point and the context here. i am not arguing that
 the statement in rev. can be applied indescriminately, just that
 the whole acceptance/rejection idea does not just follow on from
 man-made traditions - but there is i believe an act of god
 involved in the selection and criteria of what is classified as
 scripture and comes under the definition of 2tim 3.16.
