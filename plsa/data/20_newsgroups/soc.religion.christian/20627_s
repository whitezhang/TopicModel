 one of the laws of nature, specifying cause and effect seems to dictate 
 (at least to this layman's mind) there must be a causal event.  no
 reasonable alternative exists.
 
 as far as i can tell, the very laws of nature demand a "why".  that isn't
 true of something outside of nature (i.e., *super*natural).

 i believe the "genetic code" will be entirely deciphered in our lifetimes,
 but we will not see man convert entirely inert material into self sustaining, 
 reproducing life, *ever*.  (i've never been much of a prophet, though. i
 can't even *picture* new york in my mind 8^] ).  i don't believe *any*
 technology would be able to produce that necessary *spark* of life, despite
 having all of the parts available. just my opinion.

 that preposition sort of precludes an absolute, doesn't it?  without an 
 absolute conclusion, what are we left with?  i believe the word "faith"
 works nicely.
 
 =      if there were something more to the man (say, a soul), then

 = well, then, buddhism, confucianism, taoism, hinduism, judaism,

 well then, with an *equal* scale, and under an *equal* standard, investigate
 them all, and discover where god is ( or *whether* he is, for the denial of
 god is ultimately a statement of faith, non-falsifiable as his existence 
 may be). 
 
 for isn't this the purpose of religion - to discover, and in discovery, to
 *know* god?
 
 you don't mind if a few of us send up a prayer on your behalf during your
 research, do you?  after all, if we of christ are deluding ourselves, you
 really have nothing to worry about, eh?
 
 until the king returns,
