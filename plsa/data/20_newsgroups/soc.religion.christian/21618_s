 does anyone belong to or know any facts about the
               christian reformed church?
 
 [it's one of two major heirs to the dutch reformed tradition in the
 u.s. the other is the reformed church in america.  the crc is
 more or less a spinoff from the rca.  it was unclear to me from
 my reference exactly the differences between them are.  --clh]
