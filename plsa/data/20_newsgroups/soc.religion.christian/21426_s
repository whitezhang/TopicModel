 what is the basis of the idea of hell being a place of eternal
 suffering?  if it is biblical, please reference.
 
 here's my train of thought: if god is using the earth to manufacture
 heavenly beings, then it is logical that there would be a certain
 yield, and a certain amount of waste.  the yield goes to heaven, and
 the waste is burned (destroyed) in hell.  why is it necessary to
 punish the waste, rather than just destroy it?
 
 peace and joy,
