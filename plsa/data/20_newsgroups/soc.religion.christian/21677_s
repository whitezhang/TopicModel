 but one of the most basic concepts of christian morality is that we
 all have defective appetites due to original sin.  not just
 homosexuals, but everybody.  thus we are not entitled to indulge in
 whatever behavior our bodies want us to.
 
 i think we need to keep clear the distinction between homosexual
 _behavior_ (which is wrong) and homosexual _orientation_ (which is not
 a sin, merely a misfortune).
