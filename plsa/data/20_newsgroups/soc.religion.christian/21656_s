 fred gilham asks whether it is true that goedel wrote a version of
 the ontological argument for the existence of god.
 
 yes, it is true. someone has published a rebuttal pointing out
 certain flaws in the argument, and recently professor c anthony
 anderson, of the philosophy department of the university of
 minnesota, has written a revised version of the argument, perhaps
 free of flaws, and at any rate free of the flaws complained of in
 the original version. he has sent me a copy, which i still have (i
 saw it last week when i was looking for something else), and when it
 surfaces again i can supply particulars. my guess is that it is
 being published (or already has been) in the journal of symbolic
 logic.
