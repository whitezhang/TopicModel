 some years ago -- possibly as many as five -- there was a discussion on
 numerology.  (that's where you assign numeric values to letters and then add
 up the letters in words, in an effort to prove something or another.  i can
 never make any sense of how it's supposed to work or what it's supposed to
 prove.)
 
 somebody posted a long article about numerology in the bible, saying
 things like "this proves the intricate planning of the scriptures, else
 these patterns would not appear".
 
 then there was a brilliant followup, which was about numerology in all the
 other numerology posts.  stuff like "the word `numerology' adds up to 28,
 and the word appears 28 times in the posting!  such elegant planning!
 further, the word `truth' also adds up to 28; the writer is using these
 numerological clues to show us that we reach truth via numerology!"
 (these examples are made up by me just as examples.)
 
 i really liked that reply, because it did such an excellent job of showing
 that these patterns can be found in just about anything.  however, i did
 not save a copy of it.  i do not remember the author.  i'm only 90% sure
 that it was posted to this newsgroup.
 
 but, on the off chance that somebody remembers it and saved it, or that the
 author is reading here, i wanted to know if anyone could send me a copy.  (i
 think it should be made into an faq, if we can find it.)
