 jim,
 
 please feel free to correct me and give me some texts.  as far as i can see the
 only text which vaugely relates to jewish evangelism is found in mt. 23:15.
 however since this is found only in mt. it cannot be dated before 90ce which
 makes it unusefull for understanding second temple judaism.
