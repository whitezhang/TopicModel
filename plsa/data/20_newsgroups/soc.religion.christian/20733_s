 the big-bang model supposes a temporal singularity at the point of
 origin. there was _no_ time for a prior cause to occur in. if you
 want to invent fables for the surrounding context, fine, but one fable
 is only as good as any other. why should i prefer to believe in a god that
 _just_ exists, as opposed to a singularity that _just happened_, or 
 giant puce subspace iguanas, that fling universes off their tongues
 like gobs of spit?

 just your opinion, and unfortunately wrong. self assembling molecules
 have already been produced, entirely from inert matter, and have
 spontaneously mutated into a more rapidly assembling form on exposure
 to ultraviolet light. both abiogenesis and the beginnings of evolution,
 today. (saw this in "nature", early last year.)
 
 biological vitalism is dead, and has been dead for many, many years.
 give it up. life is not a 'spark'. life is the self-organization
 of systems poised between chaos and order.

 your king baldly and repeatedly stated he would be back within the lifetime
 of some then present and alive. "soon, soon" he said, over and over - as
 have many would be messiahs.

 [i should have watched this more closely.  we had a discussion about
 the first cause, etc., not long ago.  i'm not up for a replay.
 there was also a detailed discussion of the point max brings up
 here about the initial singularity.  the geometry near the big bang
 is very interesting.  time turns into space, so there is no "before".
