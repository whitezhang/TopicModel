 i differ with our moderator on this.  i thought the whole idea of god coming
 down to earth to live as one of us "subject to sin and death" (as one of
 the consecration prayers in the book of common prayer (1979) puts it) was
 that jesus was tempted, but did not succumb.  if sin is not part of the
 basic definition of humanity, then jesus "fully human" (nicea) would not
 be "subject to sin", but then the resurrection loses some of its meaning,
 because we encounter our humanity most powerfully when we sin.  to distinguish
 between "human" and "fallen human" makes jesus less like one of us at the
 time we need him most.

 first, the monophysites inherited none of nestorius's version -- they 
 were on the opposite end of the spectrum from him.  second, the historical
 record suggests that the positions attributed to nestorius were not as
 extreme as his (successful) opponents (who wrote the conventional history)
 claimed.  mainly nestorius opposed the term theotokos for mary, arguing
 (i think correctly) that a human could not be called mother of god.  i mean,
 in the athanasian creed we talk about the son "uncreate" -- surely even 
 arians would concede that jesus existed long before mary.  anyway, nestorius's
 opponents claimed that by saying mary was not theotokos, that he claimed
 that she only gave birth to the human nature of jesus, which would require
 two seperate and distinct natures.  the argument fails though, because
 mary simply gave birth to jesus, who preexisted her either divinely,
 if you accept "nestorianism" as commonly defined, or both natures intertwined,
 a la chalcedon.
 
 second, i am not sure that "nestorianism" is not a better alternative than
 the orthodox view.  after all, i find it hard to believe that pre-incarnation
 that jesus's human nature was in heaven; likewise post-ascension.  i think
 rather that god came to earth and took our nature upon him.  it was a seperate
 nature, capable of being tempted as in gethsemane (since i believe the divine
 nature could never be tempted) but in its moments of weakness the divine nature
 prevailed.
 
 comments on the above warmly appreciated.

 [there may be differences in what we mean by "subject to sin".  the
 original complaint was from someone who didn't see how we could call
 jesus fully human, because he didn't sin.  i completely agree that
 jesus was subject to temptation.  i simply object to the idea that by
 not succumbing, he is thereby not fully human.  i believe that you do
 not have to sin in order to be human.
 
 i again apologize for confusing nestorianism and monophysitism.  i
 agree with you, and have said elsewhere, that there's reason to think
 that not everyone who is associated with heretical positions was in
 fact heretical.  there are scholars who maintain that nestorius was
 not nestorian.  i have to confess that the first time i read some of
 the correspondence between nestorius and his opponents, i thought he
 got the better of them.
 
 however, most scholars do believe that the work that eventually led to
 chalcedon was an advance, and that nestorius was at the very least
 "rash and dogmatic" (as the editor of "the christological controversy"
 refers to him) in rejecting all approaches other than his own.  as
 regular usenet readers know, narrowness can be just as much an
 impediment as being wrong.  furthermore, he did say some things that i
 think are problematical.  he responds to a rather mild letter from
 cyril with a flame worthy of usenet.  in it he says "to attribute also
 to [the logos], in the name of [the incarnation] the characteristics
 of the flesh that has been conjoined with him ... is, my brother,
 either the work of a mind which truly errs in the fashion of the
 greeks or that of a mind diseased with the insane heresy of arius and
 apollinaris and the others.  those who are thus carried away with the
 idea of this association are bound, because of it, to make the divine
 logos have a part in being fed with milk and participate to some
 degree in growh and stand in need of angelic assistance because of his
 fearfulness ...  these things are taken falsely when they are put off
 on the deity and they become the occasion of just condemnation for us
 who perpetrate the falsehood."
 
 it's all well and good to maintain a proper distinction between
 humanity and divinity.  but the whole concept of incarnation is based
 on exactly the idea that the divine logos does in fact have "to some
 degree" a part in being born, growing up, and dying.  of course it
 must be understood that there's a certain indirectness in the logos'
 participation in these things.  but there must be some sort of
 identification between the divine and human, or we don't have an
 incarnation at all.  nestorius seemed to think in black and white
 terms, and missed the sorts of nuances one needs to deal with this
 area.
 
 you say "i find it hard to believe that pre-incarnation that jesus's
 human nature was in heaven."  i don't think that's required by
 orthodox doctrine.  it's the divine logos that is eternal.
