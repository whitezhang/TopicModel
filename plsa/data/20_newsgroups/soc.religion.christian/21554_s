    the catholic doctrine of predestination does not exclude free will in
 any way.  since god knows everything, he therefore knows everything that
 is going to happen to us.  we have free will, and are able to change
 what happens to us.  however, since god knows everything, he knows all
 the choices we will make "in advance" (god is not subject to time).  too
 often arguments pit predestination against free will.  we believe in
 both.
