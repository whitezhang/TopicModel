 satan was one of god's highest ranking angels, like uriel, raphael,
 michael, and gabriel.  in fact, his name was satanel.  he did challenge
 god's authority and got kicked out of heaven.  a lot of the mythology
 of satan (he lost the -el suffix when he fell) comes from the
 book of enoch and is not found in the bible.
 
 read the book of enoch, available thru bookstores, or get the book
 called "angels: an endangered species" (i think).
