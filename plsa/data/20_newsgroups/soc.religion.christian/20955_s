 well, i think that most christians believe that your conciousness will
 somehow continue on after your 'physical' death, which contradicts what
 most atheists (myself included) believe, namely that your conciousness,
 being contained in your brain, dies when your brain dies.

 i fear the pain that often comes with the process of dying, but since i
 won't be around to worry about it, i don't fear eternal death.

 this is something i've always found confusing.  if all your nerve endings
 die with your physical body, why would flame hurt you?  how can one "wail
 and gnash teeth" with no lungs and no teeth?
