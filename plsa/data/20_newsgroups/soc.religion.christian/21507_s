 let me say that the life, death, and resurrection of jesus christ is
 central to christianity. if you personally believe that jesus christ
 died for you, you are a part of the christian body of believers.
 
 we are all still human. we don't know it all, but homosexual or heterosexual,
 we all strive to follow jesus.  the world is dying and needs to hear about
 jesus christ.
 
 are you working together with other christians to spread the gospel?
