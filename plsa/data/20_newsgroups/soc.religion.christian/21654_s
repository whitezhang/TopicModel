 	okay, i went back and looked:  sure enough, my hunch was right.
 	
 		2 peter was most likely written between 100-120 a.d.
 		
 		revelation was almost certainly written between 80-96 a.d.
 		
 		odds are the gospel of john was written around 90 a.d.
 		
 		best dates for luke and acts are around 80 a.d., maybe later.
 		
 	again, this is from footnoted information in the new american bible,
 	the best translation i've come across in regards to giving complete
 	historical information about each book.

 [of course the folks who you're arguing with almost certainly do
 not accept 2 peter as being pseudonymous.  in that case they'd
 have to date it far earlier than this.  --clh]
