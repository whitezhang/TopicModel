 i don't know if this is the sort of thing you guys like
 to discuss.  i guess it falls into the area of apologetics.
 
 this is a question that seems to pop up now and again in
 conversations with non-christians.  it usually appears in
 the following sort of unqualified statement:
 "well you know that religion has caused more wars than
 anything else"
 it bothers me that i cannot seem to find a satisfactory
 response to this. after all if our religion is all about
 peace and love why have there been so many religious wars?
   personally i am of the view that religion has often been
 used as an excuse to instigate wars often to disguise
 national ambitions but i would love to hear what anyone
 else has to say about this subject.
   thanks in advance

 northern ireland, yugoslavia(?) come immediately to mind)

 [i'm beginning to suspect that the natural condition of humans is
 conflict.  perhaps we should not ask whether a religion or philosophy
 has been involved in any wars -- since they all have -- but whether
 it has stopped any.  --clh]
