 all of the arguments concerning the sabbath ought to make the point
 pretty clear - anyone outside of the catholic or orthodox oranglican or
 monophysite churches ourght to worship on saturday if they are really
 sola scriptura.  otherwise, they are following a law put into effect by
 the church, and only the above chruches really recognize any power of
 the chruch to do so.

 [you will note that nothing in the faq said anything about the church
 establishing or changing a law.  the argument against the sabbath is
 that it is part of the ceremonial law, and like the rest of the
 ceremonial law is not binding on christians.  this argument is based
 on paul's letters, acts, and in a more general sense, jesus'
 teachings.  further, most people argue that scripture shows worship
 occuring on sunday, and paul endorsing it.  i understand that these
 points are disputed, and do not want to go around the dispute one more
 time.  the point i'm making here is not that these arguments are
 right, but that the backing they claim is scripture.
 
 accepting the principle of "sola scriptura" does not commit us to
 obeying the entire jewish law.  acts 15 and paul's letters are quite
 clear on that.  i think even the sda's accept it.  the disagreement is
 on where the bible would have us place the line.
 
 by the way, protestants do give authority to the church, in matters
 that are not dictated by god.  that's why churches are free to
 determine their own liturgies, church polity, etc.  if you accept that
 the sabbath is not binding on christians, then the day of worship
 falls into the category of items on which individual christians or
 (since worship is by its nature a group activity) churches are free to
 decide.
