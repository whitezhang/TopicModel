 hi, you might want to read charismatic chaos by john macarthur.  in it
 he discussed exactly this queation, amongst others.  in my own words,
 very simplified, his position is basically that one must decide, what
 is the most important - experience or scripture?  people tend to say
 scripture, without living according to that.  their own
 feeling/prophecy/etc tends to be put across without testing in the
 light of scripture.
 
 there's a lot more than this, really worthwhile to read whether you're
 charismatic or not.
