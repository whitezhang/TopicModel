 where in the bible is there *any* teaching about an immaterial afterlife?
 i was always taught that both the o.t. jews and the n.t. christians would
 have found the notion incomprehensible--as do i.
 
 don't we christians believe in the resurrection of the body?
 
 or do you mean by material simply the stuff made of the 100+ elements
 that we know and love too much?
