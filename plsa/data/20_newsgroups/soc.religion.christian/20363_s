 the classic references in this area are jacques ellul for a
 liberal/evangelical perspective and os guiness for a straight
 evangelical view.  if you want to look at non-christian sources
 try alvin toffler as the perennial optimist.  his views while
 blatently non christian explore where technology may be going.

 this is regardless of technology.  be careful to separate the issues of
 related to speed and dispersion of technology (how far the letter
 went and how quickly it got there) and the message being passed in the
 technology (something that seems to be totally wrong.)
 
 >how can we help to make best use of computer technology ?
 
 when lecturing in this area i challenge my (non-christan/atheistic) class
 about the impact technology has on life, quality of life and the rights
 that they consider important.  depending on how you work out your
 faith will determine your response to the use of technology.  for example
 friends of mine are considering ivf due to a life threatening situation the
 wife is going through; when it is over they will have the baby. (god
 willing).  in this case the technology is available and my friends have to
 decide what to do.  in all cases though you must decide if the technology
 is against god's revealed word.
