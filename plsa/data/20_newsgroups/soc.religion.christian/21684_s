 a friend of mine managed to get a copy of a computerised greek and hebrew 
 lexicon called "the word perfect" (that is not the word processing 
 package wordperfect). however, some one wiped out the exe file, and she 
 has not been able to restore it. there are no distributors of the package in 
 south africa. i would appreciate it, if some one could email me the file, or 
 at least tell me where i could get it from. 
 
 my email address is
 	fortmann@superbowl.und.ac.za     or
 	fortmann@shrike.und.ac.za
  
 many thanks.
 
 in him, paul fortmann
