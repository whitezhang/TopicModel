 my girlfriend is a smoker. she has been addicted to it for quite some time.
 she has been tried a couple of times, but then always get back to it. her 
 background is non-christian, but she's interested in christianity. i'm a
 christian and non-smoker.
 
 i would like to collect any personal stories from christians who managed to 
 quit. i hope that this will encourage her to keep on trying. if anybody ever 
 had a similar problem or knows a good book on it, pls reply by email. 
 
 i appreciate any kinds of helps. thanks a lot.
