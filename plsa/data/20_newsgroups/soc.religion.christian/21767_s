 there is a contradiction related to the moral issue of polygamy in the
 mormon writings.  in the book in the book of mormon called the book of 
 jacob, joseph smith wrote that it was an abomination to god for 
 david and solomon to have many wives.  later, when joseph smith wrote
 the doctrines and covenants (possibly when polygamy was becoming an
 issue in his personal life) he wrote that it was not an abomination for
 david to have many wives.  how do mormons answer this contradiction?
