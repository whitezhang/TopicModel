 
   i'm concerned about a recent posting about wbt/sil.  i thought they'd
 pretty much been denounced as a right-wing organization involved in
 ideological manipulation and cultural interference, including vietnam
 and south america. a commission from mexican academia denounced them in
 1979 as " a covert political and ideological institution used by the
 u.s. govt as an instrument of control, regulation, penetration, espionage and
 repression."
   my concern is that this group may be seen as acceptable and even
 praiseworthy by readers of soc.religion.christian. it's important that
 christians don't immediately accept every "christian" organization as
 automatically above reproach.
