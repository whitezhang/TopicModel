 so what's your point?  mark's comment still is valid.  to suggest that
 aids is "deserved" is ludicrous.  i sin.  i can resolve to abstain from 
 sin, and do weekly (more often, actually).  yet i routinely fail.
 i surely do deserve what i get, yet god compassionately provided 
 the incarnate logos, jesus, as a rememdy and a way out of our situation.
 if aids is deserved, i surely deserve instant death just as much, as do
 we all, as st. paul so cogently remids us.
 
 to willingly judge "others" as deserving punishment seems to me
 to be the height of arrogance and lack of humility.

 so what's the point here?  i can get aids and never engage in
 "deviant" sexual behavior.  in fact, i could engage in lots
 of deviant sexual behavior with hiv+ people and never be
 infected.  aids is a consequence of particular behaviors,
 many of which are not sexual.  and not all sexual behaviors
 carry the risk of transmission.

 the end of all things is to know, love and serve god, growing
 daily closer through prayer, meditation and discipline.  even so
 i could get aids.  anyone could, unless they remain forever celibate,
 iv-drug-free, and transfusion free.
