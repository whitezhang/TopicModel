 perhaps we have different definitions of absolute then.  to me,
 an absolute is something that is constant across time, culture,
 situations, etc.  true in every instance possible.  do you agree
 with this definition?  i think you do:

 a simple example:
 
 in the new testament (sorry i don't have a bible at work, and can't
 provide a reference), women are instructed to be silent and cover
 their heads in church.  now, this is scripture.  by your definition, 
 this is truth and therefore absolute.  
 
 do women in your church speak?  do they cover their heads?  if all 
 scripture is absolute truth, it seems to me that women speaking in and 
 coming to church with bare heads should be intolerable to evangelicals.  
 yet, clearly, women do speak in evangelical churches and come with bare 
 heads.  (at least this was the case in the evangelical churches i grew 
 up in.)
 
 evangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture 
 to be absolute truth.  (and there are plenty of other examples.)
 can you reconcile this?

 i don't claim that there are *no* absolutes.  i think there are very
 few, though, and determining absolutes is difficult.

 but you are claiming that all of scripture is absolute.  how can you
 determine absolutes derived from scripture when you can't agree how
 to interpret the scripture?  
 
 it's very difficult to see how you can claim something which is based 
 on your own *interpretation* is absolute.  do you deny that your own
 background, education, prejudices, etc. come into play when you read the 
 bible, and determine how to interpret a passsage?  do you deny that 
 you in fact interpret?
