 there is a paragraph in the new testament which in my opinion, clearly makes
 a positive inference to reincarnation. i don't remember which one it is off of
 the top of my head, but it basically goes like this: jesus is talking with the
 apostles and they ask him why the pharisees say that before the messiah can come,
 elijah must first come. jesus replies that elijah has come, but they did not 
 recognize him. it then says that the apostles perceived that he was refering to
 john the baptist. this seems to me to clearly imply reincarnation. can anyone
 offer a reasonable alternative interpretation? i would be very interested to 
 hear it.
