 if that's the only reason, i'd be inclined to doubt whether or not what
 they profess is christianity.  the relationship of faith is based upon
 trust.  fear and trust are generally incompatible.  if my only motivation
 is fear, is there room for trust?  if so, there's room for faith.  
 if fear precludes trust, then there can't be faith.
