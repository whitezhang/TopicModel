 this is not true.  the athiest's position is that there is no proof of the
 existence of god.  as much as some people accept their church, their priests
 or straight from their own scriptures as the "proof", this does not 
 satisfy atheists.
 
 atheists do believe in recognisable authorities.  if they were as dogmatic as
 you claim they are, they would be trying to prove 1 + 1 =2 every time they
 got up.  what they dispute is that churches, priests, scriptures etc.
 represent true authorities and know the truth.

 are you asking us to believe blindly?  you are trying to deny that part of
 us that makes us ask the question "does god exist?" i.e. self-awareness and
 reason.  if we do not use our ability to reason we become as ignorant
 as the other animals on this earth.  does god want us to be like that?
 
 you are right that science and reason cannot prove anything.  however, if
 we do not use them we can only then believe on faith alone.  and since
 we can only use faith, why is one picture of "god" (e.g. hinduism) any less
 valid than another (e.g. christianity)?
