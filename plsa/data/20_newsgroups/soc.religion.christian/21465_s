 i will wimp out and admit that i never liked the metaphor of
 jesus "paying" for our sins in the sense that many christians
 accept as literal. the point is that god understands the suffering
 we go through, not just intellectually like when we watch
 the somalians on tv, but _really_ understands, he can "feel" 
 our pain. this fact is manifested by jesus' life. we can argue
 that someone in history might have suffered more than jesus,
 we can think of more horrible torture than crucifixion, we can
 think of cases of betrayal and fruitless effort leading to
 worse despair, but the main point is that jesus is in the
 trenches with us, he is in everyone, whatever i do to the least
 of humanity i do to him, and whatever i do for the least of
 humanity i do for him.
 
 now, to reconcile this with the existence of hell is beyond my
 capabilities, but that wasn't my goal.

 thankfully our moderator is surprising.

 as i re-read this i must admit that this is more of a description
 of my faith than an explanation, but perhaps that's all
 i can do, hopefully that's all i have to do.
