 oh, that must explain matthew 18:
 
 1) in that hour came the disciples unto jesus, saying, "who then is greatest in
 the kingdom of heaven?"
 2) and he called to him a little child, and set him in the midst of them,
 3) and said, "verily i say unto you, except ye turn, and become as little
 children, ye shall in no wise enter into the kingdom of heaven.
 14) even so it is not the will of your father who is in heaven, that one of these
 little ones should perish.
 
 nice thing about the bible, you don't have to invent a bunch of convoluted
 rationalizations to understand it, unlike your arguments for original sin. face
 it, original sin was thought up long after the bible had been written and has no
 basis from the scriptures.
