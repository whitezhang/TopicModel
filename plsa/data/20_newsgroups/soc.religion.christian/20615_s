 yes, i do agree with your definition.  my use of the term "always" is
 rather deceptive, i admit.

 hold it.  i said that all of scripture is true.  however, discerning
 exactly what jesus, paul and company were trying to say is not always so
 easy.  i don't believe that paul was trying to say that all women should
 behave that way.  rather, he was trying to say that under the circumstances
 at the time, the women he was speaking to would best avoid volubility and
 cover their heads.  this has to do with maintaining a proper witness toward
 others.  remember that any number of relativistic statements can be derived
 from absolutes.  for instance, it is absolutely right for christians to
 strive for peace.  however, this does not rule out trying to maintain world
 peace by resorting to violence on occasion.  (yes, my opinion.)

 sure.  the bible preaches absolute truths.  however, exactly what those
 truths are is sometimes a matter of confusion.  as i said, the bible does
 preach absolute truths.  sometimes those fundamental principles are crystal
 clear (at least to evangelicals).  sometimes they are not so clear to
 everyone (e.g. should baptism be by full immersion or not, etc).  that is
 largely because sometimes, it is not explicitly spelled out whether the writers
 are speaking to a particular culture or to christianity as a whole.  this is 
 where scholarship and the study of biblical contexts comes in.

 god revealed his truths to the world, through his word.  it is utterly 
 unavoidable, however, that some people whill come up with alternate 
 interpretations.  practically anything can be misinterpreted, especially
 when it comes to matters of right and wrong.  care to deny that?
