 didn't paul write that if the resurrection is not true, we are the
 biggest fools of all?  however, whether you believe in christ or not,
 his teachings (e.g. love your brotherman as yourself), even if only 
 followed at a secular level, could do a great deal to alleviate some of 
 the problems we see today in the world.  even when i was a rabid atheist 
 i couldn't deny that.
