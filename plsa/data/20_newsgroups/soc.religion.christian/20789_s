 unfortunately, this isn't true.  on another news group earlier this year,
 someone posted that the king james bible was the divinely inspired version
 of the bible in english and was, therefore, inerrant; all other english
 translations were from satan, trying to deceive the body of christ.  a
 few years ago, the pastor of a church i was attending showed me a poster
 advertising the availability of a certain man to address congregations.
 very prominantly on the poster was the fact that the man used only the kjv.
 the idea that the kjv is the english bible is more prevalent than many
 might think.
