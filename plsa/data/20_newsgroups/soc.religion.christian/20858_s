 jeff fenholt claims to have once been a roadie for black sabbath.
 he was never ever a musician in the band.  he was in st. louis several
 months back.  the poster i saw at the christian bookstore i frequent
 really turned me off.  it was addressed to all "homosexuals, prostitutes,
 drug addicts, alcoholics, and headbangers..." or something like that.
 
 well, if i showed up with my long hair and black leather jacket i
 would have felt a little pre-judged.  as a orthodox christian, and
 a "headbanger" i was slightly insulted at being lumped together with
 drug addicts and alcoholics.  oh yes, i suppose since i drink a good
 german beer now and then that makes me an alcoholic.  not!
