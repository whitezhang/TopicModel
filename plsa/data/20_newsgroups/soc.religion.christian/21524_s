 yes, i suppose that's true.  of course, notice i qualified with nearly
 every language :-).  and there are missionaries out there who can
 speak every imaginable language and dialect.  but then, the fact that
 not all languages have a written gospel lends no credence to the 
 concept of "pentecost" type xenoglossolalia since most tongues occur not
 in these places of un-written language, but rather in churches full
 of people who do have a written language and a bible in that language.
 
 but i nitpick.
