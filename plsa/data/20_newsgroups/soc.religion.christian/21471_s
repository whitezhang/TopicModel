 lets talk about principles. if we accept that god sets the
 standards for what ought to be included in scripture - then we
 can ask:
 1. is it authoritative?
 2. is it prophetic?
 3. is it authentic?
 4. is it dynamic?
 5. is it received, collected, read and used?
 
 on these counts, the apocrapha falls short of the glory of god.
 to quote unger's bible dictionary on the apocrapha:
 1. they abound in historical and geographical inaccuracies and
 anachronisms.
 2. they teach doctrines which are false and foster practices
 which are at variance with sacred scripture.
 3. they resort to literary types and display an artificiality of
 subject matter and styling out of keeping with sacred scripture.
 4. they lack the distinctive elements which give genuine
 scripture their divine character, such as prophetic power and
 poetic and religious feeling.

 but the problem with this argument lies in the assumption that
 the hebrew canon included the apocrapha in the first place, and
 it wasn't until the sixteenth century that luther and co. threw
 them out. the jewish council you mentioned previously didn't
 accept them, so the reformation protestants had good historical
 precedence for their actions. jerome only translated the
 apocrapha under protest, and it was literally 'over his dead
 body' that it was included in the catholic canon.

 how do you then view the words: "i warn everyone who  hears the
 words of the prophecy of this book: if anyone adds anything to
 them, god will add to him the plagues described in this book.
 and if anyone takes away from this book the prophecy, god will
 take away from him his share in the tree of life and in the
 holy city" (rev 22.18-9)
 surely this sets the standard and not just man-made traditions.
 
 it is also noteworthy to consider jesus' attitude. he had no
 argument with the pharisees over any of the ot canon (john
 10.31-6), and explained to his followers on the road to emmaus 
 that in the law, prophets and psalms which referred to him - the 
 ot division of scripture (luke 24.44), as well as in luke 11.51
 taking genesis to chronicles (the jewish order - we would say
 genesis to malachi) as scripture.

 i am not familiar with the book. 
 some other arguments you might like to consider are found in
 chapter 3 of josh mcdowell's evidence that demands a verdict.
