 
      i just thought i'd share a nice experience before my exam today.
 i was walking down the streets on our campus, and a beggar came up and asked
 me for any spare change i might have.  i had a dollar or so that i gave her,
 and - not wanting to give away all my money to strangers (i generally give
 a dollar as that will buy a little food at mcdonalds or something) - i offered
 her some "spiritual gifts," as i called them, rather than gifts of money.
 i talked of how great i felt that god had made such a pretty day, and how
 nice it was to give to people - she then said she was getting married soon.
 she talked about how she and her husband had very little (they may not have
 even had a house, for all i know), but that they felt a very special love in
 the lord, an unselfish kind of caring.  it warmed my heart to know that 2
 people can have so little monetarily, and realize that spiritually they are
 indeed very rich.  a good lesson for all of us who say we want more, more,
 more; what we really need cannot be counted, or sold, or bought.
