 my, my, my.  i knew that i would receive a response to my post, but not
 this extensive.  thank you to all who responded; it at least showed that
 people were willing to think about it, even though the general response was
 a return to the same old "why should it matter?" question.  to those of you
 who were a part of this response, i suggest that you read the articles
 covering this same question in soc.culture.african.american, for you are in
 dire need of some cultural enlightenment.
 
 hasta luego
