 		exactly!!  read that one sentence in there..."to the degree
 	that means other than the death penalty and military operations are
 	sufficient to keep the peace, then these non-violent provisions are to
 	be preferred..."
 
 	i don't believe that it is necessary for us to murder criminals to keep
 	the peace; the church in the united states feels the same way, thus the
 	reason that the catholic church has opposed every execution in this
 	country in recent memory.

 	so what is justifiable?  as you stated very explicitly from the new
 	catechism, the only justifiable case is when it is necessary to keep
 	the peace.  since that does not apply *at all* to this country, the
 	logical conclusion (based on your own premises) is that one must be
 	opposed to *any* form of capital punishment in america.
 
 
 		just my opinions.
