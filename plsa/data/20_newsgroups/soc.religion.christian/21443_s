 the belief that the churches of egypt and syria were (or are) monophysite is 
 false, as is the belief that they often held that the council of chalcedon 
 was nestorian.
 
 these misunderstandings were exacerbated by political factors, and thus led 
 to schism - a schism that is on its way to being healed.
