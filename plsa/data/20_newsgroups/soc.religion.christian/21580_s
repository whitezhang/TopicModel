 i define faith as "belief, in the abscense(sp?) of evidence". i also
 include in "evidence" past experiences. because i have no past experience
 in a god actually having an effect on my life and because i have never
 seen evidence for any god beyond what can be explained without the
 neccessity of a god or which is more convincing than the many fictional
 works i have read (and other reasons), i do not believe in any god(s).
 from what i have seen, some people reconcile this lack of evidence by
 using faith.
 it is faith in that sense (the only way i _currently_ understand the word
 "faith") that i find intellectually dishonest.

 pascal's wager goes something like this:
 premise #1: either there is or there isn't a god.
 premise #2: if god exists, he wants us to believe and will damn us for not
 believing.
 premise #3: if god does not exist, then belief in god doesn't matter
 because death is death, anyway.
 conclusion: belief in god is superior to non-belief because
 non-belief damns us to eternal punishment if we are wrong, while belief in
 god only wastes a little time in life if we are wrong.
 
 sound pretty straightforward and is logically sound. the problem is,
 premise #1 presupposes 1:1 odds between belief and non-belief. this is
 flat out wrong, because of the sheer number of religions out there and the
 fact that, for the most part, the religions are mutually exclusive. i have
 heard theists referred to as "99% atheists" because they believe in their
 god (or gods) to be the _one_ god (or set of gods). the consequence of
 this is "what if i pick the wrong god?" suddenly, the odds don't look so
 good because picking the wrong god or wrong doctrines of a god still
 leaves you with the possibility of being wrong and being damned to another
 god's version of hell.

 i don't see how "disillusionment" enters into it. you see, i presented my
 mother's treatment of me to show the cause of my questioning my atheism, a
 questioning which continues to this day. i had already been an atheist for
 five years before having any contact with my mother's version of
 christianity. if anything, i had become somewhat disillusioned with
 atheism (uh, oh, i thought, what if there *is* a god?). yes, in a way, i
 have also become disillusioned by many religions, simply because i had
 thought at one time that they had all the answers, if i only found the
 right one.
 i'm still looking, but each time i look in a different place, i become a
 little stronger in my attitude (belief, if you will, no faith, though,
 it's based on the evidence of past experience) that i'll never find a
 religion which has all the answers.
 sorta like looking for easter eggs. the more time it takes you to find the
 next one, the more convinced you become that you may already have found
 all the eggs you're going to find.
 someone else mentioned that critisism isn't going to make me think any
 more highly of christians. i have a contrary position: constructive
 critisism will likely improve my attitude towards christians. abusive
 critisism will turn me off.
 no accusations to you, mr. sapienza. i merely slipped that into this post
 because i forgot to reply to that one.
