 i'd be fascinated to see such evidence, please send me your article!
 on the negative side however, i suspect that any such simplistic link
     abstinence-education => decreased pregnancy,
     contraceptive-education => increased pregnancy
 is false.  the us, which i'd guess has one of the largest proportion of 
 "non-liberal" sex education in the western world also has one of the highest
 teenage pregnancy rates.  (please correct me if my guess is wrong.)
