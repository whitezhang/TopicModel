 one rule of thumb is that if a person is making the claim, they are
 wrong.  i was just reading john 14 this morning (i think that is the
 right chapter, anyway it is close and i don't have a bible at work to
 check with.) and in it jesus is talking to his disciples about his
 impending death and he says that he will be going away and then later
 he will be with them.  he said something along the lines of "i will
 be in you and you will be in me."  (again i cannot provide the exact
 quote or citation.)  anyway, my understanding of this is that
 the second coming will not be an outward event.  it is an inward
 event, christ will come to live in our hearts and we will live in him.
 if you look for a person you will be deceived.
 
 it seems to me that the jews had been looking for a messiah that would
 be a political or military leader and so didn't recognize jesus when
 he came.  jesus tried to show that his kingdom was not of this earth.
 a lot of what i have seen written about the second coming seems to
 based on an expectation of christ coming back and finally taking over
 the world and running it the way it should be.  it sounds a lot like
 what the jews were looking for.  the first coming wasn't like that and
 i see no reason for the second coming to be like that either.
 
 oh and by the way, i don't expect it to happen once.  there is no one
 second coming, there are a lot of little ones.  every time christ
 comes into someones heart, christ has come again.
 
 peace,
 will.
