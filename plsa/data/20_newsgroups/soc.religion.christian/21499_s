 this was a popular belief in the judaism of jesus` time, that elijah
 would return again (as he had been taken in to heaven in a chariot and
 did not actually die).  however jesus was referring to john the
 baptist not in the sense that elijah was reincarnated as john
 (remember elijah didn`t die) but that john was a similar prophet to
 elijah.  john was a fiery preacher, he wore sackcloth and wandered
 rough through israel preaching the coming kingdom.  the verses that
 describe him (in mark`s gospel) can be linked to ot references about
 elijah.  hence john was similar to elijah and jesus was drawing the
 parallels between the two just as he drew parallels with the suffering
 servant in isaiah (and other messianic figures) and himself.
 
 a brief reply but i don`t have time to look up all the relevant stuff.
 
 suffice to say there is a very strong explanation.
