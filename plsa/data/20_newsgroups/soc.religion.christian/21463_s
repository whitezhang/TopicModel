 i certainly agree with the last paragraph.  also, jesus;s statements on
 hell can be treated as totally symbolic, allegorical or as parables, as
 was much of his other teaching.  there's more than enough hell here on earth
 that we are freed from by following jesus that the rest just doesn't mattter
 to me.  and the fact that we can be free of the hell here is the best gift
 god offers.  eternal life begins for us now and we do not wait to start
 partaking of the divine nature and journeying on the path to deification.
