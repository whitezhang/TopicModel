 i was surprised when i heard this same kind of remark from a fellow grad. 
 student i know, especially since he had seminary training.  i have read the 
 same essay and do not find lewis making any such claim.  rather, lewis is 
 condemning the use of such coporate prayer efforts as platforms to make 
 political jabs at opponents, feigned as confessions of guilt (ie., lord please 
 forgive us for allowing "insert political issue/idea/platform" to exist in our
 country, it is wrong and we ask your forgiveness.).  i would be interested in
 knowing what part of the essay you feel condemns national repentance (please
 quote).
