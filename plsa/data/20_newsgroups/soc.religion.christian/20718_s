 recovery programs involve meeting people's spiritual needs.
 
 i responded:
  in 12-step programs (like alcoholics anonymous), one of the steps
  involves acknowleding a "higher power".  aa and other 12-step abuse-
  recovery programs are acknowledged as being among the most effective.}

 you are asking me to provide objective proof for the existence of
 god.  i never claimed to be able to do this; in fact i do not believe
 that it is possible to do so.  i consider the existence of god to
 be a premise or assumption that underlies my philosophy of life.
 it comes down to a matter of faith.   if i weren't a christian, i
 would be an agnostic, but i have sufficient subjective evidence to
 justify and sustain my relationship with god.  again this is a matter
 of premises and assumptions.  i assume that there is more to "life, the
 universe and everything" than materialism; ie that spirituality exists.
 this assumption answers the question about why i have apparent spiritual
 needs.  i find this assumption consistent with my subsequent observat-
 ions.  i then find that god fills these spiritual needs.  but i cannot 
 objectively prove the difference between apparent filling of imagined 
 spiritual needs and real filling of real spiritual needs.  nor can i
 prove to another person that _they_ have spiritual needs.
