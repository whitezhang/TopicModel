                survey of new interpretations of arsenokoitai
 
 d.s. bailey
 
      d.s. bailey was perhaps the trailblazer of new assessments of the meaning
 of arsenokoitai.  he takes the term in i cor 6:9 as denoting males who actively
 engage in homosexual acts, in contrast to malakoi ("effeminate"), those who
 engage passively in such acts.*4   however, he insists that paul knew nothing
 of "inversion as an inherited trait, or an inherent condition due to
 psychological or glandular causes, and consequently regards all homosexual
 practice as evidence of perversion" (38).  hence bailey limits the term's
 reference in paul's works to acts alone and laments modern translations of the
 term as "homosexuals."  bailey wants to distinguish between "the homosexual
 *condition* (which is morally neutral) and homosexual *practices*" [italics in
 source].  paul is precise in his terminology and moffatt's translation
 "sodomites" best represents paul's meaning in bailey's judgment (39).  bailey
 clearly denies that the homosexual condition was known by biblical writers.
 
 j. boswell
 
      the most influential study of arsenokoitai among contemporary authors is
 that of john boswell.*5    whereas the usual translation*6  of this term gives
 it either explicitly or implicitly an active sense, boswell gives it a passive
 sense.
 
       in an extended discussion of the term (341-53), he cites "linguistic
 evidence and common sense" to support his conclusion that the word means "male
 sexual agents, i.e. active male prostitutes."  his argument is that the arseno-
 part of the word is adjectival, not the object of the koitai which refers to
 base sexual activity.  hence the term, according to boswell, designates a male
 sexual person or male prostitute.  he acknowledges, however, that most
 interpret the composite term as active, meaning "those who sleep with, make
 their bed with, men."  boswell bases his interpretation on linguistics and the
 historical setting.  he argues that in some compounds, such as paidomathes
 ("child learner"), the paido- is the subject of manthano, and in others, such
 as paidoporos ("through which a child passes"), the paido- is neither subject
 nor object but simply a modifier without verbal significance.  his point is
 that each compound must be individually analyzed for its meaning.  more
 directly, he maintains that compounds with the attic form arreno- employ it
 objectively while those with the hellenistic arseno- use it as an adjective
 (343).  yet he admits exceptions to this distinction regarding arreno-.
 
      boswell next appeals to the latin of the time, namely drauci or exoleti. 
 these were male prostitutes having men or women as their objects.  the greek
 arsenokoitai is the equivalent of the latin drauci;  the corresponding passive
 would be parakoitai ("one who lies beside"), boswell affirms.  he claims that
 arsenokoitai was the "most explicit word available to paul for a male
 prostitute," since by paul's time the attic words pornos ("fornicator") and
 porneuon ("one committing fornication"), found also in the lxx, had been
 adopted "to refer to men who resorted to female prostitutes or simply committed
 fornication."*7
 
      in the absence of the term from pagan writers such as herodotus, plato,
 aristotle, and plutarch, and from the jewish writers philo and josephus,
 boswell finds even more convincing evidence for his affirmation that
 arsenokoitai "did not connote 'homosexual' or even 'sodomite' in the time of
 paul" (346).*8   he also demonstrates its absence in pseudo-lucian, sextus
 empiricus, and libanius.  he subsequently finds it lacking in "all discussions
 of homosexual relation" (346)*9  among christian sources in greek, including
 the didache, tatian, justin martyr, eusebius,*10    clement of alexandria,
 gregory of nyssa, and john chrysostom.  chrysostom is singled out for his
 omission as "final proof" that the word could not mean homosexuality.*11 
 
      boswell next appeals to the omission of the texts of i cor and i tim from
 discussions of homosexuality among latin church fathers (348).*12   cited are
 tertullian, arnobius, lactantius, and augustine.  the last named uses
 "circumlocutions."  other latin writers include ausonius, cyprian, and minucius
 felix.  the term is also lacking in state and in church legislation.  by the
 sixth century the term became confused and was applied to a variety of sexual
 activities from child molesting to anal intercourse between a husband and wife
 (353).
 
      having surveyed the sources, boswell concludes, 
 
    there is no reason to believe that either arsenokoitai or malakoi connoted
    homosexuality in the time of paul or for centuries thereafter, and every
 reason
    to suppose that, whatever they came to mean, they were not determinative of
    christian opinion on the morality of homosexual acts (353).
 
 it is clear throughout that boswell defines arsenokoitai to refer to male
 prostitutes.  he even goes so far as to conclude that paul would probably not
 disapprove of "gay inclination,"  "gay relationships,"  "enduring love between
 persons of the same gender," or "same-sex eroticism"  (112, 166-17).

 6.  several tranlation of i tim 1:10 are:  kjv, "them that defile themselves
 with mankind";  asv,  "abusers of themselves with men";  nasb,  "homosexuals";
 rsv, nkjv, nrsv, "sodomites";  neb, niv, "perverts"; gnb, "sexual perverts"; in
 i cor 6:9 these occur:  kjv, "abusers of themselves with mankind"; asv,
 "abusers of themselves with men";  nasb, rsv, "homosexuals"; nkjv, "sodomites";
  neb, "homosexual persversion."  the rsv and neb derive their translation from
 two greek words, malakoi and arsenokoitai which gbn has as "homosexual
 perverts."  nrsv has the two words as "male prostitutes" in the text, and
 "sodomites" in the footnote.  the active idea predominates among the
 commentators as well;  it is the primary assumption.
 7.  boswell, christianity 344.  yet this was no a word "available to paul for a
 male prostitute," for it does not occur at all in any literature prior to paul
 (as a serach in the thesaurus linguae graecae using ibycuc confirms).  if paul
 coined the term, it would have no prior history, and all such discussion about
 its lack of usage in contemporary non-christian and christian literature is
 meaningless.
 8.  again this would be expected if paul coined the word.
 9.  the key phrase here apparently is "discussoin," for boswell admits later
 (350 n.42) that it occurs in quotes of paul but there is no discussion in the
 context.  hence the implication is that we cannot tell what these writer
 (polycarp "to the philippian 5:3"; theophilus "ad autolycum 1.2, 2.14";nilus
 "epistularum libri quattuor 2.282";  cyril of alexandria "homiliae diversae
 14"; "sybilline oravle 2.13") meant.  yet polycarp, who was a disiple of hohn
 the apostle and died about a.d. 155, argues in the context that young men
 should be pure.  he uses only the three terms pornoi, malakoi, and arsenokoitai
 from paul's list.  this at least makes boswell's use of "all" subjective. 
 apparently clement of alexandria "paedogogus 3.11"; sromata 3.18"; also belong
 here.
 
 10..  yet eusebius uses it in "demonstraionis evangelicae 1."
 11.  either boswell is misrepresenting the facts about chrysostom's use of
 arsenokoitai and its form (about 20) in the vice lists of i cor 6 or i tim 1,
 or he is begging the question by denying that the word can mean homosexual when
 chrysostom uses it.  yet the meaning of arsenokoitai is the goal of his and our
 study, whether in the lists or other discussions.  boswell later admits (351)
 that chrysostom uses the almost identicl form arsenokoitos in his commentary on
 i cor.  although boswell suggests that the passage is strange, it may be that
 paul is seeking to make a refinement in arsenokoitai.  
 12.  apparently jerome is a significant omission here, since he renders
 arsenokoitai as "masculorum concubitores," corresponding "almost exactly to the
 greek" (348 n.36).
