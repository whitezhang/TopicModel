 hello,
 
 i'm writing a paper on the role of the catholic church in poland after 1989. 
 can anyone tell me more about this, or fill me in on recent books/articles(
 in english, german or french). most important for me is the role of the 
 church concerning the abortion-law, religious education at schools,
 birth-control and the relation church-state(government). thanx,
 
                                                  masja,
