 
   here's how i talk to non-christians who are complaining about hell.
 
 me:	"do you believe you're going to heaven?"
 him:	"i don't believe in heaven."
 me:	"so are you going there?"
 him:	"if there was a heaven, i would."
 me:	"but since there isn't a heaven, you're not going there, are you?"
 him:	"no."
 
   the point is that heaven is based on faith--if you don't believe in heaven,
 there's no way you're going to be in it.
   of course, the next step is, "i don't believe in hell either, so why will i
 be there?"  it seems to me that hell is eternal death and seperation from god.
 most atheists do believe that when they die they will die forever, and never
 see god--so they do, in fact, believe that they're going to hell.
   hell doesn't have to be worse than earth to be hell--because it's eternal, 
 and it's a lot worse than heaven.  that's the only comparison that matters.
