 some variant is quite popular.  this, and other arguments, are
 discussed in john leslie mackie's "the miracle of theism: arguments
 for and against the existence of god".  although mackie ultimately
 sides with "against", his arguments are, i think, quite fair to both
 sides.  brief discussions can be found in the alt.atheism faqs.
