 a priest i know gave me an interesting explanation.  he said that the
 words of mary point not to doubt or troubled thoughts, but rather to
 complete humbleness.  those who are humble and do not revel in
 themselves frequently are confused when given high praise about
 themselves, as mary would rightly be.
