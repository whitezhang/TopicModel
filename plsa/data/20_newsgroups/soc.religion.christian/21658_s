 what is the proper way to dispose of old blessed palms?
 i`ve have a bunch that i`ve been holding onto.  in addition,
 my mom has been giving me her's.  i used to give them to my
 uncle who would burn them (and leave the ashes to seep into the
 ground).  should i do the same?  could i just bury them?  could
 i add them to my compost bin?
 
 thanks in advance.
