 the last sentence is ironic, since so many readers of
 soc.religion.christian seem to not be embarrassed by apologists such as
 josh mcdowell and c.s. lewis. the above also expresses a rather odd sense
 of history. what makes you think the masses in aquinas' day, who were
 mostly illiterate, knew any more about rhetoric and logic than most people
 today? if writings from the period seem elevated consider that only the
 cream of the crop, so to speak, could read and write. if everyone in
 the medieval period "knew the rules" it was a matter of uncritically
 accepting what they were told.

 [this may be unfair to lewis.  the most prominent fallacy attributed
 to him is the "liar, lunatic, and lord".  as quoted by many
 christians, this is a logical fallacy.  in its original context, it
 was not.  --clh]
