 pardon me if this is the wrong newsgroup.  i would describe myself as
 an agnostic, in so far as i'm sure there is no single, universal
 supreme being, but if there is one and it is just, we will surely be
 judged on whether we lived good lives, striving to achieve that
 goodness that is within the power of each of us.  now, the
 complication is that one of my best friends has become very
 fundamentalist.  that would normally be a non-issue with me, but he
 feels it is his responsibility to proselytize me (which i guess it is,
 according to his faith).  this is a great strain to our friendship.  i
 would have no problem if the subject didn't come up, but when it does,
 the discussion quickly begins to offend both of us: he is offended
 because i call into question his bedrock beliefs; i am offended by
 what i feel is a subscription to superstition, rationalized by such
 circular arguments as 'the bible is god's word because he tells us in
 the bible that it is so.'  so my question is, how can i convince him
 that this is a subject better left undiscussed, so we can preserve
 what is (in all areas other than religious beliefs) a great
 friendship?  how do i convince him that i am 'beyond saving' so he
 won't try?  thanks for any advice.
