 j.n. darby was one of the founders of the "plymouth brethren" and an
 early supporter of dispensationalism.  f.f. bruce highly approved
 of his translation.  he also translated the bible into several other
 languages.

 this was from the same fellow who did young's concordance, which was
 a standard reference work, similar to strong's concordance.

 i believe that these just follow standard reference works.

 some are by larry pierce ("brethren"), some are by baptists, and i
 think that thompson (of chain reference fame) was presbyterian)

 another standard reference work that has been around for decades.
 a new version was just released and is available through christian
 book distributers.

 c.i. scofield was the creator of the scofield reference bible.  for many
 people (but not me), this is the study bible.  the notes are strongly
 dispensational.

 these are probably the most accurate strong's numbers available.
