 it can doubtless be taken that jael's slaying of sisera was a type
 of mary's victory over sin. but even if we take deborah's words as
 applying prophetically or symbolically to mary, they must still be
 applicable literally to jael.  we may well take them to mean that
 god used her as a part of his plan for the deliverance of his
 people, and that she has this in common with mary.  but we have no
 reason to suppose that they mean that she was sinless, and thus no
 reason to take the like expression applied to mary as proof that she
 was sinless.
