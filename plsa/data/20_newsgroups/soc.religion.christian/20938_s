 i find it interesting that cls never answered any of the questions posed. 
 then he goes on the make statements which make me shudder.  he has
 established a two-tiered god.  one set of rules for the jews (his people)
 and another set for the saved gentiles (his people).  why would god
 discriminate?  does the jew who accepts jesus now have to live under the
 gentile rules.
 
 god has one set of rules for all his people.  paul was never against the
 law.  in fact he says repeatedly that faith establishes rather that annuls
 the law.  paul's point is germane to both jews and greeks.  the law can
 never be used as an instrument of salvation.  and please do not combine
 the ceremonial and moral laws in one.
 
 in matt 5:14-19 christ plainly says what he came to do and you say he was
 only saying that for the jews's benefit.  your christ must be a
 politician, speaking from both sides of his mouth.  as paul said, "i have
 not so learned christ."  forget all the theology, just do what jesus says.
  your excuses will not hold up in a court of law on earth, far less in
 god's judgement hall.
