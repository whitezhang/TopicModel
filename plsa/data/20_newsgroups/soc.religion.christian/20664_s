 at the end of a recent (mon 19 apr 1993) post, alastair thomson
 offers the following "paraphrase" of john 3:16:
 
    "god loved the world so much, that he gave us his son,
    to die in our place, so that we may have eternal life."
 
 the "to die in our place" bothers me, since it inserts into the
 verse a doctrine not found in the original. moreover, i suspect that
 the poster intends to affirm, not merely substitution, but forensic
 (or penal) substitution.  i maintain that the scriptures in speaking
 of the atonement teach a doctrine of substitution, but not one of
 forensic substitution.
 
 those interested in pursuing the matter are invited to send for my
 essays on genesis, either 4 thru 7 (on this question) or 1 through 7
 (with lead-in).  the n'th essay can be obtained by sending to
 listserv@asuacad.bitnet or to listserv@asuvm.inre.asu.edu the
 message
