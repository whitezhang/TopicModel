 i have stated before that i do not consider myself an atheist, but 
 definitely do not believe in the christian god.  the recent discussion
 about atheists and hell, combined with a post to another group (to the
 effect of 'you will all go to hell') has me interested in the consensus 
 as to how a god might judge men.  as a catholic, i was told that a jew,
 buddhist, etc. might go to heaven, but obviously some people do not
 believe this.  even more see atheists and pagans (i assume i would be 
 lumped into this category) to be hellbound.  i know you believe only
 god can judge, and i do not ask you to, just for your opinions.
 
 thanks,
