 somewhere, someone told me that satan was the angel in charge of
 music in heaven, and on top of that, he was the most beautiful
 of the angels.  isn't it funny that these days how mtv has become
 the "bible" of music and beauty these days.  mtv controls what bands
 are popular, no matter how bad they are.  in fact, it is better to
 be politically correct - like u2, madonna - than to have any
 musical talent.  then of course, you have this television station
 that tells us all how to dress.  think about it, who started the
 retro-fashion craze??  mtv and madonna.  gag.
 
 anyway, just food for thought.  it is really my own wierd theory.
 
 if revelation was to come true today, i think mtv would the "ever
 changing waters" (music and fashion world) that the beast would
 arise from, and madonna will be the whore of babylon, riding the
 beast and drinking the blood of the martyrs.
 
 hmmmm....great idea for a book/movie.....
