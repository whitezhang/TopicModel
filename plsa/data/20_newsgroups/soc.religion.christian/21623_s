 (i presume you are quoting john 3:3-7.)
 
 1.  my king james bible says "except a man be born of water 
 and of the spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of god" 
 (john 3:5).  (here "man" == "adult").
 (however, this could be a quibble between translations.)
 
 2.  we can also analyze to whom the lord is addressing:
 "marvel not that i said unto thee, ye must be born again"
 (john 3:7).  here jesus is clearly directing his remarks
 to nicodemus -- a ruler of the jews (not a child).
 
 3.  we can ask ourselves why the lord would even 
 introduce the concept of spiritual re-birth through
 baptism if newborn babies weren't free from sin?

 [yup, in john 3:5 "man" is not in the original.  a better translation
 is "no one can enter...", as in nrsv.  of course in 3:7, jesus is
 addressing the person who came to him.  there are other places in the
 nt where he deals with children.  they've been mentioned in other
 postings.  --clh]
