 a section of richard badenas' book, "christ the end of the law, romans 10.14 
 in pauline perspective."  the section i have is on the contextual setting and 
 meaning of romans 9-11.  in addition, there are 111 endnotes.
 
 since the file is so long, and because of other reasons, i will take requests
 for the article personally.
 
 of course, i believe badenas' insights to be true, and, quite damaging to the
 traditional augustinian/calvinist view.
