 i agree.  god makes the husband the head of the house.  but he surely
 can't do it alone.  he needs the help of his beloved wife whom the
 lord gave him.
 
 at least that's how it is in my house.  i thank god for the beautiful
 woman he has brought into my life.  i couldn't lead without the help
 of my wonderful wife.
