 
 	often times (most recently on this list in the last few days) i've
 heard the passage from revelation:
 
 	"...whoever adds to the sacred words of this book...whoever removes
 	 words from this book..."    
 
 	 used as an arguement against the deutercanonical books.
 
 	 i feel this is ridiculous for two reasons:
 
 	 1.  they weren't added later by the catholic church; they were
 		*always* part of what was considered inspired scripture.
 		(this has been dealt with in previous postings...no reason
 		to repeat the info.)
 
 	2.  it is more likely than not that when st. john (or whomever) wrote
 		the book of revelation what was then considered scripture was
 		** not ** the same thing you and i are holding in our hands!
 
 	if one takes the translation of "this book" in rev 18:22 (or somewhere
 	around there) to mean "all of scripture", then all of us are likely
 	holding something that is in violation of this command.
 
 	it is impossible to exactly date the scriptures, even the n.t. ones
 	(they didn't like to date their letters, i guess).  i really wish i
 	had my bible with me right now to get the facts straight, but i believe
 	that several of the n.t. letters, chief among them 2 peter, have their
 	most likely date of composition in the early second century a.d.
 		revelation was almost certainly written durin the reign of 
 	domition (sp?), a.d. 80-96.  thus it could be argues that we are all
 	in sin if we accept 2 peter as scripture, since it was "added" to the
 	book after the composition of revelation, when we are told to add 
 	nothing more.
 
 	if you want to get the exact dates, get a copy of the new american
 	bible.  i'll try to follow this up tomorrow if i remember.
