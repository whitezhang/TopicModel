 the answer to both questions is yes.
 
 all scripture is true, being inspired by god.  the evidence for this
 claim has been discussed ad nauseum in this group.
 
 similarly, all truth is absolute.  indeed, a non-absolute truth is a 
 contradiction in terms.  when is something absolute?  when it is always
 true.  obviously, if a "truth" is not always "true" then we have a
 contradiction in terms.  
 
 many people claim that there are no absolutes in the world.  such a
 statement is terribly self-contradictory.  let me put it to you this
 way.  if there are no absolutes, shouldn't we conclude that the statement,
 "there are no absolutes" is not absolutely true?  obviously, we have a
 contradiction here.
 
 this is just one of the reasons why christians defy the world by claiming
 that there are indeed absolutes in the universe.

 so?  people sometimes disagree about what is true.  this does not negate
 the fact, however, that there are still absolutes in the universe.  moreover,
 evangelical christianity, at least, still professes to believe in certain
 truths.  man is sinful, man needs salvation, and jesus is the propitiation
 for mankind's sins, to name a few.  any group that does not profess to
 believe these statements cannot be accurately called evangelical.
