 i don't know either.  truth be known, so little is known of angels
 to even guess.  all we really know is that angels always speak in
 the nativ tongue of the person they're talking to, so perhaps they
 don't have any language of their own.

 well, we are told to test the spirits.  while you could do this
 scripturally, to see if someones claims are backed by the bible,
 i see nothing wrong with making sure that that guy lazarus really
 was dead and now he's alive.

 it's a common fallacy you commit.  the non-falsifiability trick.  how
 can i prove it when not all the evidence may be seen?  answer:  i
 can't.  the fallacy is in assuming that it is up to me to prove 
 anything.  
 
 when i say it has never been proven, i'm talking about the ones
 making the claims, not the skeptics, who are doing the proving.
 
 the burden of proof rest with the claimant.  unfortunately, 
 (pontification warning) our legal system seems to be headed in
 the dangerous realm of making people prove their innocence (end
 pontification).
 
 but truthfully, corinthians was so poorly written (or maybe just
 so poorly translated into english) that much remains unknown
 about just what paul really intended (despite claims of hard
 proof one way or another).  some will see his writings in
 1 cor 12-14 as saying don't do this don't do this and using
 sarcasm, metaphor, etc. while yet others take what he says literally
 sarcasms and metaphors notwithstanding.
 
 me?  when i read 1 cor 14 about praying/speaking in tongues regarding
 building oneself/the church, i see him using compare/contrast,
 saying do this because it build the church, while doing this
 builds onself (implying don't do that).  it's a common usage
 of writing that we all employ, and it is easily seen how it
 could be interpreted this way.  why some do and some don't is
 a mystery.
