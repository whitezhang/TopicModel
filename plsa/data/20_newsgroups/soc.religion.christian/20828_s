 greetings,
 
 probably a tired old horse, but...  maybe with a slightly different
 twist.  i wanted to know if there are any good english-language texts
 for learning ancient hebrew, and how these compare with german
 educational texts qualitywise, if anybody has an idea.  i can't figure
 out if i should buy one here for later study or wait until i get back to
 the u.s.
 
 something i find interesting about studying theology in germany is the
 fact that the students get their ancient language-learning out of the
 way early [i'm not a theology student, but i spend a lot of time with
 such folks] in their careers.  they take the first two years or so to just
 do greek and latin and hebrew [possibly aramaic, too--who knows].
 what's it like at divinity schools or seminaries in the states?  is
 there a lot of language instruction done?  i really don't have a basis
 for comparison.
 
 regards, phil

 [for better of worse, we don't have the tradition of classical
 education in the u.s., so generally if a seminary believes students
 should know greek, they have to teach it.  it's common for seminaries
 to require at least a semester each of hebrew and greek, though of
 course more is required for serious scholarship.  --clh]
