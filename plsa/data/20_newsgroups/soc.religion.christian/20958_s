 [deletia- and so on]
 
 i seem to have been rather unclear.
 
 what i was asking is this:
 
 please show me that the most effective substance-absure recovery
 programs involve meetinsg peoples' spiritual needs, rather than
 merely attempting to fill peoples' spiritual needs as percieved
 by the people, a.a, s.r.c. regulars, or snoopy. this will probably
 involve defining "spritual needs" (is it not that clear) and
 showing that such things exist and how they can be filled.
 
 annother tack you might take is to say that "fulfilling spiritual
 needs" means "acknowledging a "higher power" of some sort, then
 show that systems that do require this, work better than otherwise
 identical systems that do not. a correlation here would help you,
 but as you point out this might just be demonstrating swapping
 one crutch for annother. (however, i do feel that religion is
 usually a better crutch than alchohol, as it is not usually
 poisonous! :) )
 
 i hope with that clarification, my question will be answerable. i actually
 did know about the 12 step program, its the question of what it does,
 rather than what it tries to do, that makes a difference to me.
