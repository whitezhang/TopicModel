 in a short poem ("god in his mercy made / the fixed pains of hell"),
 c. s. lewis expresses an idea that i'm sure was current among others,
 but i haven't be able to find its source:
 
 that even hell is an expression of mercy, because god limits the amount
 of separation from him, and hence the amount of agony, that one can
 achieve.
