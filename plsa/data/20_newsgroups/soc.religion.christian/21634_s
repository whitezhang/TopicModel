 are you sure you want to include chalcedon here?  i presume that you 
 mean the description of jesus as fully human and fully devine.  almost 
 everyone would consider the majority of copts and armenians, and the 
 jacobites, as christians, yet for 15 centuries it has been maintained 
 that they disagree with the formula of chalcedon.  those that wouldn't 
 consider them christians are most likely to object that these communities 
 don't require a personal commitment to jesus, which is only tangentially 
 related to the formula of chalcedon.

 [as i understand the recent discussion here, the copts for all
 practical purposes accept chalcedon.  they talk about one nature
 rather than two, but the issue seems to be one of terminology rather
 than substance.  --clh]
