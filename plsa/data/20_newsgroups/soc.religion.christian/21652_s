 hi frank:
 
 i've read it a couple of times and i think that it is excellent.
 christiandom has needed this book for some time now. i suggest that
 *every* christian read it.
 
 according to hank, they printed 15 times more than harvest house
 usually prints for the first printing, and it still sold out in
 the first week. it is in it's second printing, and most christian
 book stores have waiting lists. you can order it directly from cri
 at 1-800-443-9797.
