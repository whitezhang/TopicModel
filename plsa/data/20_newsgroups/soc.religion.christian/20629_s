 i may be interesting to see some brief selections posted to the net.
 my understanding is that sspx does not consider itself in schism
 or legitimately excommunicated.  but that's really beside the point.
 what does the roman catholic church say?  excommunication can be
 real apart from formal excommunication, as provided for in canon law.
 
 after all we orthodox don't cinsider ourselves schismatic or
 excommunicated.  but the catholic church considers us dissident.
 
 if this is inappropriate for this group or beyond the charter,
 i'm sure ofm will let us know.

 [i think it's within the charter.  whether this is actually the best
 group in which to discuss it is up to the people concerned.  i am not
 interested in having this reinvoke the general catholic/protestant
 polemics, but i don't see why it should -- the issue is primarily one
 specific to catholics.  --clh]
