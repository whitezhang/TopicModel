 subject pretty much says it all - i'm looking for johnny hart's (creator
 of the b.c. comic stip) mailing address.
 
 for those of you who haven't seen them, take a look at his strips for good
 friday and easter sunday.  remarkable witness!
 
 if anyone can help me get in touch with him, i'd really appreciate it! 
 i've contacted the paper that carries his strip and -- they'll get back to
 me with it!
 
 thanks for your help,
