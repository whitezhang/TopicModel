 i no longer have the textbook, but abstinence was defined as something
 like "no contact between the penis and the vagina, vulva, or area 
 immediately surrounding the vulva, and no transfer of semen to the
 vagina, vulva, or area surrounding the vulva".  
 
 that is, abstinence wasn't discussed as "sex outside of marriage is
 morally wrong" but as keep  the sperm away from the ovum and conception 
 is impossible. the moral question i recall the teacher asking was,
 "is it okay to create a child if you aren't able to be a good parent
 yet?"
