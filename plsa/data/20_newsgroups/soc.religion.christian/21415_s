 interesting question, esp since i remember *wishing* with all
 my heart that this *were* true so that i wouldn't have to be a 
 "good christian" anymore.  "christianity" was terribly hard, the
 only reward was heaven and (maybe, sometimes, if i was really
 good) acceptance; i wanted a way out.

 what jesus has done for me since i found him (some 6 months ago) 
 i do not want to lose.  period.  
 
 that said, i originally interpreted the what-if as "if christ
 never mentioned sheol and weeping and gnashing of teeth, if
 christ preached that those who did not follow him died and stayed
 dead and at that point forever ceased to exist...."

 i believe that we can only be complete through christ. 
 do you think that buddhists can also be complete?
