 you've missed on very important passage.
 
 2 thess. 1:6-10
  for after all it is only just for god to repay with affliction those who
 afflict you, and to give relief to you who are afflicted and to us as well when
 the lord jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming
 fire, dealing out retribution to those who do not know god and to those who do
 not obey the gospel of our lord jesus. and these will pay the penalty of
 eternal destruction, away from the presence of the lord and from the glory of
 his power, when he comes to be glorified in his saints on that day, and to be
 marveled at among all who have believed-- for our testimony to you was
 believed.
 
 things to note from this passage.  unbelievers are both those who openly reject
 the gospel, and those who do not know god.  the eternal destruction is the same
 as the eternal hope in 2:16.  this distructions primarily emphasize that it is
 separation from the presence of god.  the context is speaking of the 2nd advent
 while 2:1 is speaking of the rapture.  don't confuse the two.

 yet we have a far greater discription of hell that we do heaven.
 
  for instance,

 if this was like earthly fire that requires a gas producing substance to
 ignite.
 however, there seems to be a different type of fire as expressed in the burning
 bush that was not consumed.  also, the daniel acct. shows that the laws of
 nature can be interupted even with earthly fire.
 
 >it is not stated what occurs when at the judgement,
 >the unbelievers, (who are already physically dead) are cast into hell
 
 maybe you don't understand.  there will be those who are alive at the end of
 the millenium, who will walk straight into the gwtj.  even those who have died
 in their sin will be resurrected, i.e. reunited with their physical body, to
 receive condemnation.
 
 >i.e. they no longer have a physical body so they can't feel physical pain.
 
 this is contrary to the teaching of scripture.

 this is conjecture at best if you are using it to support the "no physical
 body" thesis.

 the true awlfulness of hell, is that it is eternal separation from god, after
 having seen the glory of his presence at the gwtj.  but whether it was open
 rebellion against the revealed gospel of christ or if it is not having known
 god (not saught him as he is), then as paul says, they are without excuss and
 that every mouth will be stopped.  there will be no defense at the judgment
 seat of god. therefore we understand "it is appointed unto man once to die, and
 then comes judgment" literally.  
 
 just because it is horrific, doesn't make it less of a reality.  
 it should compel those of us who have the riches of christ to share it with
 others
