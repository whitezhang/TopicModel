 jayne stands in pretty good company.  c.s. lewis wrote a whole book
 promoting the idea contained in her first sentence quoted above.  it is
 called "the final divorce".  excellent book on the subject of heaven and

 beseeched to enter heaven, but reject the offer because being with god in
 heaven means giving up their false pride.
