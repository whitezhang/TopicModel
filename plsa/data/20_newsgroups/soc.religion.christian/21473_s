 it sounds like she has a problem.  she has a problem opening up to her
 husband so she is lesbian.  what? in a marrige, a couple is supposed
 to open up to each other.  because she didn't feel comfortable opening
 up to her husband she gets a divorce and comes to the conclusion that
 she is lesbian.  before anyone gets maried they should make sure that
 they would feel comfortable "open up the deepest part of her soul to
 her husband".  "sex, in her mind, is only a part of the whole
 relationship."  did she think it was diffrent with a man. that might
 be her problem.
