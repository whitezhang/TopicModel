 on sunday 9 may 1993, kenneth engel writes (in substance):
 
   we are told that the penalty for sin is an eternity in hell.
   we are told that jesus paid the penalty, suffering in our stead.
   but jesus did not spend an eternity in hell.
 
 this objection presupposes the "forensic substitution" theory of the
 atonement. not everyone who believes in the atonement understands it
 in those terms. for an expansion of this statement, send the
 messages
    get gen04 ruff
    get gen05 ruff
    get gen06 ruff
    get gen07 ruff
   to listserv@asuacad.bitnet or to listserv@asuvm.inre.asu.edu
 
 note that the character after the "gen" is a zero. if you want to
 read my opun from the beginning, start with gen01.
