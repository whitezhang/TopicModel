 imho this are going from bad to worse. 3-in-1, 1-in-3 was bad enough.
  
 i do not like a god who prays to himself.  i refuse to believe jesus prayed
 to himself  --   let's get real, if the scriptures say he prayed to the
 father, then the father is someone different than the son.  i have no
 problems with multiple gods.  to me, the whole context of the scriptures
 says:  be perfect, even as your father who is in heaven; that we can be
 co-heirs with christ; that we will be like him.
  
 co-heirs share all things equally--including knowledge, power, dominion etc.
 when i am like him (christ), i will be the same as he is--and he is a god.
  
 if god cannot do this, the his is not all powerful--and he is not god.
 if he will not, he is a liar--and he is not god.
  
 but if he does, he is the greatest of all the gods.
  
 
 [i don't know of anyone who says that jesus prayed to himself.  the
 whole point of the trinity is that there's enough of a distinction
 within god that relationship is possible.  this implies some sort of
 communication.  i assume that in their "native" form, the father and
 son are directly enough connected that prayer in our sense isn't
 involved.  but jesus is the incarnation of the son, i.e.  the logos
 made flesh.  when he's in a human form, his human actions are limited
 to human capabilities.  so communication with the father takes the
 form of prayer.  i don't see that there's anything problematical about
 that.  it seems to be implicit in the whole idea of incarnation.
