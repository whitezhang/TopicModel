 i was wondering if anyone knew any changes to the temple
 ceremony within the last fifty years....
 also, why do you think they were made (revelation, 
 assimilation to mainstream christianity, etc.)?
 i know that the god makers was published quite a while
 ago.  could rituals have been changed since then?
 
 i am also very interested in the influence of freemasonry
 on early mormonism, especially in the smith family and 
 in the nauvoo settlement.  info on any new studies would 
 be appreciated.
 
 thanks,
