    i don't think joe was saying any such thing.  however, your question
 on "asking jesus to come into your heart" seems to imply that infants
 are not allowed to have christ in theirs.  why must baptism always be
 viewed by some people as a sort of "prodigal son" type of thing; i.e. a
 sudden change of heart, going from not accepting christ to suddenly
 accepting christ?  why can't people start out with christ from shortly
 after birth, and build their relationship from there?  after all, does
 a man suddenly meet a woman, and then marry her that same day?  from my
 experiences, i've learned that all relationships must be built,
 including one's relationship with god.
 
    also joe is speaking from the standpoint that baptism is not just a
 ritual, but that through it god bestows sacramental grace upon the
 recipient.  certainly for those with the mental faculties to know christ
 it is necessary to believe in him.  however, the sacrament itself
 bestows grace on the recipient, and makes a permanent mark of adoption
 into god's family on the soul.
