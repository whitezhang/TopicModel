 oh, but they definitely can be.  please look at colossians 3:5-10 and
 ephesians 4:25-27.  emotions can be controlled and god puts very strong
 emphasis on self-control, otherwise, why would he have paul write to
 timothy so much about making sure to teach self-control?

 please, re-think and re-read for yourself, joe.  again, the issue is
 self-control especially over feelings and actions, for our actions stem
 from our feelings in many instances.  as for god giving in to his anger,
 that comes very soon.
