 i guess there are at least some people who are not able to support
 this claim. there are still a lot of languages without the bible, or a
 part of the bible. there are still many languages which we are not
 able to write, simply because the written version of the language has
 not yet been defined!
 
 i guess this is one of the main goals for wycliffe bible translators:
 to define rules and a grammar for writing the 'rest' of the languages
 of this world. i do not see that any of them will have any reason to
 become unemployed during the foreseeable future. (provided they get
 their neccessary support!) and still they are one of the 3 largest
 missionary organizations of the world.
