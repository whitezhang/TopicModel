 after reading this story about st. maria goretti (posted two weeks
 ago), i am a bit confused.  while it is clear that her daily
 life is one of probity and sanctity, i am afraid i don't quite
 understand the final episode of her life.  i am reading it 
 correctly, she (and the church apparently) felt that being raped
 was a sin on _her_ part, one so perfidious that she would rather
 die than commit it.  if this is the case i'm afraid that i 
 disagree rather strongly.
 
 can anyone out there explain this one to me?
 
 yours in christ,
 
 david cruz-uribe, sfo
