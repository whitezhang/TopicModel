 your very starting point is wrong.  christianity is not based on following
 a moral standard.  "for it is by grace you have been saved, through faith...
 not by works so that no man may boast."  (eph. 2:7-8)  you say that
 you know the bible well, and can recognize (do you mean recite?) many
 passages from memory.  that could very well be so.  however, it looks like
 there are a few more passages that you should pay attention to.  (titus 3:5
 and james 2:10 are among them.)
 
 obedience to the moral law is imporant.  however, it is supposed to be the
 result of turning your life over to christ and becoming a christian.  it is
 by no means the starting point.
