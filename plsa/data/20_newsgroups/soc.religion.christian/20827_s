       ?huh? okay, so i'm not eric molas, but even if that _is_ how he
 feels about life, i disagree with it.
 
       life, to me, is definitely not meaningless; it has precisely the
 purpose and meaning i choose to give it. i go on living because i _like_
 living; if i needed any further reason, i'd be free - completely free! -
 to pick any reason that suited me. that freedom can be almost
 intoxicating; it's probably the closest i've ever been to a 'religious'
 experience. i'm *very* glad i am an atheist; i wouldn't be anything
 else.

       not unless, in explaining your own subjective experience, you also
 try to convert him or proselytize. merely explaining the effects you
 personally experience religion as having on you, is not "infectious".
 not unless eric is paranoid, that is. ;->

       whatever floats your goat. you sound happy enough; that's fairly
 much all that matters, right?

       erh... pardon, but it strikes me that sentence sounds reversible.

       "empty spot"? "god-shaped hole"? i hear such things a lot from
 theists; never quite did understand what they were talking about.
 i have no such 'emptiness' or 'hole'. maybe some others do, i wouldn't
 know; but i don't, and if i did, i'd seek help about it. doesn't sound
 like a mentally healthy situation at all, walking around with a 'hole'
 in oneself.

       well, not having written that original post, i don't know if it
 was intended to be interpreted in such a way; but, having reread it
 carefully, i somewhat doubt it. at least, that's not how he gets across
 to _me_, your mileage may vary...
