 this is an excellent question and i'll be anxious to see if there are
 any such cases.  i doubt it.  in the medieval period (esp. 10th-cent.
 when aquinas flourished) argument was a useful tool because everyone
 "knew the rules."  today, when you can't count on people knowing even
 the basics of logic or seeing through rhetoric, a good argument is
 often indistinguishable from a poor one.
