 having met peter kingston (of wbt) some years back, he struck me 
 as an exemplery and dedicated christian whose main concern was with
 translation of the word of god and the welfare of the people
 group he was serving.
 wbt literature is concerned mainly with providing scripture
 in minority languages.
 
 the sort of criticism leveled at an organisation such as this
 along the lines of "ideological manipulation and cultural
 interference" is probably no more than christianising and
 education - in this wbt will stand alongside the early christian
 missionaries to parts of africa, or those groups who worked
 among native americans a couple hundred years ago.

 i think you need to substantiate these attacks as being a
 legitimate criticism of priorities other than spreading the
 gospel among underdeveloped people.
