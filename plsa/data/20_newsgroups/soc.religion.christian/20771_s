 i strongly disagree that absolute truth would not require interpretation.
 that's because truth may be absolute, but it may not be obvious.  like
 so many things, the truth is always subject to misinterpretation.
 
 i strongly suspect that we are reaching an impasse here, which is why i
 deign from commenting much further.

 now hold it.  i never said that christians cannot be arrogant.  indeed, as
 many other christians on src have stressed before, this is a trap that
 christians must always be wary about.  however, this does not mean that if
 you believe in the absolutes established by the bible, you are necessarily
 being arrogant.  a christian can believe that the word of god is absolute,
 but he or she should not expect this to be immediately evident to everyone.

 not quite.  you say that according to my stance, we cannot *reliably*
 determine what is true.  that is not what i said.  i say that as fallible
 human beings, we cannot discern the truth with 100% certainty.  the 
 distinction is subtle yet important.
 
 when a scientist performs an experiment, he can claim that his results
 are reliable, without claiming that absolutely no mistake whatsoever could
 have been made.  in other words, he can admit that he could be mistaken,
 without sacrificing his convictions.
 
 nobody can establish what absolute truth is with 100% certainty.
 throughout the centuries, philosophers have argued about what we can know
 with complete certainty and what we cannot.  descartes made a step in the
 right direction when he uttered, "cogito, ergo sum," yet we have not advanced
 much beyond that.
 
 do you believe that other people aside from you exist?  do you believe that
 the computer terminal you are using exists?  if so, can you be absolutely
 certain about that?  are you sure it is not some grand illusion?  of course,
 you have no such assurance.  this does not mean, however, that for all
 practical purposes, you can be certain that they exist.  so it is with
 christianity.  the most mature christians i know have deep convictions about
 absolute morality, yet they acknowledge that there is a non-zero probability 
 that they are wrong.  this does not, however, mean that they should (or do) 
 abandon these absolutes.

 as i said, we can never be absolutely certain that we are correct.  this does
 not mean that we cannot be certain enough, in light of the evidence, to 
 render all doubts unreasonable.
