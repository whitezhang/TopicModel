 seeing as how _the_two_babylons_ has been brought up again, it is time for
 me to respond , once again, and say that this book is junk.  it is nothing
 more that an anti-catholic tract of the sort published ever since the there
 were protestants.  its scholarship is phony and its assertions spurious.
