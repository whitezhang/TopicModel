 rick has nailed the problem down pretty well.
 
 as i can find no scripture (have i missed it ?) that details
 when you are married, i have to make some assumptions based
 on the principles of scripture.  
 
 it seems to me that it takes 3 parties to make a marriage:
 husband-to-be, wife-to-be, and god.  if you promise before
 each other and god that you will convenant together to be
 married, then...you are (imo).
 
 so why do we have the ceremonial part ?  that seems to be
 there for "connectedness" in the body of christ.  my brothers
 and sisters ought to be involved so that there can be some
 accountability on both our parts.  that's part of the concept
 from hebrews about "not forsaking the assembling of yourselves
 together as is the custom of some."  we need each other because
 lone ranger christians and lone ranger marriages smack of a
 self sufficiency that the i don't see in the nt.  does anyone
 see the paul simon "i am a rock, i am an island..." model anywhere
 in christianity. (song lyrics show your age :-) ) ?
 
 further, since marriage is a legal matter/institution in the usa
 and many other places, and such laws do not specifically go
 crosswise to the clear teachings of scripture, we ought to
 obey them to avoid even the appearance of "evil" (i thess 5:22)
 
 so this would imply at least a civil ceremony before marriage,
 but keep in mind we are at least doing all of this for the 
 conscience of others because back to the beginning...you are
 married when you and your intended promise each other and god
 to be in convenant. (imo)
 
 what ch'all think ?

 [in some states, the kind of commitment described in richard szanto's
 posting can create a common law marriage.  indeed his posting itself
 might go a long way towards establishing that a marriage exists,
 should the issue ever end up in court.  he might want to consult a
 lawyer who is familiar with common law marriage in his state.  --clh]
