 thanks for the reply, but this isn't quite the same thing.  like i said before, 
 i can understand why non-christians would be denied *access* to holy 
 ceremonies, but the ceremony itself (communion) was not secret.  in fact, all 
 four gospels record the first "breaking of the bread" in some detail.  
 communion was a fellowship meal, and it was (and still should be, in my 
 opinion) inappropriate to invite those who did not share in the fellowship of 
 the body of christ.  the fact that unbelievers, denied access to these communal 
 meals, began to imagine all sorts of secret and debased rituals during 
 communion does not by any means imply that the early christians were in fact 
 hiding shameful things from the general public.  in fact, i think if you read 
 some of the early church fathers, you will find that they were not at all 
 bashful about describing what went on during communion.  that's why it seems 
 funny to me when mormons, who claim to be the only true restoration of 1st 
 century christianity, insist on hiding certain rituals on the grounds that they 
 are "too sacred."

 [actually, that's not quite the case.  john omits the central elements
 of the last supper.  his gospel is full of symbolism of bread and
 wine.  but the actual story isn't there.  some people think he has
 omitted some of the details because they were not talked about in
 public in his community.  there is also evidence that some aspects of
 baptismal practice were kept secret. see morton smith's "secret
 gospel" -- i don't agree with his lurid speculations on what the
 secret practices actually were, but there does seem to be some
 evidence that mark omitted certain details because they were 
 inappropriate for publication.  --clh]
