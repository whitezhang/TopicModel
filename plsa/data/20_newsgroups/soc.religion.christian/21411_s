 bruce@liv.ac.uk (bruce stephens) suggests different levels of acceptance of
 homosexuality:
 > 
 > 1) regard homosexual orientation as a sin (or evil, whatever)
 > 2) regard homosexual behaviour as a sin, but accept orientation

 > 3) as 2, but "love the sinner"
 > 4) accept homosexuality altogether.
 
 i would add 4': our churches should accept homosexual orientation but hold all
 people to certain standards of sexual behavior.  promiscuity, abuse of power
 relationships, harrassment, compulsivity are equally out of place in the lives
 of homosexual as of heterosexual people.
 
 of course, this would bring up the dread shibboleth of homosexual marriage,
 and we couldn't have that! :-)
