 this week, many of you have asked about my earlier postings on ot, nt and
 intertestiment exegesis on the homosexual issue.  i have refered you to the faq
 files, which i find out, no longer contains them.  they are too long for me to
 mail to each of you, each article, but will try to get them back on the faq
 file.  
 
 because of the renewed interest on this subject, i will type, with permission,
 an article by james deyoung.  i think it is one of the best articles that i've
 read todate from the conservative position.  i can't post it all at once, so it
 will come piece meal and not daily.  after i'm done retyping the entire
 article, i will make it available for the faq file.  talk to clh.

      traditional interpretation of arsenokoitai ("homosexuals") in 1 cor 6:9
 and 1 tim 1:10 refers to sexual vice between people of the same sex,
 specifically homosexualitiy.  some restrict the term's meaning to "active male
 prostititute," but stronger evidence supports a more general translation,
 namely "homosexuals."  more recently the definition "homosexual" has been
 opposed on clutural and linguistic grounds, the claim being that the term
 "homosexuals" is anachronistic.  in addition, criticism of the traditional
 rendering says the term today includes celibate homophiles, excludes
 heterosexuals who engage in homosexual acts, and includes female homosexuals. 
 a concern for acts instead of the modern attention to desires was the only
 factor in the ancient world.  the foregoing oppositition to the translation of
 arsenokoitai by "homosexuals" has a number of debilitating weaknesses. 
 finally, this study argues that paul coined the term arsenokoitai, deriving it
 from the lxx of lev 20:12 (cf. 18:22) and using it for homosexual orientation
 and behavior, the latter of which should be an occasion for church discipline
 (i cor 5-6) and legislation in society (1 tim 1:8-11).

      coincident with the rise of the gay rights movement in recent years has
 been an increasing focus on the biblical statements regarding homosexuality or
 sodomy.    as part of this focus, the meaning of the term arsenokoitai, used
 twice by the apostle paul (1 cor 6:9,  i tim 1:10), has received vigorous
 scrutiny.    this issue is particularly crucial to contemporary society since
 so much of modern ethics is shaped by biblical statements.  more particularly, 
 the concern over gay rights and the place of gays or homosexuals in the church
 and in society require the resolution of biblical interpretation.
 
      this study of historical, linguistic, and literary matters will survey and
 evalutate recent proposals for the meaning of arsenokoitai and present evidence
 to point to a resolution.  several writers and their positions represent the
 modern debate on this word.  three authors, bailey, boswell, and scroggs, have
 provoked considerable discussion and significantly encouraged the wider
 acceptance of the homosexual lifestyle in society, in the church, and in the
 ministry.

  1.  for convenience sake, the term "homosexual" is used to encompass both
 same-sex orientation and same-sex behavior.  the meaning of this term is one of
 the main considerations of this study.
  2. these times are differnt from just over a century ago.  then p fairbairn
 (pastoral epistles [edinburg, 1874)  891) could write of arsenokoitai thit it
 is a "term for which fortunately our language has no proper equivalent." 
 unknowingly he thereby touched upon the basis for the contemporary debate and
 study.  the present writer endorses the pauline authorship of the pastoral
 epistles on the basis of internal and external evidence (see donald guthrie,
 new testament introduction, [4th ed;  1990] 621-649, for an extensive
 discussion and citation of supporters of the pauline authorship).

 other side (april 1984): 24-29.  for a study suggesting a further prohibition
 of homosexuality in the ot, see a. phillips, "unconvering the father's skirt,"
