 	the quick answer:  revelation 12:7-9
 
 	"and there was war in heaven.  michael and his angels fought against
 	the dragon and his angels who fought back.  but he [the dragon] was
 	not strong enough, and they lost their place in heaven.  the great
 	dragon was hurled down--that ancient serpent, called the devil and
 	satan, who leads the whole world astray.  he was hurled down to the
 	earth, and his angels with him."
 
 	the earlier part of chapter 12 deals (very symbolically) with why
 	satan rose up in battle against michael and the good angels in the
 	first place.
 
 	hope this clears it up.
