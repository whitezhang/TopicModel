 according to the legal practices of today's america, i imagine the legal
 definition of religion, if defined, may resemble the following:
 
 	"any system of belief or practice to which people are committed
 	for the benefit of society which must, in the opinion of secular
 	thought, be isolated from political and educational influence."
 
 	"should any system of belief or practice to which people are
 	committed be harmful or void of any benefit to society in the
 	opinion of religious thought as defined in the previous paragraph,
 	isolation of such from political and educational influence would
 	constitute unreasonable censorship and an unlawful violation of
 	civil rights."
 
 someday, perhaps they'll legalize benevolence :-)
