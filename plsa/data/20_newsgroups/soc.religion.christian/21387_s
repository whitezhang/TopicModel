 
     could anyone enlighten me on how the mormon church views 
 children born out of wedlock?  in particular i'm interested to know if any 
 stigma is attached to the children as opposed to the parents.  i'm especially 
 keen to learn if there is or is not any prohibition in the mormon faith on 
 bastards entering heaven or having their names entered in the big genealogical 
 book the mormons keep in salt lake city.  if this is an issue on which the 
 "official" position has changed over time, i'm interested in learning both old 
 and new beliefs.  e-mail or posting is fine.  all information or pointers are 
 appreciated.
