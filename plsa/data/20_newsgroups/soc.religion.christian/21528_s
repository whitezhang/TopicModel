 it is important if christianity is being damaged by it. if
 people who "speak in tongues" make claims that they are
 miraculously speaking a foreign language through the power of
 the holy spirit, when it can easily be shown that they are simply
 making noises, it damages all christians, since many who are
 not christians do not distinguish between the various sects.
 
 the more modest claim for "tongues" that it is simply
 uncontrolled praise in which "words fail you" is surely the one
 that should be used by those who make use of this practice.
 
 i agree with the point that "charismatic" practices like this
 can lead to forms of worship which are more about the
 worshipper showing off than genuine praise for god; one of the
 things jesus warned us about.
