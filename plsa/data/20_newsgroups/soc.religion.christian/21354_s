 greetings and salutations!
 
 i would like to get in touch with people who
 (a) consider themselves christians (you define it), and
 (b) are in the martial arts
 
 some topics for discussion:
 	- your particular martial art
 	- your view of the relationship between
 		christianity and your art
 	- your view of the relationship between
 		*your* christianity and your art
 	- why should a christian participate in ma
 	- why shouldn't a christian participate in ma
 	- biblical views of ma; pro or con.
 
 for example, i heard from one fellow:
 	"...i tried the karate for christ thing and it wasn't for me..."
 	- why or why not?
 
 as an aside, i am involved (in *no* official way) with an
 organization called the christian black belt association and
 i would also like to distribute info regarding upcoming events
 to *those who are interested*.  no, you won't be put on any
 "mailing list" nor will your name be "sold".
 
 however, if you are intested in an email list, let me know.
 
 i am interested in email replies only as this is cross-posted 
 to groups i don't normally read.  if anyone wants a summary
 or, of course, on-going discussion, then let me know.
 
 
 shalom,
 robert switzer
