 tsk.tsk. too much argument on non-issues !
 i'm roman catholic and it seems to me that people
 celebrate easter and christmas for itself rather
 than how it relates to jesus. i don't really
 care about some diety. if people have some other
 definition of easter, then that's their business.
 don't let it interfere with my easter.
 
 "resurrection sunday" 8-) where did that come from ?
 if people celebrate easter for the cadburry bunny,
 that's their business.

 i've always been curious about this. is jesus important
 to jews at all ? i thought he was thought of only
 as a prophet ? if that's true what do they celebrate
 easter for ?
