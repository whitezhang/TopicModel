 thanks for the letter, your comments helped some.
 
 as to the last comment, i certainly realize that it was not intended to
 sound that way.  i am still trying to understand *how* a spiritual being
 colud truly be one and three at the same time.  all of the descriptions
 of this are either platonic or sound like special pleading (sort of,
 "they appear to be three seperate beings in all ways, but really they are
 one, trust me").
 
 neither of these is acceptible to me.
 
 the fact is, so far the only descriptions of the trinity that makes any
 *sense* to me are the modalistic ones, such as modalistic monarchianism
 or "economic trinitarianism".  [i can accept that the three aspects are
 intrinsic to the nature of god, so i perhaps lean more towards the latter].
 
 i am trying, here, to see if anybody can come up with another description
 that is both orthodox and believable.

 [i fear orthodox theologians have been overly in love with paradox, to
 the extent that well-meaning people think they've just flat-out
 confused.  there's no problem with things being both 3 and 1, e.g.  if
 the 3 are different parts of the 1.  father, son, and holy spirit
 aren't exactly parts of god, because parts are things distinguished by
 physical separation.  all three persons are omnipresent, so they are
 obviously aren't physically separate.  but they're in some way
 different aspects, modes, or whatever, of one god.  if you accept
 economic trinitarianism, it's possible that you don't have any
 substantive difference with the standard view.  is it possible that
 you just don't find the neo-platonic explanation illuminating?
