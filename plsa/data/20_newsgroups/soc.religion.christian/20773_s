 i've just read carol's response and i just had to get into this.  i've
 got some verses which are not subject to interpretation because they say
 what they say.  they are 2 peter 1:20-21, 2 timothy 3:16-17, and
 galatians 1:11-12.  
 
 also, based on the fact that jesus is the word incarnate and he judges
 people if they follow him (see acts 17:29-31 and john 5:21-27) and that
 those who reject jesus' teachings are judged by the very words he spoke
 (see john 12:47-50), then jesus' words are true and do not need
 interpretation, nor would it be just of god to judge based on his word
 if it had to be interpreted.
