 this is a point that seems to have been overlooked by many. the ending of a 
 1600 year old schism seems to be in sight.
 
 the theologians said that the differences between them were fundamentally 
 ones or terminology, and that the christological faith of both groups was 
 the same.
 
 some parishes have concelebrated the eucharist, and here in southern africa 
 we are running a joint theological training course for coptic and byzantine 
 orthodox. 
 
 there are still several things to be sorted out, however. as far as the 
 copts are concerned, there were three ecumenical councils, whily the 
 byzantine orthodox acknowledge seven.
