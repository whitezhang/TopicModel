 i am glad that i am not an atheist.  it seems tragic that some people 
 choose a meaningless existence.  how terrible to go on living only 
 because one fears death more than life.  i feel so sorry for eric and 
 yet any attempts to share my joy in life with him would be considered as 
 further evidence of the infectious nature of christianity.    
 
 as a christian i am free to be a human person.  i think, love, choose, 
 and create.  i will live forever with god.
 
 christ is not a kind of drug.  drugs are a replacement for christ.  
 those who have an empty spot in the god-shaped hole in their hearts must 
 do something to ease the pain.  this is why the most effective 
 substance-abuse recovery programs involve meeting peoples' spiritual 
 needs.
 
 thank you, eric for your post.  it has helped me to appreciate how much 
 god has blessed me.  i hope that you will someday have a more joy-filled 
 and abundant life.
