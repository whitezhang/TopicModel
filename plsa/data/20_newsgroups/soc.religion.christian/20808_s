 as a muslim (spelled sometimes as moslem) i must say that muslims strong
 ly believe in jesus.  refered in islamic text as eesau(as)
 
          jesus ==>  j - esu  - s    ===> esu (pronounced eee-saw)
 
 yah we knew him well.  ideally, this war should not even be.  and even in
 a time of war, our goal is peace.  we should try to refrain from viloating
 the peace of others as then if we do violate, we will not have peace in
 ourselves.  i don't like this war eaither,  it is a conflict of territory.
 croats, muslims, and serbs lived together before in peace.  the rallying
 point is 'race'.  and im sure that there is a general out there who wouldn't
 mind being a president.

 [from a christian perspective, moslem ideas about jesus look rather
 seriously erroneous.  i've generally tried to avoid discussions of
 islam in this group, since soc.religion.islam is the right place for
 that.  thus i don't much want to go into detail.  i will simply note
 that moslems reject most of what christians regard as the most
 essential facts about jesus.  so at least from a christian perspective
 moslems don't know jesus.  again, this is no justification for
 christians to hate moslems or to kill them.  i agree with you that
 this war should never be.  --clh]
