 in some earlier discussions on this thread i may have
 given the impression that even though children didn't 
 require baptism it wouldn't hurt if they were.
 to the contrary, when you baptize children before
 they are capable of comprehending it you deny them 
 their opportunity to demonstrate their desire to
 serve god.
 
 have any of you considered that children are not
 accountable for sin because they are not capable of 
 repentance?
 peter said to a group of "men and brethren," "repent
 and be baptized every one of you" (acts 2:38).
 notice that he specified that if they *repent* then 
 they may be *baptized*.
 
 in following peter's instructions people must first
 demonstrate repentance (a forsaking of their sins and 
 a desire to obey god's commands) *before* they are 
 eligible to be baptized.
 
 since young children are not capable of repenting,
 they are not eligible for baptism.
 and since god is both just and merciful "sin is not 
 imputed when there is no law" (romans 5:13), young 
 children are not accountable for what they can't 
 comprehend.
