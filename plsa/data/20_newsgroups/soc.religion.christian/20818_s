 there is another way to view this.  the true celebration is easter,
 the resurrection of our lord.  this has been true from the foundation
 of the world.  pagan practices are then either:
 
 1. foreshadowings of the true celebration of the resurrection, 
    in which dim light was shone forth so that people would
    recognize the full truth when it was manifested, or
 
 2. satanic counterfeits intended to deceive us so that we would not
    recognize the truth when it was manifested.
 
 i don't believe the second argument, because i believe in the power
 of the resurrection, the fulfillment of the incarnation, and our hope.
 earlier or parallel ideas in other religions clearly are dim images of
 the truth of the resurrection.  as paul states, we see through a glass
 darkly.  so do others.  it serves no purpose arguing about who has
 the darker or lighter glass.  the foreshadowings are not perfect.
 so what? our understnding of god is today imperfect, for we are not
 yet perfected.  theosis is not a gift such that wham, we're perfect.
