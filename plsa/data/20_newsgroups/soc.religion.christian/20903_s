 i *did* become a christian without having been indoctrinated by my parents, and
 having studied buddhism fairly carefully and other religions to a lesser
 degree.  i made a decision to accept the truth-claims of christianity after
 having given it a lot of thought.  (i have to point out that the process was not
 purely a cold, rational one: there was a powerful experiential element as well.
 also, my calvinist should rest assured that i don't lay any of the
 responsibility for the outcome [my conversion] on anyone but god.)
 
 it took me years and years for this all to happen, because i had many of the
 objections that this poster puts forward.  i grew up in the shadow of [generic
 authoritarian conservative denomination], and i *knew* that that wasn't a way
 of life that i could adopt.  but i gradually learned not to tar all of
 christianity with the same brush, and realized quite suddenly one cold winter
 night that i accepted what i had heretofore rejected.  i am quite certain that
 i was not "brain-washed".
