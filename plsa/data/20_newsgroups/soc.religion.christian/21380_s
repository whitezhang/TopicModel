 i would like to submit the following which helped me enormously.
 if it has already been posted, i apologize.
 
 it seems that during the middle ages, it was customary for pastors to 
 explain the trinity to their parishoners by analogy to water.
 water is water, but can exist in three forms--liquid, ice and vapor.
 thus it is possible for one essence to exist in three forms.
 
 and recently, the pastor of my church drew an analogy, which i
 also found useful--a woman is often percieved by others in three
 ways, depending on their relationship to her--a mother, a wife and
 an employee in a business.
 
 thus, it seems clear to me that the essence of god can subsist in
 the father, son, and holy spirit or, depending on one's particular
 need for him.
