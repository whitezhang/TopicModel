 >>can't someone describe someone's trinity in simple declarative
 >>sentences with words that have common meaning?
 
 when i need a kick-butt god, or when i need assurance of the reality
 of truth, i pray to god the father.
 
 when i need a friend, someone to put his arm around me and
 cry with me, i pray to jesus.
 
 when i need strength or wisdom to get through a difficult situation,
 i pray for the holy spirit.
 
 i realize that the above will probably make some people cringe,
 but what can i say? i think the doctrine of the trinity is
 an attempt to reconcile jesus being god and being distinct from
 god, as described in the bible.
 
 i wonder if jesus had been a hindu how different the wording would be.
