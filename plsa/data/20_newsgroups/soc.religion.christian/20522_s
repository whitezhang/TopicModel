 the two historic facts that i think the most important are these:
 
 (1) if jesus didn't rise from the dead, then he must have done something
 else equally impressive, in order to create the observed amount of impact.
 
 (2) nobody ever displayed the dead body of jesus, even though both the
 jewish and the roman authorities would have gained a lot by doing so
 (it would have discredited the christians).
