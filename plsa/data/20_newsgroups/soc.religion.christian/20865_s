 i believe this is a just another of way of expressing the basic truth
 "all things were created by him and for him." (emphasis mine) 
 col. 1:16 , rev. 4:11. if you and i have been created for god, naturally
 there will be a vacuum if god is not our all and all. in fact,
 the first chapter of collosians brings out this status of christ, that
 he should have the preeminence. when you life is alligned with him,
 and you do his will, then the vacuum is filled.
