 excuse me, but what makes you think that just because he's atheist he
 doesn't know anything about christianity????  in my (albeit limited)
 experience atheists are often the ones who know _more_ about the
 bible, having searched it from end to end for answers.  i myself am a
 christian, but that doesn't mean i consider myself more of an
 authority on my religion -- i just have a different perspective on it
 (more biased in favor, naturally :) ).
 
 it seems quite obvious why he is subscribed, if i may infer from what
 he says: he is looking for an explanation.  who are we to question his
 motives anyway -- at the very least (although i dislike this kind of
 logic), one could hope that he will "see the light".  critcism will, i
 fear, not give him a very positive picture of christians....

 with regard to this, i guess i don't really feel sentiments of this
 order can be proven -- faith has a lot to do with it.  this is why
 those who search the bible from cover to cover for answers won't
 necessarily get what they're looking for.  of course that doesn't help
 anyone who doesn't already have faith -- what a big catch 22.  i
 discovered this quite recently when i ran into an agnostic looking for an
 explanation of my faith and i quickly discovered that i could give him
 nothing more than my life story and a description of my nature.  faith
 is a very personal thing -- any attempt to "prove" the "facts" behind
 it must be questioned.
 
 >good luck, bob.  and, best regards.
 
 likewise -- no matter what you believe.
