 	one of the things i find intersting about pagan beliefs is
 their belief in a feminine deity as well as a masculine deity. being
 brought up in a christian household, i often wondered if there was god
 the father, where was the mother? everyone i know who has a father
 usually as a mother. it just seemed rather unbalanced to me. 
 	fortunately, my own personal theology, which will probably not
 fall into line with a lot others, recognized god as a being both
 without gender and posessing qualities of both genders, as being both
 a masculine and feminine force. it provides a sense of balance i find
 sorely lacking in most theologies, a lack which i think is responsible
 for a lot of the unbalanced ways in which we see the world and treat
 each other.
