 actually in d&c 68:25-28 the parents are being held accountable for
 their own sins.  specifically they are accountable for their failure
 to teach their children properly.  if i fail to teach my children
 that stealing is wrong then i am responsible for their theft if they
 later indulge in such behavior.
 
 this is very similar to the instructions ezekiel was given in
 eze 3:18.  if ezekiel failed to do his duty and warn the wicked, 
 not only would the wicked die in his sins but the lord would hold
 ezekiel responsible!  similarly parents are responsible to teach
 their children right from wrong.  i suspect most christians (and
 jews etc.) would agree that parents have this responsibility.
