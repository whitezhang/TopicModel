 i offer him four attempts.
 
 first is an essay by me (largely indebted to attempts two and
 three), obtainable by sending the message get trinity analogy to
 listserv@asuacad.bitnet or to listserv@asuvm.inre.asu.edu
 
 second is a couple of books by dorothy l sayers: a play called the
 zeal of thy house, and a non-fiction book called the mind of the
 maker.  the play can be found in the book four sacred plays, and
 also in various other collections, including one called religious
 drama (meridian books) and one called best plays of 1937.
 
 third is the book mere christianity by c s lewis, particularly the
 last section, called "beyond personality".
 
 fourth is a book called theology for beginners, by the roman
 catholic writer frank sheed. i will say that i do not find sheed's
 approach altogether satisfying, but i know some persons whose minds
 i respect who do.
