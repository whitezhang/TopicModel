 this sounds to me like a sort of generic modalism (in the the three phases
 of water are but different modes of behavior of the same physical stuff).
 it certainly does not seem to me to describe the orthodox position.
 
 [of course, i suppose that the medieval view of water may have been
 different, but now we know that the phases of water are just different
 *behaviors* of the same physical stuff - different modes, not different
 identities - but perhaps the medieval people did not know that].

 this is clearly modalistic monarchianism, since these three aspects depend
 solely on point of view, and are do not really represent actual variety
 within the person.
 
 do you now begin to see why
