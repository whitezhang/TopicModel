 if i believed in the god of the bible i would be very fearful of making
 this statement. doesn't it say those who judge will be judged by the
 same measure?

 a god who must motivate through fear is not a god worthy of worship.
 if the god jesus spoke of did indeed exist he would not need hell to
 convince people to worship him.

 it was the myth of hell that made me finally realize that the whole thing
 was untrue. if it hadn't been for hell i would still be a believer today.
 the myth of hell made me realize that if there was a god that he was not
 the all knowing and all good god he claimed to be. why should i take such
 a being at his word, even if there was evidence for his existance?
