 the concept of god as a teacher is indeed interesting. does he grade on
 a curve, does he cheat? that is interesting. not to mention thought
 provoking. my own concept is that he is a father and we are his
 children. in that he loves us, with a love that we can never understand
 until we are with him. the bible says that he looks on the heart as the
 final measure. from that perspective, in a grading context, the heart is
 the final test.
 specifically, most christians would agree that there is only one heaven
 and one hell. from that perspective, it is heaven or hell. you either go
 to one or the other. the "grading" on a pass/fail basis is done by god
 the father with intervention by jesus the son. not by others. for only
 god sees the heart. the bible says of the heart, "...who can know it." i
 would say there has always been, and always be, an unchanging method.
 that is what makes a relationship with christ so secure. in an uncertain
 and ever changing landscape he is always the same. yesterday, today and
 tomorrow. concerning whether or not our childhoods are considerd as part
 of the test, my own conviction is no. were that the case i certainly
 wouldn't be going to heaven. the bible speaks very plainly about the
 love and care jesus had for and about children. the reality is that we
 are all children. some of us just have bigger bodies and grey hair. but
 the father, our father is always there. like most fathers he wants only
 the best for his own. there maybe decipline, but there is more love.
 it's sometimes looks like christianity is a test, to see who makes it
 and who doesn't. those who do pass=heaven, and those who don't go to the
 other place. but it is really much more than that...
 there are few experts. most of us are just travelers looking for the
 light and the way home. praying that we can bring others with us.
