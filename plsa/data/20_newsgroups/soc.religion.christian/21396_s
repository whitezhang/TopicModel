 it is often argued that we have no standing by which to judge god's
 actions.  who is the clay to talk back to the potter? but we find a
 contrary view in scripture. when god proposes to destroy the city of
 sodom (genesis 18), abraham says:
 
  + suppose that there are some good men in the city.
  + will you destroy the righteous along with the wicked?
  + far be it from you, lord, to do such a thing!
  + shall not the judge of all the earth do right?
 
 i am told that the hebrew is actually a bit stronger than this, and
 can perhaps be better rendered (dynamic equivalence) as
 
  + shame on you, lord, if you do such a thing!
 
 there are those who say that the definition of "good" is "whatever
 god happens to want." but if that is so, then the statement that god
 is good has no meaning.  it simply says that god does what he wants.
 that being the case, no one can either love or obey god because he
 is good. the only motive left for obeying him is that he is
 powerful. just as it makes sense to obey a dictator, even when he
 tells you to round up all jews and exterminate them, because if you
 defy him you might end up in the gas chamber yourself, so it makes
 sense to obey god, because he has the power to punish you if you
 don't. this ethical theory i take to be in radical contradiction to
 genesis 18 and to christianity in general.
 
 any theory that makes our moral judgements worthless makes any
 further discussion of morality (or of the goodness of god)
 meaningless. however, it does not follow that our moral judgements
 are always infallible in particular cases, still less our judgements
 in particular cases about the course of action most likely to
 achieve a good result.
 
 when i read the scriptural accounts of the actions of god in
 history, those actions often seem to me very different from what i
 might expect of a god who loves us and desires what is best for us.
 moreover, leaving the scriptures aside, and considering the natural
 world, i find that nature is often very different from what i might
 expect if it were the work of a benevolent deity.  (origen said:
 "those who believe that the author of nature is also the author of
 the scriptures must expect to find in the scriptures the same sort
 of difficulties that they find in nature.")
 
 now, that some such difficulties should exist is not in itself an
 argument against the existence, power, wisdom, and goodness of god.
 on the contrary, their absence would be such an argument. suppose
 that i am watching bobby fisher play chess, and suppose that every
 time he makes a move, i find myself nodding and saying: "good move!
 just what i was expecting him to do.  same move i would have made if
 i were playing." that would be a sign that fisher is no better a
 chess player than myself. given that he is better, i expect that at
 least some of his moves will have me thinking, "now, what do suppose
 induced him to do that?" or even, "boy, that was a real slip -- he's
 just thrown the game away!" similarly, if god understands the
 workings of the universe better than i do, it is to be expected that
 sometimes it will look to me as if he has made a mistake.
 
 one difference between fisher at the chessboard and god at the
 controls of the universe is that i can see the end of the chess
 game. if fisher wins, i revise my earlier inference that it was
 carelessness that made him lose his queen 23 moves earlier.
 however, if he loses, and particularly if i can see that there was a
 time when he had an opportunity for a checkmate in two moves and did
 not take it, then i know that he is not as good a player as i had
 thought.
 
 with god, on the other hand, i shall not in this life see the total
 result of some of his actions. therefore, my grounds for judging
 that i have seen a bad move on his part must always be far shakier
 than my grounds for making a similar judgement about fisher.

 in the book of genesis, we read that joseph's ten older brothers,
 who (with good reason) found  him insufferable, conspired to sell
 him into slavery in egypt. there he eventually became viceroy, and
 when there was a famine in canaan, he was able to provide for his
 family. when his brothers nervously apologized, he told them: "do
 not worry. you meant to do me evil, but god turned it into good."
 
 i once heard a rabbi speak on this text. he said:
 
         the history of the jews is largely a history of events
    that look like catastrophes that threaten the continued
    survival of the religion, or the people, or both. but,
    amazingly, those events turn out to be the saving of the jews
    and of judaism.
         the sale of joseph by his brothers looked like the breakup
    of the family.  but in fact, it ended with a reconciliation of
    the quarrel between them. the famine that drove the family out
    of canaan looked like a misfortune for them.  but in fact, if
    they had stayed in canaan, they would almost certainly have
    intermarried with the canaanites and been assimilated into
    their culture.  their oppression by the egyptians a few
    generations after their arrival in egypt again looked like a
    disaster. but god used it to bring them out of egypt, and into
    the promised land.
         here the people built a temple, and regularly offered
    sacrifices. but the babylonians captured jerusalem and judea,
    destroyed temple and city and countryside, and deported most of
    the people to babylon. you might have thought that that would
    be the end of the people and the religion. but it was not.
    living in canaan, the people had been under constant danger of
    assimilation.  again and again, they had turned from the
    worship of the lord to the worship of the canaanite fertility
    cults, with their ritual prostitution and ritual human
    sacrifice. the babylonian captivity put a stop to that. never
    again did the jews show any interest in polytheism or idolatry.
    neither the worship of the canaanites mor that of the
    babylonians ever again had a foothold among them.
         nor is that all. judaism had been in danger of becoming
    simply a system of sacrifices and temple observances. the only
    prescribed acts of worship consisted of coming to jerusalem
    every so often and offering a sacrifice. during the captivity,
    with the temple gone, the jews invented the synagogue, a place
    of meeting for reading and study and discussion of the
    scriptures. they came to realize clearly, what they were in
    danger of forgetting while they continued to live in judea,
    that god is not simply a local or tribal deity, not just the
    controller of the land of canaan, or the patron of the jewish
    people, but the creator of the world, and the ruler and judge
    of all humans everywhere.
         time passed, and the babylonian empire was replaced by
    that of the persians, and then that of the greeks, or rather
    the macedonians. the ruler, antiochus epiphanes, was determined
    to stamp out judaism, and to this end he made the reading and
    the study of the torah punishable by death. again, one might
    think that this would be the end of judaism. but it was not.
    the people met for worship, and instead of reading the torah
    portion appointed for the day, they would read some passage
    from the prophets that had a similar theme, and then discuss
    that.  before this time, the torah, the so-called five books of
    moses (genesis, exodus, leviticus, numbers, and deuteronomy)
    were the only books read and studied in the synagogue.  if it
    had not been for antiochus, the books of the prophets would
    probably have been forgotten altogether. his hatred for judaism
    saved them.
 
         [other examples here omitted for brevity's sake.]
 
         some of you may remember that julie andrews first became
    famous as eliza doolittle in the stage production of my fair
    lady. when warner brothers undertook to make a movie of it,
    everyone expected that julie, who had been so magnificent on
    stage, would play the same role in the movie. instead, the
    studio decided to go with an established screen star, and cast
    audrey hepburn.  julie andrews was naturally crushed. but she
    later realized that if she had played the screen role, she
    would have been type-cast for life as an elize doolittle type.
    it would have been a disaster for her. as it was, walt disney
    offered her the role of mary poppins, and she won an oscar for
    it.  at the presentation, she stood there, smiling, and looking
    at walt disney, she said, "and now, my special thanks to the
    man who made all this possible -- jack warner!" it was the most
    memorable line of the evening.
         in a similar spirit, we jews might thank the men who in
    the providence of god have preserved judaism, and kept it alive
    to this day, beginning with joseph's brothers, and continuing
    with two pharaohs, with nebuchadnezzar, with antiochus
    epiphanes....
 
 after the formal meeting had broken up, one woman came up to him
 privately and said, "you were talking about the holocaust, weren't
 you?" he answered, "if that is an example that came to your mind,
 then you are right, i was talking about it to you. but i would not
 talk about it to everyone, for not everyone can bear it." i assume
 that he meant that, without the holocaust, there would have been no
 state of israel.
 
 someone hearing the rabbi's lecture might leap to the conclusion
 that god is dependent on the wickedness of men to accomplish his
 purposes -- or at least that the rabbi thought so. he might then  go
 on to suppose that the wickedness is in fact god's doing -- that he
 stirred up joseph's brothers to a murderous hate against him, and
 that when the israelites were in egypt, god hardened pharaoh's
 heart, so that he oppressed the people, and would not let them go.
 and this raises questions about how an action can be considered
 wicked and at the same time be considered something that god has
 brought about.
 
 i suggest another way of looking at it. consider a sculptor who has
 a log of wood from which he proposes to carve a statue. but the log,
 instead of having a smooth even grain throughout, has a large knot
 that spoils the appearance of the surface. the sculptor considers
 the wood for a while, and then carves a statue that features the
 knot, that makes that particular interruption in the grain and color
 of the wood correspond to some feature of the statue, so that
 observers will say: "how fortunate the sculptor was in finding a
 piece of wood with a knot like that in just the right place. its
 presence is the crowning touch, the thing that makes the statue a
 great work of art." in reality, the knot, far from being what the sculptor was
 looking for, was a challenge to his skill. if the wood had not
 contained that flaw, he would still have made a great work of art,
 but a different one. so, if joseph's brothers had not sold him, god
 would still have brought about his purposes for the jewish people,
 but he would have done so in another manner. if judas had not
 betrayed jesus, if caiaphas and his fellow leaders had not rejected
 jesus, but had rather acknowledged him as the annointed of god, if
 pilate had followed his conscience rather than his fears and had set
 jesus free, it might appear that there would have been no
 crucifixion, and therefore no redemption, and therefore no
 salvation. not so. god did not need judas' sin to redeem us. if
 judas had done right, then god in christ would still have reconciled
 the world to himself.  we do not know how, just as we do not know
 how michelangelo would have painted the sistine chapel if its
 interior had instead been shaped like grand central station, and
 just as we do not know how bobby fisher would have won his fourth
 game agianst spassky if spassky had refused the exchange of bishops
 and had attacked fisher's knight instead (don't bother to look up
 the game in question--i am making up this example, but the point is
 none the less valid).
 
 thus, we may say both (1) that god used, say, the cowardice of
 pilate to accomplish his purposes, and (2) that the said cowardice
 was not god's doing, and that pilate would not have thwarted god's
 plans by behaving justly and courageously.
 
 what, then, are we to make of the place where god says to moses, "i
 will harden pharaoh's heart, so that he will not let the people go"?
 some christians have taken this to mean that pharaoh was a puppet
 with god pulling the strings, and that his stubbornness and cruelty
 were not his own work, but the work of god in him. i suppose rather
 that what god was telling moses was something like this: "if you see
 that pharaoh is not willing to let the people go, do not be
 discouraged, or suppose that the situation is out of my control. my
 purposes will not be thwarted. if pharaoh chooses to hear you and
 let the people go, well and good. if he does not, i will fit his
 resistance into my plans, and fit it so perfectly that future
 historians and theologians will suppose that i would have been
 thrown for a loss if pharaoh had obeyed me."
 
 to return to the question that started this all off. is it possible
 that the serbs, in slaughtering the moslems of bosnia, are
 instruments of god's will?
      first point. what they are doing is wrong, just as what
 joseph's brothers did was wrong, just as what judas did was wrong.
 they intend it for evil. if god somehow brings good out of it, that
 does not make them any less subject to just condemnation and
 punishment.
      second point. of course, god will bring good out of it. but not
 the same good that he would have brought if the serbians had
 refrained from the sins of robbery and rape and murder. nor does the
 good he purposes excuse us from the duty of doing what is right.
 
  yours,
  james kiefer
