 regarding the moral question jen (jenk@microsoft.com) asked: "is it
 okay to create a child if you aren't able to be a good parent?", i
 am reminded of a "speech" by one of the characters (i can't remember
 which) in the movie "parenthood". [i am way to liberal with my
 quotation marks tonight...]
 
 in this so-called (by me) speech, the character is expressing what 
 a lousy father he had and he made an interesting point.  he said
 something to the effect of:
 "you have to have a license to drive a car.  you have to have a
 license to own a dog.  you even have to have a license to fish.
 but, they'll anyone have a kid." [keep in mind that i am, in no
 way, trying to pass this off as a quote.  it is probably grossly
 distorted but i think you get the point...]
