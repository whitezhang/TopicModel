 [in response to some of the discussions on the sabbath, andrew byler
 commented that if we really followed sola scriptura we would worship
 on saturday -- the change to sunday was a law made by the church, and
 we don't acknowledge its authority to make laws.  i noted that
 protestants do not consider sunday worship a law.  --clh]
 
 he was not referring to the faq but to the five sabbath admissions posted
 on the bible study group.  this is what prompted someone to send the faq
 to me.

 you cannot show, from scripture, that the weekly sabbath is part of the
 ceremonial laws.   before you post a text in reply investigate its context.

 can the churches also decide what is and is not sin?  interesting.  where
 there is no divine imperative of course we must establish rules of
 operation.  but we cannot be as creative with what god has explicitly
 spoken on.

 [again, in the normal protestant interpretation, sunday is not a law,
 and worshipping on another day is not a sin.  churches are free to
 decide on the day they will meet, just as they are free to decide on
 the hour.  it would not be a sin to worship on some other day, but if
 you belong to a church that worships on sunday and you show up on
 monday, you will probably worship alone...  --clh]
