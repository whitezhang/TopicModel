 no disagreement at all that there is a very serious struggle going on.
 but jesus more typically uses consequences as a threat.  that's quite
 different from hell classic (tm). :-) jesus doesn't sound like the
 usual hell-fire type of preacher.  he attracts people through what he
 does. and the stongest example in jesus preaching is in the parable of 
 lazarus and dives, which is a parable!  in any case, my point is that
 a fear-based response to christ is not a freeing, life-affirming choice
 and isn't good news in a meaningful sense.  there are plenty of good 
 reasons to follow jesus that have nothing to do with fear or a literal 
 hell, that still pertain to overcoming in the present struggle between 
 god and the disloyal opposition.  a faith based in fear is not built
 on rock, as we should found our faith, but on ice.  if the fear were
 removed, there would be no foundation.  
 
 that's basically why it matters to me.  i think we have many christians 
 that don't have a solid basis for relating to the living incarnate god.
 i cannot be fully open to the working of god in and through my life if
 my response to god is motivated on fear.
