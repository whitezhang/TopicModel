   i question the implications of this statement; namely, that there are certain
 physical acts which are limited to god and that attempting to replicate these
 acts is blasphemy against god.  god caused a bush to burn without being
 consumed--if i do the same thing, am i usurping god's role?  
   religious people are threatened by science because it has been systematically
 removing the physical "proofs" of god's existence.  as time goes on we have to
 rely more and more on faith and the spiritual world to relate to god becuase
 science is removing our props.  i don't think this is a bad thing.
