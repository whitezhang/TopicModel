 does anyone know whether the _acta sanctorum_, the huge multi-volume collection
 of roman catholic hagiography produced by the bollandists, has ever been
 translated into english?  i'm working on the _vita s. dympnae_ and would love
 to be able to check my own translation against somebody else's.  
 
 email replies preferred, unless this query turns out to be of general interest.
