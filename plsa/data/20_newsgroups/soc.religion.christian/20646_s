 your logic is falty.  if christianity is a drug, and once we die we
 die, then why would you be reluctant to embrase this drug so that
 while you are alive you enjoy yourself.
 
 i also question your overall motives for posting this article.  why
 would you waste your presious fews seconds on this earth posting your
 opinon to a group that will generally reject it.
 
 if you die, never having acepting christ as your savior, i hope you
 have a fantastic life that it is all you evver dreamed because it is
 al of heaven you will ever know.
 
 in christ's love,
 bryan
