 well, knowing greek and hebrew, i'm probably not as picky about translations
 as i would be if english translations were my only source of information.
 but...
 
 (1) any verse that comes out substantially different in different trans-
 lations is almost certainly unclear in the original. 
 
 (2) it is very bad practice to "shop" for a translation that fits your own
 doctrinal positions.
 
 personally, i still like the rsv.  nrsv and nasv are also very good.
 
 i have a strong preference for editions that do _not_ indent the beginning
 of each verse as if verses were paragraphs.  the verse numbering is a
 relatively modern addition and should not be given undue prominence.
