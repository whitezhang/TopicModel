 whoo.  i'm going to have to be very careful with my language here.  i
 think god is voluntarily giving up his omniscience in this world so
 that we can decide on our own where we go -- free will.  in this sense
 god allows evil to occur, and in this sense can be "held responsible"
 as my chaplain says.  however, his will is, of course, that all be
 saved.  he's not going to save us "by himself" -- we have to take a
 step in his direction before he will save us.  read that last sentence
 carefully -- i'm not saying we save ourselves.  i'm saying we have to
 accept our salvation.  i do not believe in predestination -- it would
 appear from what you say further down that you do.

 ok -- i have trouble with that, but i guess that's one of those things
 that can't be resolved by argument.  i accept your interpretation.

 this is what indicates to me that you may believe in predestination.
 am i correct?  i do not believe in predestination -- i believe we all
 choose whether or not we will accept god's gift of salvation to us.
 again, fundamental difference which can't really be resolved.

 yes, it is up to god to judge.  but he will only mete out that
 punishment at the last judgement.  as for now, evil can be done by
 human beings that is not god's will -- and the best we can do is see
 taht some good comes out of it somehow.  the thing that most worries
 me about the "it is the will of god" argument is that this will
 convince people that we should not stop the rape and killing when i
 think that it is most christ-like to do just that.  if jesus stopped
 the stoning of an adulterous woman (perhaps this is not a good
 parallel, but i'm going to go with it anyway), why should we not stop
 the murder and violation of people who may (or may not) be more
 innocent?
