 you assume this because you believe in a designing creator,

 .... but then you observe our ability to modify fertility
 through intelligence & experiment, and draw no similar conclusions
 about god designing us for scientific inquiry & the use of the
 technology that it produces.  how is it that one ability is "obviously
 from god", and the other not?

 i want to know the truth, and hold the truth as the most
 basic of all ethical values, because correct moral judgement
 relies on knowing the truth, not vice versa. moralities that
 assert that assent to a belief is a moral choice, and not
 compelled by evidence inevitably cut off the limb they sit upon.
 falsification of evidence, conscious and unconscious, follows
 corrupting both the intellect and the heart.

 if there is a god, he has nothing to fear from truth.
 as to imaginary gods and there followers: be afraid. be very
 afraid.
