 					pardon me, a humble atheist, but exactly what is the difference
 between holding a revealed truth with blind faith as its basis (i.e.
 regardless of any evidence that you may find to the contrary) as an
 absolute truth, fully expecting people to believe you and arrogance?
 
      they sound like one and the same to me.
 
      and nearly every time i meet a christian (or for that matter, any
 other theist) who tries to convert me, i find this proven over and over
 again.
 
      i see no wisdom whatsoever in your words

      p.s.  if you do sincerely believe that a god exists, why do you follow
 it blindly?  
 
      do the words "question authority" mean anything to you?
 
      i defy any theist to reply.
