 although i'm neither fundamentalist nor evangelical, i have often noticed
 this trend in the media.  in short, it is permissable to bash fundamentalists.
 no need to substitue a nationality such as "mexican..." try simply to 
 substitute a different religion "...raised by muslim parents," or "...raised
 by jewish parents..."  the paper simply would not do this.
