 the apocryphal books that are in the septuagint were part of the canon 
 used by the greek-speaking churches from the inception of the church.
 they were not added later (or much later).  this is a common misconception.
 
 the preference of the hebrew canon over the greek canon is a later
 innovation.   the church did not need to be guided to "add" the books
 since they were part of the faith once received by the apostles and
 passed to the church.
