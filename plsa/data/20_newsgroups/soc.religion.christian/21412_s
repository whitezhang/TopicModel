 i agree, with the exception that i don't preach ignoring our cultures.

 in revelation 2-3, we see that in the first century church, there was one
 congregation in each major city.  so there was one unified church.  now in
 each city, there were people of different cultures.  naturally, they
 formed something of a stew, with different members having different
 heritages.  nevertheless, they were one body.  they met together,
 sometimes as smaller groups in their homes and sometimes in bigger groups
 in places such as the temple courts.
 
 now in a particular city, then and now, you will find that there is a
 common language associated with that region.  for instance, in rome, latin
 was spoken.  in the united states today, english is spoken.  so it would
 make sense that congregations in different cities would speak the common
 language and not necessarily latin.
 
 naturally, you would expect the lead evangelist to preach in the common
 language.  in the first century church, there were probably many people
 in the congregation who could speak a given tongue to translate the
 message for people of foreign ethnic groups.  today, however, you don't
 see people speaking in tongues to translate sermons, even in so-called
 pentacostal churches.  we do have a modern day equivalent though --
 bi-lingual speakers.  now in the unified church of which i am a member -
 sometimes called the international churches of christ, when we all meet
 together on sundays, there are headphones on people who don't speak
 english from which they hear an ongoing translation of the sermon in their
 native tongue.  neat idea, huh?
 
 now, we meet in different size groups in a random sort of way on sundays,
 so sometimes there will be a meeting of only haitians or of spanish-
 speaking people, for example, who will hear an evangelist preach in their
 native language.  in addition, we meet in small groups a couple of times
 during the week for bible discussion groups and devotionals.  so someone
 who speaks a different language will almost always be with people who also
 speak his language (assuming the congregation is large enough) for those
 meetings.
 
 as for the people who speak the common language, they can keep in touch
 with their culture, if they want, but they will also have equally deep
 friendships among their church relationships with people of many various
 nationalities.  
 
 >has the purpose of the church been thwarted by this action?
 
 the action of letting catholics worship in a native language instead of
 latin?  indeed not!  see my second paragraph in response to the second
 clipping of your article.
 
 however, if you mean the action of forming denominations based on a
 culture, then the purpose of the church has been indeed thwarted.
 
 i'll assume the second possiblility when answering your next clipping.

 you have met some needs of people, certainly, by helping them to be proud
 of their cultural heritages when most denominations didn't.  yet you have
 largely isolated yourselves from having quality "christian" friendships
 outside your nationality (and your denomination).
 
 we shall certainly give people a place to feel comfortable with their
 heritage.  however, we will do this in a way that does not destroy church
 unity, but rather encourages friendships among all disciples.
 
 >this is the approach of some of the groups that you cite. 
 
 it sounds like these groups have wonderful intentions, but they are going
 about things in the wrong way.  and names like the african methodist
 episcopal church still make me cringe, although not as much as before.
 
 i understand that there was more racism in the past that caused such
 groups to be formed, but now we should try to unite.  i know that it's
 hard for many people on this newsgroup to imagine there being only one
 body of people on earth, but it is quite possible, and i am working to
 make it happen.  however, what might be a smaller step towards unity,
 would be taking the word "african" out of your denomination's name.  then
 perhaps someday a long time off, you can also remove the "methodist
 episcopal" part also, and simply be part of "the church".

 there shall be one church, for the sake of unity, and it shall be useful
 in helping students new to america make the transition in culture,
 language, and thought.  we shouldn't make a new denomination to try to
 solve problems.  the whole denominational mindset only causes more
 problems, sadly.

 thank you for the invitation.  that shows me that you indeed have the
 heart to spread the gospel of jesus as well as take part in your cultural
 heritage.  thank you also for responding to my post.  i know (all too well)
 how they can be very time-consuming.
 
 the whole idea of celebrating your culture is paved with good intentions,
 but i still feel that you must restore and preserve unity at the same
 time.  my own church, the boston church, has the acapella singing that you
 mentioned in your post, yet doesn't limit expression of my mexican
 culture, even though i am in the mit campus ministry and not the spanish
 (speaking) zone.  i have made a commitment to god that i will go to the
 sunday services of my church, because i know that my brothers and sisters
 here are fully devoted in love for god as his disciples.
 
 i don't believe in tongues, as you may have already picked up on, because
 of my understanding of biblical christianity.  however, i am certainly
 willing to visit your congregation provided that it doesn't interfere with
 my normal worship.  since you also live in cambridge, i also extend an
 invitation to you to visit our services as often as you like.  you can
 meet the mit students at the student center (across from 77 mass. ave.) at
 9am on sundays to leave for worship or simply call me after wednesday
 night to find out where the service will be held on a particular day.
 my number is 225-7598, but will be 354-1357 in a few weeks from now and
 for the rest of the summer.  our service normally last from 10am to noon,
 but occasionally are later or earlier (1-3 times per year).

 definitely!
 
 let's also strive to grow in obedience to the lord through being men and
 women after god's own heart.
