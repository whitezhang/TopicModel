 well, suppose your mother was a crack addict and crack user/abuser while
 she was pregnant? suppose your husband gave you some sdt (this recently
 happened to a close friend of my wife and mine)?
 
 often, the consequences of our sin are at least partially inflicted on
 innocent people. several times in the ot, this is pointed out, even
 saying that descendants would suffer consequences for a person's sin
 for several generations. even today, we see multi-generational (to
 coin a phrase) effects from alcoholism, child abuse, and spousal
 abuse just to name three.
 
 so, god's definition of fair and ours differ.
 
 some points of perspective:
 
 though the predisposition towards sinning is now inbred (see webster's
 first definition of inbred) thanks to adam, it is arrogant and foolish
 for any of us to think we would have done any different if we were in
 their shoes. i know myself pretty well, and i'm just not that good. take
 god's word for it, neither are you. "there is no one righteous..."
 
 more important, when a person decides to be a disciple of jesus, god
 promises supernatural help in overcoming our physical self's sinful
 tendency. we can, of course, choose to ignore this help. (rom 7,8)
 
 "...god made mankind upright, but men have gone in search of many
 schemes." -eccl
