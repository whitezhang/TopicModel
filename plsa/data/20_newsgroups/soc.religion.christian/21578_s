 this is too often true.  many people try to place this as a "higher"
 sin.  however...
 
 >does jesus need

 >jesus when he says he can forgive any sin?
 
 a big part of the problem is that many of the homosexuals and people
 advocating acceptance of homosexuality in churches do not consider
 (active) homosexuality a sin.  i don't often see the attitude of
 "forgive me and i will try to change".  instead i see "there's nothing
 wrong with my life and i can be a good christian, so it must be you who
 have an illness because you don't accept me".  christians can and will
 accept homosexuals, just as they will accept *any* sinner.
 
 sure, it may be natural to some people to be homosexual - but it
 is also perfectly natural for everyone to sin!  i was born with
 a desire to sin, but i work to prevent myself from sinning.  it's
 much less common now, but i *still* have urges to lash out in
 anger.  there also may not be a sudden disappearance of sinful
 desires (or ever!), so it is sad to see people leave the church
 when they are discouraged that they are still homosexual after
 several years.
