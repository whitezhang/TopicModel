 my, this distinction seems quite arbitrary.
 
   blessed is the man whose iniquities are forgiven, whose sin is covered.
   (ps. 32:1).
 
 and quoted by the apostle paul:
 
   even as david also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom god
   imputeth righteousness without works,
   saying, blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins
   are covered.
   blessed is the man to whom the lord will not impute sin.  (rom. 4:6-8)
 
 the biblical perspective seems to be that foregiveness and covering are
 parallel/equivalent concepts in both testaments.  the dispensational
 distinction is unwarranted.

 i'm sure rex has scripture to back this up.  you're suggesting jesus is
 going to travel around dealing with individual violations of his law -- for
 millions perhaps billions of people.  such activity for moses the lawgiver
 was considered unwise (cf. ex. 18:13ff).  it makes for interesting
 speculation, though.
 
 i'll leave comments on the so-called "bema seat" vs. "throne" judgments to
 someone else.  this also seems like more unnecessary divisions ala
 dispensationalism.
