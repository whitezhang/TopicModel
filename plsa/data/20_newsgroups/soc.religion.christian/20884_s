 : [i have some qualms about postings like this.  you might want to
 : engage in a bit more conversation with joel before deluging 
 : someone who doesn't expect it with cards.  --clh]
 
 i'd suggest that more than _some_ qualms are in order.  without knowing
 anything about the situation, it is impossible to evaluate the
 appropriateness of writing.  some folks will check, others with more
 zeal than time may not.
 
 imho, requests of this nature should be made only for oneself or for someone
 who knows and approves of the idea.  otherwise, it is intrusive and
 disrespectful of the individual.
