 which means he has absolutely no idea about what the assumption is.
 
 however greatly we extoll mary, it is quite obvious that she is in no
 way god or even part of god or equal to god.  the assumption of our
 blessed mother, meant that because of her close identification with the
 redemptive work of christ, she was assumed (note that she did not
 ascend) body and soul into heaven, and is thus one of the few, along
 with elijah, enoch, moses (maybe????) who are already perfected in
 heaven.  obviously, the virgin mary is far superior in glorification to
 any of the previously mentioned personages.
 
 jung should stick to psychology rather than getting into theology.
