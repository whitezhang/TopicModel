 i'm wondering if anyone knows the answer to a rather trivial question which
 i've been thinking about: what was the process used to divide the bible into
 verses. i believe jerome divided the new testament, but i've never seen any
 discussion of *how* he did this. it seems rather arbitrary, as opposed to, for
 example, making each sentence a verse.
