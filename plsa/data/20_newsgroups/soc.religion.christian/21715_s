 the problem with this view is that the topic under discussion in this
 passage *is* marriages that were performed on earth.  jesus' words
 seem to me to indicate that he regards his response as the answer to their
 question about which earthly marriage would be valid after the resurrection.
 this being the case, the most straightforward interpretation, in my
 opinion, is that marriage does not exist in the next life because those
 who are raised are of a different nature than what we are now.  other-
 wise, why would jesus offer "but are like the angels in heaven" as a
 contrast to the idea of the resurrected marrying and being given in
 marriage?  we do not have angel-like natures now, but someday we shall,
 and when we do, our earthly marriages will be irrelevant.  or at least,
 that's what i think jesus is saying about the post-resurrection validity of 
 marriages performed on earth.  your mileage may vary. :)
