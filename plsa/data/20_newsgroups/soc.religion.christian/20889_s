 it is funny how this one little quote from genesis is treated
 by certain anti-christians as if christians have been given a
 firm command to destroy the earth. you could prove almost
 anything by taking little quotes out of context from the bible
 - it's a big book, you know. i doubt you could find a single
 case of a anti-ecological action taking place specifically
 because teh perpetrator was motivated by a christian belief.
 
 as for the nazis, they were motivated by german nationalism,
 not by christianity. in fact they despised christianity as a
 weak pacifist religion, and were much more keen on pagan
 glorification of strength and warfare. they killed the jews
 because they were not germans, not because they were
 "christ-killers" - they were just as keen on killing the other
 non-german ethnic minority, the romanies or gypsies.
