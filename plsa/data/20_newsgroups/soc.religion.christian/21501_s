 after reading the posts on this newsgroup for the pasts 4 months, it 
 has become apparent to me that this group is primarily active with 
 liberals, catholics, new agers', and athiests.  someone might think 
 to change the name to:  soc.religion.any   - or -  perhaps even
 soc.religion.new.  it might seem to be more appropriate.
 heck, don't flame me, i'm catholic, gay, and i voted 
 for bill clinton.  i'm on your side!
