 i would not swear that nothing of the sort is found in the iliad,
 but the first passage i thought of was the odyssey 11:480 or
 thereabouts (my copy has no line numbers). the ghost of acchilles
 speaks (robert fitzgerald translation):

 the next passage i thought of was from ecclesiastes 9:4
 
  + a living dog is better than a dead lion.

 surely aristotle had little influence on christian thought before
 about 1250 ad.
