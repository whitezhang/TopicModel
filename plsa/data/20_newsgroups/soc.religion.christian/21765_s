 it's always a two-way street.  god gave her the grace to avoid sin,
 thus when she was visited by gabriel, she gave her fiat, her total
 acceptance of god's will.  this fiat summarizes why catholics regard 
 her as the highest of all humans, that god chose her and that she
 accepted.  knowing this in advance, we extrapolate that she was
 neither stained by nor subject to original sin.
 
 god did create us all miraculously free to choose or not choose to sin.
 "sufficient for the day is the evil thereof and the grace of god to
 command it."  this amount of grace was precisely determined by god
 to be the amount required to do what god asked of her.  the grace
 given to each of us is also enough, but we do not always choose
 to accept it.  we also believe jesus was fully human and never
 sinned.  
 
 god could have created a much better person than myself, one who
 always chose the right thing, yet he created me instead, despite
 my flaws.  he proves he loves me as i am, continually drawing me
 towards perfection.  for whatever purpose he has for me, he has
 confidence that i will accomplish it.  if i ask god to repeat his
 miraculous creation of the mother of his son, where will that leave me?
