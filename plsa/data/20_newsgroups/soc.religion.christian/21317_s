 i sinned. and straightway, posthaste, satan flew
 before the presence of the most high god
 and made a railing accusation there.
 he said, "this soul, this thing of clay and sod,
 has sinned. 'tis true that he has named thy name;
 but i demand his death, for thou hast said,
 'the soul that sinneth, it shall die.' shall not
 thy sentence be fulfilled? is justice dead?
 send now this wretched sinner to his doom!
 what other thing can righteous ruler do?"
 thus satan did accuse me day and night;
 and every word he spoke, o  god, was true!
 
 then quickly one rose up from god's right hand,
 before whose glory angels veiled their eyes;
 he spoke, "each jot and tittle of the law
 must be fulfilled; the guilty sinner dies!
 but wait -- suppose his guilt were all transferred
 to me and that i paid his penalty!
 behold my hands, my side, my feet! one day
 i was made sin for him and died that he
 might be presented, faultless, at thy throne!"
 and satan flew away.  full well he knew
 that he could not prevail against such love,
 for every word my dear lord spoke was true!

 i heard this poem read last night and wanted to share it with other 
 subscribers of this newsgroup.  it's such a wonderful blessing to see how 
 secure our salvation is because the lord jesus paid for what he did not owe 
 because we had a debt which we were not capable to pay.
 
 thanks and praise be to the savior, the lord jesus christ, who is seated at 
 the right hand of the majesty on high, making intercession for us.
