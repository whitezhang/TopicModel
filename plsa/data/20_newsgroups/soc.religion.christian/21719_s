 hi everyone,
 
 i'm trying to find my way to god, but find it difficult as i can't hear
 god talking to me, letting me know that he exists and is with me and
 that he knows me, and i feel that i can't possibly get to know him until
 he does. maybe he _is_ talking to me but i just don't know or understand
 how to listen.
 
 some christians tell me that (in their opinion) the only way to find god
 is to take a plunge and commit your life to him, and you will discover.
 this idea of diving into the totally unknown is a little bit
 frightening, but i have a few questions.
 
 1) how do you actually commit yourself? if i just say, "ok god, her you
 go, i'm committing my life to you", i wouldn't really feel that he'd
 listened - at least, i couldn't be sure that he had. so how does one (or
 how did you) commit oneself to god?
 
 2) in committing myself in this way, what do i have to forfeit of my
 current life? what can i no longer do? i feel that i'm as 'good' as many
 christians, and i try to uphold the idea of 'loving your neighbour' - i
 don't go round killing people, stealing, etc., and i try not to get
 jealous of other people in any way - and i would say that i keep to the
 standards of treating other people as well as many christians. so what
 do i have to give up?
 
 3) when committed, what do i have to do? what does it involve? what (if
 any) burdens am i taking on?
 
 4) so then, what's the general difference before and after? i assume,
 that (like on your birthday you don't suddenly feel a year older) it
 won't suddenly change my life the day i commit myself. so what happens?
 
 5) how can i be sure that it is the right thing to do? how can i find
 out what the 'it' in the last sentence actually _is_?!
 
 thanks very much for all your help in answering these questions. perhaps
 e-mail would be a better way to reply, but it's up to you.
