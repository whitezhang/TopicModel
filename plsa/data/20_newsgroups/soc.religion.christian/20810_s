 
 	jesus was born a jew.  we have biblical accounts of
 both his mother's ancestry and his father's, both tracing back
 to david.  it seems reasonable to assume, therefore, that jesus
 was semitic.
 	as an interesting aside, jesus' being semitic makes him
 neither "white" nor "black," and in some sense underscores the
 point made earlier that his color was not important, it was his
 message, his grace, and his divinity that we should concentrate
 on.
 	finally, i would direct anyone interested in african
 involvement in the church to the account of the conversion of
 the ethiopian eunuch in acts chapter 9 (i think it's chapter
 9).  this is one of the earliest conversions, and the eunuch,
 treasurer to the queen of the ethiopians, was definitely
 african.  because "ethiopia" at that time indicated a region
 just south of egypt, many also speculate that this man was not
 only the first african christian, but the first black christian
 as well.  
 god bless,
