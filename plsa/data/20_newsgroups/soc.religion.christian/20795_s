 hi,
 
 i don't know much about bible. could you tell me the relations of
 christians with non-christians in bible? how should be the relations of
 christian nations with each other and the relations of christian nations
 with other nations who are not christians?
 
 the other question is about the concept of religion in bible. does the
 religion of god include and necessitate any law to be extracted from
 bible or is the religion only a belief and nothing to do with the
 government sides? if for example, any government or a nation is one of
 the wrongdoings according to bible, how should they be treated? 
 
 is there any statement in bible saying that bible is a guide for every
 aspects of life?  
 
 thank you.
 
 beytullah
