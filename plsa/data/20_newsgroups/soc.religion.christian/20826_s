 for the record:
 
 on february 5, 1981, at a house of representatives
 interior committee meeting, rep. james weaver (d, ore), asked watt
 whether "you agree that we should save some of our scenic resources
 for our children, not just gobble them up all at once?" watt's
 answer was:
 
  < absolutely. that is the delicate balance the secretary of the
  < interior must have -- to be steward for the natural resources

 op-ed page of the washington post for friday 21 august 1981.
