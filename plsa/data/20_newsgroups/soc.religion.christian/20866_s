 there was a recent discussion of dungeons and dragons and other role
 playing games.  since there is a lot of crossover between gamers and
 science fiction and fantasy fans, i will mention that i am the editor
 and publisher of radio free thulcanra, a christian-oriented science
 fiction fanzine.  it is not a christian magazine with a special
 interest in science fiction.  it is a science fiction fanzine with a
 special interest in christianity.  gaming is not a major topic of
 discussion but it has come up in some letters.  (no, there are no
 arguments about whether d&d is satanic.  people who think it is are
 not likely to be reading rft.)  anyway, i am now working on the april
 issue.  i will send a sample copy to any reader of
 soc.religion.christian who requests it.  it is printed on paper, so
 requests should include a snail-mail address.
