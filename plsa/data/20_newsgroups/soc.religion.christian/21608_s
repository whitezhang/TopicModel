 early in church history, the catechumens were dismissed prior to the celebration 
 of the eucharist.  it was secret, giving rise to the rumors that christians
 were cannibals and all sorts of perverse claims.  the actions were considered
 too holy to be observed by non-christians, as well as potentially dangerous
 for the individual christian who might be identified.
