 for your first set of questions (regarding the energy and will of christ)
 i quote to you the relevant part of the statement signed by both eastern
 (chalcedonian) and oriental (non-chalcedonian) orthodox scholars a few
 years ago (both families = both orthodox churches) :
 
 1. both  families  agreed in  condemning  the eutychian heresy. both  families
 confess that the logos, the second person  of the holy  trinity, only begotten
 of the father before the ages  and consubstantial with  him, was incarnate and
 was born from the virgin mary theotokos; fully consubstantial with us, perfect
 man with soul, body and mind  ($  \nu o  \upsilon \zeta $); he  was crucified,
 died, was  buried and rose  from the dead on  the third day, ascended   to the
 heavenly father, where he sits on the right hand of the father as  lord of all
 creation. at  pentecost, by the coming of  the  holy spirit he  manifested the
 church as his body. we look forward to his coming again in the fullness of his
 glory, according to the scriptures.
 
 2. both  families condemn the  nestorian heresy and the crypto-nestorianism of
 theodoret of  cyrus. they agree that it  is not sufficient merely  to say that
 christ is consubstantial both with his father  and with us, by  nature god and
 by nature man; it is necessary to affirm also that the logos, who is by nature
 god,  became by  nature   man, by his  incarnation  in the fullness  of  time.
 
 3. both families agree  that the hypostasis of the  logos became  composite by
 uniting to his divine uncreated nature with its natural will and energy, which
 he has  in common with  the father and  the holy spirit, created human nature,
 which he assumed  at the incarnation  and made  his own, with its natural will
 and energy.
 
 4. both families agree  that the natures  with their proper energies and wills
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 are united hypostatically and  naturally   without confusion, without  change,
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 without  division and without separation,  and that they are distinguished  in
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 thought alone.
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 
 5. both families agree that he who wills and acts is always the one hypostasis
 of the logos incarnate.

 i guess that adresses your question adequately.
 
 as for your second set of questions, i am afraid they are irrelevant to the
 discussion (at least from my point of view) of monophysitism. i do not see
 how they relate to the topic we are discussing (other than to start an
 endless orthodox-rc debate which i do not plan to engage into). as a brief
 answer to your questions, the position of the coptic orthodox church 
 regarding the roman pontiff, his jurisdiction, his infalability, etc.
 is exactly the same as all the other orthodox churches.
 
 peace,
