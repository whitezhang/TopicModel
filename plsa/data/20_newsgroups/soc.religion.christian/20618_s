 i don't meant to defend eric molas- i find it somewhat annoying when
 someone pops up on alt.atheism to tell us all about his (usually
 atheistic) beliefs, so i can certainly see how christians might be
 annoyed- but i'd like to point out a few things.

 "no meaning from god" is not the same as "no meaning". from my (atheistic)
 point of view, if you want meaning in your life, you get to go and
 get some or make some.
 
 no free gifts of meaning. (i never quite understood how any
 god can just "give" your life meaning, actually. if he
 says you exists to do or be x, that gives you a purpose
 if you care to accept it, but is that the same thing? but
 i digress...)

 >because one fears death more than life.
 
 this would truely be a miserably existance, which i doubt eric
 endures. life can be enjoyable, so you can live it because you like
 it, or purposefull, so you can live it to get something done. one should
 endeavour to make it so, if it is not. otherwise it would be as you say.
 terrible.

 probably true. remeber he almost certainly sees that particular joy as
 an illusion, and does not want it. so maybe it isn't so bad?

 as an atheist, i am free to be a human person. i think, love, choose,
 and create.
 
 > i will live forever with god.
 
 ah, now here we begin to diverge. i will not live forever
 with anyone.
 
 (i don't think you will either, but you are welcome to your
 opinion on the matter.)
 
 >christ is not a kind of drug.
 
 i tend to agree with you.
 
 it's my opinion that (unlike drugs) religions are normal
 parts of human societies.
 
 i think they have outlived their usefullness, but they
 are evidently quite ordinary, normal things that haven't
 proved lethal to humanity yet.

 i have heard this claim quite a few times. does anybody here know
 who first came up with the "god-shaped hole" business?

 you might want to provide some evidence next time you make a claim
 like this.

 i don't know eric, but i do not think it is wise to assume he has a less
 joy-filled and abundant life because he holds certain beliefs.
