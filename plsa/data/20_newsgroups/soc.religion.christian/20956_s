 most of you will have probably seen the news by the time you read this,
 but the branch davidian compound is no more.  this morning about 6:00,
 the feds punched holes in the compound walls by using a tank.  they 
 then started using non-lethal tear gas.  shortly after noon, 2 cult
 members were seen setting fire to the compound.  so far, about 20-30
 people have been seen outside the compound.  the fate of the other 60 or
 70 people is unknown, neither is the fate of the 17 children that were
 inside.  the compound did burn to the ground.
 
 koresh, who at times has claimed to be the messiah, but then backed off
 and only claimed to be a prophet, had promised several times to come
 out peacefully if his demands were met.  first, he demanded that his
 message be broadcast on the radio, which it was, but he didn't come out.
 he claimed to be waiting for a message from god.  finally, he said that
 god told him that he needed to decipher the mystery of the 7 seals in
 revelation, and when he was finished, he'd come out.  he finished the
 first one, but didn't do any more work that anyone knows of since then.
 the federal agents did warn him that if they didn't come out, they 
 would be subjected to tear gas.
 
 i think it's really sad that so many people put their faith in a mere
 man, even if he did claim to be the son of god, and/or a prophet.  i
 think it underscores the importance of putting you faith only in
 things that are eternal and knowing for yourself what the scriptures
 say and what they mean, instead of relying on others to do it for you,
 even if those others are learned and mean well.
