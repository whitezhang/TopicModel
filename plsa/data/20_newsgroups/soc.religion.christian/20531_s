 	"and in that day you will ask me no question.  truly, truly, i say to 
 	you, if you shall ask the father for anything, he will give it to you 
 	in my name.  until now you have asked for nothing in my name; ask, and 
 	you will receive, that your joy may be made full."
 				-john 16:23-24
 
 i don't believe that we necessarily have to say " . . . in christ's name.  
 amen," for our prayers to be heard, but it glorifies the son, when we 
 acknowledge that our prayer is made possible by him.  i believe that just as 
 those who were saved in the ot, could only be saved because jesus would one day
 reconcile god to man, he is the only reason their prayers would be heard by 
 god.
 
 	for all of us have become like one who is unclean,
 	and all our righteous deeds are like a filthy garment;
 	and all of us wither like a leaf,
 	and our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.
 				-isaiah 64:6, nas
 
 our prayers like the rest of our deeds are too unholy to go directly to the
 father because they are tainted by our sin.  only by washing these prayers with
 christ's blood are they worthy to be lifted to to the father.
 
 	"first, i thank my god through christ jesus . . ."
 				-romans 1:8, nas
 
 some scholars believe that this is paul recognizing that even his thanks are 
 too unholy for the father.
 	basically, prayer is a gift of grace, i believe that only through jesus
 do our prayers have any power; thus, praying in his name glorifies and praises 
 jesus for this beautiful and powerful gift he has given us.
