 i'll post also.)

 your boss should be the person bring these problems to.  if he/she
 does not seem to take any action, keep going up higher and higher.
 sexual harrassment does not need to be tolerated, and it can be an
 enormous emotional support to discuss this with someone and know that
 they are trying to do something about it.  if you feel you can not
 discuss this with your boss, perhaps your company has a personnel
 department that can work for you while preserving your privacy.  most
 companies will want to deal with this problem because constant anxiety
 does seriously affect how effectively employees do their jobs.
 
 it is unclear from your letter if you have done this or not.  it is
 not inconceivable that management remains ignorant of employee
 problems/strife even after eight years (it's a miracle if they do
 notice).  perhaps your manager did not bring to the attention of
 higher ups?  if the company indeed does seem to want to ignore the
 entire problem, there may be a state agency willing to fight with
 you.  (check with a lawyer, a women's resource center, etc to find out)
 
 you may also want to discuss this with your paster, priest, husband,
 etc.  that is, someone you know will not be judgemental and that is
 supportive, comforting, etc.  this will bring a lot of healing.

 this happens to a lot of people.  honest.  i believe it may seem
 to be due to gross insensitivity because of the feelings you are
 going through.  people in offices tend to be more insensitive while
 working than they normally are (maybe it's the hustle or stress or...)
 i've had this happen to me a lot, often because they didn't realize
 my car was broken, etc.  then they will come back and wonder why i
 didn't want to go (this would tend to make me stop being angry at
 being ignored and make me laugh).  once, we went off without our
 boss, who was paying for the lunch :-)
 
 >for this
 >reason i hope good mr. moderator allows me this latest indulgence.
 
 well, if you can't turn to the computer for support, what would
 we do?  (signs of the computer age :-)
 
 in closing, please don't let the hateful actions of a single person
 harm you.  they are doing it because they are still the playground
 bully and enjoy seeing the hurt they cause.  and you should not
 accept the opinions of an imbecile that you are worthless - much
 wiser people hold you in great esteem.
