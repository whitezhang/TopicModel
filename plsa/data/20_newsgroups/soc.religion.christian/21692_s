 ever since i was a kid and learned to tell when i was in a 
 dream i have used my dreams for fantasies or working out problems.
 in my dreams i have done everything from yell at my mom
 to machine-gunning zombies, not to mention myriad sexual
 fantasies. i have deliberately done things that i would never
 do in real life. i understand the need to control ones
 thoughts, but i always felt that dreams were format free,
 no morals, no ethics, no physical laws, (though sometimes i would 
 have to wake myself up to go to the bathroom.)
 
 is this an incorrect attitude? rather than weakening my inhibitions,
 i could argue that i got certain things "out of my system" by 
 experiencing them in dreams. by analyzing a dream i can determine
 if i have a problem with a certain situation, i.e. in a dream
 something will be exagerated that i can then contemplate and
 see if it really bothers me or not.
 
 i can't believe that other people don't do the same. it seems 
 silly to attach moral significance to dreams.
 
 i think that this is entirely different from out of body
 experiences, which i have never had.
 
 contradictions welcome.
