 there is a big difference between the status of what you refer to as
 alexandrians (actually, this includes all oriental orthodox churches
 and not only copts) and that of nestorians. the oriental orthodox
 churches never even "shelter" eutyches (the advocator of monophysitism)
 but on the contrary, it condemned (and still does condemn) him and his
 heresy. that is why the eastren (chalcedonian) orthodox church held
 talks with the oriental (non-chalcedonian) that started 30 years ago
 and still continueing till today, but they have converged on many
 issues the most imporatant of which is christology (i have more 
 details of the inter-orthodox dialogue, in case anyone is interested).
 so i do not see how the "alexandrians" and the nestorians are in a
 similar position.
