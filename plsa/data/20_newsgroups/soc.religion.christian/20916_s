 	anyone know anything about the interdisciplinary bible research
 institute, operating out of hatfield, pa?
 
 	i'm really interested in their theories on old-earth
 (as opposed to young earth) and what they believe about evolution.
 
 	thanks,
 		in the master,
 
 		charley.

                           piercing pleasure.
        
        seek pleasure and you will find boredom, disillusionment        
                       and enslavement.

 [note that i do not accept discussions of evolution here, as there
 is a dedicated group for that, talk.origins.  --clh]
