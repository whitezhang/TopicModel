 according to mdbs@ms.uky.edu, muslims tithe 1/6 of their income.
 
 perhaps there are some offshoots of islam that impose this on their
 followers.  but the standard tithe is 1/40 of one's net worth, once
 a year.
 
 the same writer also objects to the bible for teaching that
 
  > "woman was created after man, to be his helper" etc.
 
 this is presumably a reference to genesis 2. suppose that that
 chapter had been written with the sexes reversed. we have god
 creating woman, and then saying, "it is not good that woman should
 be alone. i will make a help meet for her." feminists would be
 outraged. the clear implication would be that god had started at the
 bottom and worked up, making first the plants, then the fish and
 birds, then the beasts, then woman, and finally his masterpiece, the
 male chauvinist pig. the statement that woman is not capable of
 functioning by herself, that she needs a man to open doors for her,
 would have been seen as a particularly gratuitous insult. the fact
 that the creation of woman from the dust of the ground was given
 only briefly and in general, while the creation of the man was given
 in six times the number of words, would have been cited as evidence
 of the author's estimate of the relative importance of the sexes.
 the verdict would have been unequivocal. "no self-respecting woman
 can accept this book as a moral guide, or as anything but sexist
 trash!" i suggest that moses, fearing this reaction, altered his
 original draft and described the creation with adam first and then
 eve, so as to appease miriam and other radical feminists of the day.
 for some reason, however, it did not work.
