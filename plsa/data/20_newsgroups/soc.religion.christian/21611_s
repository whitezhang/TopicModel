 if you were to start your own religion, this would be fine.  but there
 is no scriptural basis for your statement, in fact it really gets to
 the heart of the problem.  you think you know more than scripture.
 your faith is driven by feel goodism and not by the word of god.  just
 because they are nice people doesn't make it right.  you can start all
 the churches you want and it won't change the fact that it is wrong.
 that is not to imply that gays don't deserve the same love and
 forgiveness that anyone else does.  but to call their behavior right
 just because they are nice people is baseless, and it offers satan a
 perfect place to work because there is no check on what he is doing.
 
 [i suspect ann was suggesting that you look to see whether the
 spirit is alive among them, not whether they are nice people,
 though there's something to be said for being nice too... --clh]
