    this is no less logical than the assumption that if something is
 _not_ in the bible, then it _must not_ be done.  but i don't really
 think that's what he's saying anyway.  see below.

    what about the letter to philemon?  in it paul at least hints that a
 certain slave be released.  also, slavery in those times was not the
 same as the type of slavery we had in the u.s.  i think a better
 comparison would be to indentured servitude.  i don't really want to get
 into a discussion on slavery.  anyway, although it does demonstrate your
 point, i don't think it is relevent, because the original poster did not
 say that absence of specific condemenation proves something is not
 immoral.
 
    back to the original poster's assertion.  he is not in fact making
 the logical error of which you accuse him.  he stated the fact that the
 bible does not say that babies cannot be baptized.  also, we know that
 the bible says that _everyone_ must be baptized to enter heaven.
 _everyone_ includes infants, unless there is other scripture to the
 contrary, i.e. an exception.  since there is no exception listed in the
 bible, we must assume (to be on the safe side) that the bible means what
 it says, that _everyone_ must be baptized to enter heaven.  and so we
 baptize infants.
 
    to summarize, you accused the original poster of saying if something
 is not forbidden by the bible, then that proves it is ok; i.e. if
 something cannot be disproven, it is true.  he rather seemed to be
 asserting that since the bible does not forbid, _you cannot prove_,
 using the bible, that it is _not_ ok.  there is a difference between
 proving whether or not something can be proven or disproven (there are
 theories on provability in the field of logic, by the way) and actually
 proving or disproving it.  the other logical error we must avoid falling
 into is the converse: that if something cannot be proven, then it is
 false.  this seems to be the error of many _sola scriptura_ believers.
 
    i think the only thing that can be proven here is that one cannot use
 scripture alone to prove something either way about infant baptism,
 although the evidence seems to me to favor it.
