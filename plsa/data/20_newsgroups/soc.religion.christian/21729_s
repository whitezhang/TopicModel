 the phrase is "eulogemene su en gunaixin"- "blessed are you among women."
 there is nothing to indicate that this is an exceptional or unique status,
 only that _as a woman_ mary was blessed.  adding the word "all" is not
 a fair reading of the text.  there are some good reasons for the church's
 veneration of mary, but they cannot depend on this verse.
