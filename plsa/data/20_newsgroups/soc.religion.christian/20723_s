 dear will,
 
 i've never replied on this thing before so i hope it gets thru ok.
 i had a few thoughts!:
 
 "faith on its own, if not accompanied by action is dead" - james 2:17
 
 faith is both belief and action.
 if i say that i am a great swimmer but i never go swimming, am i really a
 swimmer? and will people believe that i am?
 likewise if i say i'm a christian but i never talk to god, am i really a
 christian? my faith is demonstrated by my action. the fact that we talk to
 god proves we have faith. satan believes in god but does not follow him!
 
 in a similar vein, i have recently been challenged by 1john2:3-6
 v3 says "we know that we have come to know him if we obey his commands"
 i find this verse quite encouraging as it could imply that 'if we have
 come to know him, then we'll obey his commands' cos he lives within us and
 we cannot help but obey what he says.
 i tend to feel that as we daily submit ourself to god he will keep changing
 us into the likeness of jesus and his fruit and works will be automatically
 produced in our lives.
 
 hope this helps.
