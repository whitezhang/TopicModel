 i agree with carol here.  determining absolutes is, practically speaking, a
 waste of time.  and we easily forget that relative truth is, in fact relative.
 
 for example, i recently was asking some children the question "what temperature
 does water boil at?"  i got the answer 212 degrees consistently.  i asked
 if they knew what scale, and was told "it's just 212 degrees.  any scale.
 that's what all thermometers say."  well, that's sincere, and may be
 true in the experience of the speaker, but it is simply wrong.  it is not
 an absolute truth.  similarly, scripture is full of truth, which we should
 nurture and cherish, but trying to determine which parts are absolute truth
 and which parts are the manifestations of that in the context of the time
 and culture in which the text was penned is missing the point.  then religion
 easily becomes an intellectual head-trip, devoid of the living experience of 
 the indwelling trinity and becomes dead scholasticism, imo.

 this was a good example.  there may be an absolute truth behind the
 writing, but the simplest understanding of the passage is that the
 instructions apply to the corinthians, and not necessarily elsewhere.
 the instructions may reflect absolute truth in the context of first
 century culture and the particular climate at corinth, which was having
 a lot of trouble with order. is it absolute truth to me?  no.  and i 
 see no compelling, or even reasonable, reason that it should be.

 even the most die-hard literalists do not take all of the bible literally.
 i've yet to meet anyone who takes the verse "blessed is he who takes your
 babies and smashes their heads against the rocks" literally.  the bible
 was not printed or handed to us by god with color codings to tell us
 what parts should be interpreted which way.

 i agree.  very few.  and even if we knew them, personally, we may not be 
 able to express that in a way that still conveys absolute truth to another.
 the presence of absence of absolutes may not make any difference, since i
 know i can never fully apprehend an absolute if it walks up and greets me.

 i can't prove the existence of absolutes.  i can only rely upon my experience.
 i also trust god's revelation that we cannot fully comprehend the infinite.
 therefore we can't comprehend the absolutes.  so i don't need them.  
 i can never know the essence of god, only the energies by and through which
 god is manifested to god's creation.  so the reality can be that there are
 absolutes, but it is of no practical importance.  it's like claiming that the
 original scriptural autographs were perfect, but copies may not be.  swell.
 who cares?  it doesn't affect me in any practical useful way.  i might as 
 well believe that god has made a lot of electric blue chickens, and that they
 live on mars.  maybe god did.  so what? is that going to have any effect on 
 how i deal with my neighbor, or god?  whether or not i go to this or that
 cafeteria for lunch?  no.  
 
 this attitude leads many non-christians to believe that all christians
 are arrogant idiots incapable of critical reasoning.  christianity is true,
 wonderful and sensible.  it appeals to reason, since reason is an inner
 reflection of the logos of god.  explanations that violate that simply
 appear to be insecure authoritarian responses to a complex world.
 
 note:  i'm not claiming there is no place for authority. that'd be silly.
        there is a world of difference between authoritative and authoritarian.
        authoritative is en expression of authority that respects others.
        authoritarian is en expression of authority that fails to do that,
        and is generally agressive.  good parents (like god) are authoritative.
        many christians are simply authoritarian, and, not surprisingly, few 
        adults respond to this treatment.
