 i don't agree, but i can only speak for myself.  i have a good friend
 whose lifestyle is very sinful.  do i hate the things she does to herself
 and others?  yes.  do i hate her?  absolutely not.  in fact, she tells me
 repeatedly that i am the best friend she has in the world.  i care about
 her very much despite the fact that i hate how she lives her life.
 
 it's very easy to fall into the progression you describe above.  i've
 felt it with my friend more than once.  there is a very important 
 part of christianity that you've overlooked above and makes it possible
 to "love the sin but hate the sinner."  before i look at someone
 else's life and sin, i look to myself and am as disgusted by what i see
 in *me* as i see in others, probably more.  self-righteousness is
 contradictory to christianity and is what makes the progression you
 describe happen.  if a christian can truthfully quote paul and say, "wretched
 man that i am!" [romans 7:24 (nasb)], that christian will be able
 to love the sinner and hate the sin.  if we have the attitude of the pharisee 
 who said, "i thank thee that i am not like other men..." [luke 18:11 (nasb)],
 we will hate both.
