 i don't understand who this post is directed towards; who are you
 trying to convince? by its subject i would assume you are directing
 the argument towards people who do not believe that christ rose
 from the dead, but in your "proof," you use the bible exclusively.
 
 the post is therefore immediately useless to anyone who doesn't
 believe that the bible is an unadulterated truth, and to everyone
 else, it is just a reaffirmation of a belief already held. as far
 as i know, there is no disagreement between christians over
 the resurrection of christ.
 
 so my question is: what is the purpose of this post?
