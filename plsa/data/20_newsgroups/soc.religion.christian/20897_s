 i have been following this thread on talk.religion,
 soc.religion.christian.bible-study and here with interest.  i am amazed at
 the different non-biblical argument those who oppose the sabbath present. 
 
 one question comes to mind, especially since my last one was not answered
 from scripture.  maybe clh may wish to provide the first response.
 
 there is a lot of talk about the sabbath of the tc being ceremonial. 
 answer this:
 
 since the tc commandments is one law with ten parts on what biblical
 basis have you decided that only the sabbath portion is ceremonial?
 or you say that the seventh-day is the sabbath but not applicable to
 gentile christians.  does that mean the sabbath commandment has been
 annulled?  references please.
 
 if god did not intend his requirements on the jews to be applicable to
 gentile christians why did he make it plain that the gentiles were now
 grafted into the commonwealth of israel?

 [acts 15, rom 14:5, col 2:16, gal 4:10.  i believe we've gotten into
 a loop at this point.  this is one of those classic situations where
 both sides think they have clear scriptural support, and there's no
 obvious argument that is going to change anybody's mind.  i don't think
 we're going anything but repeating ourselves.  --clh]
