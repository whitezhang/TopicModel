 praise god!  i'm writing everyone to inform you that i have been
 accepted to the doctor of psychology program at fuller theological
 seminary in pasadena, ca.  i've been working long and hard to try to
 get in there and have said many hours of prayer.  i'm very excited for
 this opportunity, but also very nervous about it.
 
 i'd appreciate the prayers of the readers of this group for my preparation
 for school this summer and for my career as a graduate student.  i'd also
 appreciate any information any of the readers of this group might have 
 about fuller, pasadena, or california in general, like good places to
 have fun, good churches to check out, or anything else that might be
 good for me to know.  also, if anyone knows of any foundations that 
 might have funding or scholarship money available, please let me know!
 of course, if you wish to make a personal contribution.....:)
 
 the contract for my current job is over at the end of april.  i'll be
 taking a couple classes at ut this summer and then i'll be moving to
 pasadena.  hopefully, i'll be able to get net.access next fall, although
 fuller doesn't have it itself.
 
 i've enjoyed the interesting discussions and i commend everyone for their
 earnest search to please god.  thanks to our moderator for providing
 such a wonderful service and in doing a great job of running this news
 group.
 
 may god bless you all.  vaya con dios, mi amigas y amigos.
 
 paul
