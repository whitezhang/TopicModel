 fine, but one of the points of this entire discussion is that "we"
 (conservative, reformed christians - this could start an argument...
 but isn't this idea that homosexuality is ok fairly "new" [this
 century] ? is there any support for this being a viable viewpoint
 before this century? i don't know.) don't believe that homosexuality
 is "acceptable to him". so your scripture quotation doesn't work for
 "us".
