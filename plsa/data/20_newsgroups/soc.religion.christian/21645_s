 interesting point.  the bible doesn't say "hate the sin".
 it tells to avoid sin, resist sin, even, when necessary, denounce sin.
 but not hate.

 [the following passages all talk about god or people god approves of
 hating sin or some other action.  ps 119:113 also talks about hating
 the sinner.  i believe there are other passages that would talk about
 hating someone who is evil, but i didn't turn them up in this search
 (which was on the word "hate" in the kjv, though i've crosschecked
 each passage in the nrsv).
 
 ps 97:10, 101:3, 105:25, 119:104, 113, 128, 163, , 139:21-22
 prov 6:16, 8:13
