 i won't quote any of it, but there are several errors in the article.
 not things that are just differences of opinion, but the writer just
 plain has his facts confused.
 
 for example, kip mckean was *asked* to come to the lexington church
 by the leaders there. he brought no team. he actually had been in
 charleston, il up to that point. he had many friends, even leaders in
 gainesville, telling him not to go, because people in the northeast
 weren't "open" and he'd be wasting his time and talents. really!!
 (this fact was a kind of "inside joke" at one point after the church
 in boston took off so well... not open, indeed!) ;-)
 
 i could take it on point by point, but i am not in a position to know
 one way or the other about some things in the article. i just wanted
 to point out that it contains misinformation.
