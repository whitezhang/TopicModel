 like we have never heard of, or read these verses before?
 
 how about you read them in context, taking into consideration the times and 
 places in which they were written; the local customs and pagan rituals; 
 what the surrounding verses are talking about and how they interact with 
 the rest of the bible.
 
 there are many issues in the bible that are argued, and can be argued 
 successfullly from both sides of an issue.  some examples that come to mind
 are 
 		gifts of the spirit
 		when the rapture will occur(pre or post tribulation)
 		how people should be baptized
 to name a few.
 
 i have found nothing in scripture that condemns me, or anyone else, for having
 a monogamous relationship with the person whom i love, even if we are the
 same sex.
 
 i'm sorry if i am coming across as heated.  it's just that the lord has been
 so dear to me the last several years and i'm tired of hearing this same old
 thing from people who believe what their told rather than finding out for 
 themselves.
 
 check it out for yourself.  invite the holy spirit to guide you.  if i weren't
 confident of this i wouldn't invite you to do this.
 
 god bless
