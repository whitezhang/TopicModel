 hi i am a sociology student and i am currently researching into 
 young offenders.  i am looking at the way various groups of 
 children are raised at home.  at the moment i am formlulating 
 information on discipline within the christian home.
 
 please, if you are a parent in this catagory can you email me 
 your response to the following questionaire.  all responses 
 will be treated confidentially and will only be used to prepare 
 stats.
 
 1.  ages & sexes of children
 
 2.  do you spank your kids?
 
 3.  if so how often?
 
 4.  do you use an implement to spank with? 
 
 
 5. if you do not spank, what method of discipline do you use?
 
 6.  your age?
 
 7.  your location
 
 8.  while under the age of 16 did you ever commit a criminal 
 offence?
 
 9.  how ere you disciplined as a kid
 
 
 thank you in advance for any reply you can make.  please e-mail 
 your replies rather than post them on the newsgroup
 
 [i hope it is obvious that responses to this question are likely to
 have serious problems when used for research purposes.  our readers
 are not likely to be a random sample of christians, and this form does
 not contain enough information to act as a stratified sample.  perhaps
 someone who is familiar with research methods might want to correspond
 with him.  --clh]
