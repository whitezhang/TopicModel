 ah, double-fulfillment.  first of all i would say that i'm not sure all
 the prophecies had double-fulfillment, e.g., the isaiah 7:14 prophecy.
 
 i would say that just because this happens on some occasions does not mean
 it will occur always, especially with regard to nt prophecies. the apostles
 who quoted the ot and applied those passages to jesus were acting as divine
 messengers and giving the inerrant word of god to the church.  no one has
 that authority today.  no one has the apostolic authority to say that
 such-and-such a prophecy has double-fulfillment.  if the imagry of
 revelation fits with events of the 1st century, it is folly for us to try
 and make it apply to events 20 centuries later.
