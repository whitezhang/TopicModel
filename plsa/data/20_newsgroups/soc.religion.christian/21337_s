 oh yea?  which version of the bible is the perfectly preserved one?  and
 why are there so many translations that are not perfectly preserved?  is
 god trying to confuse us?

 but that is exactly what happend.  there are so many branches of 
 denominations of christianity and deviations of doctrine portruding
 from varying translations of biblical texts by "serious students" that
 are much too numerous to begin to count.  if there is a perfect bible,
 then there would be no possible misinterpretation and there would be
 no need for anyone here to be debating it.  on the other hand, maybe
 the bible is perfect, but no one on this planet is perfect enough to
 read it correctly, but then there would be no point in god giving us
 something we cannot use correctly.

 imho, if you trust your salvation on the reliability of a single book,
 you are on weak ground.  remember, in the beginning was the word, and
 the word was with god, and the word was god.  this word existed before
 the bible was written.  (note: word <==> god).  this word that john is
 trying to describe cannot be fully described in any written language,
 all languages being imperfect.  realization comes only from contemplation
 of the word, and is outside the boundaries of language.  i use the bible
 as a guide, a stepping stone, but in no way is it my final authority.
 god alone is the final authority.
