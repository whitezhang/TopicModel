 there was an article in usa today a few months ago showing the results
 of a study that actually only about 1% were homosexual.  i saw another
 figure that listed 2% as the figure.  of course, even if it were 99%
 that would have little bearing on whether or not it is a sinful behavior.
 how many people have commited other acts of fornication?  how many
 people have lied or sinned in other ways?

 why isn't it a specific feature of homosexuality?  paul describes
 "men with men working that which is unseemly" to describe the acts.  
 sure, there spirtual nature was depraved also, and like the other
 sins, the idolatry, the other sexual immoraity, and the other sins
 sprang from their depraved spiritual state which was a result of 
 man's not glorifying god as god and being thankful.  still, their
 acts were shameless.

 is everything sinful specifically elaborated on in the new testament?
 scripture does not condemn being a drug dealer.  being ruled by the
 spirit rather than the letter not only frees from legalism, it also
 protects us from sins that are against the spirit.  the word is a
 two edged sword that cuts both ways.  
 
 i think we must be careful before we totally throw out leviticus.  
 if the law is reflection of god's character and true holy nature, then
 those who say that god endorses homosexuality run into a problem.  
 if homosexuality were "natural" (whatever that means) wholesome, 
 endorsed by god, and those who oppose sexual behavior are narrow-minded
 biggots, as some would have us believe, why is there a condemnation of
 it in leviticus.  this condemnation is in the midst of all the other
 sex sin condemnations, and there is nothing in the text to say that this
 law was limited to temple prostitution, and no good reason to believe that
 this was the case.  furthermore, male homosexual sex was a death-penalty
 crime!  
 
 is every sin elaborated on in the new testament?  take a look at
 i corinthians 5.  paul said that one of the corinthians had broken a
 law not even heard of among the gentiles, that one should have his father's
 wife.  there is a prohibition against having your father's wife in 
 leviticus.  no other new testament verse clearly condemns it (besides
 this one.)  notice that paul did not say that the sin was in commiting
 adultery, etc.- he spoke against having one's father's wife.  
 
 notice also that this sexual condemnation in leviticus is not mentioned
 in the specific context of paganism either.  and there was no pagan 
 coustom mentioned in i corinthians either.  as a matter of fact
 taking one's father's wife wasn't even done among the gentiles.  it was
 just a plain blantant sin, whether worshipping idols was involved or
 not.

 one of the reasons that some of us do not accept that common argument
 is because paul probably did face this and other problems.  sin can
 be tough to over come, especially without supernatural power.  is
 homosexual sin any more difficult to overcome that heterosexual sin,
 like lusting after a married woman, or sleeping around with people of
 the opposite sex?  i doubt it, and even if it is, that is no excuse.
 god is greater than all of it. 
 
 another reason we reject it is because it ignores the supernatural
 power of god to intervene in this kind of situation.  how many 
 people have been set free from sin by the power of god?  sure there
 may be any groups that have tried to change homosexuals and failed.
 that is a reflection on the people involved in the program, and not
 god's willingness and ability to change a sinner.  any program that
 uses formulas may fail.  what people need is the power of god to
 change them, whether they are involved in homosexual sin, or any other
 sin.

 i don't see how you come to that conclusion.  paul's dealings with
 pastorial issues encouraged people to give up their liberties in order
 to spare others- not to allow people to continue in sin because it
 was just too difficult.  take the example of eating meat offered to idols.
 paul felt that there was nothing wrong, in an abstract sense, with
 eating the meat.  yet he advised believers to sacrifice their liberty
 to eat meat in order to spare others.  
 
 but paul never allowed people to sin because living holy was just to
 tough.  paul wrote to "make no provision for the flesh to fulfill the lusts
 thereof."  (romans 13:14)  then he goes in to a discourse on how we
 should sacrifice our own liberty in order to spare the consciences of others.
 
 suppose it were not a sin for people to practice homosexual acts.  
 since others consider it to be a sin, then using paul's approach
 on pastorial issues, those who would otherwise be homosexuals should 
 sacrifice their liberty and be celbate or monogamously married to a
 member of the opposite sex.  paul never offers a lesser sin (homosexual
 "marriage") to prevent people from engaging in what may be considered 
 a more damaging sin.

 yet marriage itself is not a sin.  marriage is holy in all- and something
 that god ordains, and paul recognizes this.

 actually, adam was put in the garden to tend to it before he fell.
 after he fell he would have to toil over the ground.

 that is why we are dependent totally on god- what a vunerable and glorious
 position to be it.  we all must be transformed by the renewing of our
 minds- and that is the only way homosexuals can walk in freedom, just
 like anyone else.

 i'm sure you can see how people with the opposing view see this 
 conclusion.  it's like saying, "how should i kill myself, with gun or
 aresenic?  what about the person who just is overcome with a desire to
 sleep with goats?  would it be better for him to sleep with one goat,
 or all of them?  what about the person who wants to sleep with his aunts?
 would it be better for him to sleep with one aunt or all of them?  
 
 in all these cases, the more people or animals one sleeps with, the higher
 the chance that they will get a disease.  but this only deals with 
 physical aspects of the question.  whichever sin is commited, it all 
 leads to spiritual death.

 the issue that is most often addressed in scripture seems to be the
 actual act.  second, isn't it historical snobbery to say that
 only homosexuals of this century are capable of having "loving
 relationships?"  there are ancient writings glorifying homosexual "love."
 (btw, i am one who believes in refraining from making oathes.  also,
 where do you get that tax collectors are sinners.  that's certainly not
 explicit.  jesus didn't tell zachias to quit his job.)

 [i'm reluctant to comment in this in detail.  our basic concepts of
 the intention of jesus and paul are greatly different.  as i indicated
 in the article, whatever the ambiguities of various words (and i still
 think they are significant), it does seem clear that paul considered
 the homosexuality he saw around him wrong.  what you do with this fact
 depends upon your basic approach to the bible.  i'm afraid that
 communication between legalist and anti-legalist christians is even
 harder than between protestants and catholics in the 16th cent.  since
 you disagree with my starting point, obviously you're going to
 disagree with all of the intermediate discussion and conclusions.
 sometimes discussion is still useful.  i've seen some very interesting
 work on paul done by jews.  obviously they don't agree with him, but
 they sometimes have helpful insight into what he meant.  but i don't
 see much sign for hope here.  in talk.religion.misc there's an axiom
 that by the time hitler's name is invoked, all hope for sensible
 discussion is gone.  on this subject, when sleeping with goats is
 invoked, i don't think there's enough basis for understanding to be
 worth pursuing.  --clh]
