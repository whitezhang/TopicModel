 note that i said the fall of rome, not of the empire.  the roman empire
 lasted until 1453, with its transfered capital in constantinople.  the
 main reason for it's fall was not so much the sack of constantinople by
 the men of the 4th crusade (who were not christians - they had been
 excommunicated down to the last man after attacking the christian city
 of zara in croatia), but rather the disastorous defeat in the battle of
 mazinkert.  after the turks breached the frontier, it was only a matter
 of time before the empire fell, the inability of the empire to hold onto
 the rim of anatolia, with the ottomans and rum seljuks in the middle
 should be quite obvious to any student of history.  the sack of
 constantinople only hastened the inevitable along.  for if the greeks
 had wanted to save their empire, why would they not cooperate with the
 crusaders when they came to do battle with the saracens in the 1st-3rd
 crusades?  because of their obstinacy over cooperating with people they
 considered heretics, even though those "heretics" were fighting for the
 cause of the empire and christendom in doing battle with the turkish
 hordes in anatolia, edessa, lebanon, palastine, and syria, the some
 hordes who were to later sack constantinople, and overrun a third of
 europe (the balkans, hungary, the ukraine, the caucasus, etc.)
