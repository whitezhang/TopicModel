 note the difference here. one is saying, if *christ* disagrees with 
 a christian being gay, *christ* can change that.
 
 the other is saying, if *i* think being gay is wrong, that a christian
 cannot be gay, *i* need to tell them to change.
 
 
 as lois said, and as before her paul wrote to the believers in rome,
 who are you to judge another's servant?
