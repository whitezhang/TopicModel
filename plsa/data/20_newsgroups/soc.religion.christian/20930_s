   in a word, yes.  i don't believe that physical knowledge has a great deal of
 impact on the power of god.  in the past, god gave us the ability to create
 life through sexual relations.  now, he is giving us the ability to create life
 through in vitro fertilization.  the difference between the two is merely 
 cosmetic, and even if we gain the ability to create universes we won't begin to
 approach the glory of god.
   the power we are being given is a test, and i am sure that in many cases we
 will use our new abilities unwisely.  but, people have been using sexuality
 unwisely for millenia and i haven't heard an outcry to abolish it yet!
   no matter how far we extend our dominion over the physical world, we aren't
 impinging on god's power.  it's only when we attempt to gain control of the
 spiritual world, those things that can't be approached through science and 
 logic, that we begin to interfere with god.
