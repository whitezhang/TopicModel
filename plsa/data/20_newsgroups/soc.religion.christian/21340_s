 undoubtedly people adopt atheism for many reasons, but i suspect that a biggie
 is that the god they've believed in is (in j.b. phillips's words) "too small". 
 if a person's understanding of god is not allowed to grow and develop, it will
 eventually become inadequate.  the grey-haired gentleman on a throne who was a
 comforting image in childhood becomes a joke.
 
 a therapist friend of mine sometimes suggests to her clients that they "fire
 god".  what she means by that is letting go of an inadequate understanding of
 god to make room for a fuller one.  but she follows up by encouraging them to
 "hire a new one".  my guess is that a lot of folks go through the firing
 process, but are not adequately supported in the subsequent re-hire.
