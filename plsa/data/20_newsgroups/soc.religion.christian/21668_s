 [someone asked about biblical support for the image of satan as
 a fallen angel.  rev 12:7-9 and enoch have been cited.  --clh]
 
 there is also a verse in luke(?) that says he[jesus] saw satan fall
 from heaven.  it's something like that.  i don't have my bible in
 front of me or i would quote it directly, but it's a pretty obvious
 reference to satan's expulsion.

 [i believe the reference is to luke 10:18.  the context of the passage
 makes it possible that jesus is referring to satan being defeated by
 jesus' mission, rather than a previous fall from heaven.  --clh]
