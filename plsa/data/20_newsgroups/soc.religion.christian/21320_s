 well, it's that time of year again here at iu:  graduation.
 unfortunately, this means that i am out of here, more than likely for
 good.  i cannot say if i'll be in here under another username or not, or
 even if i'll ever get back in here at all.  i am leaving this part of my
 ministry to another brother, john right.  so, have fun and remember that
 flaming can be considered slander.
