 general question: since the world was discovered to be
 round, the definition of saturday is, if not ambiguous,
 at least arbitrary. how would someone answer this?
 
 also, when the calendar was changed (gregorian to julian?)
 was the day of the week changed or just the date? once again
 this points to the arbitrariness of the days.

 just months and dates.  --clh]
