 since jesus was born in the middle east, then i expect his human
 features to be similar to middle easterners at that point in time.
 and since the camera wasn't invented yet we can only guess what 
 he looked like. for example, with all the dinosaur bones we're
 digging up we still don't know if they were yellow-polka-dotted,
 or purplish-orange 8-). likewise, i don't think anybody has a 
 picture of jesus (is there ? 8-) ) so our current image of 
 jesus is our best guess.
 
 okay. so let's assume that jesus is black. would that make you
 follow his techings ? cause if you follow his teachings, skin 
 color becomes a moot point, anyway. what counts more in your
 life ? your faith in jesus or his skin color (as a human) ?
 
 in the interest of historical accuracy, however, since jesus
 was from israel wouldn't his skin color be like any other jew ?
 i.e. fair-skinned ? although probably heavily tanned from the
 desert sun ? experts in this area speak up !!! cause i'm not. 8-)
