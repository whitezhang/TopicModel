 that is generally accuate, but contains one serious error.  we catholics
 do believe that god's revealed truth that is not explicitly recorded in
 the bible can be and is passed on through the tradition of the church.
 it should be noted that the tradition of the church, otherwise known as
 sacred tradition, is not the same as ordinary human traditions.
 however, we do not believe that additional truth will be revealed to
 the church.  public revelation, which is the basis of catholic doctrine,
 ended with the death of st. john, the last apostle.  nothing new can
 be added.  theologians study this revelation and can draw out implications
 that were not recognized previously, so that the council of nicea could
 define statements about the theology of the trinity and the incarnation
 that were not explicitly stated in the bible and had been disputed
 before the council, but there was no new revelation at nicea or at
 any subsequent council.
 
 cardinal newman's _an essay on the development of christian doctrine_,
 written while he was still an anglican, is an excellent discussion of
 of this point.  it was recently reprinted as a doubleday image books
 paperback with some related shorter works under the title _conscience,
 consensus, and the development of doctrine_.
