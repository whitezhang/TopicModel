    if the papacy is infallible, and this is a matter of faith, then the

    of faith, but a matter of church law, then we should still obey as the
    pope is the legal head of the church.
 
    in other words, given the doctrine of infallibility, we have no choice
    but to obey.
 
 this is a primary problem in the church today.  what you are saying is
 more or less heresy.  you might call it "infallibilism".  it's the
 idea that the pope is always right in everything he says or does.
 this is virtually all over the place, especially in this country.
 
 the pope is only infallible under certain very specific and
 well-defined conditions.  when these conditions are not met, he can
 make mistakes.  he can make *big* mistakes.
 
 a couple historical examples come to mind.
 
 bishop robert grosseteste was perhaps the greatest product of the
 english catholic church.  at one point during his career, the reigning
 pope decided to install one of his nephews in an english see.  bishop
 grosseteste said that this would happen over his dead body (though
 maybe not in so many words; you have to treat popes with respect, even
 when they are wrong).  the problem was that this nephew would just
 collect the income of the see, and probably never set foot there.
 this would deprive the people of the see of a shepherd.  bishop
 grosseteste was quite right in what he did!
 
 another example is that of pope john xxii, a pope of the middle ages.
 he decided that souls that were saved did not enjoy the beatific
 vision until the last judgement.  he decided that this should be a
 defined doctrine of the church.  though he didn't quite get around to
 defining it.  now there's no way this is compatible with catholic
 doctrine.  the pope's doctrine was criticised by many in the church.
 he went so far as to put a number of his opponents in jail, even.  in
 the end, he had to admit his mistake.  shortly before he died, he
 recanted.  his successor made the exact *opposite* idea a dogma of the
 church.
 
 if you consult any of the great catholic theologians who treat of such
 subjects, such as st. robert bellarmine (a doctor of the church), you
 will find detailed discussions of whether the pope can personally fall
 into heresy or schism.
 
 the teaching of all such theologians is that the commands of a pope
 must be resisted if they are to the detriment of the catholic faith.
 a pope's authority is given for the purpose of building up the
 catholic church.  commands in conflict with this purpose have no
 legal *or* moral force.
