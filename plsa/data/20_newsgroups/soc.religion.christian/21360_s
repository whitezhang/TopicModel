 the only reason for the death penalty is revenge?? if you are going to
 try to refute a position, try to refute the whole position or acknosledge
 that you are only speaking to small piece of the problem. broad sweeping
 "the only reason, " etc on as tough nut to crack as the death penalty
 reallly doesn't help much.
 
 every year the fbi releases crime stats showing an overwhelming amount of
 crime is committed by repeat offenders. people are killed by folks who
 have killed (who knows how many times) before. how aobut folks who are for
 the death penalty, not for revenge, but to cut down on recidivism?
