 i agree entirely.  speaking as an atheist (heterosexual, for what it's
 worth), this is one of the least attractive parts of some varieties of
 christianity.  although i'm sure it's possible to argue theologically
 that we shouldn't make analogies between discrimination on the basis
 of sex and race and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation,
 morally the case looks unanswerable (for those outside religion): the
 three forms _are_ analogous; we shouldn't discriminate on the basis of
 sex, race or sexual orientation.
 
 i found the moderator's faqs on the subject instructive, and recommend
 everyone to read them.
 
 there seem to be three different levels of acceptance:
 
 1) regard homosexual orientation as a sin (or evil, whatever)
 2) regard homosexual behaviour as a sin, but accept orientation
 (though presumably orientation is unfortunate) and dislike people who
 indulge
 3) as 2, but "love the sinner"
 4) accept homosexuality altogether.
 
 my experience is that 3 is the most common attitude (i imagine 1 and 2
 are limited to a few fundamentalist sects).
 
 i suppose i can go along with 3, except that i have this feeling that
 a 14--15 year old living in a community with this attitude, on
 discovering that they were more attracted to members of the same sex,
 would not feel the love of the community, but would rather feel the
 pressure not to exhibit their feelings.  i'm not saying that the
 community (in particular the parents) would not love the child, but i
 suspect the child would not feel loved.
