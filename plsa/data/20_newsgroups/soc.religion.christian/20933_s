 
   hello,
 
   i have seen two common threads running through postings by atheists on the 
 newsgroup, and i think that they can be used to explain each other.  
 unfortunately i don't have direct quotes handy...
 
 1) atheists believe that when they die, they die forever.
 
 2) a god who would condemn those who fail to believe in him to eternal death
    is unfair.
 
   i don't see what the problem is!  to christians, hell is, by definition, 
 eternal death--exactly what atheists are expecting when they die.  there's no
 reason hell has to be especially awful--to most people, eternal death is bad
 enough.
   literal interpreters of the bible will have a problem with this view, since
 the bible talks about the fires of hell and such.  personally, i don't think
 that people in hell will be thrust into flame any more than i expect to jesus
 with a double-edged sword issuing from his mouth--i treat both these statements
 as metaphorical.
