 i see a parallel between what i will stupidly call the "homosexual" 
 issue and the "atheist" issue. please take no offense at these
 comparisons.
 
 the homosexual "feels" things that i admit i do not "feel". 
 he learns that these feelings are classified as homosexual feelings
 and learns of a model of sexuality that seems to apply to
 his feelings, which he then can fit with his experiences.
 that is, this model gives him a sense of understanding his
 situation. models that do not match up with what he knows he
 feels will be discarded. however, one wonders if once accepting
 the idea of his being gay and deciding what exactly that
 means he will analyze all his feelings and experiences based on 
 the definition he has already accepted, which of course validates
 his model.
 
 if that was hard to understand now listen to my parallel.
 
 the christian "feels" things that an atheist claims he does not
 feel. the christian accepts the christian theology as the true
 description of what his feelings mean. once accepting this
 model he interprets his experiences with regards to this model
 which of course validates his christianity.
 
 as a reminder, i am a christian, a catholic, i don't hate 
 homosexuals or atheists, but am just trying to understand
 them. i only compare them because they are both so foreign
 to me. am i as blind to the homosexual as the atheist seems
 blind to me? or am i as prejudiced against atheistic denial of
 religious experience as the homosexual is prejudiced against 
 attempts by society to deny his sexuality?
 
 or am i just out to lunch, again?
