 hello.
 hoping to net some netters
 who are in the helping professions 
 (counseling, psychology, psychiatry, social work, therapy etc.)
 to network on some topics and consider
 the possibility of a sci.counseling.christian type newsgroup
 or list.
 
 the integration of psychology and counseling and theology 
 is a subject of great debate and one of particular interest
 to me.
 
 if you're out there, please lemme know.
 
 email me direct if you will so we can get to know one another
 off the news.
