 so long as we think that good things are what we *have* to do rather than
 what we come to *want* to do, we miss the point. the more we love god; the
 more we come to love what and whom he loves.
 
 when i find that what i am doing is not good, it is not a sign to try
 even harder (romans 7:14-8:2); it is a sign to seek god. when i am aware 
 of jesus' presence, i usually want what he wants. it is his strenth, his love 
 that empowers my weakness.
