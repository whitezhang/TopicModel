 please excuse the interruption.
  
 i am seeking pro-life activists to fill out a 13-page questionnaire
 on attitutes, opinions, and activities.  if you would be willing
 to participate in this research, please email me privately at
 kste@purccvm.bitnet.  all replies and questionnaires will be
 made anonymous prior to printout and will be kept confidential.
  
 thank you very much for your help.

 isn't an invitation to a discussion in this group.  --clh]
