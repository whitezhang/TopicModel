 this is true. the statement didn't say anything about christians in general.
 it specifically said "strict fundamentalist" christians. it reflects a
 common perception that people have about fundamentalists being strict
 disciplinarians. whether or not this perception is justified is another issue.
 
 
 [the other reading is that they are distinguishing between strict
 and relaxed fundamentalists.  --clh]
