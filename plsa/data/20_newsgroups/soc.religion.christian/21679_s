 suppose someone said that he was sure that he would return from death,
 in glory and power, flying in the clouds with the host of heaven,soon, within
 the lifetimes of those then standing with him - and 2000 years went by without
 any such event. [he also asserted, so they say, himself to be god.]
 
 2 questions:
 
 	1) is that one of those "false prophecies" you were talking about?
 	2) does that make the speaker a false prophet?

 uhh,  has it occurred to you that there is no way to know any of these
 things, for certain, "without the tiniest shadow of a doubt"? that people
 who thought they did have also been deluded?
 
 those of us who believe in actually being able to _check_ our opinions
 have an out - we can check against some external reality. those who
 assert that beliefs entertained without evidence, or even despite evidence
 have a special virtue (ie. "faith") are out of luck -- and this is the
 result.

 start with the prophecy above - what can we conclude about the speaker?
