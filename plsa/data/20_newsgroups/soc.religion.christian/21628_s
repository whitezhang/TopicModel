 you are right, michael.
 
 in john 3:5, jesus says, "amen, amen, i say to you, no one can enter the
 kingdom of god without being born of water and spirit."  that's really what
 he said, and he meant it.  that verse is the definition of baptism.  i don't
 have the law book in front of me, but there is a canon law that urges
 parents to baptize their children within one week of birth for the very
 reason that you state.
