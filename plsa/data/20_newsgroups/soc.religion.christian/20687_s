 please forgive all the inclusions. i suppose they are neccessary to follow
 the argument.
 
 my point is that "if life has meaning or importance then we should try
 to find that meaning or importance" which is almost a tautology. (i hope
 i'm not being too patronizing.) one term for that meaning is "creator",
 though that is not obvious from my above argument.

 (it's more like "i think, therefore i am, therefore god is.")

 unfortunately the term "religious" is ambiguous to me in this context.
 i could say that searching for meaning in life is by definition being
 religious. i could say cult followers by definition have given up on 
 the search.
 
 if you want "meaning" why not search for the truth?
 
 so far, my understanding of christianity is congruent with my understanding
 of truth. there have been many before me who have come to conclusions 
 that are worded in ways that make sense to me. by no means does that imply
 that i understand everything.
