 thanks for posting the exact wording which i had not seen
 previously. the part i quote above seems to me to indicate
 disapproval of capital punishment - it is to be used only when
 other means are not sufficient; i would say this is a stronger
 restriction than saying that capital punishment is useable when
 justifiable. i would certainly say there are cases where a
 crime justifies death (perhaps this is the old testament
 interpretation), but my reverence for life would say that i
 would oppose the actual infliction of the death penalty (a new
 testament interpretation?). it is a matter for debate whether
 the death penalty works to keep the peace in a way that
 non-violent provisions do not. i don't believe it does, and i
 would certainly observe that in the usa, where you have the
 death penalty, there is a far higher murder rate than here in
 the uk, where we do not.
