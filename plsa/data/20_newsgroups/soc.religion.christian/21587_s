 either a: god exists, or b: he doesn't.  we have two choices, either
 1: believe in god, or 2: don't believe in god.  if a is true, then 2
 brings eternal damnation, whereas 1 brings eternal life.  if b is
 true, then 1 has minor inconvenience compared with 2.  thus, it is
 rational to believe in god.
 
 this has numerous flaws, covered in the faq for alt.atheism, amongst
 other places.

 disillusionment strikes me as an excellent reason for stopping
 believing in something.
