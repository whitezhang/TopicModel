 peir-yuan yeh asks:
 
 >i wonder if the ot is not exactly like jewish history.  are they the
 same >or part of them are the same?  how about torah? are the first five
 books >of ot as the same as torah?????
 
 yes, yes, and yes.  jewish history as recorded in the old testament and
 as shown by archaeology are the same.  kings, revivals, temples, and all.
 
 the torah, as far as i know, is the five books of moses.  then come the
 prophets (all the prophets, plus joshua, judges, 1&2 samuel, 1&2 kings)
 and the writings (psalms, proverbs, lamentations, ruth, esther, ezra,
 nehemiah, ecclesiates, song of songs, 1&2 chronicles, job).
 
 and the veracity of isaiah, which you quoted to your moslem friend is
 quite well known.  a complete manuscript exists that dates back to past
 200 bc, and is kept in a museum in israel.  it was found among the dead
 sea scrolls, which greatly enhanced our knowledge of the veracity of the
 old testament, as they date back to around the time of christ, whereas
 before, the oldest complete manuscript in hebrew was from around 900 ad.
 
 your moslem friend is sorely mistaken, but understandably so.  if jesus
 was crucified, and atoned for our sins, he must have been god, for only
 the death of god could atone for the sins of all humanity.  and as
 isaiah predicts, the messiah will be called "the mighty god."  and if he
 was god, then he must have rose, for as st. paul wrote, it was not
 possible that death could hold him.  and if jesus rose from the dead,
 your moslem friend would have little reason to be a moslem.  which is
 why he denies the authenticity of the old testament.
