 my $.02 - yes and no.  i do not believe the above scenario is not possible.  
 either they are believing and living (in at least some part) led by god, else 
 they are not.  believing (intellectually, but waiting(?)) is not enough.
    especially important to remember is that no one can judge whether you are 
 so committed, nor can you judge someone else.  i guess the closest we can 
 come to know someone's situation is listening to their own statements.  this 
 can be fallible, as is our sense of communion one with another.

 regarding this passage, we need to remember that this is a letter to a church 
 (at laodicea), people who are of the body of christ. (rev.3:14-16)  he talks 
 about their works.  a translation could say that he says their lack of 
 concern makes him sick (to the point of throwing up).

    right, saving is by faith alone, except that faith does not come alone, if 
 you catch the two meanings.
    i can offer the explanation that jesus would that we were either "on fire 
 for him" or so cold we knew we were not in his will and thus could be made 
 aware of our separation.  this is admonishment for his children, not eternal 
 damnation.
