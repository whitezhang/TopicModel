 hi,
    i'd like to subscribe to leadership magazine but wonder if there is one on
 disk instead of on paper. having it on disk would save me retyping
 illustrations, etc into a word processor. it's just cut and paste.
    if there are other good christian magazines like leadership on disk media,
 i'd appreciate any info.
 
 with gratitude,
 james.
