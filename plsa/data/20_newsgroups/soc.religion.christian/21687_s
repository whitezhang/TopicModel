 every so often, the pope declares that some departed christian is
 now in heaven, and may be invoked in the public rites of the church.
 it is my understanding that roman catholics believe that such
 declarations by the pope are infallible. i see three possibilities:
      1) the church has received a public revelation since the death
 of (for example) joan of arc.
      2) the church was given a list before the death of st john
 which had joan's name on it.
      3) there is no public revelation about joan, and roman
 catholics are free to doubt that she died in a state of grace, or
 even that she is a historical character.
