 well i am one of those (apparently) odd people who can sometimes
 control their dreams.  for example, i might decide before going to
 sleep that i want to repeat a favourite dream, or dream about a
 specific place.  or if i am having an unpleasant dream, i can often
 (not always) redirect events to something more pleasant.
 
 i guess i think that the same standards apply in these "directed"
 dreams as apply in waking fantasies or real life (ref jesus teaching
 about looking at a woman lustfully being the same a committing
 adultary).
 
 when my normal dreams display themes that i would not conciously chose
 to dream about, i take that as a sign that all is not well with my
 "inner life" - maybe i have underlying tenstions/fears that need to be
 resolved, or maybe its straightforward sin.  in either case, the cause
 needs to be resolved.  
 
 in fact, either case is pretty rare.  i don't
 often remember dreams that i don't chose to have.  when i do, they
 almost always tell me something important.
 i also almost never dream in pictures, and especially not in colour
 (in fact i've had precisely one full colour picture dream that i can
 remember, and it was definately spiritually important)
 i tend to dream in sound, with the odd blurred image, in black and
 white.
 
 interesting topic - i'll be fascinated to read other responses.

 ps. just to make it clear, i don't do ( and have never tried ) oobes.
     i tend to think they are off limits for christians.
