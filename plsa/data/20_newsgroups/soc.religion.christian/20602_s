 why is it that we have this notion that god takes some sort of pleasure
 from punishing people?  the purpose of hell is to destroy the devil and
 his angels.
 
 to the earlier poster who tried to support the eternal hell theory with
 the fact that the fallen angels were not destroyed, remember the bible
 teaches that god has reserved them until the day of judgement.  their
 judgement is soon to come.
 
 let me suggest this.  maybe those who believe in the eternal hell theory
 should provide all the biblical evidence they can find for it.  stay away
 from human theories, and only take into account references in the bible.
