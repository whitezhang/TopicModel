 in 12-step programs (like alcoholics anonymous), one of the steps
 involves acknowleding a "higher power".  aa and other 12-step abuse-
 recovery programs are acknowledged as being among the most effective.
 
 unfortunately, as evidence for god, this can be dismissed by stating
 that the same defect of personality makes substance abusers as makes 
 people 'religious', and the debunker could perhaps acknowledge that
 being religious is a better crutch than being a drug addict, but
 still maintain that both are escapism.  (and i suspect that there
 are some atheists who would find the substance abuse preferable to
 christianity.)
 
 i think that an essential problem with communication between christ-
 ians and atheists is that as christians we necessarily see ourselves
 as incomplete, and needing god (the 'god-shaped hole'), while atheists
 necessarily see themselves as self-sufficient.  if the atheists are
 right, christians are guilty of being morally weak, and too cowardly
 to stand up for themselves; if the christians are right, the atheists
 are guilty of considerable arrogance.  (i use the term atheist to
 refer to a person who has a definite conviction that there is no god,
 as opposed to one who does not know and/or does not care about god.)
