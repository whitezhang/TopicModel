 since when did conservative, protestant, old-time religion believers get
 an exclusive francise to christianity?  christianity is, and always has
 been, a diverse and contentious tradition, and this group reflects that
 diversity.  i, fo one, am not ready to concede to _any_ group- be they
 "liberal" or "conservative", catholic, protestant, or orthodox, charismatic
 or not- the right to claim that they have _the truth_, and everyone else
 is not "christian."
