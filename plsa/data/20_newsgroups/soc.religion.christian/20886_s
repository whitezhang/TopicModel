 if you agree that good works have a role somewhere, you will 
 generally find yourself in one of two camps: 
 
    (1) faith + works --> salvation
 or (2) faith --> salvation + works
 
 either (1) works are required for salvation, or (2) faith will 
 inevitably result in good works. 
 
 i am also of the opinion that salvation is by faith alone, based on
 ephesians 2 and romans 3:21-31.  i also conclude that james 2, when 
 read in context, is teaching bullet (2) above. when james speaks of 
 justification, i would claim that he is not speaking of god declaring
 the believing sinner innocent in his sight (paul's use of the word). 
 instead he is speaking of the sinner's profession of faith being 
 "justified" or "proven" by the display of good works. also according 
 to james 2, the abscence of such works is evidence for a "dead" or 
 "useless" faith which fails to save.
 
 james 2 is not a problem for the doctrine of salvation by faith if it
 is teaching (2).  works would have their place, not as merit toward 
 salvation, but as evidence of true faith.

 [there are of course a number of other possibilities.  the reformers
 believed
 
   salvation --> faith --> works
 
 some of us suspect that the three things are tied up together in such a way
 that no diagram of this form can do it justice.
