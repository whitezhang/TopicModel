 that would be neat, but nowhere in the bible does it say
 that one who has the gift of tounges can do this.  if the gift
 of tounges were the ability to be understood by everyone,
 no matter what languages they know, there would be no need for the
 gift of interpretation, and i corinthians 14 would not have had to
 have been written.

 that's a pretty harsh assumption to make about a several million
 christians world wide.  sure, there are some who want glory
 for themselves who speak in tounges, just as there are among those
 who do not have this gift.  there were people like this in the corinthian
 church also.  that does not mean that there is no true gift or that all
 who speak in tounges do it for their own glory in the sight of men.  
 i would venture to say that a large percentage of those who do speak in tounges 
 do so more often in private prayer than in public.

 at pentecost the miracle was that the crowd were all given the
 ability to understand the apostles speaking in greek.  --clh]
