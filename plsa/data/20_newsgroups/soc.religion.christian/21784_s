 i am becoming increasingly convinced that most of us take paul's illustration
 about one body / many parts far too narrowly. it is easy to say that the one
 body represents a particular sect of christianity (generally our own), and
 the parts are clearly the various offices of ministry. there is a place for
 that. but having met people who are walking closeely with god in a wide
 variety of doctine - catholic, protestant, liberal, conservative, orthodox,
 etc. - i am willing to encompass a wide spectrum of views within the
 context of the 'body of christ.' and i am equally sure that one day, after
 we shug off this mortal coil, when we no longer see through a glass darkly
 but see clearly, face to face, we will all be ashamed at some of the things
 we held as truth. we ought all fellowship, worship, and serve where we are
 called, and understand that where we are called may not be where everyone
 else is called.
 
 one of the fathers of the reformation (help me out - can't recall the name)
 put it quite succiently:
 
 	in essentials, unity.
 	in nonessentials, liberty.
 	in all things, charity.
 
 while i agree with lewis (mere christianity) that calling oneself a christian
 implies some basic, fundamental standards of belief if the word is to mean
 anything at all, i think most of us define the bounds of essentials a bit
 too broadly, deny the place for liberty in questionable issues near those
 bounds, and ignore the requirements of charity all together. 
 
 me? i attend a vineyard church, speak in tongues, am effectively an
 inerrantist, though i'll grant some inaccuracy in translation, am moderately
 pre-mill, and evangelical. but, i'm not ready to damn those who use icons,
 say mass in latin, uphold the virgin mary (though i really don't believe
 that she was sinless), vote on church membership, or insist on baptism for
 salvation. of course, i think my doctine is pretty close to the truth -
 why would i follow it if i believed something else was closer to the truth?
 but my understanding of the reality of a walk with christ is continually
 evolving as i spend more and more time walking with him, studying his word,
 and fellowshiping with others in the (often extended) family.
