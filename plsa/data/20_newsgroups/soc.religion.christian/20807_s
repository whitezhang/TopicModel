 i've sent the article.  in terms of the group discussion, i wanted to point
 out that "non-liberal education" (head in the sand) is not the same as
 "abstinence education".
 
 we had "non-liberal education" regarding drugs when i was a kid in the 60's,
 which didn't do us a lot of good.  but "abstinence education" regarding
 drugs has proven effective, i think.
