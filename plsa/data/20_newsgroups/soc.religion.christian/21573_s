 i would absolutly love to have the time and energy to do so. the
 problem is to be totally fair i would have to go throught this type of
 search on every issue i belive in.  i don't have the time, resources,
 or ability to do what you ask.  maybe you should pray that god gives
 me the opportunity instead of simply discrediting me because i have
 not been able to talk to every gay christian.
 
 in christ's love,
 bryan
