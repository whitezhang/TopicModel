 paul fortmann submitted a sermon by peter hammond on praying for
 justice that spoke of the positive value of the imprecatory
 (cursing) psalms.
 
 in this connection, i recommend to the membership the book
 reflections on the psalms, by c s lewis, with special reference to
 the chapter on "cursing in the psalms."
 
  yours,
  james kiefer
