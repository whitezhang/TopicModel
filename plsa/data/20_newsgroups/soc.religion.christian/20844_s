 if i am not mistaken, the jewish family names cohen, kahn, etc.
 are considered to be legitimate indicators of descent from aaron.
 the family names levi, levene, etc. are considered to be legitimate
 indicators of descent from levi. the main legal issue is the purification
 of the priesthood, which is supposed to involve finding the ashes of
 of the red heifer last used for this purpose 2000 years ago.
