 i have a question for you all related to this.  jesus condemns divorce
 several times in the new testament, and i have a hard time with this.
 the catholic church (as far as i can tell) does grant annulments with
 the statement that the marriage never really existed in god's eyes.
 (please, if i am mistinterpreting, correct me.)  however, i have
 witnessed marriages where two people were very much in love but
 recognized that they were destroying themselves and each other by
 staying in a marriage, and that the problems were due to personal
 childhood issues that had never been resolved.  i ask you, is divorce
 justified in such a case?  they knew who they were, what they were
 doing, they were deeply in love, but in the end, it did not work out.
 i must admit that i don't see jesus forcing them to live together, or
 even condemning that they go and seek happiness with someone else
 later on.  opinions?

 [this is a commonly discussed question, though it's been long enough
 that i'll allow it to be asked.  as you might expect, there is a range
 of answers.  catholics and some others will say that divorce is never
 justified.  (by the way, in situations where someone is being abused,
 or for other serious cause, separation is allowed by all traditions
 that i know.  no one should be forced to stay in a situation where
 they are in danger.)  others see it as a last resort in situations
 that have fallen apart badly enough that the best we can hope for is
 to choose the lesser of evils.  in some sense the difficult legal
 question turns out not to be divorce, but remarriage.  that's because
 of jesus' statement in mark 10:11-12 and par.  as with so many other
 things, this turns on your approach to the bible.  conservative
 protestants tend to see statements like this as having no exceptions.
 more liberal ones are willing to make allowances for situations where
 a literal interpretation would lead to painful results.  (it is noted
 that at the time it was possible for a man to divorce his wife almost
 on a whim.  thus a common explanation in the more liberal approach is
 that jesus was trying to protect people from this sort of thing, not
 to establish an absolute rule to which there could never be
 exceptions.)  catholics, as is typical with catholic ethics, take a
 theoretical hard line, but allow for exceptions in practice through
 the process of anullment.  in the last discussion most of our
 non-catholic readers seemed to accept with some reluctance that
 in some cases there might be no good alternative, but there was a
 feeling that the church should often be doing a better job of
 helping people prepare for marriage and deal with problems that
 come up during it, and that in a properly run church, divorce
 should not be necessary.  --clh]
