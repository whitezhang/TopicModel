 i probably should let this pass, it's not worth the time, and it's not
 really intended for me. but i couldn't resist. a personal weakness of mine.
 jerkius kneeus. tragically incurable.

 not so; i can prove that the existance of god is disputable
 by showing that people dispute it; this is easy: i dispute that
 god exists. simple.
 
 i missed your "traditional proofs" treatise, but the proofs i remember
 from the summa theologic (the 5 ways i think it was) were rather poor
 stuff. the ontological argument is about a billion times better, imho.
 
 i would think you'd want non-traditional proofs, considering the general
 failure of the traditional proofs: at least the ones i know of.
 (i am thinking of the ontological argument, the cosmological argument and
 the teleological argument. those are the ones traditional enough to
 have funny names, anyway.)

 this is the real question. so to discuss it, i'll assume god exists.
 otherwise, there is no heavenly authority to babble about.

 please show this is the case. i am familiar with the first cause
 argument, and i'll accept (for the sake of argument) that there
 is a first cause, even though i find some of its premices
 questionable. the rest you'll have to show. this includes
 that the first cause is god.

 got it. i deny that god is all good. so there.

 this isn't self-consistent: if humans must renew the relationship,
 then god (incarnate or not) can't do it. well, unless you think god is
 human. granted, god made himself 'human', but this is nonetheless cheating:
 the intent of the statement is clearly that man has to fix the problem
 he caused. god fixing it- even by indirect means- contradicts this.

 why?
 
 also, why assume said claim is true anyway?
 
 if *i* claim to be truth, are you bound by reason to follow me?

 :)
 
 undoubtably. do you mean to imply we should all obey the commands of the
 marines without question? you seem to imply this about god, and
 that the marines are similar in this respect.. if this is not what
 you are trying to say, they please explain what it is you are saying,
 as i have missed it.

 why? why not question it? even if it *is* truth, we cannot know this
 certainly, so why is it so irrational to question? perhaps we will
 thus discover that we were wrong.
 
 you assert that god is truth and we can't question truth. but
 i assert that god is not truth and anyway we can question truth.
 how is it my assertion is less good than yours?
 
 >  one may not deny the truth.
 
 oh?
 
 i hereby deny 1+1=2.
 
 i hope you'll agree 1+1=2 is the truth.
 
 granted, i look pretty damn silly saying something like that,
 but i needed something we'd both agree was clearly true.
 
 now, you'll notice no stormtroopers have marched in to drag
 me off to the gulag. no heaven lighting bolts either. no mysterious
 net outages. i seem to be permited to say such things, absurd or not.

 they are certainly not true. at least, the ones newton derived are
 not true, and are indeed wildly inaccurate at high speeds or small
 distances. we do not have a set of laws of physics that always
 works in all cases. if we did, physics would be over already.
 
 science is all about questioning this sort of truth. if we didn't,
 we'd still follow aristotle. i'd generalize this a little more:
 if you want to learn anything new, you must question the things
 you know (tm). because you can always be wrong.
 
 >therefore, the authority which is truth may not be denied.
 
 even presupposing that truth may not be denied, and may
 not be questioned, and that god is truth, it only follows
 that god may not be denied or questioned. not that he must
 be obeyed!
 
 we could unquestioningly disobey him. how annoying of us.
 but you have not connected denial with disobedience.
