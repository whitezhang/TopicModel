 was paul a god too? is an interpretation of the words of paul of higher
 priority than the direct word of jesus in matt5:14-19? paul begins
 romans 14 with "if someone is weak in the faith ..." do you count
 yourself as one who is weak in the faith?

 yes, but what does the bible have to say? what did jesus say? paul
 closes romans 14 with, "on the other hand, the person with doubts about
 something who eats it anyway is guilty, because he isn't acting on his
 faith, and any failure to act on faith is a sin." gaus, isbn:0-933999-99-2
 have you read the ten commandments which are a portion of the law? have
 you read jesus' word in matt5:14-19? is there any doubt in your mind
 about what is right and what is sin (greek hamartia = missing the mark)?

 whereas, the ten commandments and jesus' words in matt5:14-19 are fairly
 clear, are they not?

 matt5:14-19 doesn't answer your question?

 breaking bread - roughly synonymous with eating.

 how do you unite this concept of yours with the ten commandments and
 jesus's word in matt5:14-19?

 or, they assumed that the ten commandments and jesus' word in
 matt5:14-19 actually stood for something? perhaps they were "strong in
 the faith?"

 [no, i don't believe that paul can overrule god.  however paul was
 writing for a largely gentile audience.  the law was regarded by jews
 at the time (and now) as binding on jews, but not on gentiles.  there
 are rules that were binding on all human beings (the so-called noachic
 laws), but they are quite minimal.  the issue that the church had to
 face after jesus' death was what to do about gentiles who wanted to
 follow christ.  the decision not to impose the law on them didn't say
 that the law was abolished.  it simply acknowledged that fact that it
 didn't apply to gentiles.  thus there is no contradiction with mat 5.
 as far as i can tell, both paul and other jewish christians did
 continue to participate in jewish worship on the sabbath.  thus they
 continued to obey the law.  the issue was (and is) with gentile
 christians, who are not covered by the law (or at least not by the
 ceremonial aspects of it).
 
 jesus dealt mostly with jews.  i think we can reasonably assume that
 mat 5 was directed to a jewish audience.  he did interact with
 gentiles a few times (e.g. the centurion whose slave was healed and a
 couple of others).  the terms used to describe the centurion (see luke
 7) suggest that he was a "god-fearer", i.e. a gentile who followed
 god, but had not adopted the whole jewish law.  he was commended by
 jewish elders as a worthy person, and jesus accepted him as such.
 this seems to me to indicate that jesus accepted the prevailing view
 that gentiles need not accept the law.
 
 however there's more involved if you want to compare jesus and paul on
 the law.  in order to get a full picture of the role of the law, we
 have to come to grips with paul's apparent rejection of the law, and
 how that relates to jesus' commendation of the law.  at least as i
 read paul, he says that the law serves a purpose that has been in a
 certain sense superceded.  again, this issue isn't one of the
 abolition of the law.  in the middle of his discussion, paul notes
 that he might be understood this way, and assures us that that's not
 what he intends to say.  rather, he sees the law as primarily being
 present to convict people of their sinfulness.  but ultimately it's an
 impossible standard, and one that has been superceded by christ.
 paul's comments are not the world's clearest here, and not everyone
 agrees with my reading.  but the interesting thing to notice is that
 even this radical position does not entail an abolition of the law.
 it still remains as an uncompromising standard, from which not an iota
 or dot may be removed.  for its purpose of convicting of sin, it's
 important that it not be relaxed.  however for christians, it's not
 the end -- ultimately we live in faith, not law.
 
 while the theoretical categories they use are rather different, in the
 end i think jesus and paul come to a rather similar conclusion.  the
 quoted passage from mat 5 should be taken in the context of the rest
 of the sermon on the mount, where jesus shows us how he interprets the
 law.  the "not an iota or dot" would suggest a rather literal reading,
 but in fact that's not jesus' approach.  jesus' interpretations
 emphasize the intent of the law, and stay away from the ceremonial
 details.  indeed he is well known for taking a rather free attitude
 towards the sabbath and kosher laws.  some scholars claim that mat
 5:17-20 needs to be taken in the context of 1st cent. jewish
 discussions.  jesus accuses his opponents of caring about giving a
 tenth of even the most minor herbs, but neglecting the things that
 really matter: justice, mercy and faith, and caring about how cups and
 plates are cleaned, but not about the fact that inside the people who
 use them are full of extortion and rapacity.  (mat 23:23-25) this, and
 the discussion later in mat 5, suggest that jesus has a very specific
 view of the law in mind, and that when he talks about maintaining the
 law in its full strength, he is thinking of these aspects of it.
 paul's conclusion is similar.  while he talks about the law being
 superceded, all of the specific examples he gives involve the
 "ceremonial law", such as circumcision and the sabbath.  he is quite
 concerned about maintaining moral standards.
 
 the net result of this is that when paul talks about the law being
 superceded, and jesus talks about the law being maintained, i believe
 they are talking about different aspects of the law.  paul is
 embroiled in arguments about circumcision.  as is natural in letters
 responding to specific situations, he's looking at the aspect of the
 law that is currently causing trouble: the law as specifically jewish
 ceremonies.  he certainly does not intend to abolish divine standards
 of conduct.  on the other hand, when jesus commends the law, he seems
 to be talking the law in its broadest implications for morals and
 human relationships, and deemphasizing those aspects that were later
 to give paul so much trouble.
 
 it's unfortunate that people use the same terms in different ways, but
 we should be familiar with that from current conflicts.  look at the
 way terms like "family values" take on special meaning from the
 current context.  imagine some poor historian of the future trying to
 figure out why "family values" should be used as a code word for
 opposition to homosexuality in one specific period in the u.s.  i
 think law had taken on a similar role in the arguments paul was
 involved in.  paul was clearly not rejecting all of the jewish values
 that go along with the term "law", any more than people who concerned
 about the "family values" movement are really opposed to family
 values.
