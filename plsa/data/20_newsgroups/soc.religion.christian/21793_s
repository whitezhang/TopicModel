 i'm looking for the following article:
 
 	``the war within: an anatomy of lust''
 	leadership 3 (1985), pp 30-48
 
 i've looked in the libraries of 3 uk bible colleges, but none of them subscribe
 to the magazine (its a us publication, btw). if anyone has access to this
 article and would be willing to post me a photocopy (i presume that copyright
 restrictions will allow this?), please e-mail me. thanks,
