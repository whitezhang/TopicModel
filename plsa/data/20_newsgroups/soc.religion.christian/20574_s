 one interpretation i've heard of this verse is that it refers to the sin 
 of physically abusing one's wife.  the husband is usually physically 
 stronger than his wife but is not permitted to use this to dominate her.  
 he must honor her as his sister in christ.  this would therefore be an 
 example of a specific sin that blocks prayer.
 
 this verse also makes me think of the kind of husband who decides what 
 is god's will for his family without consulting his wife.  god reveals 
 his will to both the husband and the wife.  there needs to be some 
 degree of mutuality in decision making.  even those whose understanding 
 of the bible leads to a belief in an authoritarian headship of the 
 husband need to incorporate this in order to have a functional family.  
 one way to look at it is that god speaks to the wife through the husband 
 and to the husband through the wife.
