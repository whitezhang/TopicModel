 this is the problem. this is not hell, this is permanent death. it is
 indeed what atheists (generally) expect and it is neither fair nor
 unfair, it just is. you might as well argue about whether being made
 mostly of carbon and water is "fair".
 
 however, the atheists who claim that hell is unfair are talking about
 the fire and brimstone place of endless suffering, which necessarily
 includes eternal existance (life, i dunno, but some sort of continuation);
 not at all the same thing.
 
 granted, you clearly feel that hell=death, but this is not a univeral
 sentiment as near as i can tell.
 
 if *your* idea of god "condemns" heathens to ordinary death, i have no
 problem with that. i do have a problem with the gods that hide from humans
 and torture the unbelievers eternally for not guessing right.
