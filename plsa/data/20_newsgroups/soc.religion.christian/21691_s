 let the word of christ dwell in you richly as you teach and admonish one
 another with all wisdom, and as you sing psalms, hymns and spiritual songs with
 gratitude in your hearts to god. 
 colossians 3:16
 
 a reminder: these verses are from the new international version. as with any
 translation, faithfulness to the original hebrew and greek may vary from time
 to time. if a verse sounds a little off occasionally, compare it with another
 translation or with the original texts, if you are able to do so.
 
 god bless you,
