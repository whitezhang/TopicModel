 i invite them both (and other interested parties as well) to read my
 comments on this verse of scripture. to obtain them, send the
 message get choosing barabbas to listserv@asuacad.bitnet or to
 listserv@asuvm.inre.asu.edu. putting it briefly, i think that the
 significance of the demands of the jerusalem crowd has usually been
 greatly misunderstood, both by christian and by anti-christian
 readers.
