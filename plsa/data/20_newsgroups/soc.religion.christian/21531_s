 this is a rfd on a proposal for a newsgroup which would promote a 
 sharing on the "johannine hours" as proposed each month by the monks of 
 the ecumenical community of taize (pronounced te-zay) in france.
 
 name of proposed newsgroup: 
 ==========================
 
 soc.religion.taize (unmoderated)
 
 
 purpose of the group: 
 ====================
 
 the taize community is an international ecumenical community of monks 
 based in france. many young adults come there to search for meaning in 
 their life and to deepen their understanding of their faith through a 
 sharing with others. this newsgroup will allow such a sharing through a 
 monthly "johannine hour" which will be posted at the beginning of each 
 month. a "johannine hour" involves a short commentary on a given bible 
 passage, followed by some questions for reflection.  any thoughts that 
 may arise in consequence and that you wish to share with others can be 
 posted here. we are not interested in theological debate, and even less 
 in polemics. no expertise is required! the idea is to help one another 
 to deepen our understanding of scripture as it is related to our own 
 life-journey.
 
 the idea of "johannine hours" was born in taize as a simple response
 to all those who were trying to assimilate the bible's message in the
 midst of their daily life. because of work or studies, it is often
 impossible to spend long hours in silence and reflection, but
 everyone can take an hour from time to time to enter a church, sit
 quietly at home or go out for a walk in the woods. there, in silence,
 we can meditate on a passage of scripture to listen to the voice of
 christ.
 
 during the time of silence, it is important to concentrate on what we 
 understand and not waste time worrying if, in some biblical expressions, 
 we find it difficult to hear the voice of christ. the idea is to 
 communicate to others what we have understood of christ, not burdening 
 them with our own hesitations but rather telling them what has brought 
 us joy, what has led us to run the risk of trusting more deeply.
 
 perhaps those who read and think about the "johannine hours" in this
 newsgroup could share their reflections and discoveries with others.
 
 the important thing is the complementarity between two aspects, the
 personal aspect of silent, personal reflection and the communal aspect
 of sharing, which through usenet makes us a part of a worldwide network.
 
 background of the taize community:
 =================================
 
 the following provides some background information on the life and
 vocation of the taize (pronounced te-zay) community.
 
 "a parable of communion": august 1940, with europe in the grip of
 world war ii, brother roger, aged 25, set up home in the almost
 abandoned village of taize, in eastern france. his dream: to bring
 together a monastic community which would live out "a parable of
 community", a sign of reconciliation in the midst of the distress of
 the time. centering his life on prayer, he used his house to conceal
 refugees, especially jews fleeing from the nazi occupation.
 
 an international and ecumenical community: taize's founder spent the
 first two years alone. others joined him later and at easter 1949,
 seven brothers committed themselves together to common life and
 celibacy. year by year, still others have entered the community, each
 one making a lifelong commitment after several years of preparation.
 today, there are 90 brothers, catholics and from various protestant
 backgrounds, from over twenty different countries. some of them are
 living in small groups in poor neighbourhoods in asia, africa, north
 and south america. the brothers accept no donations or gifts for
 themselves, not even family inheritances, and the community holds no
 capital. the brothers earn their living and share with others
 entirely through their own work. in 1966, sisters of saint andrew, an
 international catholic community founded 750 years ago, came to live
 in the neighbouring village, to share the responsibility of welcoming
 people in taize.
 
 taize and the young; the intercontinental meetings: young adults, and
 less young, have been coming to taize in ever greater numbers since
 1957. hundreds of thousands of people from europe and far beyond have
 thus been brought together in a common search. intercontinental
 meetings take place each week, sunday to sunday, throughout the year
 and they include youth from between 35 and 60 countries during any
 one week. the meetings give each person the opportunity to explore
 the roots of their faith and to reflect on how to unite the inner
 life and human solidarity. the meetings in summer can have up to
 6,000 participants a week. three times every day, the brothers and
 everybody on the hill come together for common prayer in the church
 of reconciliation, built in 1962 when the village church became too
 small.
 
 "a pilgrimage of trust on earth" the community has never wanted to
 create a "movement" around itself. instead, people are called to
 commit themselves in their church at home, in their neighbourhood,
 their city or village. to support them in this, taize has created
 what it calls "a pilgrimage of trust on earth". at the end of each
 year, the pilgrimage has a "european meeting" which brings together
 tens of thousands of young adults from every part of europe for
 several days in a major city. there have also been meetings in asia
 and in the united states. every year, brother roger writes an open
 letter to the young. usually completed during a stay in one of the
 poor regions of the world, these are translated into thirty languages
 and provide themes for reflexion for the following year.
 
 note:  discussion on the creation of this newsgroup will take place in 
        news.groups.
