 the above article is a good short summary of traditional christian
 teaching concerning the death of mary.  
 also very good is "re: question about the virgin mary" by micheal d.
 walker.  he tells the story very well.
 i would like to add that in the eastern orthodox church we celebrate "the
 dormition (or falling asleep) of the theotokos (the mother of god)".  the
 icon for this day shows mary lying on a bed surrounded by the apostles
 who are weeping.  christ, in his resurrected glory, is there holding what
 seems to be a small child.  this is, in fact, mary's soul already with
 christ in heaven.  the assumption of mary is one more confirmation for us
 as christians that christ did indeed conquer death.  it forshadows the
 general resurrection on the last day.  the disciples were not surprised
 to find mary's body missing from the grave.  she was the mother of the
 savior.  she was the first of all christians.  she gave birth to the word
 of god.  if it were not for her we would not be saved.  this is why we
 pray in the orthodox church, "through the prayers of the theotokos,
 savior save us."
