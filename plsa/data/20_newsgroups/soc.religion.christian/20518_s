 i was at my parents' seder and noticed the labelling on one of the 
 packages was english, hebrew and french.  in the phrase "kosher for 
 passover" the french word used was "pa^ques."   we've deliberately 
 mistranslated this at the kulikauskas home and keep referring to foods 
 being kosher for easter. :-)
 
 back to the original questions in this thread concerning christians of 
 jewish descent and the law:  i always wonder when i see posts on this 
 subject whether the writers are christians of jewish descent relating 
 the life-decisions god has led them to or people who take only an 
 academic interest in the topic.  (having known seanna since she was nine 
 years old, i do know in this case.)  i admit that the answer to this 
 question affects the amount of weight i give to the writer's statement.
