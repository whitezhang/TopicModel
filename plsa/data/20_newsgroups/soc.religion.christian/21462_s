    jung may have said that, but he was in no way speaking for the
 catholic church.  the dogma of the assumption in no way means mary is
 considered to be god or part of "the godhead."  therefore it implies no
 such thing about the feminine in general.
 
    also jung's statement makes it sound as though the dogma was
 announced "out of the blue."  this also is incorrect, as dogma is only
 the formulation of what has always been part of tradition.  this dogma
 has always been believed, but was not formally defined until the
 assumption was declared as an _ex cathedra_ statement.
