 this is something i've always found a little curious. i've never quite understood
 the trinity thing. on the one hand, jesus is supposed to be god incarnate. but,
 at the same time, he is god's son "for god so loved the world that he gave his
 only begotten son". first question is, if jesus was god in human form, how could
 he really be god's son? if the holy ghost "planted the seed" in mary, so to speak,
 then it seems that jesus' relationship to god would be the equivalent to the
 human father/son relationship. while a son might inherit alot of the father's 
 qualities, he is not the father. they are still two separite entities. to try
 and say that a son is the same person as the father is obviously wrong. in that
 case, jesus and god aren't the same. on the other hand, if their relationship
 isn't the same as the human father/son relationship, but jesus is actually god
 incarnate, then he's not really god's son and he never was. he's just god
 manifesting himself as jesus. at least, this is how i'm seeing it. can someone
 who is more knowledgeable about the trinity enlighten us? 
 
 getting back to the original question, what is the great price that jesus paid
 to redeem our sins? was it dying on the cross? since jesus knew that he would
 rise again in 3 days and then ascend back to heaven, i have a hard time seeing
 how this is considered paying such a great price for humanity. his earthly body
 may have been killed, but then, so what? he suffered a few hours of physical
 pain, but then, there has been many a human who has suffered a great deal more.
 the fact that jesus was god's only begotten son doesn't seem to me to have much
 meaning since god can beget as many sons as he wants to. jesus being the only
 one was simply a matter of choice. i suspect that these questions will be very
 offensive to many christians on this net. to those people, please accept my
 sincere apologies. it is not my intention to offend or to trivialize christ.
 but, i do believe these are legitimate questions and i am genuinely curious.
  
 [note that the trinity and incarnation have to be looked at together.
 first, your reading of the virgin birth is an uncommon one.  (in this
 group, it's dangerous to say that no one believes something.)  you
 seem to be suggesting the jesus is god's son in a physical sense,
 with the holy spirit as father and mary as mother.  i consider that
 terrible heresy, though some people react less violently.  the virgin
 birth says that jesus' birth is god's responsibility.  but it doesn't
 imply that god's sperm was involved.  indeed one (though by no means
 the only) speculation is that god used joseph's genetic material.
 
 second, jesus is in some sense doubly indirect from the father.  in a
 trinitarian context, the term son refers to the eternal logos, who is
 a part of god.  the son didn't come into existence with jesus' birth.
 jesus is the incarnation of the son.  so his sonness isn't
 specifically a result of being incarnated.  rather, it's the son
 who was incarnated.
