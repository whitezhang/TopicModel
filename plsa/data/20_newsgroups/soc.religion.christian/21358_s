 on of the attributes of being sacred in this case is that they
 should not be spoken of in a "common manner" or "trampled under
 feet" such as the lords name is today.  the ceremonies are
 performed in the temple because the temple has been set aside
 as being as sacred/holy/uncommon place.  we believe that the 
 ceremonies can only be interpreted correctly when they
 are viewed with the right spirit- which in this case is in the
 temple.  so from our point of view, when they are brought
 out into the public, they are being trampled under feet,
 because of misinterpretations and mocking, and it is therefore
 offensive to us.
 
 please do not assume that because of my use of the words
 'we' and 'our' that i'm an official spokesman for the lds
 church.  i am merely stating what i believe is the general
 feeling among us.  others feel free to disagree.
