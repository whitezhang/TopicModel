 one day a few years ago franky schaeffer walked into a greek orthodox
 church.  he is now an orthodox christian.  so is his mother and if his
 father, fransis schaeffer, had not passed away he too would have come
 into the church.  
 franky, like many americans who have recently found the orthodox church,
 described the experience as finally coming home after a long jouney
 through a desert.  you should also read the book "becoming orthodox" by
 peter gillquist.  it describes the long journey of some 2000 weary
 evangelical protestants to the orthodox church.   come taste and see how
 good the lord is.
