 though you can certaily assert all this, i don't see why it necessarily
 has to be the case. why can't hate just stay as it is, and not beget more?
 who says we have to get disgusted and start hating the sinner. i admit
 this happens, but i donlt think you can say it is always necessaily
 so.
 
 why can we not hate with a perfect hatred?

 certainly we should love even our enemies. amos 5:15 says to hate the evil
 and love the good. this can't contradict christ's teaching. i think we tie
 up both hate and love with an emotional attitude, when it really should be
 considered more objectively. surely i don't fly into a rage at every sin
 i see, but why can i not "hate" it?
