 james sledd asks:
 
  1. what is the nature of eternal life?
  2. how can we as mortals locked into space-time conceive of it?
  2a. if the best we can do is metaphor/analogy, then what is the
  best metaphor?
 
 c s lewis's essay the weight of glory deals with this question. i
 recommend it enthusiastically. you might also read the chapter on
 "heaven" in his book the problem of pain. he gives a fictional
 treatment in his book the great divorce. i have found all of these
 very helpful.
 
 you might also be helped by the treatment in dante's divine comedy.
 heaven occupies the last third of the poem, but i cannot imagine
 reading it other than from the beginning. i urge you to use the
 translation by dorothy l sayers, available from penguin paperbacks.
 
  yours,
  james kiefer
