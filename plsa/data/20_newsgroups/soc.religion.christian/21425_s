 woo! so far, we've had the following interpretations of the figure of
 the `whore of babylon' in rev 17 & 18:
 
 a) the united states of america
 b) mho db) which was as a figure of the fallen spiritual powers who
    corrupt and oppress human society
 c) historical jerusalem
 d) historical rome
 
 dare i suggest that the passage might be many layered in meaning? how
 about * the prophecy reveals god's judgement on the corrupt & idolatrous
 state oppressing his chosen people (d) * that god's judgement extends
 _especially_ to his once chosen city (c) because, despite that city's
 special call, it still rejected god's grace at the decisive time (rev
 11:8? - also isn't rev19:24 equally suggestive of rome as jerusalem?) *
 that the usofa is guilty of many of the crimes of rome/babylon (a) and
 is equally subject to god's judgement * that the good book(tm) actually
 encompasses _all_ these viewpoints by revealing the corrupting spiritual
 powers warring against mankind through the very society that we've
 created. (b)
 
 clever, huh? (<-- flame here!) no need to argue at all! 
 
 i think mary's view has a lot of sense because there seems to be a
 deliberate contrast between rev 17/18 and rev 21/22 - the mortal
 jerusalem chosen by god but never (historically) fulfilling its vocation
 and the new jerusalem perfected (outside of history) purely by god's
 grace. eg details like rev 17:1 `.. who sits on many waters' cf rev 22
 the single stream in the new jersualem `the river of life flowing from
 the throne of god and of the lamb.'
 
 rex - didn't understand your post - what's the relevance of babylonian
 mystery religions to all this? please elaborate your ideas about ot &
 the book of rev? why do you freak at the idea of a primarily `spiritual'
 interpretation of rev? i'd mail, but i can't get thru:
