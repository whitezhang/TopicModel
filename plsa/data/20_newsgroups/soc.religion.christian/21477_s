 i don't necessarily object to the secrecy but i do question it, since i see no 
 biblical reason why any aspect of christian worship should involve secrecy.  
 but i am interested in your claim that early christian practices "parallel" 
 mormon temple ceremonies.  could you give an example?  also, why do they only 
 parallel mormon ceremonies?  why don't mormon ceremonies restore the original 
 christian practices?  wasn't that the whole point of joseph smith's stated 
 mission?
