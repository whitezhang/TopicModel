 in fact, that is the reason easter "jumps all over the calendar"- passsover
 itself is a lunar holiday, not a solar one, and thus falls over a wide
 possible span of times.  the few times that easter does not fall during or
 after passover are because easter is further linked to the vernal equinox-
 the beginning of spring.

 your obsession with the term "whore" clouds your argument.  "whore" is
 a value judgement, not a descriptive term.

 overall, this argument is an illustration of the "etymological fallacy"
 (see j.p. louw: _semantics of nt greek_).  that is the idea that the true
 meaning of a word lies in its origins and linguistic form.  in fact, our
 own experience demonstrates that the meaning of a word is bound up with
 how it is _used_, not where it came from.  very few modern people would
 make any connection whatsoever between "easter" and "ishtar."  if daniel
 seagard does, then for him it has that meaning.  but that is a highly
 idiosyncratic "meaning," and not one that needs much refutation.
