 hi,
    what presentation package would you recommend for a bible teacher?
    i've checked out harwards graphics for windows. i think its more
 suitable for sales people than for preachers or bible teachers to present
 an outline of a message.
 
    i'm looking for one that:
 *  is great for overhead projector slides.
 *  has or imports clip arts
 *  works with word for windows or imports word for windows files.
 *  works with inkjet printers
    if you know of any that meets part or all of the above, please let me know.
 please email your response as i don't keep up with the newsgroup.
 
 thanking you in advance,
 james.
