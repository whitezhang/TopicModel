 well, michael,  i don't know if clh has left them in the faq  (maybe you should
 post the "how to get there map again), but i posted two or three lengthy
 exegetical paper on these verses.  they looked at the ot, nt and
 intertestimental usages of terms in reference.  i would suggest you read those
 before you talk about a "need" in exegetical studies.  if those aren't enough,
 i could also provide "the source and nt meaning of apsevokoitai".  dr james
 deyoung published it in the masters seminary journal in fall of '92.  to read
 any of these 4 papers shows that the shoe is on the other foot as far as a need
 for honest exegesis.
 
 again, please refer to the faq file, or if you are unable to acess it, drop me
 a line and i will enclose them to you.
