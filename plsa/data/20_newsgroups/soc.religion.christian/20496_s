 maybe cyclical is not the best word.  that is one aspect of it.  in the
 case of the virgin birth prophecy, it applied to the then and there, and
 also prophetically to christ.  the army that threatened the king would 
 cease to be a threat in a very short time.  yet it also prophecied of 
 christ.
 
 several prophecies that refered to christ also had application at the
 time they were made.  "out of egypt have i called my son" refers both
 to israel, and prophetically to christ.   "why do the heathen rage"
 was said of david and also of christ.  
 
 another example would be the scripture quoted of judas, "and his bishoprick
 let another take."  another example is something that isaiah said of his
 disciples which is also applied to christ in hebrews, "the children thou
 hast given me."
 
 how does the preterist view account for this phenomenon.
