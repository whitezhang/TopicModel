 but what was wrong with it?  it won't tempt anyone to any kind of sin, as
 far as i can tell.  it doesn't belittle anyone.  it does not substitute
 offensiveness for humor (it's genuinely funny).
 
 we shouldn't assume that _all_ jokes that mention sexuality are "dirty"
 merely because so many are.
 
 and we should never mistake prudery for spirituality.  it can be the direct
 opposite -- a symptom of the _lack_ of a healthy perspective on god's
 creation.
