 the basic problem with your argument is your total and complete reliance on
 the biblical text.  luke's account is highly suspect (i would refer you to
 the hermeneia commentary on acts).  moreover luke's account is written at
 least 90 years after the fact.  in the meantime everyone he mentions has died
 and attempts to find actual written sources behind the text have come up
 with only the we section of the later portion of acts as firmly established.
 moreover, pauls account of some of the events in acts (as recorded in 
 galatians) fail to establish the acts accounts. 
 
 what we need, therefore, is a reliable text, critically appreciated, which
 documents the death of christians for belief in the resurrection.  i would
 suggest you look at some greek and roman historians.  i think you will be
 disapointed.
