 just a quick comment.  as a baptist clergyperson, i find the idea
 of such a "baptism" (if the news report is in fact accurate, and
 they seldom are regarding religion) offensive.  the pastor here seems
 to have a most unbaptist view of baptism- one that seems to demand the
 ceremony even when comprehension and choice are absent.
 
 we do baptize converts, but no one who has been deceived into hearing
 the word is likely to be a convert.  if in fact the grace of god might
 work in such a situation, there is no harm done in waiting a day or
 two.
 
 baptist believe in regenerate membership.  did this church include these
 half-baked (at best) converts into their church fellowship? or do they
 somehow feel there is some validity in dunking them and turning them loose?
 
 this kind of "evangelism" is certainly not baptist, and probably not
 very christian, either.
