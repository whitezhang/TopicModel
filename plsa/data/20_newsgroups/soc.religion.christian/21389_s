 in mentioning some nonsense about psychology :) and atheism, bob muir asks
 the following question.   
 
 >	do i sound "broken" to you?
 
 i answer in the affirmative.  now this answer might sound a little
 intellectually dishonest to bob, but i think i have been accused before
 of that heinous crime and am man enough to take it.  !-)  what thinking
 person has not at one time or other been accused of it?   is it
 politically correct for christians to be the only besieged group
 permitted the luxury of arrogance?   
 
 now i have a question for bob.  why in the world would any self-respecting
 atheist want to subscribe to a christian news group?  i have a 
 difficult enough time keeping up with it, and i think i know something
 about the subject.     
 
 bob reminds me of my roommate.  in order to disbelieve atheism, he says 
 he will need to be proven wrong about it.  well, i don't even waste 
 my time trying.  i tell him that he'll just have to take my word for it. 
 in response, he tells me he will say an "atheist's prayer" for me. 
 
 good luck, bob.  and, best regards.
