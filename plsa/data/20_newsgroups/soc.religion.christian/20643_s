        that argument would be more compelling if it were not for the
 ishtar eggs and ishtar bunnies.  why mix pagan fertility symbols from the
 worship of the pagan goddess of fertility with biblical belief?  what
 would really be lost if all of you were to just drop the word "easter" and
 replace all such occurances with "resurrection sunday"?  would you not
 show up for services if they were called "resurrection sunday services"
 rather than "easter services"?
