 anything that does not bring me closer to god is a sin. 
 (if you think this is too strict, just consider how ambiguous it is.)
 
 this implies that staying the same is a sin. a christian should
 never be satisfied. it does not imply that
 having fun is a sin. it does not imply that sleeping is a sin.
 it does imply that i sin every day.
 
 a perhaps simpler definition:
 anything that is counter to the two great commandments: 
 love god, love your neighbor, is a sin.
 anything i do that is not from love is a sin.
 
 the same action can be a sin sometimes and not a sin sometimes.
 
 i could yell at my kids as discipline, all the time loving them,
 considering only to teach them proper behavior, or i could yell at my
 kids out of anger or selfishness.
 
 i could post an excellent article because i am interested in sharing
 my opinions and getting feedback and learning, or i could post an
 article because i want everyone to realize how wise i am.
