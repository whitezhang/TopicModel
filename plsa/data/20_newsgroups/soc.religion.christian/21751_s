 curiously enough, this subject has occupied a good bit of my prayer life
 recently.  god's experience of time is so completely different from our own,
 since he is both within and without it.  using words like "foreknowledge"
 and "predestination" are semantically incorrect when it comes to describing
 god's perception of our action, because, for god, the beginning, living, and
 ending of our lives are all the same.  sort of.  for god, there is no "before"
 when he did not know, so he could not have "foreknowledge" of our lives or
 a time when he could have "predestined" our actions.  in fact, since our
 understanding of things is so tied to our linear experience of time, i
 would say that it is impossible for us to understand completely how our
 free will interacts with god's control of the universe.
