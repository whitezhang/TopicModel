    in the hebrew of genesis 3:15, the gender is clearly masculine.

    the latin has feminine forms, only by an accident of grammar.
 
 i have yet to see an adequate explanation of st. jerome's translation
 of genesis 3:15.  his latin clearly uses the feminine, but i don't
 know why, since the hebrew is clearly masculine.  if anyone knows of a
 scholarly treatment of this puzzle, i would appreciate hearing from
 you.
