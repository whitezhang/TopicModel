 1 cor 11:31-32 "but if we judged ourselves, we would not come under judgment. 
 when we are judged by the ^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^ lord, we are being discipled so
 that we will not be condemned with the world."
 
 1 cor 5:3 "even though i am not physically present, i am with you in spirit.
 and i have already passed judgment on the one who did this, just as if i were
 present."          ^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^
 
 1 cor 2:15-16 "the spiritual man makes judgments about all things, but he
 himself is not     ^^^^^^^^^ subject to any man's      ^^^ judgement:  'for
 who has known the mind of the lord that he may instruct him?'  but we have the
 mind of christ."
 
 jude :14-15 "enoch, the seventh from adam, prophesied about these men:  'see,
 the lord is coming with thousands upon thousands of his holy ones to judge
 everyone, and to   ^^^^ convict all the ungodly of  ^^^ ^^^^ ^^^^ ^^ ^^^^^ all
 the ungodly acts they have done in the ungodly way, and of all the harsh words

 arrogance is a sin.  although a desire to show others of one's rightness may
 be a sign of arrogance in some cases,  it may be only a sign that they are
 following the bible in others:
 
 jude :22-23 "be merciful to those who doubt; snatch others from the fire and
 save them; to others show mercy, mixed with  ^^^^^^ fear -- hating  ^^^^ even
 ^^^^ the clothing stained by corrupted flesh."
 
 
 >if i find someone arrogant, i typically don't have anything to do with them.  
 
 i hope you don't find me arrogant, then.  this sounds like a bad practice --
 ignoring what certain people say because you perceive them as arrogant.

 listen, slow to speak and slow to become angry,"
