 it might be interesting for folk to know that the church of scotland
 (also a presbyterian church)  managed to "agree to disagree" over
 women's ordination for 25 years.  the reasoning was that congregations
 are free to call whoever they wish, and that ministers and sessions
 choose elders.  if a congregation did not wish to have a woman, they
 were not obliged to, and if a session did not wish to, they could not
 be forced to.  (note that the who issue of freedom to call on the part
 of the congregation is very important here - this year is the 150th
 annivarsary of the disruption, where the church split on that very
 issue, they didn't get back together for almost 80 years).
 
 a couple of years ago on the 25 anniversary of the allowing of womens
 ordination the position was changed - so that, in theory, all
 ministers and elders must recognise that women can be ordained.  in
 theory, a minister who refused to ordain a woman to his session, or
 refused to work with a woman minister in presbytery, could be
 disciplined.  in practice this has not happened, and i believe it is
 unlikely to happen.  my personal view is that the new legislation was
 a mistake, and that the permissive (but not prescriptive) legislation
 worked very well.  
 
 we are going to start going round the homosexual debate at next years
 assembly.  at this years, a motion was put to ban the blessing of
 same-sex couples (after an edinburgh minister did so).  our panel on
 doctrine is currently looking at marriage, and will report next year -
 the matter will be considered and debated then.
 
 hope this is interesting
