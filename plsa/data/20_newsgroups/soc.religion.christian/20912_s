  i find this view of christianity to be quite disheartening and sad.
 the idea that life only has meaning or importance if there is a creator
 does not seem like much of a basis for belief.
 
  and the logic is also appalling: "god must exist because i want him to."
 
  i have heard this line of "reasoning" before and wonder how prevalent
 it is. certainly in modern society many people are convinced life is
 hopeless (or so the pollsters and newscasts state), but i don't see
 where this is a good reason to become religious. if you want 'meaning'
 why not just join a cult, such as in waco? the leaders will give you
 the security blanket you desire.
