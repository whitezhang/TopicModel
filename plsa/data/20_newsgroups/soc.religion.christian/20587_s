 if you would bother to check in any good dictioanry or thesaurus, i think
 you will find that "arrogance" has to do with an offensive exhibition of
 presumed or real superiority (a paraphrase from my own webster's).
 arrognace is about pride and haughtiness. a person can believe in absolute
 truth, even blindly (whatever that means) without being obnoxious about it.
 just as a person can be a "humble," authority-questioning,
 defying-any-theist-to-reply athiest and be quite arrogant. arrogance is not
 about what you believe, it is about how you relate to what you believe and
 how you present it to others. if your overwhelming experience of christians
 has been that they are arrogant, i apologozing both for myself and on the
 behalf of those who have offfended you. but my own experience, at least in
 forums like usenet where you see a good mix of people, is that arrogant
 christians and athiests seems to occur in about equal numbers.
