 i have a simple test. i take several people who can speak
 only one language (e.g. chinese, russian, german, english).
 then i let the "gifted one" start "speaking in toungues".
 the audience should understand the "gifted one" clearly
 in their native language. however, the "gifted one" can
 only hear himself speaking in his own language.
 
 works everytime. 8-)
 perhaps i would believe the "gifted ones" more if they were
 glorifying god rather than themselves. then perhaps we'd
 witness a real miracle.
