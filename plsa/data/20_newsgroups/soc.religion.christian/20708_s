 this is a ridiculous argument for being a christian.  so then, you might 
 consider switching from christianity to another religion if you were 
 offered an even more frightening description of another hell?  how many
 christians do think there are who view it strictly as an insurance policy?
 not many i know; they believe in a message of love and compassion for 
 others.  a faith based on fear of hell sounds like a dysfunctional 
 relationship with god.  like a child who cringes in fear of a parent's
 physical violence.  
 
 many religions have concrete views of heaven and hell, with various
 threats and persuasions regarding who will go where.  competition over
 who can envison the worst hell can hardly nurture the idea of loving
 your neighbor as yourself.
