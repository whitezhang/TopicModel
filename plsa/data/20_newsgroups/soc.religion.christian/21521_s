 	paul-
 
 	you did a wonderful job of not doing anything humany possible to 
 offend us catholics; hopefully i can be just as careful in my wording as you
 were.
 	i also don't want to extend this topic into an entire major issue of
 debate (anymore than it already is), but just a note or two:
 
 	1.  please don't talk about jesus' "parents"--the doctrinal positions
 		of the church an unequivocally different regarding mary and
 		joseph.  i (personally) have never heard of anything being
 		attributed to st. joseph other than his sainthood; that is,
 		no reference *ever* to him being sinless, assumed into heaven,
 		immaculately conceived, etc.--all these ideas apply only to
 		mary.
 
 	2.  i would agree there is very little scriptural evidence for our
 		doctrines about mary.  needless to say, that presents a 
 		significant problem to those who accept the bible as the only
 		source of doctrine.  if, however, one turns to the sacred 
 		traditions of the undivided christian church, there is no
 		problem finding plently of evidence that it was basically a
 		unanimous belief among the apostles and all the early 
 		generation that mary was assumed into heaven, body and soul,
 		etc. etc.  it wasn't until the reformation that these doctrines
 		were called into question.  as far as i am concerned (again, my
 		personaly feelings) if it's a choice between the apostles or
 		luther, i'll choose the apostles every time, whether or not
 		it is recorded within the writings that the traditions of men
 		have determined to be "the bible".
 
 	like a said, just a couple of notes.  as is often said, i believe that
 we must agree to (politely) disagree.  
 	may god's peace and blessings be with you always in your search to
 discover his absolute truth.
