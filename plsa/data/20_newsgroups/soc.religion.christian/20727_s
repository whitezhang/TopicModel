 i have a hard time understanding this attitude.
 
 if the gospels are the least bit accurate, then there can be little
 doubt that jesus belived hell was a reality.
 
 as a teacher, what would be the wise and loving thing to do if people
 in your audience were headed there?  to warn them!  it would, however, 
 be rather cruel and/or sadistic to believe that such a place exists 
 and then remain quiet about it.  
 
 the only scenario i can envision in which dimished respect would be
 justified is if jesus knew there was no such place as hell, and spoke
 about it anyway, just to scare people. unless you would accuse jesus
 of this, i would encourage you to reconsider what a loving response 
 is when you perceive someone to be in danger.
