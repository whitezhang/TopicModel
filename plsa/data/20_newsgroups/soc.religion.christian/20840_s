    without active participation.  if you know the latin, one really
    beautiful way to hear the passion is it's being chanted by three
    deacons:  the narrator chants in the middle baritone range, jesus chants
    in the bass, and others directly quoted are handled by a high tenor.
 
 i heard the gregorian chant of the passion on good friday.  in this
 liturgy, our lord is definitely *very* sad.  it's as if he has
 resigned himself to die for these poor pitiful creatures who are
 killing him.
 
 the chant is *quite* beautiful.
