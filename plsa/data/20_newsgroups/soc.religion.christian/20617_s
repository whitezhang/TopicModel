 years ago i grabbed the following from the net - maybe from this
 newsgroup.  does anyone know of a source for whether this is an
 accurate quote?   thanks!  bartletts leaves out the homosexual lines,
 but they were one of the groups the nazis tried to exterminate.
 ===
 in germany, they first came for the communists,
 and i didn't speak up because i wasn't a communist.
 then they came for the jews,
 and i didn't speak up because i wasn't a jew.
 then they came for the trade unionists,
 and i didn't speak up because i wasn't a trade unionist.
 then they came for the homosexuals, and i didn't speak up
 because i wasn't a homosexual.
 then they came for the catholics, and i didn't speak up
 because i was a protestant.
 then they came for me ---
 but by that time there was no one left to speak up.
