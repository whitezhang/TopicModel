 several replies to my post have said that i should get to know  
 christian homosexuals before judging them.  i maintain that i was not  
 judging them by saying that homosexuality is wrong.   i would like to  
 look at the responces to my post and make a general sterotypical  
 evaluation of the people who responded to the side of christianity  
 and homosexuality being compatible (admitedly not all are homosexuals  
 but i know that many are from their e-mail responces).  i don't  
 normally make sterotypical assumptions about groups of people, but  
 since i have been asked to by many of the opposing veiw point i will.
 
 so far people have made wild assumptions, put me down because i don't  
 have the resources of others, and even reverted to name calling.  if  
 you don't think this is an acurate representation then those of you  
 who are homosexual christians show me the diffrence.
 
 in christ's love,
 bryan
