 no, imo, mr. stowell missed the point.

 mr. stowell seems to have jumped rather strangely from truth to absolutes.
 i don't see how that necessarily follows.  
 
 are all truths also absolutes?
 is all of scripture truths (and therefore absolutes)?
 
 if the answer to either of these questions is no, then perhaps you can 
 explain to me how you determine which parts of scripture are truths, and
 which truths are absolutes.  and, who is qualified to make these 
 determinations?  there is hardly consensus, even in evangelical 
 christianity (not to mention the rest of christianity) regarding 
 biblical interpretation.
 
 i find mr. stowell's statement terribly simple-minded.
