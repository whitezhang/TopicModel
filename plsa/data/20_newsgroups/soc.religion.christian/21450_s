 without quoting at length from the preceeding post, i'd just like
 to say that i find it a much more appropriate way of dealing with
 issues like the holocaust and bosnia that asserting that "god is
 punishing them."
 
 the activity of god is always _redemptive_, which means "restoring
 what has been lost, broken, or distorted."  so, god does not _will_
 the brokenness, lostness, distortion, genocide, poverty, etc, but
 is nonetheless capable, willing, and active to restore, heal, mend,
 and redeeem.
