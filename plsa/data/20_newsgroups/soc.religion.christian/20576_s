 i'm not surprised that you see no wisdom in them.  that is because your
 premises are wrong from the word "go".  you claim that christianity is
 based on blind faith, but this simply is not so.  just look at the
 current thread on the evidence for jesus' resurrection for evidence
 that jesus was real and that he triumphed over death.
 
 furthermore, you say that christians hold to their beliefs "regardless of
 any evidence that you may find to the contrary."  without any evidence
 to support your claim, this statement is little more than an ad hominem 
 argument.
 
 mind you, i don't mean this as a personal attack.  i'm merely pointing out
 the intellectual dishonesty behind condemning christianity in this fashion.
 it would make much more sense if you could prove that all christians do 
 base their belief on empty nothings, and that they do ignore all evidence to 
 the contrary.  only then can you expect your attack to make sense.
