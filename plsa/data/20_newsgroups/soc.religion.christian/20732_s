    this is probably too simplistic for some, but john 3:16 saus,
    "for god so loved the world that he gave his only son, that
    whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life".
 
    genesis 15:6, "and he (abram) believed the lord; and he reckoned
    it to him as righteousness".
 
    i don't find anywhere that god restricts heaven to particular
    ethnic groups or religious denominations or any other category
    that we humans like to drop people into. but he does require
    that we believe and trust him. in hebrews it says that god spoke
    of old by the prophets (the old testament), but in these last days
    he has spoken to us by his son jesus christ. and we learn of
    him through the pages of the new testament. the bible tells us
    what we need to believe. for those who have never heard, i leave
    them in god's capable care, he will make himself known as he
    desires. it behooves each one of us to act upon the knowledge
    we have. if you reject the claims of jesus, and still go to
    heaven, then the joke's on me. if you reject him and go to hell,
    that's no joke, but it will be final.
