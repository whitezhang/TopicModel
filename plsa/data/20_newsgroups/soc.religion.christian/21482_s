 i haven't read this entire thread, but, if someone hasn't tossed this out yet, then here it is: 
 
 2 samuel 12:21-23 (rsv) : 
 
   "then his servants said to him, `what is this thing that you have
   done? you fasted and wept for the child while it was alive; but when
   the child died, you arose and ate food.' he [david] said, 'while the
   child was still alive, i fasted and wept; for i said, 'who knows
   whether the lord will be gracious to me, that the child may live?' but
   now he is dead; why should i fast? can i bring him back again? i shall
   go to him, but he will not return to me.'"
 
 anyhow, many interpret this to mean that the child has gone to heaven
 (where david will someday go). i don't claim to know for sure if this
 applies to all babies or not. but even if it's just this one, what
 would you say to this?
