 i'm compiling a bibliography on religious perspectives on esotericism,
 hermeticism, gnosticism, mysticism, occultism, alchemy and magic, and
 am interested in sources that others have found particularly interesting
 and insightful.  i'm especially interested in medieval works, such as
 _the chemical wedding of christian rosenkreutz_ and arthurian legends.
 
 please feel free, too, to send personal opinions on any of the above,
 pro or con or anywhere in between.  thanks much.
