 john, 
 
 while i will not take the time to rebut you point by point, i will suggest
 three current works which i think will be helpful in your quest to answer
 this question.  john dominic crossan (professor of religion at de paul univ)-
 _the cross that spoke_ harper and row pub. 1988, also his latest work 
 _the historical jesus - the life of a mediterranean jewish peasant_ harper
 and row pub. 1991,  also two works of burton mack (professor of new testament
 at the claremont graduate school) _a myth of innocence_ fortress press 1988,
 and his latest book _the lost gospel: the book of q and christian origins_
 harper and row, 1992.  you might start with mack's book on q and then 
 examine the others afterward.  however i think that once you do that you will
 see that your "evidence" is not as sturdy as you'd like.  most of the tired
 arguements you stated, assume eyewitness accounts, such is not the case. but
 anyway look at mack and crossan and then get back to us.
