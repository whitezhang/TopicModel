 i don't know which passage you are refering to, but the passage i have
 often seen cited as an example of a mother image of god is isaiah 49:15
 "can a woman forget her sucking child / that she should have no 
 compassion / on the son of her womb? / even these may forget, / 
 yet i will not forget you." 
  
 this passage is *not* a mother image of god at all. the mother here
 is the image of the best human constancy can show, and it is 
 contrasted with the constancy of god. the mother figure here represents
 mankind, not god.
