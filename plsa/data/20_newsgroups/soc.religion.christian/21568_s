 ouch, this is a good question. to me, not existing is worse
 than existing no matter what, so i will modify this question to be:
 would i be a christian if it made no eternal difference in my
 reward or punishment? i hope this is in the same spirit you want.
 
 i personally am very goal oriented. it is hard for me to do things
 that do not achieve some goal. however, to relate this to sports, 
 only after i learned to not care about the score did i become
 a good basketball player. i had to learn to go all out no matter
 the situation. perhaps this lesson is relevent. after all,
 only if i can give up my life can i keep it, only if i am
 humble can i achieve glory. only if i concentrate on living
 my life now the best i can will i be afforded life eternal.
 i think you have illuminated the true meaning of "saved by faith."
 
 but what is my answer? right now i would remain a christian.
 however, was that always my answer? that's the problem. heaven
 and hell are good motivators at certain stages of maturity.
 and i admit there are certain times when perhaps i bite my
 tongue and put up with something in the hope of a better day,
 i.e. i mentally trade present happiness for future happiness.
 i hope the cynics and skeptics do not read more into that
 than appropriate, but i am trying to be honest.

 i think these kinds of questions are extremely fruitful. i guess it
 depends on how one views knowledge and learning. by stripping
 ideas to simple, straightforward, opposing concepts we can
 determine levels of importance. by analyzing the theoretically 
 absurd we can gain a better understanding of the actually absurd.
