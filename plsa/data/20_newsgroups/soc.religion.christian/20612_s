 i would like to get your opinions on this: when exactly does an engaged
 couple become "married" in god's eyes?  some say that if the two have
 publically announced their plans to marry, have made their vows to god, and
 are unswervingly committed to one another (i realize this is a subjective
 qualifier) they are married/joined in god's sight.
 
 suppose they are unable to get before the altar right at the current time
 because of purely logistical reasons beyond their control.  what do you
 think about this?
 
 post or e-mail me with general responses.  if you need clarification as to
 what i am asking, please e-mail.
 
 thanks and god bless!
