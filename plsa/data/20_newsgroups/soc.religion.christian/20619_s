 in response to a lot of email i've gotten, i need to clarify my position.
 
 i am not in favor of paganism.
 
 i am not in favor of the easter bunny or other non-christian aspects of
 easter as presently celebrated.  (incidentally, easter eggs are not
 non-christian; they are a way of ending the lenten fast.)
 
 my point was to distinguish between
   (1) intentionally worshipping a pagan deity, and
   (2) doing something which may once have had pagan associations, but
 nowadays is not understood or intended as such.
 
 many people who are doing (2) are being accused of (1).
 
 it would be illogical to claim that one is "really" worshipping a
 pagan deity without knowing it.  worship is a matter of intention.
 one cannot worship without knowing that one is doing so.
