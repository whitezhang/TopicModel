 i do recall watt making a comment to this effect, though it was quite a few
 years back and i can't cite the specifics.  i also recall that cecil andrus, who
 was secretary of the interior during the carter administration, responded
 to watt's comments by pointing out the stewardship role that god gave
 to man, as recorded in genesis.  which makes me wonder: who are the
 true conservatives?  it seems to me that a *conservative* should want to
 *conserve* things of value for long-term societal benefit.  this form of
 *conservation* should logically extend to the physical environment in 
 which people live, as well as the moral environment in which they relate
 to one another and to god.
 
 imho, watt's stewardship status is not enhanced by the fact that he served 
 on the board of directors for jim bakker's organization, during a time in 
 which bakker committed criminal acts which eventually landed bakker 
 in federal prison.
