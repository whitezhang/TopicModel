 although i certainly agree with the basic sentiment that snideness is
 unloving and ineffective, i'm a little disturbed by the formulation that
 ill temper is not a christian trait. it seems like a false argument to
 say that anyone who displays trait x must not be a christian. could
 well be a sinning christian, but a christian nonetheless.
 anger is human, and christians are
 human: christians get angry and defensive and react badly just like
 everyone else. it's not perfect righteousness but the effort of seeking
 righteousness that marks a dedicated christian. and one of the greatest
 gifts of faith to me is that of seeking and accepting forgiveness for
 my failures. expecting flawless behavior from self or others isn't
 christianity: it's perfectionism.
