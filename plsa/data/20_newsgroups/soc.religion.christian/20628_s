 no the members of the first group are not necessarily
 arrogant.  but when i ask them if they are absolutely certain
 that the volcano will erupt, i expect them to say so "no,
 but i've chosen to believe some knowledgable people who have
 determined that the volcano will erupt," rather than, "yes, i am
 absolutely certain."  when it comes to religious discussions,
 arrogance or at best naivete is reflected in the latter type of
 statement.
