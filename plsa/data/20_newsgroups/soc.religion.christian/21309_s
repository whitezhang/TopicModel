 so true.  i'm not sure of the basis of the belief, but it was a widely
 held belief among the laity of the rc church and their support of it
 lead to it being declared to be true.  basically the teaching on infallibility
 holds that the pope is infallible in matters of faith and doctrine, the
 college of bishops is likewise infallible, and the laity is as well.
 the pope gets most of the attention/criticism but the consensus of the
 other bodies is equally infallible (according to rc teaching).
