 we also cannot fail to note the intense suffering a devastation which has been
 wrecked on our world because of christians -- who were certain they were
 following christ.  from captialist who have polluted the enviorment in strict
 obedience to the gensis command to subdue the earth, to nazi's who have
 "justly"
 punished the jews for the killing christ (as well as the other progroms), the
 innocent women who were burned alive in accordance with "you shall not allow a
 witch to live", the moslems who were killed in the crusades, the god-fearing
 men destroyed by the inquistion.  the religious wars in spain, france, england,
 etc.  christianity has undoubtedly caused the most suffering and needless loss
 of life by individuals whose certainity that they were following the
 instructions therein, was unquestionable.  there is much to grieve.
