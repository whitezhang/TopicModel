 a good example of this is abraham (referred to in the james passage). hebrews
 says that abraham was justified by faith -- but his faith was demonstrated
 through his works (i.e., he obeyed what god told him to do).
 
 reading abraham's ``biography'' in genesis is very instructive. he was a man
 beset by *lack* of faith a lot of the time (e.g. lying about sarah being his
 wife on 2 occasions; trying to fulfil god's promise on god's behalf by
 copulating with hagar). . . yet it seems that god didn't evaluate him on the
 basis of individual incidents. abraham is listed as one of the ``heroes of 
 faith'' in hebrews 11. i.e., when it really came to the crunch, god declared
 abraham as a man of faith. he believed god's promises.
 
 this gives us confidence. although real faith demonstrates itself through
 works, god is not going to judge us according to our success/failure in
 performing works.

 he saved us, through the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the holy
 spirit.'' (titus 3.5)
 
 amazing grace! hallelujah!
