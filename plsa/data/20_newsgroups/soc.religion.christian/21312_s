 from time to time i have made reference to a book called "the two babylons"
 which is a book written by alexander hislop (mid 1800's) about the babylonian
 mystery religion and its flight through history.  i was unable to put it down
 the first time i read it, but others have found it dry.  it has numberable
 references and illustrations.  if you are interested in purchasing your own
 copy, you can call moody book store @ (312)329-4352 and order it for $16.99 and
 they will ship it to you.   
   it is a good book just to get the reference titles for your own digs into the
 mystery religions.  i have found it invaluable for that purpose alone.  but for
 those who only want to skim the subject, it comes highly recommended.  
   just a note to my rc brothers and sisters.  you may find this to be a
 diatribe or you may find it to be a test to the origin and true nature of the
 origin of rcism.  if you are offended by anything that asks hard questions
 about your denomination (as to whether or not it is "christian") then perhaps
 you should just passover this offer.  to those who are a little more
 adventurous, go for it and later, please contact me with you reasons pro or con
 on the scholorship of this book.  i really would be interested.
