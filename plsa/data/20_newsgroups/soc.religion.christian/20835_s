 i'm interested if anyone out here can point me towards a review of the
 following book in any scholarly christian journal, whether it be
 conservative or liberal, protestant or catholic.
 
 _the_lost_years_of_jesus_ (documentary evidence for jesus' 17 year
 journey to the east), by elizabeth clare prophet.  supposedly this
 is a theory that was refuted in the past, and she has re-examined it.
 
 i thought this was just another novel book, but i saw it listed as
 a text for a class in religious studies here.  also, the endorsements seem
 to come from some credible sources, so i'm wondering if scholars have
 reviewed it (or anyone on the net, for that matter).
