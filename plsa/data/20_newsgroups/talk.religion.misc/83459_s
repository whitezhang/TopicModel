 hs>do you also think we shouldn't fund treatment for heart disease, since after
 hs>all, those people are in that situation because of their lifestyle
 hs>(overeating, lack of exercise, etc)?  what about skin cancer patients
 hs>(tanning), lung cancer patients (smoking), car accident victims (driving)?
 
 man heather, you are trying to make me think again. first, heart
 disease, we are all going to die.
 
 to answer your question above, why should people who are
 responsible pay for the irresponsible acts of others? one
 more time, if you are going to engage in an act (eating, watching the
 tube, smoking, drinking, driving (drinking and driving) you should be
 responsible for your actions and the conquences of that action.
 
 hs>why limit yourself to just situations which are related to sexual behavior?
 
 i'am not, it is just that babies are dieing and i need to move on that
 right now. do one thing right and do it well.
 
 hs>shouldn't we make all the people mentioned above take all the responsibility
 hs>for their situation and not ask you to pay for it, since they too chose the
 hs>course they led?
 
 couldn't have said it better.
