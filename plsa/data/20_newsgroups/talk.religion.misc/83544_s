 yes, this is certainly one of the traditional ideas about the mithraic
 cult (although not the only one.)  it had many elements that seem
 to have been borrowed by catholicism (e.g. the mass, communion, the
 sharing of a sacred meal, consecration of bread and wine, etc.)
 
 for quite an amusing novel that uses this same idea, check out:
 
 the covenant of the flame
 by david morrell.
 
 it has some quite interesting occult bits, and lots of killing.
 i won't spoil it by revealing the ending, but i will say that it
 is relevant to mithraism.
