 john 12:24-26: "most assuredly, i say to you, unless a grain of wheat
 falls onto the ground and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it
 produces much grain.
   "he who loves his life will lose it, and he who hates his life in
 this world will keep it for eternal life.
   "if anyone serves me, let him follow me; and where i am, there my
 servant will be also.  if anyone serves me, him my father will honor."
 
 why would i want an eternal life if i hate this one?
 
 if we were created by a deity, why would that deity not wish us to
 enjoy what he has given us?
 
 why would i want to live forever?  the challenge in my life is that i
 will die, and that i must give my life the meaning i wish it to have
 before that happens.  my time is here and will someday pass; i will be
 content to live on in the memories of my friends, and once they too
 are dead, then i will no longer have any reason to exist.
 
 in short: even if your deity *does* exist, that doesn't automatically
 mean that i would worship it.  i am content to live my own life, and
 fend for myself, so when i die, i can be proud of the fact that no
 matter where i end up, it will be because of *my* actions and *my* choices.
 
 if your god decides to toss me into a flaming pit for this, then so be
 it.  i would much rather just cease to exist.  but if your god wants
 my respect and my obedience, then it had better earn these; and if it
 does, then they will be very strong and true.

 jesus wasn't the only one who rose from the dead -- i think it was
 osiris who did the same, as well as a few characters from greek or
 norse legend, if memory serves.
 
 but still: why would i want to rise from the dead?  why do *you* want to?

 if your god wants to win my devotion, then it knows what it can do --
 provide some way for me to believe without having to resort to blind
 faith that could be applied equally well to any religion.

 that's precisely it.  i neither see nor know zeus either, nor odin.
 shall i offer them the same devotion i offer jesus?

 you've got to understand my point-of-view: i see christians spouting
 bible verse all the time as if it were some sort of magic spell that
 will level all opposition.  truth is, it's not.  robert has never
 demonstrated that he actually understands what the verses imply; he
 just rattles them off day by day.  some brazenly fly in the face of
 common sense and reality, and i point these out where i can.
 
 but even more than that, even when christians *do* try to explain the
 verses in their own words, they do so from a christian point of view,
 which is that every human being would want to be a christian if only
 he or she understood the christian message properly, and then all
 strife and suffering on the earth would end.  here's the problem with
 that: substitute "moslem" or "buddhist" or "satanist" instead of
 "christian", and it means the same thing.
 
 christanity is a very nice belief set around a very nice book.  but if
 you want to make me believe that it has any bearing on the real world,
 you've got some convincing to do.

 and in my opinion, you're bumbling about blindly making up entities
 where there aren't any, and depriving yourself of a true understanding
 and enjoyment of your life.  as long as you keep your beliefs to
 yourself, i'll keep my beliefs to myself -- but as soon as you start
 waving them around, expect me to toss in my opinions, too.
