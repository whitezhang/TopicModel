 
 the nicene creed
 
 we believe in one god the father almighty, maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible.
 and in one lord jesus christ, the only-begotten son of god, begotten of the father before all worlds, god of god, light of light, very god of very god, begotten not made, being of one substance with the father by whom all things were made; who for us men, and for our salvation, came down from heaven and was incarnate by the holy spirit of the virgin mary, and was made man, and was crucified also for us under pontius pilate.  he suffered and was buried, and the third day rose again according to the scriptur
 
 
 
 
 
 es, and ascended into heaven, and sitteth on the right hand of the father.  and he shall come again with glory to judge  both the quick and the dead, whose kingdom shall have no end.
 
 and we believe in the holy spirit, the lord and giver of life, who proceedeth from the father and the son, who with the father and the son together is worshipped and glorified, who spoke by the prophets.  and we believe in one holy and apostolic church. we acknowledge one baptism for the remission of sins. and we look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come. amen.
