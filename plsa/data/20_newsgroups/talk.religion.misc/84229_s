 
 burning yourself alive seems a rough way to go, given the waco bunch
 had other choices.
 
 but it reminded me of the russian old-believers who, thinking the
 antichrist was coming in 1666, grew frantic when peter the great 
 started westernizing russia and reforming the russian church a few
 years later. they locked themselves in their churches and burned
 themselves alive by the thousands. 
 
 are there other cases of apocalypse-obsessed christians resorting
 to self-imolation? is there a history of precedents?
