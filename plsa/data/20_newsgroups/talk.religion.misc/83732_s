 how about the following inaccurate, unsubstantiated accusations:
 in 8257@blue.cis.pitt.edu
 >jim has been threatening
 	- but no "threat" produced 
 >once he realized that
 	- display of telepathy
 >threatening to quote me
 	- in spite of no "threat" produced, nor forecast ever happening (precognition?)
 >responding jim's threat to quote me
 	- in spite of claimed threat never being given
 >jim, preparing to...
 	- in spite of it never happening.  telepathy or precognition?
 >jim again, still mystified
 	- unsubstantiated and untrue.  more telepathy?  or maybe telempathy?
 >jim, still scandalized
 	- unsubstantiated again.  seems to be a habit...

 you appear to have the products of paranatural divination methods?
