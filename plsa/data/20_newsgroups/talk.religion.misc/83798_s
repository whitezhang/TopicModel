 for those missing the context of this thrilling discussion between
 jim and i, jim wrote the following to me in e-mail after i pointed out
 that he (jim) had taken a quote out of context:
 >in t.r.m. robert weiss writes [a promise from psalm 9:10]
 >gee, since you wouldn't be at all hypocritical, you must be really
 >busy arguing against these out-of-context extracted translations!
 
 he directed a similar accusation of hypocrisy, again based on a lack of
 response to an article by robert weiss, toward stephen.
 
 i pointed out that i did, in fact, agree that both robert weiss and
 jim meritt took quotes out of context.  hence, i find it difficult to
 understand why jim thinks i am a hypocrite.  needless to say, i don't
 have time to reply to *every* article on t.r.m. that takes a quote
 out of context.  
 
 i asked jim the following:
 >}so, according to you, jim, the only way to criticize one person for
 >}taking a quote out of context, without being a hypocrite, is to post a
 >}response to *every* person on t.r.m who takes a quote out of context?
 
 jim replied by saying 
 >did i either ask or assert that?
 
 but today we find four articles from jim, one of which has the subject
 "silence is concurrence":  
 
 m23364@mwunix.mitre.org (james meritt) writes:

 which is, of course, a complete red herring.  taking quotes out of
 context isn't a crime.  i don't have time to read every article on
 t.r.m., and i'm certainly under no obligation to reply to them all.
 
 does "silence is concurrence" imply that jim thinks that because i
 didn't respond to weiss' articles i must condone weiss' taking quotes
 out of context?  jim doesn't want to give a direct answer to this
 question; read what he has written and decide for yourself.
 
 
 but back to the context of my conversation with jim.  jim's next 
 gambit was to claim that he was using inductive logic when he
 concluded that i was being a hypocrite.  i challenged him to provide
 the details of that logic that led him to an incorrect conclusion.
 today we find another obscure article (posting it twice didn't help
 make it more clear, jim), titled "inductive logic":
 
 >scenario:
 >a white goose waddles past the door
 >a white goose waddles past the door
 >a white goose waddles past the door
 >...( repeat an uncountably large number of times)...
 >a black goose waddles past the door.  an individual hits it with an axe.

 more red herrings.  could jim mean that he has read an uncountably large
 number of my articles?  could jim mean that because i "axed" his articles,
 but not weiss' articles, he wants to conclude inductively ...
 well, i can't see where he is going with this.
 
 but i can help him with his induction.  i've written roughly 80
 articles since january.  the vast majority of them are discussions with
 frank decenso and other inerrantists, where i take the position that
 they are making bad arguments.  some are discussions with jim meritt
 where i take the position that he is making bad arguments (a straw man
 argument earlier, and taking quotes out of context more recently.)
 
 think hard about this jim.  see the pattern?  think harder.  run it
 through your induction engine and see what pops out.
