 	i'm not sure that you can distinguish between myth and legend so
 neatly, or at all.  a myth is more than a single story.  the thought 
 structure and world-paradigm in which that story is interpreted is as
 important a part of the myth as the story itself.  thus, i can think of
 no story which is meant to be conveyed understandably from one person
 to another within a single culture which won't rest upon that underlying
 thought structure, and thus transmit some of that culture's mythical
 "truths" along with it.
