 isn't that interesting?!  in the jewish tradition you are incredibly
 wrong!  they originate in the torah and with jewish ancestors,
 specifically the patriarch abraham (z"l).  that knowledge was sent east
 to india and china when abraham gave "gifts" (the commentators to jewish
 scripture say this was the knowledge of the occult arts) to all the rest
 of his children when he sent them away to the east.  this assured that
 isaac only, who remained with abraham, would inherit his most important
 spiritual gifts, what eventually became judaism.
 
 so you see, other religions can have very parochial views too.  by the
 jewish view, you are very mistaken, your scripture are not scripture,
 your gods are not gods, your practices a jumble of errors that lead
 people to idol worship and away from god.  that doesn't stop us from
 respecting you to the extent of not trying to convert you or proselytize
 you and being willing to dialog in a respectful manner.  we're content
 to let you live the way you care to live as long as you leave us be.  we
 are happy to co-exist as long as you give us the same right.
 
 but your incredible rudeness and violent nature seems to preclude that.
 too bad.  is this typical of your religion?

 you are a most presumptuous fellow!  how dare you presume that the
 "typical" new ager doesn't acknowledge god and is selfish.  what trite,
 self-righteous, ego-ful garbage!  there are buddhists, christians, jews,
 and those of many other religions here on this newsgroups for whom your
 words are simple slander.

 of course, from the jewish perspective you are incredibly wrong.  we'd
 say that there is no "godhead" -- just created beings who may be
 enjoying a good laugh at your expense.

 so not only are we selfish, we are also thieves and liars!  and you
 expect any of us to pay attention to you and your "religion?"  why not
 call us more name?   maybe then we'll all convert in gratefullness!

 you delude yourself.
