 dennis, there are 1e6 things i pay taxes for, and that i don't approve
 of, such as paying lawyers to postpone death sentences, creating
 silly weapons that are never used, placing china as the preferred
 nation while china doesn't have any human rights.
 
 the democracy works by selecting the people you want to govern and 
 to make sure that your opinion is heard. remember what spock said:
 "the needs of the few outweight the needs of the many".
 
 as long as government spending does not contradict the constitution
 i don't see any problems in a case where the people have selected 
 a group of people to make decisions in one direction. and if this is 
 bad, then we should elect a new government. democratic systems work
 this way, and i don't have anything against you raising an opinion
 in your case. 
 
 i just hope you realize that each individual should make their
 own judgement, and posting pre-filled letters sounds like you
 don't trust your fellow americans to utter their own opinion,
 just your own.
 
 cheers,
 kent
