 no.  zeno's paradox is resolved by showing that integration or an infinite
 series of decreasing terms can sum to a finite result.

 well, suppose a probe emitting radiation at a constant frequency was
 sent towards a black hole.  as it got closer to the event horizon, the
 red shift would keep increasing.  the period would get longer and longer,
 but it would never stop.  an observer would not observe the probe actually
 reaching the event horizon.  the detected energy from the probe would keep
 decreasing, but it wouldn't vanish.  exp(-t) never quite reaches zero.
 
 i guess the above probably doesn't make things any more clear, but hopefully
 you will get the general idea maybe.
