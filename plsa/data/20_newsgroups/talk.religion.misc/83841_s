 i will attempt to construct a facsimile of what was previously said, and 
 then address kermit's offering.

      i respond.
 
      the question that was raised was not if jesus went to infernal paradise
      before entering into heaven. no one has made a point for or against 
      that issue, nor have they compared the lds position against orthodox
      belief. the infernal paradise is held to be abraham's bosom (luke 16), 
      the place of the righteous dead in sheol (equivalent to hades).
 
      the point that was raised by john was that someone could not repent
      on their death bed. tom albrecht pointed to a biblical example that was
      contradictory to what john's position put forward. the thief on the 
      cross was promised by christ to be with him in paradise, the abode of 
      the righteous dead. john's position possibly needs to be reworked.
      kermit needs to address the topic at hand.
