   thanks for the etymology lesson, but i actually know what "orthodox" means.
 you're avoiding my question, however, which was: from what body of theology
 does your version of orthodoxy come?  you seem to simply be saying that
 whatever *you* understand the bible to say is "orthodox."

   you are obviously mistaken, since many, many people have read the bible and
 many do not agree with you on this point.  once again, robert, is your
 interpretation the only "correct" or "orthodox" one?

    this whole string began as a response to your attacks on mormonism; no one
 is attacking your personal beliefs, only your tendency to present them as
 "orthodoxy."  i don't much care *what* you believe about the bible; just don't
 present you personal understanding as the only "orthodox" one.

    i have never attacked your specific beliefs -- that's *your* approach,
 remember?
     stating that other people who depend solely on the bible have other views
 is indeed proof that the bible can be interpreted many ways, which has been
 my whole point all along.  the specifics of your belief are your business;
 just don't pretend that they are anything more than your personal
 intepretation, and be careful about crying "heresy" based on your private
 belief system.
