 aside from the fact that you will be flamed up one side and down the other
 for suggesting that the rkba was "invented" rather than merely recognized,
 your assertion merely reinforces the knowledge that rkba must be maintained
 so that we, the people, can protect our own neighborhoods.  the police
 certainly aren't doing it.  how long did it take the dc police to catch
 that drive-by shotgunner (note that he wasn't using an uzi, but one of
 those shotguns you claim we needed to worry about back then)?  i believe
 there were eleven attacks before the police ever caught a suspect....

 yes, gone are the days when you can leave your house unlocked at night.
 well, it couldn't last forever.
