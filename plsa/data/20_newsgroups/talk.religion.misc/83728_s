 a good point.  what helps to keep such things going is the public
 attitude that one should have "faith""; that some authority from
 on high should not be subjected to mere reason.  couple this with a
 variety of personality quirks, mojor and minor mental illnesses, and
 ego of would-be leaders, and you get all the variety of cults and 
 religions that people subscribe to.
