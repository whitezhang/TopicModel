 not entirely.  its not a premise, its a conclusion.  second, that scientists
 (for the most part) exlude the possibility is not a problem, its a necessity. 
 scientists are empircists, not theologians.

 so do scientists, and long before you did.  clearly you have a deep and 
 fundamental misunderstanding of science.

 absolutely and utterly false (except for some were amhs). lucy (australopithecus
 afarensis, ca. 3 to 3.25 mya) is 40% complete, and about 80% taking into 
 consideration bilateral symmetry.  lucy walked upright and bipedally, just 
 like humans, and the two share a remarkably similar dental pattern.  her
 cranial morphology is unlike humans or modern apes.  there are hundreds of 
 other specimens of this and other species, of which only some are *partially* 
 reconstructed.  they exist bill.  you can touch them, feel them, hold them.  
 but forget hominids.  the earth, the universe, the cultural record all look and 
 test out as ancient indeed.  they are not reconstructions.  has god has tricked
 us here too?  it won't go away, bill.

 so *you* and other fundamentalists say.  what about the billions who don't 
 say so?  beware of people who say they have the truth, bill, and reconsider
 each time you think you do.

 that was not your point, bill.  your point above was god *has* the power ....
 scientists generally agree with that.  that's a far cry from saying god did.
 please attempt to understand your own posts.
