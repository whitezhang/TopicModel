 question for those of you who seem to be fundamentalists (stephen
 tice, the cotera, joe gaut, et al)(apologies if i've mislabelled any
 of you, i've only started reading t.r.m since the bd disaster.  but i
 know the cotera is a fundy) and are defending koresh and his beliefs
 as an example of true christianity under persecution from the the big
 bad secular state: what is your opinion of his reported sexual habits?
 if the reports are accurate, what iyo does this say about the quality of
 his christianity?  or are the allegations just part of the big
 cover-up?
 
 (i remain deliberately neutral on the cause of the fire: i wouldn't
 put it past koresh to have torched the place himself.  on the other
 hand, if the propane-tank-accident story is correct, i wouldn't put it
 past the fbi to try to cover its ass by claiming koresh did it.  i
 hope your government does a very thorough investigation of the whole
 debacle, and i'll be disappointed if a few heads don't roll.  the
 authorities seem to have botched the original raid, and in the matter
 of the fire, are guilty of either serious misjudgement, or reckless
 endangerment.)
