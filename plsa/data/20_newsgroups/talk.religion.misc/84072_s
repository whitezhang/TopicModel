 of course it is.  it forms a very big part of your self-respect.  you come onto 
 the board, thinking you're some sort of apologeticist for your faith, and you
 routinely get roasted over a grill for stupid theories and unfounded assumptions.

 i doubt that sieferman has anything to do with you dropping out.  
 
 it's probably closer to the truth to say that you don't have the cards to 
 play in this game (because you insist on playing from a losing hand), and you're
 finally realizing it.  you will lurk on the board, and keep 
 quiet for a while, looking for an area where you are *certain* that you 
 are correct, and then we'll see you pop back in again.  of course, you then
 will say that you have merely returned because your life is now "in order".
 
 but we'll know better.
