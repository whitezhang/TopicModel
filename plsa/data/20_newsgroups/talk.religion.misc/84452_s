 i recently watched a an episode of "the old west" a tv show on the 
 discovery channel (or perhaps the a&e network), the one hosted by kenny
 rogers.  this episode was all about the mormons and how they settled utah,
 etc.
 
 a large portion of the broadcast was about the "mountain meadows massacre".
 the program very specifically pointed out that brigham young knew nothing
 about the incident until long after it had happened (before telegraph), and
 it occured as a result of several men inciting a bunch of paronoid moromn
 settlers into what amounted to a mob.  all participants in the incident were
 prosecuted and eccomunicated from the lds church.
 
 i suggest you watch a rerun of that episode (they play them over and over) 
 and see what they (non-mormons) have to say about it.
