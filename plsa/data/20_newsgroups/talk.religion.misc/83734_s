 this was obviously a lot different than the ordinary fbi adventure.
 
 i believe that the federal officers had a conflict of interests here.
 
 throught out the whole affair, it seamed to me that they were chiefly
 concerned with saving face rather than saving lifes.  its true that
 the bd were resisting arrest and that they should have surrendered
 when they first realized that these where federal officers.  but they
 didn`t.  
 
 but when they didn`t, the fbi should not have treated as a hostage
 situation, it wasn't.  
 
 i think  more discussions, possible independant negotiators, and
 family intervention should have been used.
 
 of course this is just monday morning quartberbaking...or is it?
 
 
 i don`t think i shall every forget reno responding to ted
 koppels questions last night.  watching the ag squirm when
 telling us that the only reason they "stepped it up" a bit
 was because of there fear for the safety of the children.
 
 when i think of the chief role of the government--to protect and
 to serve....i ask myself--just who where they protecting and just
 who where they serving?
 
 i did see a flag at half mast today.  i wonder who they are mourning.
