 your last remark is a contradiction, but i'll let that pass.
 
 i was addressing the notion of the great commission, which
 you deleted in order to provide us with dull little homilies.
 thank you, bing crosby.  now you go right on back to sleep
 and mommy and daddy will tuck you in later.
 
 oh, and how convenient his bible must have been to michael
 griffin, how convenient his christianity.  "well, i'll just
 skip the bit about not murdering people and loving the sinner
 and hating the sin and all that other stuff for now and
 concentrate on the part where it says that if someone is doing
 something wrong, you should shoot him in the back several times
 as he tries to hobble away on his crutches."
 
 i'll leave the "convert or die" program of the missionaries and
 their military escorts in the americas for nadja to explain as
 she knows much more about it than i.
 
 must be awfully convenient, by the way, to offer platitudes
 as you have done, david, rather than addressing the arguments.
