 andy-- i think we do agree, given your clarification of how we were 
 each using the terms fact and theory.  i'll only add that i
 think perhaps i feel more strongly about separating them,
 though your usage is quite valid.

 i'll add here that any falsification or rejection does not in any way
 reduce its current usefulness.  so long as it accurately predicts or 
 describes things we can observe.
 
 not to be a pain in the ass, but is there any reason you don't
 just say _the theory of evolution_ rather than the _fact of evolution
 is still a theory_.  i'm asking because this whole thread got started
 because i was bothered by a post that referred to _the fact of evolution_,
 basically leaving off the phrase _is still a theory_.  without a 
 clarification, like the one you just gave, just saying _the fact of
 evolution_ has a very different meaning to me.

 i'm not sure i agree here.  again, it may be because i feel stronger
 about separating terms.  i was trying to say that the _theories_
 proposed to explain the _mechanisms_ and the _mechanisms_ themselves
 are the only realities here.  it is the existence of mechanisms, not 
 the things themselves, that are so predictive as to be considered 
 fact (as you would say).  there aren't really little planetary particle 
 systems called atoms out there.  or i should say, and more to my original 
 point, it would be a leap of faith to say there are, because we observe only 
 the mechanisms.  there is no need to _believe_ there are _actually_
 atoms out there as we have decided to think about them.  it's enough
 to discuss the mechanisms.  at any rate, i'm not sure i am being 
 any clearer than before, but i thought it was worth a shot.
 
 the bottom line, though, is i think we agree on two fundamental ideas:
 
    1. --evolution is a theory supported by observational evidence (my way)
       --the fact of evolution is a theory supported by observational
         evidence (your way)
 
    2. --creation is just an opinion.  if a theist wants to call it
         a theory then he can.  i won't:  it has no supporting evidence 
 	and it neither predicts nor supports any observations that can
         be made.  with no mechanisms to talk about, there really isn't
 	much to say.
 
 do you agree?
