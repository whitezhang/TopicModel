 the person who was telling me about the septuagint version said that the greeks
 had a wonderful library in alexandria that was full of manuscripts/scrolls
 and that it was burned soon after the septuagint version was translated 
 (perhaps to conceal some changes in the different versions, or perhaps just
 as part of the typical burning of valuable things that occurs during changes
 in power groups, he/i dunno).
