 or, you can try not confuse a construct with the constructor.  if you take
 a look at quantum mechanics, many objective observations can be made
 as well.  however, physics is not objective.  bohr said the randomness
 of atomic motion is inherent in the motion itself.  einstein said that 
 nature is deterministic; it is our method of observation that inserts the
 randomness.  they were talking about the exact same results.
 
 depends on how you look at it, i guess.
