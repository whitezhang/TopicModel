 unless dennis's parents were excentric in their naming a girl with
 a boy's name i strongly suspect that abortion might be a medical service
 that his insurers were not counting on him requiring.
 
 
 when an insurance company attempted to set up lower rates for non smokers
 in the early 80s they got spiked by the tobacco industry. anyone know what
 the current status is on the smoking issue?
 
 
 if denis really wants to have a "fair" insurance premium i take it he would 
 be willing to have dna fingerprinting done so that the company could weed out
 all but the cast iron non risk cases?
 
 us health financing system sucks, certainly its killing a hell of a lot of
 people every year.
