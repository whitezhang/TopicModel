 /if all morality were relative- big hairy deal.
 
 as i said, you appear to be the only person saying that all morality
 is relative.  most people i know do hold some absolutes in their
 moral system.
 
 i >>personally<< believe that the dignity of the individual and the right
 of free will are absolutes.  i recognize that there are some moral
 systems around which don't accept this; i reject them as dangerous
 and anti-social (nazism, some forms of communism, fundamentalist
 xtianity--no, that's not a slam).  but for the most part, almost
 every moral system agrees on these two points.

 too bad.  i know i'm right, so i get to enforce my view upon you whether
 you like my premise or not.  and since you can't prove otherwise, there
 isn't even an intellectual basis for your resistance to accepting my
 viewpoint.

 /(though i don't think it is sufficient.)  
 
 
 well, then answer me this:   you seem to be opposed to moral relativism
 (as you call it) because it has the capacity to degenerate.  obviously,
 then, you would advocate a nonrelative (absolute) moral system.
 
 whose absolutist moral system do we choose?  
 
 how do we come to this decision?
 
 what about people who disagree with the chosen moral system?

 /rule, people might abandon it.
 
 fine.  i can agree with most of what you typed here.  however, just because
 morality gets based on something nonrelative does not mean that we have to
 pick your xtianity as its base.
 
 we can start a morality based on dignity of humans, freedom of choice,
 tolerance, etc. and never ever rely on xtianity for anything.  just because
 someone has a consistent moral system based on true principles does not
 mean that they have to involve xtianity in it.  xtianity certainly does not
 have a monopoly on principles of behavior; indeed, fewer religions are
 guiltier of violating their own principles
