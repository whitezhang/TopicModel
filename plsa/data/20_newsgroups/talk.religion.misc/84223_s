 apparently you *didn't* read the whole thing.  you continue to miss the point.

 counselling that only provides alternatives to abortion would be just as
 biased as counselling that only provides *abortion* information.  how about
 providing counselling that will give a woman help in finding what *she* is
 comfortable with.
 
 your adoption-funding idea may be a good one.  any idea if it is feasable?

 making adoption easier on the birth-mother may help reduce abortion, but
 it will *not* eliminate the need for it.  abortion is not done just because
 the mother can't care for the child and doesn't feel good about giving it
 to strangers.  abortion is done because the mother can not afford the
 *pregnancy*.

 then please justify why being "human" automatically makes something valuable.
 and why that includes the unborn.

 no, they are not guaranteed to become productive members of society.  even
 if they do that is *many years* in the future--until which they are a burden
 on someone, or society.  there is also the matter of the mother.  forcing
 her to carry a pregnancy to term at a critical time in her life could prevent
 her from being a productive member of society.

 ok, look.  it's like this.  we *are* footing the bill.  maybe they will
 take choice a.  maybe they will take choice b.  maybe they will take choice
 c.  they can't afford any *one* of them.  if they take choice a we'd have
 to pay them, say $5.  if they take choice b it would cost us $20.  if they
 take choice c it will cost us $20 now and a hell of a lot more for the next
 18 years.  which one sounds the most realistic for us to be willing to pay
 for?  now some people happen not to like choice a.  other people happen
 not to like choice c (paying for it, that is).  c has been around and paid
 for for years.  even though it means we spend a lot of money, we can't in
 conscience refuse to pay for it.  now a has been around and is perfectly
 legal, but it hasn't been funded in the past.  now a is going to be funded
 but some people object.  they don't like the idea of their tax money going
 to pay for choice a.  so we could refuse to fund a at all.  then those
 women who can't afford any of those choices will be forced to take choice
 b or c, which will cost *all of us* more money.  most of us don't see any
 reason at all why *more money* should be spent to the effect of *removing
 personal choice* from some women.  the alternative is to fund a if that is
 what the mother chooses.  we will also still fund b and even c if *that*
 is what the mother chooses.  however, some women will certainly choose a,
 and that will then save us $15 we otherwise would have had to spend.  your
 "taxes" are not being raised to fund a choice you object, they are being
 *lowered* because we will fund a choice that is *legal*, despite your
 objections to it.  (actually, your taxes are not really going to go down,
 as i'm sure you would point out.  but the amount that is saved in that
 area can help out in another--like our massive debt.)

 those other procedures you mention only cost money.  there is no savings
 in other procedures that would be required down the road without them.
 (in fact, there could be additional costs down the road *because* of them.)
 this is quite different from the case of abortion.

 this is bullshit.  we are *not* refusing "to make the alternative affordable
 too".  if we refused to pay for the more expensive choice of birth, *then*
 your statement would make sense.  but that is not the case, so it doesn't.
 if clinton tried to block funding for pre-natal care and delivery (or left
 it out of his health-care plan), i would certainly object.  i would also be
 quite surprised.

 yes, but probably not your definition of it, or for the reasons you think.

 you stupid fuck!  *we do* want to fund *all* the choices.  *you* are the

 your humble opinion is still wrong.  even with easy adoption, there is still
 the fact that pregnancy takes several months.  months in which a young woman
 could need to be getting an education.  (like finishing high school, entering
 college, finishing college, getting a job...things that are much harder to
 do if you have to "take a break" for a few months...things that have a massive
 impact on her future productivity.)

 you *can* have a conversation with the "mentally incompetant".  and even
 though *you* personally may refuse to have a conversation with "people
 you just don't like", it is still *possible* for others to have a conversation
 with them.  it is *not* possible for *anyone* to have a conversation with
 a fetus.

 he was still biologically independent.  at least to the same extent you are
 now.  he consumed nutrients and digested them in the normal manner.  he
 breathed his own air.  a fetus on the other hand, gets it's nutrients already
 digested by the mother.  it gets its oxygen from the mother as well.  that
 is not biologically independent.

 awareness is only *part* of what makes a "member of society".  it is the
 minimal conceivable requirement, yet many people seem to think that something
 without awareness could still be important enough to justify the suffereing
 of a true member of society.  i keep asking, but i still haven't seen a real
 justification for why the life of a non-sentient creature should be worth the
 suffering of a sentient being.  (i haven't read every response on the threads
 i've been asking on, yet, so we'll see if i see one later.)
