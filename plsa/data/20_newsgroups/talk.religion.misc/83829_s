 if i have a habit that i really want to break, and i am willing to
 make whatever sacrifice i need to make to break it, then i do so.
 there have been bad habits of mine that i've decided to put forth the
 effort to break, and i've done so; there have been other bad habits
 that i've decided are not worth the effort to break.  it's my choice,
 either way.
 
 i am my own master.  i choose what i want to do.  i weigh the benefits
 of my actions against their consequences, and i use my experience to
 help me deal with the unexpected, which in turn make me more experienced.
 
 i don't always succeed, but i never fail, either -- i learn.
 
 do *you* have any habits you can't break?  why not?
 
 >for one, you seem unable to master your lack of desire to understand

 i have arrived at my own understanding of christianity, just as you've
 probably arrived at your own understanding of islam that is most
 likely very different from the way a moslem thinks of his religion.
 are you "unable to master your lack of desire to understand even the
 slightest concept of the quran"?  if that's different, then how is it
 different from what you accuse me of?  can i accuse you of having no
 desire to understand even the slightest concept of atheism?

 of course not.  that's disgusting.  for centuries, religions have been
 discriminating on sex and treating women as second-class humans;
 that's one of the reasons i renounced my christianity.
 
 >do you insult

 >time opportunity presents itself?
 
 no.  i don't insult people.  period.  it's not in my nature, and it's
 not something that i want to do, either.
 
 >are you truly the master of yourself?
 
 not yet -- but my life is the ground i use to practice on.  the fun is
 in the getting there!

 we don't start out perfect; we've got to strive to be something
 better.  i know my shortcomings, and i know my strengths, and i live
 my life according to the decisions i make, and i am content to abide
 with the consequences of my decisions as easily as i'll accept the
 praise for them.  there have been times in my life when i've made
 mistakes, yes; i try to never make the same mistake twice.

 i regard christ as a myth.  i feel that there are far too many people
 offering far too many interpretations of what he supposedly said and
 did.  the only person who can really judge me is *me*.  i choose the
 roads i travel, and i decide whether or not i want to reach the end of
 any given road or turn back -- and as long as i don't *always* turn
 back, there's no shame in it.  when i need help, i seek out my friends.

 and you don't have a clue about what i'm saying, either.  open your
 eyes and see; open your ears and listen.  i'm not just spouting off
 empty words.  this is my life, this is what gives me meaning.

 huh?  you're going way off the track here.
 
 i say my mother loves me.  how do i know, you ask?  i can point to
 definite things she's done for me, and i can even just bring her to
 you so you can ask her, face-to-face.
 
 you say your deity loves you.  how do you know, i ask?  you can't even
 convince me that it exists!

 if any god dangles 'heaven' before me like a carrot, promising untold
 pleasures to me if i'll only suspend my disbelief and ignore my
 rationality for just this once, then i would choose 'hell'.  i can
 *not* lie to myself to placate another being, no matter how powerful
 it is.
 
 note also that there are several gods trying to lure me this way:
 yahweh, allah, zeus, odin, ra...  please give me a solid reason to
 choose one of them over the others.

 that paragraph demonstrates that you haven't listened to a single word
 i've said.
 
 have you ever gone to an amusement park?  why?  i mean, after a few
 hours, it closes, and nothing's different except that you're a few
 dollars lighter.  going to the amusement park doesn't do you any good
 at all.  why do you do such a meaningless thing?
 
 the answer is that you think it's fun.  you play the skee-ball over
 and over because you'd like to get better at it, even though you're
 not going to win anything better than a stuffed animal even if you
 blow ten dollars on it.  you ride the roller coaster because it's an
 thrilling experience, even though (because?) it scares the dickens out
 of you.
 
 in the same way, i think life is fun.  and i don't intend to leave the
 amusement park of life until they close down for the night!  :-d

 so you (and your holy book) say.  by the same token, therefore, santa
 claus delivers toys every xmas.  don't you see?  i have no reason to
 believe that what you say is true.  please give me some reason that i
 can't similarly apply to santa claus.

 i can't do it, because your existence means nothing more to me than
 just your communications over the net.  you have no more bearing on
 nor importance in my life than that; remove it, and you will cease to
 be significant to me.
 
 are you thereby inferring that your deity is nothing more than a
 collection of verses in a book, and cannot be supported without
 invoking them?
 
 or do you mean that the existence of your deity (and, in fact, any
 other deity that can be written about) is as real as your own
 existence?
 
 why do you believe what you believe?
