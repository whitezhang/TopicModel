 well, looking at the videos it seems that this fire started in various
 places at the same time, which would indicate that this was a planned
 action. i'm sure fbi and batf didn't *deliberately* start a possible
 fire, having a sniper kill korresh would have been a far easier 
 method. looking at the careful operation, and use of tear gas
 that as i know don't start fires, it is less likely that this 
 was the case.
 
 sorry, but my bets are on fanatical people keen to start
 armageddon -- theirs.
 
 cheers,
