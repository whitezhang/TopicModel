 i believe i've just discovered an anthopological parallel.  in my many
 "discussions" with the fundies, their main tactic is to discredit
 my sources.  they shrilly bleat:
 
      "barclay's claims are bogus; mckenzie's arguements are a sham,
 oehler position is specious, jouon's ideas are fiction, darby is a
 fraud, howard is a counterfeit, rotherham's claims are vapid."
 
 ahha...now with the branch athiests zealots we have the following:
 
      "hitching`s claims are bogus, gorman argument's are a sham,
 jastrow's position is specious, stanley's ideas are fiction, durant
 is a fraud, thorpe is a counterfeit, hoyle's claims are vapid."
 
 are we witnessing the founding of a new major religion.... or has
 it really been there all along?!
 
 
 let me try again.
 
 "the doubt that has infiltrated the previous, smugly confident certitude
 of evolutionary biology has inflamed passions.  there is lack of agreement
 even within warring camps.  sometimes it seems as if there are as many 
 variations on each evolutionary theme as there are individual biologists."

 housecleaning"; feb 1982; pg. 78.
