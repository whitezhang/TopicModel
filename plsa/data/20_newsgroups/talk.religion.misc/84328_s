 atoms are not objective.  they aren't even real.  what scientists call
 an atom is nothing more than a mathematical model that describes 
 certain physical, observable properties of our surroundings.  all
 of which is subjective.  
 
 what is objective, though, is the approach a scientist 
 takes in discussing his model and his observations.  there
 is no objective science.  but there is an objective approach
 which is subjectively selected by the scientist.  objective
 in this case means a specified, unchanging set of rules that
 he and his colleagues use to discuss their science.
 
 this is in contrast to your objective morality.  there may be an
 objective approach to subjectively discuss your beliefs on
 morality.  but there exists no objective morality.
 
 also, science deals with how we can discuss our observations of 
 the physical world around us.  in that the method of discussion
 is objective ( not the science; not the discussion itself ).
 
 science makes no claims to know the whys or even the hows sometimes
 of what we can observe.  it simply gives us a way to discuss our
 surroundings in a meaningful, consistent way.
 
 i think it was neils bohr who said (to paraphrase) science is what
 we can _say_ about the physical world.
