 no.

 no. the library at alexandria was perhaps the greatest library ever
 built in the world. the greeks had a love of wisdom, philo sophos, and
 this great love was reflected in the alexandrian library. the christians 
 got a hold of it and began modifying and purging texts and then the moslems 
 invaded and either the christians burned the library to keep it from falling 
 into moslems hands (far more likely since they were the book burners, not the 
 moslems), or it burned in the sack of the city or the moslems burned it. 
 either way, a tremendous amount of information was lost. the destruction of the
 library of alexandria was probably one of the greatest crimes of man
 against man.

 actually, the hebrew almah, (young woman), was translated as the hellenistic 
 greek parthenos which may or may not be correctly translated into the
 modern and technical english term virgin. the jews did not have the type
 of virginity cult that the greco-romans had in artemis and diana.

 the standard text used by christians and jews is the masoretic text.
 jews of course use the text in its original hebrew, without translation.

 propaganda.
