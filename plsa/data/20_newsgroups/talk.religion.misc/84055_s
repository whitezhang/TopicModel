 slight semantical difference.  the lds church does own a heck of
 a lot however.  they are the largest land holder in missouri
 (where they think christ will appear at the second coming).
 
 i believe they also own some large beverage company like pepsi
 (that was why they had to take caffiene off of their "forbidden
 substance" list).
