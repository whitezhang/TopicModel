 by "they," you mean the leaders of the lds church?  i grant you that when
 joseph smith was still alive, plenty of "accusations" were filed, most of
 which had little bearing with reality, as evidenced by various verdicts.
 i have studied lds history for 15 years now, and i have yet to see prove
 that the lds leadership was involved, in quote: "illegal activities."
 plural marriage, yes, but your charge of "underage" wives sounds like it
 could have originated from a tabloid, and discredits the high moral
 standards which characterized these leaders and families, unlike, as it
 appears, those of david koresh.
 
 #        joseph smith started the sect.  after he and his brother hyram

 and neither did he claim he was.  as the church reflects the moral
 aptitude of its leaders (and especially those of joseph smith), i have
 nothing but the highest respect for this inspired man, whose only "crime"
 was that he refused to deny that he had seen a vision...  many have tried
 to explain the "smith phenomenon" away, but the bold presence of an 8.5
 million member strong church stands as a witness that joseph smith's
 testimony had enough resilience and power to carry on the message.

 "the rest" were apostates and excommunicated members of the church,
 while the great majority of the membership, the twelve, and the various
 auxiliary organizations, chose to accept brigham young as the new
 prophet and leader of the church.  if you knew your lds scriptures and
 doctrine, you would have known that brigham young was the first in
 line to fill the prophet joseph smith's vacancy: he was the senior
 apostle in the quorum, and various comments made by joseph indicated
 that it was brigham who would lead the latter-day exodus to the west.
 
 other rightful "heirs" were either dead (hyrum smith) or excommunicated
 (oliver cowdery), and while persecutions abounded and intensified,
 joseph smith had already given orders to look for a new place, an empty
 land beyond the boundaries of the united states (at that time).  this
 "rekhabite" principle (pseudographia) was well understood and antipated
 by the great majority of lds faithful, and was not questioned by them.
 
 granted, a couple of "do-it-yourselfers" stayed behind, unwilling to
 sacrifice and to undertake the perilous journey to the unknown, but
 this also was necessary to separate the tares from the wheat.  the
 church benefitted from this purification process: they became even
 more unified and willing to carry out their mission to the world.

 #
 #        just a little context to put this all in perspective.
 
 btw, since when is the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints (one of
 the largest denominations in the country) a "sect"???  it didn't "splinter"
 from any other religion, as did say, the southern baptists or methodists.

 what a balloney.  suicide is sinful and against the law of god.  i am
 not comfortable with this alleged "cosiness" with mammon: i assure you
 that *many* among us reject this attitude categorically.  period.  our
 only true allegiance is to our god and to the leaders which he has
 appointed to represent him.  in any regard, to read this trash (about
 suicide and "atone for sins with blood") is yet another insulting
 misrepresentation of what my church believes in and stands for...

 preposterous.  even if this were true (reliable data, please), i
 am convinced that those officers would perform to the highest codes
 of honor and conduct (that's why they were selected for in the
 first place, remember?).  besides, one of our articles of faith
 strongly states the principle of freedom of religion, and that all
 people are free to worship "*how*, *where*, or *what* they may."
 
 #        if it's true, there would be little affect.  lds and rlds
 #philosophy is that all other religions have strayed from the true
 #church as set down by jesus, but that god will judge each on his
 #own merits.  in addition, the rlds also contend (and the lds may
 #as well) that ignorance of the true way (tm) is an excuse.  you
 #can only be condemned if you had been tought the way and rejected
 #it.  in short, lds and rlds suffer everybody from lutherans to
 #buddhists, secure in the knowledge that though they are wrong they
 #will not be penalized for ignorance.  it is more likely that hoover
 #liked them because of their rather strict upbringings which forbade
 #alcohol, tobacco, hot drink (like coffee or tea), and the like.
 #these people are the "salt of the earth" and as such are more
 #easily made to follow orders and have few vices to be used against them.
 
 a good explanation, i can accept that.  you are right that lds people
 are sometimes a little too cosy with mammon's "orders" (the late
 president kimball, for example, was an exception with his strong
 opposition of the selection of the mx "peace keeper" missile maze
 in utah).
 
 #        that's my somewhat educated guess, anyway.  both sects have

 #and rare, and hardly worth noting their common ancestry.
 #
 #        none of this has any relevance to guns, though.  when a
