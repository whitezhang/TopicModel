 it is true that mormons believe that all spirits (including jesus,
 lucifer, robert weiss) are in the same family.  it does not mean
 that jesus was created, but rather that lucifer and robert weiss
 were not.  i agree that this is a "heresy".  so what?  
 the sweating of blood in gethsemene is
 not a basic mormon doctrine.  jesus did not perform the atonement
 in getheseme alone, as some anti-mormons are trying to teach.  
 as far as the "unpardonable sin" whatever that is, it is biblical,
 and not specifically mormon.  it is also called the sin against
 the holy ghost.  most bible scholars (other than conservative
 ones) do not believe jehovah and elohim were always the same.
 i'm sure you've heard of the j and the e texts?  i don't
 know what you mean by "that he needed to be saved".  jesus?
 jehovah?  elohim?  in mormon doctrine, jesus was sinless,
 and thus did not "need to be saved".
