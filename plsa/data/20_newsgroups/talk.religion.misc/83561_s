 if it were'nt for the sin of men, none of this killing would have been 
 necesarry, he is kind and loving, but also righteous, 
 sin must be punished.
 
 before jesus, man had to take the sins on himself.
 but jesus died and took it all upon him, so now we also have a forgiving god.
 
 if he were not kind and loving, there wouldn't have been any people left.
