 what are the consequences of the homophobic ranting of the
 self-righteous?  well, i just noted this on another group,
 and thought i'd pass it along.  the context is talk.origins,
 and a report of yet another "debate" that was nothing but an
 attempt at mindless bullying and factless assertion by a
 standard-issue creationist.  the writer reflects that the
 behavior reported reminds him of some christian groups he has
 known.  i believe that the writer is a (non-homosexual) christian:
 
 +	there is a very effective technique used to promote
 +	unit cohesion among the soldiers of the lord.  it is
 +	called "witnessing"...  i've seen this process used well
 +	and poorly; the near devil worship i mention was a group 
 +	... that was using the witnessing to get people lathered
 +	up to go kill homosexuals or at least terrorize them off 
 +	campus as it was clearly god's will that they do so.
 
 i have deleted the specifics of the location, as i do not
 believe it characteristic of the place (a state in which i
 spent my formative first 10 years), though it *does* have,
 unfortunately, a subpopulation that this remark fits to a tee.
