 i'm for the moment interested in this notion of the 'leap of faith'
 established by kierkegaard. it clearly points out a possible solution
 to transcendental values. what i don't understand is that it also
 clearly shows the existentialism system where any leap to any
 transcendental direction is equal. 
 
 in other words i might not jump off the cliff mentioned above,
 but at the same time i will decide to what direction i will go.
 actually i will do it just now.
 
 cheers,
 kent
