 1) well, mr koresh allowed other children and adults to leave the compound
 during the course of the siege; why didnt these children leave then?
 i dont know myself, and certainly havent heard any answers on this here.
 
 2) yes, one simple non-action, ie not attacking the compound with
 modified tanks, would have prevented this tragedy. i bet you blamed
 the move people for the deaths that occurred in adjacent row
 houses in philadelphia, not the government which dropped the
 firebomb, right?
