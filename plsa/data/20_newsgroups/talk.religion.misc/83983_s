 a "moment of silence" doesn't mean much unless *everyone*
 participates.  otherwise it's not silent, now is it?
 
 non-religious reasons for having a "moment of silence" for a dead
 classmate: (1) to comfort the friends by showing respect to the
 deceased , (2) to give the classmates a moment to grieve together, (3)
 to give the friends a moment to remember their classmate *in the
 context of the school*, (4) to deal with the fact that the classmate
 is gone so that it's not disruptive later.
 
 blindly opposing everything with a flavor of religion in it is
 utterly idiotic.
