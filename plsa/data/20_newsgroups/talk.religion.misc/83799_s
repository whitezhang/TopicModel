 i addressed most of the key issues in this very long (284 lines) post
 by dean kaflowitz in two posts yesterday.  the first was made into the
 title post of a new thread, "is dean kaflowitz terminally irony-impaired?"
 and the second, more serious one appeared along the thread
 
 "a chaney post, and a challenge, reissued and revised"
 
 both only in talk.abortion, but i am posting its contents into
 talk.religion.misc as soon as i exit here.
 
 this should be enough for us to thrash out for the next week or so.  the
 second post really grapples with the main bones of contention between us.
 the first is more lighthearted and tells about such things as 
 kaflowitzdebatingpoints [tm], which he continues to rack up on both
 talk.abortion and talk.religion.misc, while setting follow-ups to 
 talk.abortion alone.  his lame excuse for the latter policy is that
 he gets a prompt as to where to set follow-ups, and does not follow
 talk.religion.misc much; this suggests that he is being hypocritical in not
 also setting his newsgroups line to talk.abortion alone.
