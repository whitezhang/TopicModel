 peter wrote a bit of the bible.  what peter says about god is what
 the bible says.   
 
 
 consider the bible a court recording.  over the period of thousands of
 years, various people come up and testify of their experience with the
 living god.  up comes abraham the wealthy rancher.  up comes moses,
 once the high official of egypt.  up comes elijah, a priest.  up comes
 david, a mere shepherd who became king.  up comes the pagan king 
 nebuchanezzar.  up comes the pagan king of persia, cyrus.  up comes
 nehemiah, cupbearer to the king of persia.  then matthew, an irs agent
 takes the stand.  up comes luke, an m.d.  then paul a jew who use
 to kill christians for fun.  up comes john, a 17 year old boy.  up
 comes peter, a fishermen.  up comes james, the brother of jesus himself.
 up comes hundreds of others.  you hear testimony from fishermen, irs
 agents, priests, kings.  the court hearing lasts thousands of years
 with people coming up and testifying about the god who calls himself
 "i am." 
 
 while you are listening to all this stuff, you realize that
 king david could have never known john, solomon could have never known
 matthew, nehemiah could have never known peter.  you realize that all these
 people are independent witnesses, and so, you rule out collaboration.  yet
 all of the witnesses tell of the same god.   each testifier tells
 of his own experiences with the living god.  each experience is
 different, but each experience has enough cross-over to unmistakenly
 reveal that each one of these people is talking about the very same god.
 what daniel did not know about god, the 3rd highest official of
 babylon, god revealed to john 600 years later--but with a different
 perspective.  no two testimonies are identical.  each testimony
 dares to venture off what is already known.  yet each witness's
 testimony, even though different from those prior, consistently
 describes harmoniously fitting facets of the character of the same god.  
 
 now.  as we stare gazing at the computer, you got this seeming fanatic
 on the other end of the net, saying, i know this god  "i am".  he has
 revealed himself to me too.  he also calls himself jesus (john 8:58).
 please believe me.  i am telling the truth.  it is wonderful to know him.
 
 are you going to just pass off all this testimony as fictiousness? 
 are you going to call three thousand years worth of testimony from
 shepherds to irs agents to royal officials to kings to computer
 programmers, fiction?  with a scoff of your keyboard, with near
 complete ignorance of the testimonies, are you going to say that
 that is all complete hooey?   would that not be the most audacious
 display of arrogance?  do you actually think you know better than
 king solomon, king david, or even abraham lincolnr?
