 not to worry.  the masons have been demonized and harrassed by almost 
 every major xian church there is.  for centuries now.  and still they 
 stand.  they wil withstand the miserable southern boobtists, i am sure.
 they may even pick up a little support as people start to listen to the 
 boobtists and realize that subtracting the obvious lies and claims of 
 satanism that the masons sound pretty good by comparison.  one thing is 
 known.  a sizable proportion of southern babtists are masons!  and the 
 masons have already fired back in their own magazines against the 
 boobtist witch-hunt.
   since the consrervatives have already been a divisive element with 
 their war on boobtist moderates and liberals, they may now start in on 
 their mason/boobtist brothers and hasten their own downfall as more and 
 more southern boobtists realize their church can't stand being run by a 
 handful of clowns looking for holy civil wars and purity tests and drop 
 'em out of the leadership positions they have taken over.
   so as far as i am concerned, the louder, ruder, and more outrageous 
 an anti-masonic crusade these old goats mount, the better.
 
 pop some pocorn and get a center row seat.  the circus is about to begin.
 and, oh look!  here come the clowns!
 
 
 pope charles    slack!
