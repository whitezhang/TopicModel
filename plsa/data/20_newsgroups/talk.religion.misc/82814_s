 mr decenso, in spite of requiring scholarly opinion on the hanging of judas,
 rejects that the scholarly opinion of the those scholars and then rephrases
 those scholars opinion on the subject:

 actually, if you do further research as to the greek word "apacgw," you will
 find that it does denote success.  those scholars did indeed have an excellent
 reason to assume that the suicide was successful.  as i pointed out, i
 recently checked several lexicons:
 
 	"greek english lexicon of the new testament," louw and nida
 	"robinson's greek and english lexicon of the new testament"
 	"greek english lexicon of the new testament," grimm
 	"word study concordance," tynsdale
 	"a greek english lexicon of the new testament and other 
 	 early christian writings," bauer-arndt-gingrich
 	"the new analytical greek lexicon," perschbacher
 
 a couple simply stated "hanged oneself", and a couple were more explicit 
 and stated that "apacgw" means specifically "kill yourself by hanging." a
 couple also noted that the meaning of one the root words for "apacgw" is
 "strangle, throttle or choke" (which pretty much invalidates the guy who
 suggested to david joslin that judas was hung upside down).  one of the best
 references though, "robinson's greek and english lexicon of the new
 testament," not only stated the translation, it gave both the root words, the
 literal translation, related greek words which use the same roots, and also
 other presented specific examples of the word in greek literature (to give
 further context).  
 
 the word "apagchw" has two root words: "gchw" is the "to strangle" root, and
 the root word "apo" means literally "away." this root words is included in
 words which denote a transition.  it can mean a transition in place (eg: the
 greek word "apagello" means to send a message).  "apo" can also denote a
 change in state and specifically the change from life to death.  robinson
 specifically makes comparison to the word "apokteiuo," which means "to kill."
 in literal meaning the word "apacgw" means "to throttle, strangle to put out
 of the way," and implicitly denotes a change in life state (ie: away from
 life, to death).  so while the word "apacgw" does mean "to hang," it
 specifically denotes a death as well.  thus robinson is quite specific when he
 state that it means "to hang oneself, to end one's life by hanging." he then
 notes the the use of "apacgw" in homers odessy 19:230 to denote context.  he
 presents that example of "apacgw" as being used to explicitly mean "suicide by
 hanging." now since there is a perfectly good word for strangling, without the
 added denotation of "death," and as you insist that the bible was written by
 god, and every word is precicely correct, you are stuck with the complete
 meaning of "apacgw" (ie: since the word "apacgw" was used, then death is
 denoted as the result). 
 
 by the way, i note that mr decenso also presents an example of "apacgw":

 note mr decenso, as you say, the septuagint was a translation from hebrew to
 greek, and you have not shown the original meaning of the hebrew (ie" the the
 hebrew say "and died"), and thus whether it was simply echoed in the greek. 
 it should also be pointed out that, regardless of the added "and died", the
 correct translation would still be "apacgw," as the man did indeed die from
 strangulation (redundant, but correct).  further, we have evidence that the
 septuagint was repeatedly rewritten and reedited (which included versions
 which contradicted each other), and such editing was not even necessarily
 executed by greeks.  thus i am not sure that you can use the septuagint as it
 now stands, as a paragon of ancient greek.  so, what you really need to prove
 your point mr decenso, is an example, in ancient greek, of someone committing
 "apacgw" and surviving.  otherwise i would see you as simply making worthless
 assertions without corresponding evidence. 
 
 now i would note mr decenso, that everytime i go out of my way to research it
 one of your apparently contrived exegisis, i pretty much find it false.  thus,
 i think that if you are going to add to the text, something over and above
 what the source clearly says, then you had better have an explicit greek or
 historical source to justify it. 
 
 by the way, as to mr rose's statement about trees around the potter's field:
 
 > there are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom.
 
 unless mr rose can show that these trees are two thousand years old, or that
 there are 2000 year old stumps there, or has a 2 thousand year old description
 of the area which mentions such trees, then it is inappropriate for him to
 assert that the present placement of trees prove the location of the trees two
 thousand years ago (after all, things change). 
 
 now as to your other argument, ie: that the money judas used is not the same
 as the 30 silvers:

 >          ^^^^^^
 
 true, peter (or the author of acts) does not specifically call judas' betrayal
 "an iniquity," but for that matter, neither does john specifically call judas'
 actions "an iniquity" either.  further john 13:29 did not say that judas took
 the money box, but rather said:
 
     "some thought that because, judas had the money box, jesus was telling
      him "buy what we need for the feast"; or that he should give something
      to the poor, so after receiving the morsel he immediately went out, and
      it was night."
 
 note that it is said that judas left, it does not say that he took the money
 box.  thus when i see your explanation it still seems to me you would choose
 the a an unproven iniquity, mentioned by another author, in a different
 book, written at a different time, over the iniquity explicitly mentioned by
 the author of acts.  i find this forced and contrived. 
 
 of course this particular argument becomes moot, since we have have seen
 evidence that "apacgw" means suicide.  you see, since judas' hanging was
 successful, he could not have spent the money mentioned in john 13:29, because
 matthew and mark explicitly say the betrayal was on the high holy day (ie:
 passover), and thus he could not have spent the money before killing himself
 the next day.  thus the money which bought the "field of blood" would have to
 have been the 30 pieces of silver (of course he got the 30 pieces of silver
 that night as well, and thus couldn't have spent that either.  oh dear, i
 believe that the house of cards is comming down). 
 
 maybe we should at this point, discuss now whether jesus was crucified on
 friday or saturday as that is now part of the argument about judas.
 
 by the way, as to where the prophesy of the potter's field came from (ie: the
 mention of it in matthew), you say:
 
 > please, when we are done with this study on his death, remind me to discuss
 > this with you.
 
 i am reminding you now to discuss it now. it's all part of the same verse we
 are discussing, and i wish you would quit procrastinating and sidestepping 
 these issues.

     ps. i would note again, that you are not stating that that bible
     is not possibly inerrant; you are stating that it *is* inerrant.
     since you have been, by your own admission, presenting merely "possible"
     reconciliations (i of course don't rate them that highly), then the 
     best you can do is say that the bible is "possibly" inerrant, not that 
     it *is* inerrant.
