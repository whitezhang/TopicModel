 i am looking for experiences people have had with mormons and your
 views of mormonism because of these experiences.
 
 i would appreciate only experiences that have happened to you...not
 friend of a friend stuff.  also, i would like to hear good 
 experiences you might have had with mormons.  i am doing this
 in the interest of spreading tolerance, so please, no flames.
 
 e-mail would be preferred because of the short time for this.
 
 thanks,
