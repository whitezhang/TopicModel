 so instead you are asking individual citizens to place themselves at risk
 by assuming that everyone who claims to be a cop, actually is a cop.
 around here the police have actually made public service announcements saying
 that if you are a lady driving by yourself at night and you see blue lights
 flashing behind you. do not pull over until you reach a well lit, preferably
 occupied place, gas station etc.

 it wouldn't be murder, it would be self defense.
