 a lot of people won't agree with me.  that's their right and i respect that.
 however, to the point, jews are also covered by the saving grace of jesus
 christ.  there are jews who have become christians.
 
 this brings up another question i still have to ponder:  why is there so 
 much anti-semitism?  why do people hate jews?  i don't hate jews.  i consider
 them to be like anyone else, sinners we all are.
