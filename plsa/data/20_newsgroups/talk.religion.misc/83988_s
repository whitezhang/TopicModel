 not that einstein "proved" anything, but you can't answer it, and your 
 answer be in general true.  and even that statement assumes an
 objective reality independent of our beliefs about it.

 s/an objective reality for values/some values are real even in the face
 of disagreement/
 
 if you are saying that some moral systems are better than others, in
 your opinion, then all you get is infinite regress.  what you do not get
 is any justification for saying that the moral system of the terrorist
 is inferior to that of the man of peace.  your saying it does not
 make it so,  and that's according to your premise, not mine.
