 well, there is a fair amount of evidence floating around that indicates
 that oto has been around since at least the late 1800s, long before
 crowley ever heard of it, how long has amorc been around? (yes, i know
 that they claim to have existed as an organization clear into prehistory,
 but i doubt that they have any organizational paperwork
 as a non-profit that can be carbon-dated to 20,000 bc)
