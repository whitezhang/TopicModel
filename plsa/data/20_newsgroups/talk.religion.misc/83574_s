 i believe that the idea of objective morality is absurd, becasuse all
 the evidence i've seen indicates that morality and moral systems are
 man made and thus subjective.
 
 this is not a shot at christianity; i would apply it to any other person
 or group that advocates objective morality, unless said person/group
 can provide some sort of evidence to support that claim.
 
 actually, christians do claim an absolute morality, but that is another
 matter.
