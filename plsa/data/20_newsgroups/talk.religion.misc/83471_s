 you keep saying that. i do not think it means what you think it
 means.
 perhaps you should explain what you think "science has it's basis
 in values" means. the reason why people do science is that
 they value it's results. that does not mean that science has
 it's basis in values. any more than des stops working if i stop
 valuing my privacy.
