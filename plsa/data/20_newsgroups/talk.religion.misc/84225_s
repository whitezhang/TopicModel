 that's right.  everyone.  even infants who cannot speak as yet.  even
 a little child will rebelliously stick his finger in a light socket.
 even a little child will not want his diaper changed.  even a little
 child will fight nap-time.
 
 so far as jesus saying "everyone":  
 
     a certain ruler asked jesus, "good teacher, what must i do to
     inherit eternal life?"
 
     "why do you call me good?"  jesus answered.  "no one is good--
     except god alone."
 
 ken, the book of romans states that we are born sinners.  we do
 not grow into being a sinner.  we sin because we are sinners.  the
 common mistake, even in christian circles, is to think the reverse
 true.    so for as surely as you grew to look like you parents,
 you not only inherited their appearance, but also their sin nature.
 it goes with being human.
  
 even though a new-born is innocent as can be, his sinful nature
 will surely manifest itself more explicity as he gets older.  for
 as surely as he grows hair on his head and teeth within his mouth,
 he will show the signs of his innate sin by rebelling
 against mommy and daddy with that loud proclamation "no."
