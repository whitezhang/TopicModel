 superficially a good answer, but it isn't that simple.  an awful lot of the
 starvation and poverty in the world is directly caused by the economic
 policies of the western countries, as well as by the diet of the typical
 westerner.  for instance, some third-world countries with terrible
 malnutrition problems export all the soya they can produce -- so that it can
 be fed to cattle in the us, to make tender juicy steaks and burgers.  they
 have to do this to get money to pay the interest on the crippling bank loans
 we encouraged them to take out.  fund-raising for ethiopia is a truly bizarre
 idea; instead, we ought to stop bleeding them for every penny they've got.
 
 perhaps it's more accurate to say that there's a western ethic against
 western infanticide.  all the evidence suggests that so long as the children
 are dying in the third world, we couldn't give a shit.  and that goes for the
 supposed "pro-life" movement, too.  they could save far more lives by
 fighting against third world debt than they will by fighting against
 abortion.  hell, if they're only interested in fetuses, they could save more
 of those by fighting for human rights in china.
 
 and besides, suzanne's answer implies that non-western countries lack this
 ethic against infanticide.  apart from china, with its policy of mandatory
 forced abortion in tibet, i don't believe this to be the case.
