 er, i'm afraid not.  the cambridge time retardation effect unfortunately
 spreads out as far as the physics labs, and certainly as of 1987 the old
 definition was still in use when teaching students...

 well, yes, but almost any description of physics in plain english will
 misrepresent it to some degree.

 except that momentum is no longer taught in gcse physics, because it was felt
 to be too difficult...

 yeah, and i was claiming that speed causes disappointment, too. 
 
 thinking about it, a much more interesting distortion would probably be the
 visual effect of having the universe seemingly compress itself into the front
 of your field of view and frequency shift all over the place, which i seem to
 remember is what happens at those speeds...  at least you'd see it, unlike
 the curvature of spacetime.  what the hell is this doing in talk.abortion?
