 i would like to add my support for a misc.taoism discussion group.
 i applaud the enthusiam shown by the person posting <79899@cup.portal.com> 
 "thyagi@cup.portal.com" (i read in alt.magick), but i differ
 with him/her in believing that at least some minimal parameters 
 should be agreed upon.

 but if we don't limit it to *something*, the discussion degenerates into
 a big amorphous glob. 
 
 other questions thyagi proposes are:
 
 > 1) what is this 'actual process of reality'?
 > 2) why is taoism based upon an assumption?
 > 3) why does this assumption concern knowledge and what can be known?
 > 4) what is the value of not knowing?

 it seems to me that these questions more properly fall into the
 category of "general metaphysics". i would prefer any misc.taoism
 to deal more closely with topics and works more closely associated
 with at least "semi-orthodox" taoism: with established classic works 
 definitely included and works like mantak chia's argued about! 
 
 i think "neo-taoism" should be excluded or get its own group (what i
 mean by this is "humpty-dumpty taoism", in which taoism means whatever 
 a poster says it means.) this "alt.taoism" could also be a refuge 
 for debates about what "taoism *really* means" or speculations on sexual
 alchemy, etc..
 
 e.g. (from thyagi again):
 > taoism does what the hell it wants, i tell you.
 > taoism doesn't exist.  'taoism' is no more real that 'tao'.  decide, now.
 > real or not real?  exist or not-exist?  when shall we be certain
 
 kent gloomily predicts (quoting from thyagi's article):

 i think that discussions of this nature are not completely out of
 place. what's happening is that that the term "taoism" is becoming
 completely polluted and trivialized like the words "magic", "alchemy", 
 "zen," etc., by writers appropriating the word to mean whatever they 
 want. this is seen by the spate of new age books entitled "the
 tao of" this, that, and everything else. (with respect to some exceptions
 like the books by jou, tsung-hwa.)
 
 any other comments/ideas? i look forward to seeing them. on balance,
 i say let misc.taoism rip and let the chips fall where they may. if
 it just gets filled up with college freshmen asking about the
 tao of sex then it will have been a failure and people will post to
 these groups just as they do now.
