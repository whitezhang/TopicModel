 and maybe they do.  but without somebody to set the time that doesn't
 do them any good.

 humph.  deleted there was my list of non-religious reasons one might
 want a moment of silence for a dead classmate.
 
 maybe everyone doesn't want to be silent for teachers to give their
 pompous non-religious speeches in assembly.  i know i didn't.  so?

 please provide documentation that opposing only things that are
 actively religious (e.g. actual prayer, "amen" after a moment of
 silence, mandatory classes in religion) and not things that have
 possible but uncertain religious implications (e.g. moments of
 silence, having the bible on the shelves during reading period) is not
 a way to prevent a state religion.
