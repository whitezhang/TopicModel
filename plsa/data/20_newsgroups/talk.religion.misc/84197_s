 	could he?  and the first three that died, when guns ablazing in came
 	the batf and fbi?
 
 	i imagine i would have some trouble giving up my children to
 	someone who had just shot -- what -- two of them?
 
 	nb:  it takes two sets of guns in a situation like this.

 	fanatical:  those whowill not tolerate another's way of life
 	religious:  based on emotional, internal, or otherwise
 		lacking in commonly defined _scientific_ basis,
 		including legal ones, such as this old saw:
 
 			innocent untilproven guilty
 
 		not
 			innocent until presumed guilty
 
 	who is the fanatic?  note who is dead; this usually bespeaks
 	a fair bit for the idea that the other side also had lethal
 	weapons, used fatally.
 
 		they are dead:  the children.
 			at best koresh was an asshole and the government
 			criminally negligent in its hadni\ling of the case.
 
 			at worst, koresh and his followers were

 				not brainwashed
 				guilty of illegal arms possession
 					(as yet unproven)
 				and murderedd

 >children out from the war zone. i'm not ashamed of this statement.
 
 	who created the war zone?  you should be ashamed of bypassing that.
 	it's the same damned (literally) comment made by the folks in
 	the former yugoslavia to justify ethnic cleansing:
 
 		"gee, they had the guns, all they had to do was surrender".
 
 >
 >to justify other means does not eliminate the fact that children
 >died for a cause that they should not have been part of. 
 
 	whose "cause" did they die for?  the one where they lived,
 	peacibly, to all known purposes (until proven in court,
 	folks!), or the cuase of righteous government safeguarding 
 	the freedom of the children
 
 		who are now dead.
 
 
 	againi say:
 
 		i do not know who did what
 		i was not there.
 		the fbi leaders show moral sickness trying to
 			convict in the press ahead of schedule
 		and you should look over your shoulder,
 
 		becuase if there is anything my ruminations that
 		actually  sets onto real fact of what happened
 
 			and i do not know that; i am defending
 			people who ahving been burned to death cannot
 			speak for themselves
 
 		you may, in 22-5 years, find that the concept in our
 		court system  has gone from
 
 			due processss
 
 		to
 
 			due profit
 
 		and the batf come to collect their fair share of the tax
 		on the value of your house if you rented it for income
 
 			which is going down now, folks.
 			read bankruptcy 1995
 				its accurate in figures
 				and it bypasses the greedy
 					businessman and
 					mankers who have
 				taken profit from the corruption
 				of our govbernment.
 
 			look to where the money went, folks.
 
 			you  got $10 for medicare that paid a doctor for
 			$00.50 worth of medicine.
 
 				this is the customaryprofitmargin
 				to businessmen for goernment entitlements.
 
 	who wll own the land of the cult now?  note well:  it was nonproift,
 	religious, and nontaxable.  large tract of land .... hmmm.
 
 	use your brains, folks:  it happened germany, and it can happen
 	here.
 			4.3 trillion (admitted) and counting....
