 the idea of an apostacy did not originate with lucy smith or joseph
 smith or the mormons.  the idea of a restoration was quite common
 in the early 19th century usa.  alexander campbell, founder of the
 group that now survives with the name "disciples of christ" preached
 that the primitive church had been lost and was attempting to restore
 it (although not be revelations).  many cambellites subsequently became
 mormons, including co-founder sidney rigdon.  actually, you can find
 such sentiments in many of the early protestants of the reformation,
 such as martin luther.
