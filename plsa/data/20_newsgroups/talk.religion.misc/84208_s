 can a theist be truly objective?  can he be impartial
      when questioning the truth of his scriptures, or
      will he assume the superstition of his parents
      when questioning? 
 
 i've often found it to be the case that the theist
      will stick to some kind of superstition when
      wondering about god and his scriptures.  i've
      seen it in the christian, the jew, the muslim,
      and the other theists alike.  all assume that
      their mothers and fathers were right in the
      aspect that a god exists, and with that belief
      search for their god.
      
 occasionally, the theist may switch religions or
      aspects of the same religion, but overall the
      majority keep to the belief that some "creator"
      was behind the universe's existence.  i've
      known muslims who were once christians and vice
      versa, i've known christians who were once
      jewish and vice versa, and i've even known
      christians who become hindu.  yet, throughout
      their transition from one faith to another,
      they've kept this belief in some form of higher
      "being."  why?
      
 it usually all has to do with how the child is
      brought up.  from the time he is born, the
      theist is brought up with the notion of the
      "truth" of some kind of scripture-- the bible,
      the torah, the qur'an, & etc.  he is told
      of this wondrous god who wrote (or inspired)
      the scripture, of the prophets talked about in
      the scripture, of the miracles performed, & etc.
      he is also told that to question this (as
      children are apt to do) is a sin, a crime
      against god, and to lose belief in the scrip-
      ture's truth is to damn one's soul to hell.
      thus, by the time he is able to read the
      scripture for himself, the belief in its "truth"
      is so ingrained in his mind it all seems a
      matter of course.
      
 but it doesn't stop there.  once the child is able
      to read for himself, there is an endeavor to
      inculcate the child the "right" readings of
      scripture, to concentrate more on the pleasant
      readings, to gloss over the worse ones, and to
      explain away the unexplainable with "mystery."
      circular arguments, "self-evdent" facts and
      "truths," unreasoning belief, and fear of
      hell is the meat of religion the child must eat
      of every day.  to doubt, of course, means wrath
      of some sort, and the child must learn to put
      away his brain when the matter concerns god.
      all of this has some considerable effect on the
      child, so that when he becomes an adult, the 
      superstitions he's been taught are nearly
      impossible to remove.
      
 all of this leads me to ask whether the theist can
      truly be objective when questioning god, hell,
      heaven, the angels, souls, and all of the rest.
      can he, for a moment, put aside this notion that
      god *does* exist and look at everything from
      a unbiased point of view?  obviously, most
      theists can somewhat, especially when presented
      with "mythical gods" (homeric, roman, egyptian,
      & etc.).  but can they put aside the assumption
      of god's existence and question it impartially?
