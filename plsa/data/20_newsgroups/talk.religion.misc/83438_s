 mr. meritt, please state explicitly the inductive argument which leads
 you to conclude mr. tice thinks it "ok" to take biblical quotes out of
 context in some other t.r.m. articles.
 
 also, please explain why you rely on inductive reasoning (with its
 implicit uncertainty) in determining mr. tice's opinions when the man
 is himself clearly available for questioning.

 following statement:
 
    the word "agree" and the phrase "not disagree" are identical in
    meaning.
