   what i was referring to was not fraud look-alike companies, but ones that
 made cheap 'gm' etc parts for restoring cars.  they were sold as non-name
 brand parts, but had all of the 'look', so your car would be restored to true
 gm, and not brand xyz.  as you pointed out, they're a lot cheaper, so the
 not as die-hard restorer can afford them too.  this is all from what i've
 read in automotive magazines over the last few years, and apparently the car
 companies turned a sympathetic eye, because they didn't make the parts anymore.

  no, but is tell me whether or not the following scenario is realistic:
 1) el-cheapo companies make and sell 'gm' parts as gm originals.
 2) gm gets annoyed, and lobbies for a bill to stop anyone from labelling
  parts as name brand unless they actually are.., or pushes for heavier
 enforcement of current fraud laws.
 3) zealous officers raid the previously mentioned small companies, mostly
 because they didn't have a specific licensing agreement to make the parts
 that gm no longer makes.
 
   pow! instant oppression.  who cares about the _intent_ of the law.  it's
 the letter that everyone ends up following.
 
 >there is a hell of a difference between remanufacturing and passing off.
 
   perhaps they _were_ remanufacturing parts.. but then the parts would not
 really be exactly name-brand.

  i can't say i agree with you more.  perhaps i misphrased myself in my previous
 post, or you misread what i was trying to say.

   ??? i don't ever remember saying something like that.  i may or may not
 agree with what the various bureaus did, but in the end it was the bd's choice
 to blow themselves up, and that can never be blamed on over-zealous law
 enforcement.
