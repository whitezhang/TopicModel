 if you were able to prove that morality is objective, then it would
 be correct to do so. the problem is, by the very meaning of the
 words in question, to do so is oxymoronic. of course you could
 redefine the words, but that would still not lend support to the
 underlying concept.

 this does not parse. how could you hardly be wrong without dragging
 in the o-word?

 i have no problem with objectivity at all. it is my objectivity that
 has led me to conclude that morality is subjective.
