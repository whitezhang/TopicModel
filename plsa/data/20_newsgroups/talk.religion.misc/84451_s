 jeremiah:
 25:27 therefore thou shalt say unto them, thus saith the lord of
 hosts, the god of israel; drink ye, and be drunken, and spue, and
 fall, and rise no more, because of the sword which i will send among
 you.
 25:28 and it shall be, if they refuse to take the cup at thine hand to
 drink, then shalt thou say unto them, thus saith the lord of hosts; ye
 shall certainly drink.
