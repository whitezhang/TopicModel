 	it isn't so much a matter of 'interpretation' of bible texts 
 that sets mormonism apart from orthodoxy as it is a matter of 
 *fabrication*.
 
 	about 20 years ago, _national lampoon_ had some comic strips 
 in them that were drawn by neal adams. they were called "son o' god" comics. 
 it was a parody of the jesus in the bible. in the comic, there were a 
 group of thirteen jewish kids from brooklyn, and when one of them said 
 the magic word, he turned into "son o' god." he went from a myopic, 
 curly headed, yarmulke wearing boy to a replica of the stylizied 
 portraits of jesus --- with long flowing brown hair and gentile 
 features.	
 
 	now, if someone were to profess faith in this natlamp jesus, 
 and claim that they were a christian because they believed in this 
 natlamp jesus, we would have to say that this was fallacious since 
 this jesus was a fabrication, and did not really exist.
 
 	this is the exact same thing that the lds do when they claim 
 that they are christian. they profess faith in jesus, but the jesus 
 that they profess to have faith in is as much a fabrication as the 
 natlamp jesus was.
