    so rick, why not read the bible for yourself?  it is written in plain
    english.  decide for yourself.   
 
 it?  that would imply the singular, yet there are many _translations_
 of the bible, many of which differ in choice of wording and hence can
 lead to different _interpretations_.  btw have you also read the
 koran, vedas ... etc., plain english translations are available.
 decide for yourself.
