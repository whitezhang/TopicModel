 
 someone posted a list of x number of alleged bible contradictions.  as joslin
 said, most people do value quantity over quality.  dave butler posted some good
 quality alleged contradictions that are taking a long time to properly exegete.
 
 if you want a good list (quantity) - _when critics ask, a popular handbook on
 bible difficulties_ by dr. norman geisler deals with over 800 alleged contradictions.
