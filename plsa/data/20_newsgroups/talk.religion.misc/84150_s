 how do you know? were you there?
 
 while obviously koresh was a nut case, the (typical) inability of the
 government/media to get its story straight is quite disturbing. on
 tuesday night, nbc news reported that the fbi did not know the place
 was burning down until they saw black smoke billowing from the
 building. the next day, fbi agents were insisting that they saw davidians
 setting the fire. the fbi was also adamantly denying that it was possible
 their battery of the compound's wallks could have accidentally set the
 blaze, while also saying they hadnt been able to do much investigating
 of the site because it was still too hot. so how did they know they
 didnt accidentally set the fire.
 
 sounds like the fbi just burned the place to the ground to destroy
 evidence to me.
