 oh, yeah?  well---*i* know of ....
 
 anyways, cannibalism is much more commmon than those who feel that it is wrong
 (and then point out that the fact that western civilisation doesn't do it is
 proof positive that we are more advanced) would have us believe.  cannibalism
 is often used in funeral ceremonies as a way of keeping the deceased loved one
 alive.  many other cultures (including many american indian cultures) eat/ate
 the flesh of slain enemies, often as a way of showing respect for the valor of
 the departed.  hearts are often favored for this, as it contains the spirit.
 
 have you ever read or seen "alive", which is the story of the argentinian boys
 soccer team that crashed in the andes and then ate the bodies of those who died
 in order to survive?  finger lickin good.  how about the twighlight zone
 episode "to serve man"?
 
 if you want more info on this, a good place to start is on sci.anthropology
 
 now send me $20 and eat my flesh,
