 that's not "showing the signs of his innate sin", that's testing the
 limits of his newfound independence.  a two-year-old will continually
 test you to see just how much he can get away with, just as a pet dog
 will.
 
 if a child always submitted to your will in a docile fashion, would
 you praise him and suspect that he's the second coming of christ, or
 would you seek professional help about his emotional development?
