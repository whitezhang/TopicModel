 suppose x-ist saucers land.  the aliens destroy all paper currency and tattoo
 "666" on people's foreheads and start sacrificing small children.  then a
 bunch of other aliens come along and offer to get rid of the x-ists in return
 for one dollar.  the people happen to have a single dollar bill hidden during
 the purge.
 
 get the point?  none of these events are *inherently* impossible.  so it is
 not the case that the value of a dollar bill is fixed by reality.
 
 for a more mundane example of how the value of a dollar bill is not constant,
 consider the following game thought up by the rand corporation:
 
 you are with a bunch of friends.  you have a $10 bill.  you offer to sell the
 $10 bill to the highest bidder -- subject to the restriction that you also
 get to take the money bid by the second-highest bidder.
 
 try it.  you'll find that sometimes people will end up bidding more than $10
 for your $10 bill.
