 actually if mr x had something to gain by his claims his
 account of the events would nmot be the most respected. case
 and point, the resurrection. by claiming that the resurrection
 actually happened the early preachers were able to convert many
 to christianity. however, if you read mathew 27:38 (?) and the
 case for the resurrected saints who walked around jerusalem and
 appeared to "many people" you would realize that other
 historians (josephus for one) would have reported on it all if
 it happened. the fact that the bible speaks of events of such
 great magnitude that they would have been noticed taken with
 the fact that they are not reported on by historians could only
 mean that the bible contains many made up stories.
