 
 mr. clinton said today that the horrible tragedy of the waco fiasco
 should remind those who join cults of the dangers of doing so.
 now, i began scratching my head thinking (a bad sign :-), "don't the 
 mainstream religions (in this case christianity...or the 7th day 
 adventist in particular) just keep these guys going ? isn't mr. clinton 
 condemning his own religion ? after all, isn't it a cult too ?"
 
 ... bad thoughts these.
