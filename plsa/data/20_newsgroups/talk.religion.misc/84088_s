 	some wept as they heard elie wiesel describe a jewish woman
 	somewhere in the carpathian mountains, who read a short
 	newspaper article about the warsaw ghetto uprising.  "she
 	wondered aloud: 'why are our jews in warsaw behaving like
 	this?  why are they fighting?  couldn't they have waited
 	quietly until the end of the war?'
 
 	"treblinka, ponar, belzec, chelmno, birkenau; she had never
 	heard of these places.  one year later, together with her
 	entire family she was in a cattle-car traveling to the black
 	hole of history named auschwitz."  at the end of his speech,
 	the writer said, "she was my mother."

 is anyone else impressed with the short count of the bodies found in
 waco?  have the rest been assumed bodily into heaven?
