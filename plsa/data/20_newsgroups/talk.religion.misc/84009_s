 some of these "cults", which seems like a rather dismissive term
 to me, are pretty big here in the usa.  most of them
 are quite respectable & neiborly & do not resemble branch davidians
 in the least; confusing them is a mistake.  what about "live &
 let live", folks?  i'm sure we can uncover a few extremist loonies
 who are catholic -- the anti-abortion movement in the usa seems to have a
 few hard cases in it, for example.

 i have to agree matthew with this; i have certainly encountered a lot
 of anti-catholic-religion propaganda & emotion (& some bigotry) from
 members of certain religious groups here.  they also practice their
 missionary work with zeal among catholics in the united states, but to
 someone who is or was raised catholic such rhetoric is pretty
 off-putting.  it may work better in an environment where there's a lot
 of popular anti-clericalism.
 
 follow-ups set elsewhere, this no longer seems very relevant to celtic issues
 to me.
