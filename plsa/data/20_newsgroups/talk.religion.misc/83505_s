 the trouble with trying to find out the truth is that roehm and his
 buddies were accused of being flaming faggots, one of the pretexts for the
 night of long knives in which roehm and most of the sa wing of the nsdap
 were purged.  since the accusers thereafter controlled the records,
 anything bearing on the subject -- true or not -- has to be considered
 tainted evidence.  the available data suggest that roehm and his crowd,
 the sa -- sturmabteilung, "storm troopers" -- left the world a better
 place when they departed, but concrete particulars are still no more than
 more or less shrewd guesses.
