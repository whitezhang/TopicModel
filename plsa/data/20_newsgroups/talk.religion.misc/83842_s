 well, if they were satanists, or followers of an obscure religion,
 then i would be sure that christians would in unison condemn and 
 make this to a show case. but when we are dealing with a fanatical
 revelation preacher that kills ultimately everyone, including the
 innocent children, then it seems that we are dealing with christians 
 and christians (note the spelling).
