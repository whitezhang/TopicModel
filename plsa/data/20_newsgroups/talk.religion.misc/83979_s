 brian, have you checked out what your priests told you in the
 bible to see whether they were telling you the truth?  did you know
 that according to the bible, there shouldn't even be such things as
 "priests" anymore?  do you know why the preisthood was established in
 the old testament to begin with and the reasons why after jesus,
 there were no priests--that is until the roman catholic church 
 300 years later devised the doctrine of transubstantiation by ignoring
 the whole concept beyond the book of hebrews?
 
 you said you analyzed the bible very closely.  i think you are
 lying.  for if you had, i would think you would have at least
 got the doctrine of hell straight.
 
 so what is your beef against jesus?  be specific and point on
 verses.
