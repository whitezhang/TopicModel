 i've asked your god several times with all my heart to come to me.  i
 really wish i could believe in him, 'cos no matter how much confidence
 i build up on my own, the universe *is* a big place, and it would be
 so nice to know i have someone watching over me in it...
 
 i've gone into this with an open mind.  i've layed my beliefs aside
 from time to time when i've had doubt, and i've prayed to see what
 good that would do.  i don't see what more i can do to open myself to
 your god, short of just deciding to believe for no good reason.  and
 if i decide to believe for no good reason, why not believe in some
 other god?  zeus seems like a pretty cool candidate...
 
 all i know is that in all my searching, even though i've set aside my
 pride and decided that i want to know the truth no matter how
 difficult it may be to accept, i have never had any encounter with any
 deity, christian or otherwise.
 
 please tell me what more i can do while still remaining true to myself.
