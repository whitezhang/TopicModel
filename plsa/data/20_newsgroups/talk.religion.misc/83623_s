 i regard love as no more or less "benign" than any other christian does.
 you are merely expressing "approval" of the consequences i find therein.
 which says more about our politics and cultural trappings than about my
 (or any) religion.  "love" is a highly ambiguous word, of which christians
 can write both the "gentle" words paul uses of it in 1 corinthians -- in
 a passage that even the "conservatives" will quote at you :-) -- and the
 words of t. s. eliot in his pentacost hymn, "love is the unfamiliar name
 that wove the intolerable shirt of flame ..."
 
 this is in any case rather to the side of what i was attempting to raise
 in my note, as will become more evident below.
 
 >as a non-believer, i find michael's christianity kinder and gentler.
 
 blechhh.  i think you are misreading me, rather seriously.  though,
 given my principle that one cannot force one's own notion of "sin" on
 another, and my unshakeable "disestablishmentarianism", russel turpin
 and others (believers and unbelievers alike) are under no threat of my
 legislating my own understanding of christian love.
 
 >if i take him at
 >his word, he cannot condemn the inquisitors, because they were

 you misread.  i can do (and have repeatedly done) a complete bill of
 accusation against the inquisition by exhibiting in as thorough a form
 as anyone might want a demonstration of the harm it has done to human
 beings (in the first place) and to respect for (let alone love of) "god"
 in near succession.  please go back to my quoted words above:
 
 the "possibility that always exists" is that i (or, to revert to proper
 time sequence, my predecessors over the last several centuries) could
 persuade "christian b" of my case that the inquisition *does* indeed
 constitute an egregious violation of the law of love.  i must also note
 that the majority of christians have been so persuaded.  by christian
 argumentation, as well as by secular [both christian and non-christian]
 prohibitions.
 
 what mr. turpin alludes to is a trickier point:
 
 	a.  i demonstrate the human pain and violation of love involved
 	    in the inquisition.
 
 	b.  the inquisitor responds that mother church must, however
 	    painful this *seems*, "discipline" her children for their
 	    own good -- in this case the salvation of their souls (or
 	    if the tortured heretic will not recant, than by bad example
 	    "deterring" others from the same loss-of-soul.)
 
 	a.  i point out that this "justification" of a failure in love
 	    depends on a highly speculative construal of texts and of
 	    philosophical assertions that are quite undemonstrable.
 
 	b.  burns me at the stake.
 
 my rhetoric has failed, but the point i am making is sustained.  what is
 going on here has a *lot* to do with "cultural baggage."  in this case,
 the baggage includes a (nearly universal, and absolutely secular) belief
 that an accused person must prove innocence and that testimony is most
 believable if taken under torture.  the elimination of inqisitorial
 practice (in those places where it *has* been eliminated, or at least
 greatly reduced) has very little, if anything, to do with the discussion
 of sin in the exchange between a and b.
 
 mr. turpin is pointing out that, if i am a versus the grand inquisitor's b,
 then my persuasion is not very likely to work.  i know this; and in what-
 ever personal agony, i consign the issue to god and my ghostly defense
 attorney.  so, "one possibility" fails in this case -- as it will fail in
 may others.  at the other extreme, the "persuasion" will succeed when it
 properly should not, if it entails mistaken assumptions i share with the
 inquisitor.  and that is potentially an even more troubling case, in that
 many of the victims of inquisition will have "accepted" that they were in
 fact sinful (in such random cases as they may actually have been guilty
 of charges brought against them.)
 
 the point is that the "persuasion" breaks down when the parties do not
 share enough to agree on all the cultural baggage -- and given the main
 thrust of the inquisition, against "heresy", it is *bound* to break down
 in precisely the "worst" cases.  the "conservative" (i don't think that
 is the right word, btw) will take refuge in what i attribute to b above,
 that he is "justified" in causing harm because he *thinks* that works to
 a "greater good."  but this is a violent and extravagant refusal to follow
 the gospel, as if one's theories about "sin" entitled one to cast aside
 jesus' words on dealing with sinners (cf. matthew 5:39ff).
 
 i am a "radical" christian *only* in that i take the gospel seriously.
 
 >(or, for that matter, what does it mean to love one's fellow
 >man?) and what is the "right thing"?  and how does one go about
 >loving god? 
 
 well, the whole *point* of making these the "base" commandments is that
 they *aren't* reducible to rules.  a set of rules is a moral code or a
 law code or an algorithm for acting.  such things can be very helpful
 to individuals or societies -- but not if they are used *instead* of a
 personal involvement in and responsibility for one's actions.  the great
 commandment is, more than anything else, a call to act *as if you were
 god and accepting ultimate responsibility* in your every action.  a
 demand that i, like most, would rather *not* hear, but it keeps popping
 up nonetheless (along with the reassurance that it is more important
 that i be open to trying this, than succeeding at it).  "conservatives"
 may twist this "act as if you were god" to mean "lay down rules for other
 people and be as nasty to them as possible if they don't keep your rules."
 they are so insistent (and obvious) about this that they have convinced a
 lot of people (who rightly reject the whole concept!) that such idiocy
 is how god acts.  that, after all, is the standard accusation "against
 god" by the atheists here and elsewhere.  that the "conservatives" have
 confused their manipulative, hoop-jumping notions of coercing other
 people with the nature of god is almost the entire content of standard
 american atheism -- and i quite agree with it on this point.

 and different bodies of christians have, from the beginning, urged
 *different* "ethical systems" (or in some cases, none).  as a result,
 it is bizarre to identify any one of these systems, however popular
 (or infamous) with christianity.  christianity does not have a torah.
 it does not have a qu'ran.  specifically christian scripture has very
 little, if anything, in the way of "commandments" -- so little that
 the "christians" who desperately *want* commandments go "mining" for
 them with almost no support (and thus almost no obvious limitation :-))
 for their efforts.  the one, single, thing in the gospels which jesus
 specifically "gives" as "a commandment" to us is "love one another."
 
 	[i will be expanding on this point in a reply to paul hudson
 	 that i hope to get to in a day or so -- it is quite true that
 	 some christians infer lots of commandments from the nt; i'll
 	 point out what has to be going on in these inferences, and why
 	 there is a huge amount of "cultural baggage" involved.]
 
 you are quite right that this is "goo" if one is looking for an ethical
 system.
 
 but why should anyone be looking for an ethical system, since our
 society is eager to hand us one or more no matter what we do?  it
 may be that we need a principle for the critique of ethical systems
 -- in which case i will profer the _agapate allelou_ once again.

 i think you are begging the question. why don't i and the (myriads
 of) other christians like me tell you something about christianity?
 [nor is this very new in christianity -- you might want to look up
 the origins and fundamental doctrines of the quakers, from the 17th
 century onwards, and they are not at all the first to understand the
 gospel in a manner that is congenial to my case.]
