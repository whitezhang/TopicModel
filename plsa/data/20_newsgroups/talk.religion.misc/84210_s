      "orthodox" is a compound word. it comes from 'orthos' (straight, true, 
      right) and from 'doxa' (opinion, doctrine, teaching). i use orthodox to 
      refer to 'right teaching.' right teaching is derived from letting god 
      speak to us through the bible. this can be from reading simple truths 
      in the scriptures and by using the bible to interpret the bible.
 
 ra> who is that "holds that" luke meant what you said he meant?
 
      i think that it is apparent from reading the scriptures that are
      pertinent.
 
      luke 23:43 records christ's promise to the repentant thief who hung on
      an adjacent cross: "truly i say to you, today you will be with me in
      paradise." but was it not until later that christ rose from the dead
      and ascended to heaven? if christ himself was not in heaven until
      sunday, how could the repentant thief have been there with him? the
      answer lies in the location of "paradise" when jesus died.
 
      apparently paradise was not exalted to heaven until easter day.
 
      jesus refers to it in the middle of the story of the rich man and 
      lazarus as "abraham's bosom," to which the godly beggar lazarus was
      carried by the angels after his decease (luke 16:19-31).  thus
      "abraham's bosom" referred to the place where the souls of the redeemed
      waited till the day of christ's resurrection.
 
      it was not yet lifted to heaven but it may well have been a section of 
      hades (hebrew: sheol), reserved for believers who had died in the faith
      but would not be admitted into the glorious presence of god in heaven
      until the price of redemption had actually been paid on calvary; or
      even that none would precede the presence of jesus back to glory with
      the father.
 
      doubtless it was the infernal paradise that the souls of jesus and the
      repentant thief repaired after they each died on friday afternoon. but
      on sunday, after the risen christ had first appeared to mary magdalene
      (john 20:17) and her two companions (matthew 28:9), presumably he then
      took up with him to glory all the inhabitants of infernal paradise
      (including abraham, lazarus, and the repentant thief). we read in
      ephesians 4:8 concerning christ: "ascending on high, he led captivity
      captive; he gave gifts unto men." verse 9 continues: "but what does `he
      ascended' mean but that he also descended to the lowest parts of the
      earth?" -i.e., to hades. verse 10 adds: "he who descended is the same
      as he who ascended above all the heavens." presumably he led the whole
      band of liberated captives from hades (i.e., the whole population of
      preresurrection paradise) up to the glory of heaven.

      i think that this characterization is faulty. whenever my 'personal 
      interpretation' is questioned, i usually give a reason.
 
      as for those that see things differently, please, put forward where
      there is a valid difference, and we can discuss it. 
 
      i seem to be seeing from you the notion that any difference in how one 
      views the bible is somehow legitimate, except, or course, for the stuff 
      that i glean from it. put forward a contrary view and perhaps we can 
      have a discussion on that topic. but to decry something that i put 
      forward, without putting forward something else to discuss, and to 
      dismiss what i put forward while giving credence to other alleged views
      that have yet to be put forward is simply being contentious.
 
 ra> are we to simply assume that you are the only one who really
 ra> understands it?
 
      if you believe that something that i have drawn from scripture is 
      wrong, then please, show me from scripture where it is wrong.  simply 
      stating that there are other views is not a proof. show it to me from 
      scripture and then we can go on.
