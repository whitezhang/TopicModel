 compare the driver to an urge such as jealousy, where there is an urge
 and an "object". the jealousy does not technically exist until the object
 is apparent. however, the capacity to be jealous is presumably still there
 even though it is not detectable.
 
 your description of the unbilical took me three passes to understand (!) but
 i get the gist and i have to tentatively agree. i think our two definitions
 can sit side by side without too much trouble, though. i haven't attempted to
 define the reason behind the moral driver (only hinted through the essence of
 each moral). your definition hints that animals are also capable of a
 similar morality - simians have a similar social order to ourselves and it is
 easy to anthropomorphize with these animals. is this possible or have i
 misunderstood?

 my p.s. thoughts falls roughly in line with john stuart mill and
 his writings on utilitarianism. i have no particular plan (except to do
 my bit - personal ethics and social work). my opinion (for what it is worth)
 is that the authority for each moral must be increased somehow, and that this
 will probably take several generations to be effective. i don't think that the
 list of morals has changed for society significantly, though . the authority element
 may come from our authority figures and roles models (see eric berne and his
 transactional analysis work [+ mavis klein] for references) and this is what
 gives rise to a deterioration of moral standards in the long term.
 
 i've had some more thoughts on my definitions:
 
 i've was thinking that i should add moral character to the list of definitions
 in order to get a dynamic version of the moral nature (ie. the interplay of
 the moral code and associated authorities). a suitable analogy might be a
 graphic equaliser on a hifi system - the moral nature being the set of
 frequencies and the chosen 'amplitudes', and the moral character being the
 spectrum over time.
 
 conscience is a little more difficult because i can't define it as the
 reasoning of a person between actions in the context of his moral nature
 because conscience seems to cut in most of the time unbidden and often
 unwanted. i think conscience is manifest when a decision is made at a given
 time which compromises one's moral nature. my conscience fits in more with
 freud's superego (plus the moral driver) with the stimulous being the
 urges or freud's id. the reasoning that i mentioned before is freud's ego,
 i suppose. if the moral driver is part of the id then the reason why
 conscience cuts in unbidden is partially explained. the question is "what
 provides the stimulous to activate the moral driver?". i think i need some
 more time with this one.
 
 that's about it for now!
