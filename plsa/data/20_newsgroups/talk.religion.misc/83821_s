 i don't accept atoms or gravity as fact either.  they are extremely useful
 mathematical models to describe physical observations we can make.
 other posters have aptly explained the atomic model.  gravity, too, is
 very much a theory; no gravity waves have even been detected, but we
 have a very useful model that describes much of the behavior on
 objects by this thing we _call_ gravity.  gravity, however, is _not_ 
 a fact.  it is a theoretical model used to talk about how objects 
 behave in our physical environment.  newton thought gravity was a
 simple vector force; einstein a wave. both are very useful models that 
 have no religious overtones or requirements of faith, unless of course you 
 want to demand that it is a factual physical entity described exactly 
 the way the theory now formulated talks about it.  that takes a great 
 leap of faith, which, of course, is what religion takes.  evolution
 is no different.
