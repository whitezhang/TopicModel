 jim and andy both have it incorrect i believe:
 
 the *facts* are what is there, the processes that exist in the
 present or the physical evidence of the processes having occured
 in the past. these *facts* exist with or without a theory.
 
 the *theory* tries and explains the *facts* and how they relate
 to the rest of the physical universe in a manner that is both
 coherent and useful, that it can be used to make predictions.
 
 the *facts* of gravity, evolution, electromagnetic radiation,
 relativity, atoms will exist and behave in the way in which they
 behave regardless of whether we have a theory to try and explain
 how they interact... or even why.
 
 a theory never really becomes a fact... but a theory can predict
 the existence of a previously unknown fact, and if we find this
 fact as the theory predicted we say the *theory* is *supported*
 by the *facts*. a theory is a mental construct, a speculation, 
 a model.  if it is a good model, it may be useful.
 
 in science a theory is something that is supported by the 
 evidence, considerable evidence, sometimes *all* of the evidence.
 a *hypothesis* is a new fledgling theory because there is not
 yet enough evidence to support it.  when a new hypothesis 
 is proposed to replace an existing theory, it must explain
 *all* of the facts that the current theory explains and at least
 some of the facts that the current theory could not and/or
 predict new facts.
 
 it is so simple.... i'm surprised that this subject gets
 beat to death about once a month. a quick glance in a dictionary
 would clear up 99% of the confusion and bandwidth in this
 newsgroup.  then we could talk about really important things
 like, why do men have nipples?
