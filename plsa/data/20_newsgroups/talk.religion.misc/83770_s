 if an unreasonable warrant is served in the 'knock' fashion, i can see
 the warrant, claim it is unreasonable, allow the search, and hire a
 lawyer to have the evidence suppressed.
 
 if any warrant is served in the 'no-knock' fashion, all i
 see is men with guns bashing in the door.  maybe they've got "police"
 or "atf" jackets, maybe they yell "police".  but anyone can do that
 with little effort. even if i have time to take in all this, if i
 decide they are police and fail to defend myself, my decision could easily
 be fatal.
 
 more likely i can't see the jackets before i have to decide whether to
 defend myself or not, and they yell as they are bashing in the door,
 so i can't hear them.  or, they've already thrown in some flash-bang
 grenades, deafening and confusing me.

 some news readers expect "disclaimer:" here.
 just say no to police searches and seizures.  make them use force.
