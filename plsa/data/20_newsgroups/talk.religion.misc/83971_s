           sometimes a god-believer will maintain that atheism is itself 
        a religion.  many postings to this group have answered that well.  
        here's another way to answer the assertion: 
           suppose that i don't believe that broken mirrors or black cats 
        bring bad luck.  does that mean that i have a superstition?
