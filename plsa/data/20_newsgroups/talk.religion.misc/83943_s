         it should be remembered that all of the first reports came from 
        the fbi, and that independent observers, i.e. the press, were not 
        allowed to get close and see things for themselves.  official 
        communiques tend to be self-serving for the agencies that issue 
        them. 
         people in general tend to believe first reports, as these get 
        the most and the biggest headlines.  corrections are often 
        overlooked. 
          an example is the fbi report that several of the bodies found 
        in the rubble had bullet wounds.  the local coroner, who is 
        independent of the fbi, has so far found no bullet wounds!
