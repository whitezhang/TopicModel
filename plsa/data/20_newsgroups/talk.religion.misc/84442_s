 the oed gives the etymology of "sibyl" as coming from the ancient greek 
 
 	sigma iota beta upsilon lambda lambda alpha 
 	( s i b ih l l a )
 
 which is claimed to come from the doric 
 
 	sigma iota omicron beta upsilon lambda lambda alpha 
 	( s i o b ih l l a )
 
 which (if i read it properly) in turn came from the attican (athenian)
 
 	theta epsilon omicron beta omicron upsilon lambda eta 
 	( th eh o b o ih l ae )
 
 i don't know much about attis, but it wouldn't surprise me to learn that
 this god was tied to the athenian capital
 
 	alpha tau tau iota kappa upsilon sigma
 	(a t t i k u s)
 
 the oed does not list any etymology for "cybele" since that is a propper noun,
 but i suggest that the greek spelling of that word would be much closer to
 the anticedants of sibyl than the two words are now. perhaps "cybele" is a
 french or latin spelling?
