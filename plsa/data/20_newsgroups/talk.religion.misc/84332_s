 convenient?  it seems very appropriate that this is cross-posted to
 alt.conspiracy.
 
 assuming the most favorable interpretation of your '1000 degree'
 measurement (that the temperature is in centigrade, rather than the
 more common -in the us- fahrenheit), you are still laboring under at
 least 2 misconceptions:
 
 1.  you seem to believe that steel melts somewhere around 1000 c.
     actually, the melting point of most iron alloys (and steels are
     iron alloys) is in the neighborhood of 1400 c.  even if the gun
     were found in area which achieved the 1000 c temperature, the steel
     parts of the gun would not be deformed, and it would still be
     trivial to identify the nature of the weapon.
 
 2.  a fire is not an isothermal process.  there are 'hot' spots and
     'cold' spots, though 'cold' is purely a relative term.   so the
     weapon was not necessarily situated in a hot spot, as you seem to
     imply.  and, even if it was, so what?  it would not have melted
     anyway.
