 give me a break.  if the mormons fortified utah and armed it to the teeth,
 and were involved in illegal activity, then they deserve whatever they get.
 
 you are making a ludicrous suggestion.

 does that include the right to murder little children?  how about killing
 atf officers?  i do not know much about the gun laws in texas, but 
 koresh's folks claimed to have grenades, grenade launchers, and rocket
 launchers.  i am not sure that the nra feels that this falls under 
 "right to bear arms."

 please explain.  i do not remember jews or mormons (as a group) overtly 
 breaking a judicious (a.k.a. non-nazi) law and being punished for it.
