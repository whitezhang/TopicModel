 are you the spokesman for "most people?"

 that you don't recognize the biblical commentary used.  those in the
 church know the language though, and have no such excuse.

 you missed the point -- which is that the prophets, the psalms, and 
 revelation, all together, provide a very rich view of a very special
 event -- a wedding.

 how are you able to make such a conclusion?  please note, that the
 first part of revelation makes it clear that the address is to those
 in the church. that said, it doesn't hurt to try to see what the 
 prophecies are ahead of time -- for those outside the church.

 so you say. it should be interesting to see what the investigators 
 conclude, and what the final judgments are.

 so much for war and government eh.

 very glad you asked, since i goofed -- it should be philippian 1:14-19: 
 (here from niv)
 
 	because of my chains, most of the brothers in the lord
 	have been encouraged to speak the word of god more
 	courageously and fearlessly.
 
 	it is true that some preach christ out of envy and 
 	rivalry, but others out of good will. the latter do so
 	in love, knowing that i am put here for the gospel. 
 	the former preach christ out of selfish ambition, not
 	sincerely, supposing that they can stir up trouble for
 	me while i am chains. but what does it matter? 
 
 	the important thing is that in every way, whether from
 	false motives or true, christ is preached. and because
 	of this i rejoice.
 	
 my comment stems from the realization that we who love the lord, are
 human and imperfect. whatever we "preach," no matter how eloquent, or
 how corrupted -- is of little difference. those who know the master's
 voice will recognize him -- a gem-stone amidst rock. such is also the 
 lesson of the "stumblingblock." for those who have an ear to hear.
