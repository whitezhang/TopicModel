 when the right to freedom of speech was "invented", all we had to worry about
 was printing presses and live speech. now, we have to worry about violent movies
 influencing the young and tv beaming pornography into homes. do you really believe we should start restricting constitutionally guaranteed freedoms because
 the technology has changed? freedom is ageless. it was a good idea then and it
 still is.
 
 be real careful when second guessing the founding fathers.
