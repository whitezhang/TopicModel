 the rest of the story seems to be that the agreement for the broadcast
 was for prime-time, and that koresh never even heard it played. wasn't
 even tuned in to the radio when it aired -- so no reason to come out.
 
 if later they had given him a copy of the grossly twisted newswire 
 transcript -- i'm certain koresh would think he was at the mercy of
 evil itself. 
 
 as to coming out after passover, wasn't that just one of the lawyer's
 speculations peter?
