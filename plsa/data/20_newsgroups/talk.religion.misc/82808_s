 good question.  i don't have a nice concise answer, though.  what about the
 child whose parents are crushed emotionally because he/she starts a carerr
 doing something they greatly dislike.  it is the same kind of harm, and
 is probably "caused" by the same thing:  the desire of the child to be 
 true to his or her self.
 
 what is more important, being true to yourself or burying that truth within
 you in order to maintain peace in the family?
 
 hard question, no good answer.
