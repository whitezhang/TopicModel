 no, and im especially unhappy that these 70+ people died in an assault
 on private property with government armored vehicles.
 
 i am also unhappy (or actually, very suspicious) that the fbi was dismissing
 out of hand any chances that they might have accidentally set the blaze 
 themselves. i mean, i guess we are just supposed to believe that
 ramming modified tanks into the walls of a building and injecting
 toxic gases into the building are just routine procedures, no way
 anything could go wrong.
