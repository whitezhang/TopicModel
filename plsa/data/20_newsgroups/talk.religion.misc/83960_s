 y'know, the perp who commits a drive-by near the homes of some of my friends
 ain't gonna be in any condition to do so again...  and most of the places with
 large numbers of drive-bys are places where guns are strictly controlled, or
 the residents can't afford them..
 
 just because you once had freedom of speech, we've decided information is too
 easy to transmit, so for the public good we will start armed raids on anyone
 who says something that violates what we believe is proper to say.
 
 you attack one constitutional right as being outdated, and i can probably come
 up with a like justification to attack the others.  retaining any of your rights
 requires retaining all of your rights.
