 again, you missed jesus's point.  if you read the surrounding passages
 you would understand what jesus means by "life in the world."  but
 as is, you bumbled around, asserted your standard axiom that the bible is bunk,
 and came up with the wrong idea.  also, you do not know exactly
 what jesus means by eternal life.  
 
 brian k., do you expect to jump in the middle of the quantum mechanics
 book and understand hermite polynomials having not read the surrounding
 material?  why do you such with the bible?  for an idea what jesus
 means by the world, look up references to it in your concordance.  for
 a good description, the whole book of ecclesiastes is game.  for 
 eternal life, check out john 17:3, john 3:15-16.  you will find that
 eternal life is quite different than what you think.  eternal life
 starts now--an infinitely high quality of life living in fellowship
 with god.

 if my diety exists, you would not just cease to exist.  jesus talks of
 hell in luke 16:19-31.

 the truth is, is that it is not some sort of magic spell.  the truth
 is is that you do not understand it, and enjoy not understanding it.
 
 >christanity is a very nice belief set around a very nice book. 
 
 
 wrong again.  christianity is supposed to be relationship.  you
 do not even know what christianity is and you are arguing against
 it.

 just as i make up such places as jericho, jerusalem, babylon, corinth,
 ephesus, susa, and such kings as nebuchanezzar, david, solomon,
 sennacherib, herod, pontius pilate . . . .   but i guess then
 that you treat abraham lincoln as a myth like you do odin and zeus.
