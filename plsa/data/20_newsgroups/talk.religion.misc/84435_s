 it seems you lived a fairly 'wild life'-- my background is far more
 traditional, mostly working, working, working. maybe there's a clear
 indication that the way you lived your life produced a certain 
 amount of anxiety that needed to be released. religion was one
 possible medicine. while my more stable environment didn't and 
 still does not produce the situation where i feel such guilt.
 
 this is just one possible explanation why you feel this burden,
 while i haven't felt it so far.
