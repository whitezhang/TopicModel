 this is cute, but i see no statement telling me why your church is the true 
 church. i do presume that you know or at least believe that yours is true. 
 attempting to ream my faith without replacing it with something "better" is 
 a real good way to loose a person completely from christ.
 
 this is the greatest reason i see that these attacks are not motivated by 
 love. they only seek to destroy there is no building or replacing of belief. 
 this is not something christ did. he guided and instructed he didn't 
 seek to destroy the faith he found, he redirected it. 
 
 this is what i see when people say they "love" <insert favorite group here>. 
 and i have to laugh at the irony. 
 
 please excuse the scarcasm but it was nice to say it. 
 oh, btw robert don't take this personally, your post was merely convinent.
