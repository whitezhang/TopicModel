 i am surprised and saddened. i would expect this kind of behavior
 from the evangelical born-again gospel-thumping in-your-face we're-
 the-only-true-christian protestants, but i have always thought 
 that catholics behaved better than this.
 
 friend dennis, i urge you to follow the example of your fellow
 catholics, of who i count many dozens as my friends, and practice
 your faith through good example and decent living and respect
 for the common humanity of others. please do not stoop to the
 level of the e b-a g-t i-y-f w-t-o-t-c protestants, who think
 that the best way to witness is to be strident, intrusive, loud,
 insulting and overbearingly self-righteous.
 
 the imagery in the song of solomon is a little bit dated (get it? 
 middle east - date palms - oh, never mind) but apparently acceptable, 
 on a steaminess level, to be accepted as part of the canon. from
 this fact i derive that erotica itself is not incompatible with
 catholic doctrine.
 
 is there such a thing as catholic erotica? not necessarily a love
 story between people of that faith, but a love story that is not
 exploitative, does not seek redemption through penis size, pays
 proper respect to the dignity of each partner, and is still erotic
 enough to have a place on a.s.s.
 
 i would submit that the _darknites_ series of stories qualify, also
 most of the _journal entries_, and _rings i and ii_.
 
 i would guess that your aim is to cut down on the pornography and
 increase the erotica. i actually agree with you that nearly all of
 the "i've got an enormous dick, and i shot my wad all over her face"
 stories are crap. i count them as noise, which makes my take on the
 signal-to-noise ration much lower than many other people's.
 
 since you are one of the few posters here who can actually write 
 decent prose, could you write a few stories for us instead of
 overwhelming us with commentary?
