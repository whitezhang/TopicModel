   evolution is both fact and theory.  the theory of evolution represents the
 scientific attempt to explain the fact of evolution.  the theory of evolution
 does not provide facts; it explains facts.  it can be safely assumed that all
 scientific theories neither provide nor become facts but rather explain facts.
 i recommend that you do some appropriate reading in general science.  a good
 starting point with regard to evolution for the layman would be "evolution as
 fact and theory" in "hen's teeth and horse's toes" [pp 253-262] by stephen jay
 gould.  there is a great deal of other useful information in this publication.
