 evolution = theory
 creation = fact
 vs                        is this demonstrating the nonsense part?
 evolution = assertion     
 creation = fiction

 what is the fact of evolution?  there is a difference between calling evolution a
 fact and talking about the theory of evolution providing facts (i happen to think
 the latter is more accurate ).  and you said it best yourself: if you assess 
 the _theories_ of evolution objectively...  why didn't you say,  if you assess 
 the _facts_ of evolution objectively...
