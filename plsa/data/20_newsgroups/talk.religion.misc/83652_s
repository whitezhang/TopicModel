 just for the record ( not that any kind of information would be
 likely to affect your thinking ) i have an msee -- focus in
 electromagnetics -- from penn.
 
 a photo of the smallest logo in the world does not an atom make.
 what was observed is something we can measure that matches what 
 the mathematical model we call an atom had predicted.  
 
 much in the same way that we need both a particle model and a
 wave model for light, the atomic model is a mathematical
 representation of physical phenomena.  a model that can and
 probably will continue to change over time.  that makes it 
 subjective (the model that is).  however, the model gives us an
 objective way to talk about the physical world.
 
 to put it another way, the quantum mechanical model of the atom
 allows for discussion of the atom that will give repeatable and
 unambiguous results, which is objective.  however, as bohr and
 einstein duked it out mid-century, the interpretation of
 those reapeatable, observable measurements is quite subjective.
 bohr said that the observable randomness of atomic motion was
 inherent in the nature of the universe.  einstein said particle
 motion was deterministic, but it was our measurement shortcomings
 that introduced the randomness.  they were talking about the
 exact same results, though.
