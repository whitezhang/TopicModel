 scuse, please, are you under the impression that this argument is made in
 a vacuum, and that somehow only the fetus' potential life is being considered?
 
 i would guess, from your 'very egocentric' comment that you do not, in which
 case i have to ask just what the hell is wrong with egocentrism when one is
 making a fundamental choice about one's life?  don't *you* consult *your*
 *own* wants when *you* make decisions about your life?  i haven't noticed you
 asking *me* about what *i* want from you....
 
 i've got some *great* ideas.  if egocentrism is ruled out, you can show up
 tomorrow 8am and i'll put you to work.
