 be warned, it is not my job to convert you.  that is the job of
 the holy spirit.  and i, frankly, make a lousy one.  i am only
 here to testify.  your conversion is between you and god.  i am
 "out of the loop".  if you decide to follow jesus, of which i
 indeed would be estatic, then all the glory be to god.
