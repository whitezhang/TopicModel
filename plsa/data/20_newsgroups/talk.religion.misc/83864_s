 my apologies. i really didn't have the time to chase down a slew of
 references from 10-20 years ago when i was looking at these issues.

 1. the mother church did disappear at the time of the roman attack. james
 the just was judicially murdered a few years earlier, but there is
 evidence that the church survived him. there is no evidence that it still
 existed after the assault on the city. the individuals historically
 associated with that church disappear at that time. 
 
 2. the followers of jesus included a number of individuals whose nicknames
 suggested connections with the jewish terrorism of the time (zealotes,
 iscariot, "sons of thunder").
 
 3. for cult psychology, there's an extensive literature.
 
 4. for an understanding of the motivation of the members of the jerusalem
 church, there is a mixed collection of sources. the anchor bible has some
 interesting articles, but one thing i've noticed about biblical
 scholarship is that intellectual honesty and a skeptical approach are
 notably lacking. you basically have to spread your net wide and then
 winnow. (for example, allegro and schoenfeld have some interesting ideas,
 but they were both "over the top.") many interesting ideas have not been
 followed up, mostly due to religious reasons. what was the connection of
 early christian theology to samaritan dualism and proto-gnosticism? (see
 stephen's speech in acts for a samaritan interpretation of the
 crucifixion.) schweitzer's interpretation of jesus's motivations could be
 updated, especially now that we have the essene and chenoboskian
 materials. and so it goes. (for instance, the convincing statistical
 evidence concerning the authorship of the pauline materials has been
 completely ignored by biblical scholars.)
 
 i don't track this area much any more. (my coursework is 20 years old.) i
 have a personal theory that the synoptics were written in syria during the
 course of the jewish revolt. i suspect mark was written before the fall of
 jerusalem as an apology to get the romans and roman-sympathizers off the
 back of the local greek christians. matthew and luke were written with
 similar goals, but incorporating additional materials. given the evidence
 in the gospel of thomas (chenoboskien), i suspect q came from a samaritan
 (proto-gnostic) milieu. in any case, they were written in an environment
 cut off by time or circumstances from jerusalem, not expecting further
 contact, and not wanting to be connected by outsiders to the themes of the
 doctrines held by the jerusalem church.
 
 sorry about the lack of documentation, but the time is hard to find.
