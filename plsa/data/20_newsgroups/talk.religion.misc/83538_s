     non-toxic tear gas?!?  do you know what tear gas is?
 
     i do: once upon a time i happened to be in a room when someone threw 
     a tear-gas grenade in (that was supposed to be a joke:).  the sensation 
     was incredible: i felt my eyes and nostrils were being torn apart.
     i remember us - a bunch of young men in our early 20's - running out
     like a herd of wild animals, knocking down the door and jumping
     out of the windows (thank g-d we were on the first floor).
 
     i can't imagine this kind of stuff being used against children.
