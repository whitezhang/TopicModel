 yeah. innocents. people who hoard $250k worth of high-caliber automatic weapons

 their self-appointed messiah-following parents. a burning started by the 
 davidians.

 is this subject line a veiled threat against u.s. government agents or possibly
 executive office leadership (i.e. clinton)? i've considered you a bit of a loon,
 before, stephen, i guess this pretty much confirms it.
