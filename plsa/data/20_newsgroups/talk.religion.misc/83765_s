 i assume you are saying that no-knock warrants are 'unreasonable', this
 is a matter of opinion and is not a clear violation of the 4th
 admendment. you say that 'this is a country of laws' yet you seem very
 willing to ignore these laws, or at least those you disagree with,
 and respond to a legal situation with 'blazing guns'. like it or not,
 as it stands now no-knock warrants are legal. if you don't like this
 there are legal means to fight this including contacting your
 congresspersons about changing the law; and, if it happens to you,
 fighting its legality in court.
