 when robert refers to the "orthodox", he is talking about the historical
 position of the christian faith. such things are derived from biblcal
 texts through the centuries by the apocolic fathers of the faith.
 
 you are right that people read things differently in the bible, and this
 is alright in parts like parables and such forth. however, when it comes
 to the essential doctrines of the historical orthodox christan beliefs,
 there is only one correct way to read it. for example, either the
 doctrine of the trinity is true, or it is false. yes, people read the
 texts differently, but only one position is true. they both cannot be.
 according to the text, the doctrine is true and has always existed.
 
 therefore, when people like joseph smith come along with a vision and
 thinks he can undo centuries of a doctrine that is supported by the
 bible, people consider him a cult.
