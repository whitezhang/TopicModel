 let's see, if alexander destroyed tyre, and people move back, and
 they construct houses, and after a while 14000 people live there
 and still call it tyre, it is not considered to be rebuilt. instead
 it's considered to be 'just-some-people-that-got-together-for-fishing-
 and-they-needed-houses' place.

 sigh, i was never born in a city then (my home town has 10.000
 people). i have to consult my city and inform them that it's from
 now a fishing village. when this city (kristinestad) was founded
 in the 17:th century about 1000 people lived there, so the norms
 were even more bizarre for dumb swedish queens who founded cities
 along the coast of finland.
 
 i would like to know why paul thought is was worth mentioning the 
 small fishing place of tyre in acts. again, maybe he was a keen
 fisherman and wanted to visit the shores of tyre? :-)
 
 cheers,
 kent
