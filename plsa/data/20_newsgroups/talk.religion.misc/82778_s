 i agree, which is why i've asked for help with it.
 
 the reason i'm working on this list is because i've recently had one
 too many christians tell me "the bible contains no contradictions
 whatsoever."  they believe that it's true, and that it describes
 reality perfectly, and even predicts history before it happens.
 
 before i can carry on any sort of meaningful conversation with these
 people, i've got to show them, with concrete evidence, that the bible
 is not nearly as airtight as they thought.  i hope to do that with
 this list.
 
 specifically: when i bring up the fact that genesis contains two
 contradictory creation stories, i usually get blank stares or flat
 denials.  i've never had a fundamentalist acknowledge that there are
 indeed two different accounts of creation.
