 its just variation within a thread.  the variation at times has been so great
 that speciation has occurred.  so albert sabin is the common ancestor of
 several threads, some of which have themselves speciated.  on a separate topic,
 i subscribed to t.o. just recently.  albert sabin existed at that time, so i
 have no clue as to its origins.  maybe the abiogenesists have an answer.  i
 might also point out that evolution is aimless.  thus why albert 
 sabin evolved into a religious discussion is probably unexplainable.
