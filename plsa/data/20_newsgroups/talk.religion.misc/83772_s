 so you say the credibility of the fbi and atf is questionalbe.  so be it.
 but certainly the credibility of david koresh was (when he was alive)
 absolutely untrustworthy.  the bd's in the compound were by all accounts
 absolutely loyal to koresh, and thus would lie for him.  thus, the
 credibility of his followers must be questionned.  do you trust them more
 than the police?

 no, i saw one of the escapees say it himself on television.  that was on the
 10 o'clock news on channel 5 here in the bay area.

 you are speculating that the fbi purposely started the fire?!?!?  please,
 if you've got such a ridiculously extraordinary claim, and have no evidence
 whatsoever, at least give us a speculatory reason why the fbi would want to
 do such a thing.
 
 the possibility that the fire was started accidentally is much more reasonable,
 but we don't have anything but contradictory anecdotal evidence right now.
