 this brings up another something i have never understood.  i asked this once
 before and got a few interesting responses, but somehow didn't seem satisfied.
 why would the nt not be considered a good source.  this might be a 
 literary/historical question, but when i studied history i always looked for 
 firsthand original sources to write my papers.  if the topic was on mr. x, i 
 looked to see if mr. x wrote anything about it.  if the topic was on a group, 
 look for the group, etc.  if the topic is on mr. x, and mr. x did not write 
 anything about it, (barring the theistic response about the bible being 
 divinely inspired which i can't adequately argue), wouldn't we look for people
 who ate, worked, walked, talked, etc. with him?  if someone was at an event 
 wouldn't they be a better "reporter" than someone who heard about it second 
 hand?  i guess isn't firsthand better than second hand.  i know, there is bias,
 and winners writing history, but doesn't the principle of firsthand being best
 still apply?
