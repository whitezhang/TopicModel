 [by the way mr decenso, you really should have looked in the index of your
 bauer-arndt-gingrich greek lexicon.  you would have found that the word in
 acts for "lot" is "kleros," not "chorion" as stated by mr archer, and nowhere
 in the very large discussion of kleros in done the to "theological dictionary
 of the new testament" by bromley, is the meaning "burial plot" discussed.  it
 discusses the forms of "kleros" (eg: kleros, kleroo, etc), and the various
 meanings of "kleros" (eg: "plot of land," and "inheritance"), but mentions
 nothing about chorion or "burial plot." (why does this not surprise me?) thus
 it would seem to be a very good thing you dumped archer as a reference.]

 i owe the group an apology.  it is my habit to check my articles before and
 after their submission for errors.  in my last article i stated:

 i was wrong. i admit that i do not have a handle on greek grammar, and thus
 confused "kleros", the second to last word in acts 1:17 as being the plot of
 land discussed.  in actuality it is "chorion", which is the last word acts
 1:18.  unfortunately my greek dictionary does not discuss "chorion" so i
 cannot report as to the nuances of the word.
  
 i don't know if someone else would have caught this, though i am sure that
 someone would be able to do so, but i have an aversion to disseminating
 mistakes, especially when someone else might use that mistake to prove a point"

 vary noble of you dave.  i didn't want to have to go to x number of sources to
 show you wrong.  (although i am researching chorion a little).

 "of course the only other reference mr decenso has given is bullinger.  and
 bullinger uses such ridiculous exegisis that when i accused mr decenso of

  [actually mr decenso, you said that there was "benefit" to our argument, in
   that it caused to to rediscover bullinger's exegisis.  i did not realize
   that you would find such garbage beneficial, unless you were convinced by
   it]."

 thus i apologize for thinking that even mr decenso could find such "drek"
 convincing....he should specify which parts of bullinger he finds convincing
 and quit hiding behind a disingenuous mask of "this is what bullinger
 believed, not necessarily what i believe." so which is it mr decenso? do you
 find the exegisis convincing or not?)"
  
 my reply...
 one of my purposes in debating these alleged contradictions with you and
 others is to diseminate many different views of possible reconciliations
 raised by various bible scholars and students alike.  when i present my views,
 i will clearly distinguish them from now on.
  
 db...
 "of course without archer and bullinger we find that mr decenso has presented
 no greek exegisis at all, and mr decenso has made a big thing about my not
 referring back to the actual greek.  thus we find this demand on his part for
 quality greek exegisis to be a hypocritical requirement."
  
 my reply...
 good point.  but in your declaring that these passages are contradictory, you
 have produced only superficial reasonings and observations. nor have you dug
 deeper.  i'm glad you have begun in this post.  i will begin greek studies on
 these passages in more depth than i thought necessary, as well.
  
 db...
 "it would be appropriate to look at what mr decenso has actually used as
 evidence.  now we know what he claims for a standard, as he has stated it
 often enough:
  
 > (a) the text itself
 > (b) parallel passages
 > (c) other pertinent scriptures
 > (d) historical context
 > (e) historical content
 > (f) other pertinent historical info
 > (g) cultural context
 > (h) cultural content
 > (i) other pertinent cultural info
 > (j) grammatical construction
 > (k) hebrew and greek word studies
 > (l) etc.
  
 but are these actual standards he has used, or simply empty hyperbole.  let's
 see, he has used (a), and since he is trying to reconcile it to other
 passages, we see that he has also used (b).  on the other hand he has
 presented no use of:
  
 (d) historical context                or
 (e) historical content                or
 (f) other pertinent historical info   or
 (g) cultural context                  or
 (h) cultural content                  or
 (i) other pertinent cultural info     or
 (j) grammatical construction          or even
 (k) hebrew and greek word studies [remember, archer and bullinger don't count]
  
 thus we find his vaunted criteria for exegisis is just empty mouthings."
  
 my reply...
 question:  do you find such criteria important?  if so, do you plan on starting
 to use them to the best of your ability, or will you continue to present
 shallow observations (i don't mean this in a bad way).
 at this point in our _debates_, i have not found it necessary to present a
 total exegetical analysis of these passages, since we seem to keep beating
 around the bush and not getting into the core of the verses.  i do not believe
 it necessary to use many of the above criteria to refute your arguments re:
 judas in acts and matthew, but i will do my best from this point on to use
 several of the above criteria, since you desire me to.  i hope you will also.
 it will greatly enhance our study of these passages.
  
 db...
 "the only thing he has actually used, beyond the passage itself, is any other
 passage.  thus mr decenso should be honest and note that most of his list is
 red herring and his only real criteria seems to be:
  
 > (a) the text itself
 > (b) parallel passages
  
 my reply...
 the reason is simple...you are mistating the passages.  you claim that the
 passages contradict one another; i do not see the passages contradicting one
 another.
 (1) they may very well be complimentary, as many scholarly sources mention;
 (2) matthew may not be presenting judas' death, as you claim.  but we'll look
 at your defense of this later.
  
 also, the "reward of iniquity" in the acts passage may not be the 30 pieces of
 silver in matthew's passages.  (although you have a valiant attempt later at
 stating why you believe it is).
  
 at this beginning stages in our debates, we are laying some scriptural
 groundwork, which will be expanded upon through deeper exegesis.
  
 db...
 "of course the only reason i can see to so drastically reinterpret a passage
 as he has done with judas' death, is to make it agree with another passage so
 that both could be considered correct."
  
 my reply...
 one of the reasons i have given a different exegetical view of the passages is
 that you seem to think the majority of scholarship is wrong in concluding these
 passages are complimentary.  however, i see no problem in tony rose's
 explanation of judas' death...
  
 _____________________________________________________________________
  
 how would you explain the inaccuracy between judas hanging
 himself in matthew 27:5 and "falling headlong he burst open"
 =============================================================
  
 this question of the manner in which judas died is one with which we are
 constantly confronted in our travels. many people point to the apparent
 discrepancy in the two accounts as an obvious, irreconcilable error.
 some have gone so far as to say that the idea of an inerrant bible is
 destroyed by these contradictory accounts. however, this is not the case at
 all.
 matthew relates that judas hanged himself, while peter tells us he fell and
 was crushed by the impact. the two statements are indeed different, but do
 they necessarily contradict each other?
 matthew does not say that judas did not fall; neither does peter say that
 judas did not hang himself. this is not a matter of one person calling
 something black and the other person calling it white. both accounts can be
 true and supplementary.
 a possible reconstruction would be this: judas hanged himself on a tree on the
 edge of a precipice that overlooked the valley of hinnom. after he hung there
 for some time, the limb of the tree snapped or the rope gave way and judas
 fell down the ledge, mangling his body in the process.
 the fall could have been before *or* after death as either would fit this
 explanation. this possibility is entirely natural when the terrain of the
 valley of hinnom is examined.  from the bottom of the valley, you can see
 rocky terraces 25 to 40 feet in height and almost perpendicular.
 there are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom.
 therefore, it is easy to conclude that judas struck one of the jagged rocks on
 this way down, tearing his body open. it is important to remember that we are
 not told how long judas remained hanging from the tree or how advanced
 was the decomposition of his body before his fall.
 louis gaussen relates a story of a man who was determined to kill himself.
 this individual placed himself on the sill of a high window and pointed a
 pistol at his head. he then pulled the trigger and leaped from the window at
 the same time.
 on the other hand, a person could say that this man took his life by shooting
 himself, while another could rightly contend he committed suicide by jumping
 form the tall building. in this case, both are true, as both are true in the
 case of matthew's and peter's accounts of the death of judas. it is merely a
 situation of different perspectives of the same event.
  
 _____________________________________________________________________
  
 your only reason for rejecting this is, i believe, your attempt to discredit
 inerrancy.  you haven't related how this is impossible or highly unlikely.
 here's what you said in an earlier post...

 "the added text in this version is so heavy that, assuming you are truly so
 opposed to such tactics, you should find it not credible.  but you seem to
 find tony rose's eisegesis satisfactory, while clearly rejecting david
 joslin's."
  
 _____________________________________________________________________
  
 here, you discredit tony's explanation based on what you deem too "heavy" for
 the passages.  but you haven't addressed why you feel that way.  you can say
 it's a vain attempt to reconcile the contradiction, but that doesn't tell me it
 didn't happen, nor have you shown why you reject that possibility.
  
 questions:  is matthew lying or is luke lying?  or are they both lying?  or
 are either or both of them misinformed?  why do you think there is such an
 alleged contradiction?  i do not think you have ever told us what you believe
 in this respect.

 actually i find question (1) to be a rather stupid request, but i will answer
 it because he now restricts himself to two points.  first i would point out
 that hanging is a very efficient manner for ending a life.  in fact it is a
 bit of a fluke when someone survives hanging (except in fantasy cowboy
 movies), and even then it usually referred to as an attempted hanging."
  
 my reply...
 i work at an agency that investigates child abuse and neglect.  today, i got a
 call re: a child that attempted suicide by hanging himself because his mother
 is on crack.  he failed in his attempt and is in a child's psych ward at a
 local hospital.  hanging attempts are not always successful.
  
 to assume that because most hangings are successful, this one was also is
 "begging the question", if i may quote you.
  
 [last night, listening to _the bible answer man_ broadcast, the christian
 research institute's show, one of the scholars on there used several of these
 terms that you use.  i am not all that familiar with them.  the man on the bam
 show teaches comparative religion and logic.  it was interesting]
  
 db...
 "this is so prevalent that, so that to say a man hung himself with no other
 qualifiers is synonymous with stating that he killed himself."
  
 my reply...
 qualifiers are important at times, as we'll see in an ot passage i'll mention
 below.
 does hanging always have this outcome?  did matthew, who is the only source we
 have re: judas hanging himself, state that judas died as a result?  to say it's
 synonymous means it has the same meaning as.  a boy (age 14) hung himself.  but
 he lived.  this is only one of probably thousands of documented cases we can
 discover.

 christian scholarly (including greek scholars) opinion, i did some research."

 my reply...
 [^^^ above, mine]
 so it's ok to use christian sources to back your points?  what about tony's
 position.  do you value it or even consider it as a valid possibility?
  
 also, is it possible that the sources you read may be wrong, or lying, or
 deceived in other parts of their books?  if so, should we do, as we have done
 with archer, toss them to the side and not value anything they say, including
 their "interpretation" of the hanging of judas?  i am sure _you_ would find
 some errors and maybe even some deception in those sources.
  
 you also noted they "interpreted" the hanging as meaning he died.  although
 that is very possibly true, do you find that in the text itself?  remember,
 that's the first criteria we must examine.

 "in each case, these references specifically describe that the interpretation

 greek word "apagchw"(ie: hang oneself) is translated as a successful hanging."
  
 my reply...
 [^^^ above, mine]
 no you can't only conclude this, although, as tony says, this was a highly
 probable outcome.  but matthew does not state death as being a result.
  
 the greek word is apagcho.  matthew 27:5 is it's only occurrence in the new
 testament.
  
 in the septuagint (the greek translation of the ot used at the time of jesus),
 it's only used in 2 samuel 17:23 : "now when ahithophel saw that his advice was
 not followed, he saddled a donkey, and arose and went home to his house, to his
 city. then he put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died; and he
 was buried in his father's tomb."             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  
 notice that not only is it stated that ahithophel "hanged himself" [gr. sept.,
 apagcho], but it explicitly adds, "and died".  here we have no doubt of the
 result.
 in matthew, we are not explicitly told judas died.
  
 also, there is nothing in the greek to suggest success or failure.  it simply
 means "hang oneself".

 "reputable"?  you mean ones that have never erred?
 as far as   insisting that the hanging was unsuccessful, that can't be done,
 even by me. ^^^^^^^^^
  
 as i said in an earlier post...
  
 _____________________________________________________________________
 although i still agree with tony's exegesis as being the most probable
 explanation regarding judas' death (taking into account several criteria),
 i've recently noticed some new things in matthew.
  
 mat 27:5-8 then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed,
 and went and hanged himself. but the chief priests took the silver pieces and
 said, "it is not lawful to put them into the treasury, because they are the
 price of blood." and they consulted together and bought with them the potter's
 field, to bury strangers in. therefore that field has been called the field of
 blood to this day.
  
 first of all, notice that the text does not say that judas died as a result of
 hanging. all it says is that he "went and hanged himself." luke however, in
 acts, tells us that "and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all
 his entrails gushed out." this is a pretty clear indication (along with the
 other details given in acts - peter's speech, the need to pick a new apostle,
 etc.) that at least after judas' fall, he was dead. so the whole concept that
                                                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 matthew and luke both recount judas' death is highly probable, but not clear
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 cut.

 here we have a stickler, dave, that i have to say i just recently noticed.
 let's look at the passage in matthew:
  
 mat 27:4 saying, "i have sinned by betraying innocent blood." and they said,
 "what is that to us? you see to it!"
  
 mat 27:5 then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed,
 and went and hanged himself.
  
 mat 27:6 but the chief priests took the silver pieces and said, "it is not
 lawful to put them into the treasury, because they are the price of blood."
  
 mat 27:7 and they consulted together and bought with them the potter's field,
 to bury strangers in.
  
 mat 27:8 therefore that field has been called the field of blood to this day.
  
 notice verse 5..."then he...went and hanged himself."
 matthew does not say judas died, does it?  should we assume he died as a
 result of the hanging?                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 what does acts say?
 act 1:18 (now this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity; and
 falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out.
  
 act 1:20 "for it is written in the book of psalms: 'let his dwelling place be
 desolate, and let no one live in it'; and, 'let another take his office.'
  
 here we may have a graphic explanation of judas' death....so, my line of
 reasoning to dispel your contradiction myth re:the "two" accounts of judas'
 death is this...matthew doesn't necessarily explain how judas died; he does
                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 say judas "hanged himself", but he didn't specifically say judas died in the
 hanging incident.               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 however, acts seems to show us his graphic demise.  therefore, there is no
 contradiction between matthew and acts re: judas' `death'.
  
 .......
  
 my reply...
 ...we do know from matthew that he did hang himself and acts probably records
 his death.  although it's possible and plausible that he fell from the hanging
 and hit some rocks, thereby bursting open, i can no longer assume that to be
 the case.  therefore, no contradiction.  matthew did not say judas died as a
                                          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 result of the hanging, did he?  most scholars believe he probably did, but...?
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 ______________________________________________________________________
  
 i quoted all that to show that i highly regard the scholars' explanations, but
 in looking at the texts initially, we can't assume judas died.  it is, however,
 highly probable.                            ^^^^^^
  
 db...
 "by the way, while all agree that judas died from the hanging, the books had
 different ways of dealing with the contradiction we are discussing.  one
 simply ignored it entirely and simply referred back to matthew's version as
 the correct version in both matt and acts.  "the biblical knowledge commentary"
 suggested the hypotheses that judas hung and then when he rotted, his belly
 exploded (which doesn't explain his headlong fall), or that his branch or rope
 broke, and he fell to his death and his gut gushed out (which doesn't explain
 how a hanging man, would fall headlong rather than feet first)."
  
 my reply...
 the outcome of any fall is dependent upon many factors...how high the person
 was suspended before the fall, any obstructions such as tree branches that may
 have deviated the fall, how steep an incline of rocky surfaces the victim fell
 upon, thus possibly rolling or bouncing of several rocks, etc.  in a
 superficial examination of the acts passage and the matthew passage, we are not
 given a lot of info on the geographical specifics, but tony in the above quoted
 post gave us some...
  
 _____________________________________________________________________
 a possible reconstruction would be this: judas hanged himself on a tree on the
 edge of a precipice that overlooked the valley of hinnom. after he hung there

 now truthfully, i do not see what is comforting about matthew confusing the
 source of the potter's field prophesy, but on the other hand the author is
 correct: matthew does make that confusion.  of course a biblical inerrantist
 who claim that every word of the bible is guaranteed true by god, will have to
 thereby add one more contradiction to the death of judas (ie: where the
 prophesy of the potter's field came from)."
  
 my reply...
 please, when we are done with this study on his death, remind me to discuss
 this with you.
  
 db...
 as to your second question mr decenso, you ask how we could be sure that the
 money with which judas purchased the land, was indeed for the betrayal, rather
 than some other source.  i would point out that in acts, where it specifically
 mention "the reward of iniquity" [acts 1:18], it also specifically mentions
 what act of iniquity they were talking about (ie: acts 1:16 "...concerning
 judas who was guide to those who arrested jesus.").  now i would point out
 that when the bible describes an act of "iniquity," and then immediately
 discusses "*the* reward of iniquity," it would be rather inane to suggest that
 it was an action of iniquity other than the one discussed."
  
 my reply...
 dave, we are getting somewhere, aren't we!
  
 act 1:15 and in those days peter stood up in the midst of the disciples
 (altogether the number of names was about a hundred and twenty), and said,
 act 1:16 "men and brethren, this scripture had to be fulfilled, which the holy
 spirit spoke before by the mouth of david concerning judas, who became a guide
 to those who arrested jesus;
 act 1:17 "for he was numbered with us and obtained a part in this ministry."
 act 1:18 (now this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity; and
 falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out.
 act 1:19 and it became known to all those dwelling in jerusalem; so that field
 is called in their own language, akel dama, that is, field of blood.)
 act 1:20 "for it is written in the book of psalms: 'let his dwelling place be
 desolate, and let no one live in it'; and, 'let another take his office.'
  
 notice that in verse 16, the word "iniquity" is not used.  rather, it states
 that judas "became a guide to those who arrested jesus".
 but the writer did not stop there...vs. 17, "for he was numbered with us and
 obtained a part in this ministry."  what part did judas play in their ministry?
          ^^^^^^
 joh 12:6 this he said, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a
 thief, and had the money box; and he used to take what was put in it.
 joh 13:29 for some thought, because judas had the money box, that jesus had
 said to him, "buy those things we need for the feast," or that he should give
 something to the poor.
  
 so, now we know what part judas played - he was a treasurer, per se.
 right after peter stated that judas played a part in this ministry (treasurer,
 according to john), then luke adds the parenthetical explanation of "wages of
 iniquity" - money that should have been put into the ministry, but was stolen
 by judas to purchase a field.  i believe this is a better exegetical
 explanation of what the "wages of iniquity" are.  what do you think, dave?
  
 db...
 "now since i have given you clear answers (and even references), perhaps you
 could unequivocally state what type of inerrantist you are (instead of asking
 me what type i think you are, as you did to mr joslin)."
  
 my reply...
 i will gladly admit that i am a complete inerrantist, although i do not have
 that big a problem with the limited inerrancy view.
