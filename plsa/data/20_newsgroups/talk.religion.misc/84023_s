 like most religions, the doctrine has good and bad in it.  i would 
 certainly reject the current implementations of the doctrine.

 :no.  the above is a classic example of taking a scripture out of context.
 :it's taken from luke 22:36.  but note vs 37; "for i tell you that this
 :which is written must be accomplished in me, namely, 'and he will be reckoned
 :with lawless ones'...".  he then stated that two swords were enough
 :for the group to carry to be counted as lawless.  
 
 so having more than the politically correct number of weapons was
 cause to be arresed and killed even then, huh?
 
 :jesus' overiding message was one of peace (turn other cheek; live by 
 :sword die by sword; etc).
 
 yes, of course, as in matthew 10:34-35 "do not suppose that i have come to 
 bring peace to the earth; it is not peace i have come to bring but a sword..."
