 let's start with the name "rosicrucian". i took me a long time to come
 to the conclusion that there is a difference between a *member* of a
 "rosicrucian" body and being *a* rosicrucian. so when you say that you met
 some 'rosicrucians' you mean "members of a group that calls themselves
 rosicrucian". at least that is what your observation suggests :-)
 
 
 response:
 
 this makes much sense to me.  this is also true of most religions.
 there is a difference between being a *member* of a group of people
 who call themselves 'hindus' or 'christians' or 'pagans' and actually
 *being* any of these.  the social groups tend to make very important
 requirements about not belonging to other 'religions'.  i find that
 the ideal described by the holy texts of most religions can be
 interpreted in very similar ways so that one could presume that
 'mysticism' is the core of every religion and huxley's 'perennial
 philosophy' is the great secret core of all mystical trads. :>
 
 
 tony:
 
 i'd prefer if you would have stated up front that it was the lectorium
 rosicrucianum, only because they may be confused, by some readers of this
 newsgroup, with the rosicrucian order amorc based (the usa jurisdiction) in
 san jose, ca; this being the rc org with the most members (last time i
 looked). of course, "most members" does not *necessarily* mean "best".
 
 
 response:
 
 certainly true.  i didn't know there were any groups which called themselves
 'rosicrucians' that didn't associate with amorc.  sure, i've heard all the
 hubbub about the golden dawn and rosae crucis in relation to all these
 western esoteric groups, but hadn't heard about other 'rosicrucians'.
 i'll admit my bias.  i live in san jose. :>
 
 
 tony:
 
 "you'll have to trust me" when i tell you that if that
 lecture/class/whatever had been presented by amorc, it is unlikely that you
 would have had the same impression, i.e., you'd probably have had a
 positive impression more likely than a negative one, imho. 
 
 
 response:
 
 this may be slightly off.  i've met some of these rosicrucians and have
 a couple friends in amorc.  the stories i've heard and the slight contact
 i've had with them does not give me the hope that i'd be received with
 any kind of warm welcome.  i still like to think that most people who
 are involved with stratified relationships (monogamy, religion, etc.)
 are in deep pain and hope to heal it within such a 'cast'.
 
 
 tony:
 
      
 it is curious to know that 3 other rc 'orders' (in the usa) claim to be *non-
 sectarian*.
 
 
 response:
 
 i'd like to know at least the addresses of the 'other orders' which call 
 themselves 'rosicrucians' and especially those which are 'nonsectarian'.
 is this 'nonsectarian' like the masons, who require that a member 'believe
 in god by his/her definition'?
 
      
      
 tony:
 
 i don't see nothing *fundamentally* wrong with "us containing
 something divine"... and yes i don't like phrases like "eternal bliss"
 either! :-)
 
 
 response:
 
 let alone us *being* something divine. ;>
 
 
 tony:
 
 btw, i have read the intro letters of the lrc which they will mail you free
 of charge.
 
 
 response:
 
 addresses, phone numbers of groups?  i'm into networking.  thanks.
