 for the times when i'm interested in the truth, i do.

 this strikes me as rather obvious. what is your point about this,

 huh? of course i intend that it works. but the fact that i want it
 to work, and want to use a procedure that will show that it works,
 has no bearing on the logical standing of the procedure that
 i choose (empiricism.)
 
 i don't see how this is any kind of problem, kevin.
