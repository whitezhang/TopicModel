 i'm curious about this statement, is it a known understanding amongst
 christian believers that people who don't understand the christian
 doctrines are enjoying this state? i come from a background with 
 a heavy christian teaching (lutheran church), and consider myself
 knowledgeable with the basic understandings of christianity. at the 
 same time i'm *not* proud of things i don't understand or know of at
 this point of time. ignorance is not bliss!
 
 cheers,
 kent
