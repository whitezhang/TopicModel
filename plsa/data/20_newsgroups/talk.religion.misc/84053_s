 no, this is far from clear.  we only have the word of the fbi spokepeople that
 a survivor made this claim.  we have the contradictory word of the lawyers who
 spoke with the survivors individually that all of them agreed that they did
 not have a suicide pact and did not intentionally start the fire.  in the absense
 of any more evidence, i don't see how we can decide who to believe.
 furthermore, its quite possible that there was no general suicide pact and that
 some small inner circle took it upon themselves to kill everyone else.
 with the state of the area now, we may never know what happened.

 again, we have only the word of the fbi on this claim.  the lawyers who
 have also talked to the survors deny that any of them are making that claim.

 i will agree on your assessment as to the relative probabilities.  its more likely
 that the bd's started the fire than did the fbi.  but there is currently no
 way to decide what actually happened based on the publically available evidence
 (which is nearly none).

    d.   the fire was an started accidentally by the bds.  i am truely amazed that
         i have heard (or read) of no one suggesting this possibility.
         with all the tear gas and the lack of electical power in the compound and
         the adults wearing gas masks, it had to have been chaotic inside.
         i can easily image someone leaving a lamp too close to something or
         accidentally dropping a lamp or knocking one over.  with the winds, it
         would have quickly gotten out of control.

    no, i think that d is also quite reasonable.  i personally can't really
 asses any relative probablities to either of these 3 probabilities although if
 forced to bet on the issue, i would probably take an accident (either fbi or
 bd) over intential setting of the fire).
 
    i would also like to add a comment related to the reports that bodies recovered
 had gunshot wounds.  the coroner was on the today show this morning and categorically
 denied that they've reach any such conclusions.  he pointed out that under intense
 heat, sufficient pressure builds up in the head that can cause it to explode and
 that this can look very much like a massive gunshot wound to the head which is
 quite consisted with te reports i've read and heard.
 
    in short, there's been almost no evidence corroborating any of the many
 scenarios as to what happened on monday.  we should remain skeptical until
 more information is available.
