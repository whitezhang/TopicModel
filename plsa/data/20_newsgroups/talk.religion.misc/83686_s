 and i maintain:
 
 some people do not want to enter into the light and the knowledge that
 they alone are their own masters, because they fear it; they are too
 afraid of having to face the world on their own terms.  and so, by
 their own choice, they will remain in darkness, sort of like bugs
 under a rock.  however, some people, but not many, will not like the
 darkness.  sometimes it gets too cold and too dark to be comfortable.
 these people will crawl out from under the rock, and, although blinded
 at first, will get accustomed to the light and enjoy its warmth.  and,
 after a while, now that they can see things for what they really are,
 they will also see the heights which they can reach, and the places
 they can go, and they will learn to choose their own paths through the
 world, and they will learn from their mistakes and revel in their
 successes.
 
 they will see that there is much much more to the world than just the
 narrow experiences under the rock.  they will discover that life under
 a rock was incredibly yucky, and that life on their own terms is great
 -- so great that they will want to tell everyone else about it.
 
 do you see my point?  i think you're the one under the rock, and i'm
 getting a great tan out here in the sunlight.  my life has improved
 immesurably since i abandoned theism -- come and join me!  it will be
 a difficult trip at first, until you build up your muscles for the
 long hike, but it's well worth it!

 look, you just practically equated odin and zeus?  they're as much
 different as your god is from them...
 
 don't you see?  i'm not going to accept anything that i can't witness
 with my own eyes or experience with my own senses, especially not
 something as mega-powerful as what you're trying to get me to accept.
 surely if you believe in it this strongly, you must have a good
 *reason* to, don't you?
 
 >withough checking his own
 >presumption, he thinks hell is the equivalent of non-existence.
 
 when did i say that?  i say that i would rather cease existing instead
 of being subject to the whims of a deity, but that if the deity
 decided to toss me into the fiery pits because of who i am, then so be it.

 nope -- most people are christian.  most people are fond of feeling
 that they are imperfect, of believing that the world is an undesirable
 place, of reciting magical mystical prayers to make the world nice and
 holy again, of doing just as their priests tell them, like good little
 sheep.  you enjoy darkness, and you're proud of it.
 
 you may know the bible well -- but have you read any of the koran?  or
 zen writings?  or hare krishna literature?  if you haven't, then how
 can you say you have an open mind?
 
 >sin is fun!  let's
 >admit it.  but a life of sin leads to trouble and death in this
 >life, and hell in the next.
 
 nope.  you make decisions, enjoy your successes, and accept your
 failures; then you die.  if you are content with the life you've led
 as you reflect back on it in your final moments, then you've led a
 good life.
 
 >come out from under the rock.  
 
 please do.

 i'm sorry, i don't feel that sacrificing jesus was something any god
 i'd worship would do, unless the sacrifice was only temporary, in
 which case it's not really all that important.
 
 forget the bible for a minute.  forget quoting verses, forget about
 who said what about this or that.  *show me.*  picture just you and me
 and a wide open hilltop, and convince me that you're right.
