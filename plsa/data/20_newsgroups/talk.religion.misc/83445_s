   lev 17:11: for the life of the flesh is in the blood, and i have given
   it to you upon the altar to make atonement for your souls; for it is
   the blood that makes atonement for the soul.
 
 the old testament was very big on the "eye for an eye" business.  it
 makes sense that leviticus would support physical injury to "repay"
 moral wrongdoing.
 
 i know about sanctification.  i've been taught all about it in sunday
 school, catechism class, and theology classes.  but even after all
 that, i still can't accept it.  maybe i'm still not understanding it,
 or maybe i'm just understanding it all too well.
 
 from the bottom of my heart i know that the punishment of an innocent
 man is wrong.  i've tried repeatedly over the course of several years
 to accept it, but i just can't.  if this means that i can't accept the
 premise that a god who would allow this is 'perfectly good', then so
 be it.

 if you can explain to me why the death of jesus was a *good* thing,
 then i would be very glad to hear it, and you might even convert me.
 be warned, however, that i've heard all the most common arguments
 before, and they just don't convince me.
