 if jesus never taught the concept of the trinity, how do you deal with the 
 following:   
 
    mat 28 18 then jesus came to them and said, "all authority in heaven
    and on earth has been given to me.
 
    mat 28 19 therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing
    them in¹ the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit,
 
    mat 28 20 and teaching them to obey everything i have commanded you.
    and surely i am with you always, to the very end of the age." 
 
 also jesus speaking:
 
    act 1 5 for john baptized with¹ water, but in a few days you will
    be baptized with the holy spirit."
 
 i believe that you may have overlooked some key verses, that are crucial to
 the christian faith.
