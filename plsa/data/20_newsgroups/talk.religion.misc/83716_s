    see, this is what really bugs me about this whole incident, and
    also about usenet:  here we are almost two months after the original
    raid, a raid witnessed by several members of the press, and there is 
    still no agreement about the basic facts.  riggs, here, and others,
    are claiming that the bd's shot first, while others on the net claim
    that the feds did, in the form of concussion grenades.  
 
    i suggest that before any of you make any claims about who shot 
    first, you document your claim with actual evidence, and not just
    foaf or "he said / she said".     otherwise don't use words like
    "fact" above - it just makes you all look stupid.
