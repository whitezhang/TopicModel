 yes, but tell me how you think your question answers my question. if
 the bds didn't know immediately that they were dealing with feds
 (uniform apparel, insignia), they must have figured it out in pretty
 short order. why did they keep fighting? they seemed awfully ready
 for having been attacked "without warning".
