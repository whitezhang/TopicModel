 to the degree that relativism is a more accurate decription of the
 truth than is objectivism, it provides more power and ability to
 control events.
 
 assuming, for the moment, that morals _are_ relative, then two
 relativists can recognize that neither has a lock on the absolute
 truth and they can proceed to negotiate a workable compromise that
 produces the desired results.
 
 assuming that there is an absolute morality, two disagreeing 
 objectivists can either be both wrong or just one of them right; there
 is no room for compromise.  once you beleive in absolute morals,
 you must accept that you are amoral or that everyone who disagrees
 with you is amoral.
 
 given a choice between a peaceful compromise or endless contention,
 i'd say that compromise seems to be "better".
