 there's another point to be made. those who have been inside burning
 houses know that if they want to stay alive, it's better to run out
 from the building. we had one case where an fbi agent *had to 
 drag out a women* from the burning house, she run back in when
 she saw the forces arriving. it is a good indication of the fanatical
 mind that the followers had -- including having they children burned
 instead of saving these innocent victims of the instance.
