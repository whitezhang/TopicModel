 are you serious?!!!  here's an exercise next time you are in the barnyard. 
 take *your* model and hold it directly above a fresh cowpie.  then release the
 model.  you will observe that on its own *your* model will assume a trajectory
 earthward and come to rest exactly where it belongs.  watch out for splatters,
 particularly if you are wearing shorts when you perform this experiment.
