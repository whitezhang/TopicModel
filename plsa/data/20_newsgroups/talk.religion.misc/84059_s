 (1) you have no evidence that david koresh or his followers were
 "packing" that heavy weaponry with any intent to use for other that
 recreational and self-defense purposes.
 
 (2) your statement that "the public also has rights" is correct only is
 parsed as "the individuals who comprise the public also have rights."
 there is no separate rights-bearing entity known as "the public".
 
 (3) since the "rights of the public" of which you spoke are in fact only
 rights of individuals, the statement that the rights of the public
 should be placed above the rights of the individual has no meaning.
 
 (4) you have artificially created an illusionary conflict of
 individuals' rights when you speak of "my right to rape your daughter."
 no person has the right to rape another person, therefore there is no
 conflict.
 
 (5) how do you define "society?"  do you hold that this "society" is a
 rights-bearing entity which is separate from any individual people?  how
 do you define a "threat to society?"  to what extent do you believe that
 a person loses his rights when he is declared (by whom?) to be such a
 threat?
