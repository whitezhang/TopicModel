 	hah!  i have it on the very *best* authority (mine) that koresh is
 whooping it up in a time-share condo in dallas with elvis, jfk, and (of course)
 j.r. "bob" dobbs, who also owns the place and everything else in texas.
 	look for "koresh" sightings in the weekly world news and national
 enquirer in the coming months.
