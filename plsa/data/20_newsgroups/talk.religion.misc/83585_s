 these laws written for the israelites, god's chosen people whom god had
 expressly set apart from the rest of the world.  the israelites were a
 direct witness to god's existence.  to disobey god after knowing that god
 is real would be an outright denial of god and therefore immediately punishable.
 remember, these laws were written for a different time and applied only to 
 god's chosen people.  but jesus has changed all of that.  we are living in the
 age of grace.  sin is no longer immediately punishable by death.  there is
 repentance and there is salvation through our lord jesus christ.  and not just
 for a few chosen people.  salvation is available to everyone, jew and gentile
 alike.
 
 god be with you,
