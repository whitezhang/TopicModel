    the founding fathers of the us were hardly great on religious freedoms. at
    least one history i have read formed the opinion that they left for the
    us not to practice religious freedom but to practice religious intolerance.
 
 sigh, see what our school systems are producing?  total confusion!
 the original english settlers were, probably, the most intolerant lot
 of people to ever assemble.  however, the founding fathers
 (washington, jefferson, madison, etc.), practically made it their
 life's work to ensure that religious intolerance would not destroy
 their great experiment... a democratic republic.
 
 i strongly suggest that those interested get some of jefferson's and
 madison's writings. particularly good is madison's "(something)and
 remonstrance", [yea, i'm litterate and have functioning memory cells
 :-( ].  imho, jefferson and madison were the two greatest american's
 who ever lived. although both were products of their time (jefferson
 was a slave owner), they were able to see more clearly than their
 contemporaries, and for that matter, more clearly than most modern
 politicians. their prose is the epitome of eloquence. i don't know
 about y'all, but reading the declaration of independence give me
 mental goosebumps. (for those who have never read it, i am appending a
 copy of it.)

 in congress, july 4, 1776
 
 the unanimous declaration of the thirteen united states of america,
 
 when in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one
 people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with
 another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and
 equal station to which the laws of nature and of nature's god entitle
 them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they
 should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.
 
 we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created
 equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable
 rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of
 happiness.  that to secure these rights, governments are instituted
 among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the
 governed.  that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of
 these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it,
 and to institute new government, laying its foundation on such
 principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall
 seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness.  prudence,
 indeed, will dictate that governments long established should not be
 changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience
 hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are
 sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which
 they are accustomed.  but when a long train of abuses and usurpations,
 pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them
 under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to
 throw off such government, and to provide new guards for their future
 security.
 
 such has been the patient sufferance of these colonies; and such is
 now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former systems
 of government.  the history of the present king of great britain is a
 history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct
 object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over these states.  to
 prove this, let facts be submitted to a candid world.
 
 he has refused his assent to laws, the most wholesome and necessary
 for the public good.
 
 he has forbidden his governors to pass laws of immediate and pressing
 importance, unless suspended in their operation till his assent should
 be obtained, and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend
 to them.
 
 he has refused to pass other laws for the accommodation of large
 districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of
 representation in the legislature, a right inestimable to them and
 formidable to tyrants only.
 
 he has called together legislative bodies at places unusual,
 uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public
 records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with
 his measures.
 
 he has dissolved representative houses repeatedly, for opposing with
 manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.
 
 he has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause
 others to be elected; whereby the legislative powers, incapable of
 annihilation, have returned to the people at large for their exercise;
 the state remaining in the meantime exposed to all the dangers of
 invasion from without, and convulsions within.
 
 he has endeavoured to prevent the population of these states; for that
 purpose obstructing the laws for naturalization of foreigners;
 refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and
 raising the conditions of new appropriations of lands.
 
 he has obstructed the administration of justice, by refusing his
 assent to laws for establishing judiciary powers.
 
 he has made judges dependent on his will alone, for the tenure of
 their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.
 
 he has erected a multitude of new offices, and sent hither swarms of
 officers to harass our people, and eat out their substance.
 
 he has kept among us, in times of peace, standing armies, without the
 consent of our legislatures.
 
 he has affected to render the military independent of and superior to
 the civil power.
 
 he has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to
 our constitution and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his assent to
 their acts of pretended legislation:
 for quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:
 for protecting them by a mock trial from punishment for any murders
     which they should commit on the inhabitants of these states:
 for cutting off our trade with all parts of the world:
 for imposing taxes on us without our consent:
 for depriving us in many cases of the benefits of trial by jury:
 for transporting us beyond seas to be tried for pretended offences:
 for abolishing the free system of english laws in a neighbouring
     province, establishing therein an arbitrary government, and
     enlarging its boundaries so as to render it at once an example
     and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into
     these colonies:
 for taking away our charters, abolishing our most valuable laws and
     altering fundamentally the forms of our governments:
 for suspending our own legislatures, and declaring themselves invested
     with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.
 
 he has abdicated government here by declaring us out of his protection
 and waging war against us.
 
 he has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns, and
 destroyed the lives of our people.
 
 he is at this time transporting large armies of foreign mercenaries to
 complete the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun
 with circumstances of cruelty and perfidy scarcely paralleled in the
 most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the head of a civilized
 nation.
 
 he has constrained our fellow citizens taken captive on the high seas
 to bear arms against their country, to become the executioners of
 their friends and brethren, or to fall themselves by their hands.
 
 he has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured
 to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless indian
 savages, whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction
 of all ages, sexes and conditions.
 
 in every stage of these oppressions we have petitioned for redress in
 the most humble terms.  our repeated petitions have been answered only
 by repeated injury.  a prince, whose character is thus marked by every
 act which may define a tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free
 people.
 
 nor have we been wanting in attentions to our british brethren.
 we have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature
     to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us.
 we have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and
     settlement here.
 we have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity,
     and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow
     these usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connections
     and correspondence. they too have been deaf to the voice of justice 
     and of consanguinity.
 we must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our
     separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, enemies 
     in war, in peace friends.
 
 we, therefore, the representatives of the united states of america, in
 general congress, assembled, appealing to the supreme judge of the
 world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the name, and by the
 authority of the good people of these colonies, solemnly publish and
 declare.  that these united colonies are, and of right ought to be
 free and independent states; that they are absolved from all
 allegiance to the british crown, and that all political connection
 between them and the state of great britain is and ought to be totally
 dissolved; and that as free and independent states, they have full
 power to levy war, conclude peace, contract alliances, establish
 commerce, and to do all other acts and things which independent states
 may of right do.  and for the support of this declaration, with a firm
 reliance on the protection of divine providence, we mutually pledge to
 each other our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor.
