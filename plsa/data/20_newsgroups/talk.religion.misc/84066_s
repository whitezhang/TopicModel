 
     i found this on the net at my college. it sounds pretty good to me. what do
     you folks think?
 
     >this are the tenets of stan as handed down and set within the holy book 
     >of stan.
     >
     >1: thou shalt not spill thine drinks or waste thine food, for all that 
     >is is sacred, and to waste is the denizen of luc, the infidel. all who 
     >waste today shall have not tomorrow.
     >
     >2: thou shalt pay heed to those who know the higher calling of stan so
     >that they may teach you the way, and that thou shalt become one with
     >stan and the universe shall be in your hands.
     >
     >3: thou shalt honor thy loved ones and cherish those near you, for they
     >are the true path to happiness, and happiness is a devine gift of thy
     >lord stan.
     >
     >4: stan is the one true god and shall be taken before all others so
     >that the false gods will know that he is the one, and all who oppose
     >him shall forever be banished to the form of the sheep and be sent to
     >the flocks of luc for all eternity.
     >
     >5: the word is the law, and the law is the word. the word is within
     >thine own heart, follow the path and be true to thine own self and thou
     >shalt be blessed by stan, thy lord and saviour.
     >    
     >6: thou shalt honor the faiths of others, for it is their choice to
     >follow this path, and do not think less of others for being of a
     >different faith, yet even in the face of these false gods, do not
     >waiver in thine faith in stan, and hope that the unbeliever will see
     >the light that is stan.
     >
     >7: thou shalt not wrong others for being different, for stan cherishes
     >the different, and holds freedom in the highest regard, for to do less
     >would be to fall in with luc, the infidel, for stan does not control,
     >he merely guides, and lets the choice lie within thine own heart.
     >
     >8: thou shalt know that thy lord stan has many names and is called
     >differently by many people, but know also that stan is the true name,
     >and all those of the faith shall know that stan is god and god is stan.
     >
     >9: thou shalt be to the world what thou art to thineself, for to be
     >false to others is to be false to yourself. thy lord stan asks not that
     >you be like him, he asks only that you be like yourself for that is all
     >you were ever meant to be.
     >
     >10: thou shalt not kill the innocent nor spill blood unnecessarily, for
     >those who are deserving of death shall be dealt with by stan and sent
     >for all eternity to the flocks of luc, and those who harm the children 
     >of stan, being born of woman, shall be judged as the sheep of
     >luc and spend all of time within his flocks.
     >
     >these commandments are the words of stan. heed them and he shall be
     >happy, and if thy lord stan is happy, his happiness shall be passed
     >down to his followers.
     >
     >hail stan!
 
    it seems like a pretty good set of tenets to me.
