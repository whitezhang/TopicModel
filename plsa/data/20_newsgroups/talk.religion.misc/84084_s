 well, where is he?  another false messiah shot down in flames.
 
 matthew 24:4
    "watch out that no one deceives you.  for many will come in my
     name, claiming, 'i am the christ', and will deceive many."
 
 matthew 24:23
    "at that time if anyone says to you, 'look, here is the christ!'
     or 'there he is!' do not believe it.  for false christs and 
     false prophets will appear and perform great signs and miracles
     to deceive even the elect - if that were possible.  see, i have
     told you ahead of time."
 
 do we listen?  sadly, not all of us do.
 
 peace be with you, and condolences to the families of those lost at
 waco.
