 overlooking entirely that there is nothing to prevent anyone from
 taking the bus across the river to buy guns.  an utterly worthless
 statistic.

 as it should be.  they have a homicide rate that is a couple of orders
 of magnitude lower then this country's (as does almost everyone else
 in the world).  but i suppose that it's too unreasonable to suppose
 that a lower availability of handguns has anything to do with that fact.

 right.  remember those riots a while back?  remember what they were
 about?  nope, we have nothing to fear from the us government (unlike
 those canadians living under the terribly oppressive regime up north).

 britain basically homogeneous?!?  in comparison to the us?!?
