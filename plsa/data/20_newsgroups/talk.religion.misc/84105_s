 i'm not sure what you mean by 'saving face' unless you are confusing
 the fbi with the batf who are the ones who were in charge of the
 original search warrant.

 independant negotiators? what was there to negotiate? any sort of plea
 bargin has to be brought to the court, the negotiators can't negotiate
 charges or sentences. fbi negotitators did make a deal for the
 dividians to come out. koresh showed he was not negotiating in good
 faith and there is no reason to believe independent negotiators
 would have done any better.
