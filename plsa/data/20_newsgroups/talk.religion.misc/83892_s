      no.
      i really don't. honest.
 
      the nicene creed, as i mentioned above, is a brief statement of
      beliefs that are derived from scripture. that this certain list
      did not exist earlier does not indicate that the beliefs summarized 
      in in did not exist before the formula was derived.
