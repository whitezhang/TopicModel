 unfortunately, i think you've got it figured pretty well.  i also ask
 myself the question "why did they plan for so many months.  why was
 this so important to them?  what was the government really up to?
 why did they seal the warrant?  were they after koresh or were they after      
 the first and second amendments, among others?
