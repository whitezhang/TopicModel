 i assume you have evidence that he was responsible for the deaths?

 once again, where's your proof? suicide is considered a sin by branch
 davidians.  also, koresh said over and over again that he was not going to
 commit suicide.  furthermore, all the cult experts said that he was not
 suicidal.  david thibedeau (sp?), one of the cult members, said that the fire
 was started when one of the tanks spraying the tear gas into the facilities
 knocked over a lantern.

 i'd like to point out that the bible says "do not commit murder." the nkj
 translation mistranslates.  self-defense was never considered murder.  the
 reason why they were stockpiling weapons is because they were afraid the
 government would try something.  their fears were obviously well founded.
