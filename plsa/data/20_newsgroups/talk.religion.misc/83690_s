 another dodge.  oh well.  i'm no match for your amazing repertoire
 of red herrings and smoke screens.  
 
 you asked for an apology.  i'm not going to apologize for pointing out
 that your straw-man argument was a straw-man argument.  nor for saying
 that your list of "bible contradictions" shows such low standards of
 scholarship that it should be an embarrassment to anti-inerrantists,
 just as josh mcdowell should be an embarrassment to the fundies.  nor
 for objecting various times to your taking quotes out of context.  nor
 for pointing out that "they do it too" is not an excuse. nor for calling
 your red herrings and smoke screens what they are.
 
 i'm still not sure why you think i'm a hypocrite.  it's true that i
 haven't responded to any of robert weiss' articles, which may be due in
 part to the fact that i almost never read his articles.  but i have
 responded to both you and frank decenso (a fundie/inerrantist.)  both
 you and frank have taken quotes out of context, and i've objected to
 both of you doing so.  i've criticized bad arguments both when they
 were yours and i agreed with the conclusion (that the bible is not
 inerrant), and when they were frank's and i disagreed with the
 conclusion.  i've criticized both you and frank for evading questions,
 and for trying to "explain me away" without addressing the objections
 i raise (you by accusing me of being hypocritical and irrational, frank
 by accusing me of being motivated by a desire to attack the bible.) i
 don't see that any of this is hypocritical, nor do i apologize for it.
 
 i do apologize, however, for having offended you in any other way.
 
 happy now?
