 petri and mathew,
 
 your discusion on the "reality" of atoms is interesting, but it
 would seem that you are verging on the question "is anything real":
 that is, since observation is not 100% reliable, how can we say
 that anything is "real".  i don't think this was the intention
 of the original question, since you now define-out the word
 "real" so that nothing can meet its criteria.
 just a thought.

 ps  rainbows and shadows are "real": they are not objects, they
 are phenomenon.  an interesting question would be if atoms
 are objects (classical) or phenomenon (neo-quantum) or what?
