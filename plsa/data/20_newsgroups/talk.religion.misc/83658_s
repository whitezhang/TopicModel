 i would hardly consider the bd's to be christian.  they were acting in
 direct contradiction to scripture.  jesus' second coming is something
 that everyone will know of.  jesus also predicted that there will be
 false messiahs who will use his name.  his prophecy has been fulfilled.

 me too.  i have already given my life to god.  if god tells me to lay
 down my life, it will be to save another life.

 do you judge all christians by the acts of those who would call
 themselves christian and yet are not?  the bd's contradicted scripture
 in their actions.  they were not christian.  simple as that.  perhaps
 you have read too much into what the media has portrayed.  ask any
 true-believing christian and you will find that they will deny any
 association with the bd's.  even the 7th day adventists have denied any
 further ties with this cult, which was what they were.
 
 do you judge all muslims by the acts committed by saddam hussein, a 
 supposedly devout muslim?  i don't.  saddam is just a dictator using
 the religious beliefs of his people to further his own ends.
 
 god be with you,
