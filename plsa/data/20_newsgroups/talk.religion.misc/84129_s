 it sounds like you're modifying your definition of christian to anyone
 who *strives* to follow the teachings of christ. do i read you
 correctly? and just what constitutes *strive*? did jesus say this and
 define just what "striving" means? can you give an example of striving 
 that is insufficient to qualify one as a christian and thus condemns one 
 to eternal damnation in fiery torture? do you self-proclaim yourself a
 christian and if so on what basis?
