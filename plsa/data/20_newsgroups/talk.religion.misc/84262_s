 i am wondering about the accident of koresh. i have heard different 
 explanations.
 without any explanation about your opinions and believes,
  please kindly tell me:
 
      1)- what was koresh talking about?. (or  what was his message)
      2)- what was the main reason that government went in war with
              koresh?
 (some say that due to tax payment, ....)
 
 thanks in advance for your historical explanation.
