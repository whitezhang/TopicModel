 well, if our observer x is as likely to be in a's position as b's, and if he
 agrees that both a and b are making appropriate observations and inferences
 regarding the situation, then i would expect him to conclude that there is no
 right answer.  hopefully there would be some other factor which would allow
 him to make some judgement regarding which answer to accept.
 
 if, on the other hand, he disagrees with the principles of either a or b, i
 suspect he would make a decision in favour of the other one.
 
 it is unfortunately the case that not all moral arguments have answers from
 all perspectives.  for instance, i am completely unable to come to any
 conclusion regarding whether abortion should be allowed or not, from my
 perspective.  in an ideal world, all living things would have a right to
 life; but in an ideal world, women would have the absolute right to do what
 they like with their own bodies.  clearly there is no way to resolve in
 favour of both these principles.  therefore i agree with the compromise
 solution of allowing abortion up to a certain time after conception, and
 deciding on the time based on various (sometimes ill-defined) criteria.  this
 is also a sensible move, i think, because it lets people make their own
 decisions (within reason).  and for what it's worth, i am reasonably happy
 with current uk abortion law.
 
 similarly, the situation in what's left of yugoslavia is a horrible mess, and
 i really can't see my way to any sort of conclusion.  there, i don't even
 know enough to imagine what sort of compromise one might manage.
