 that happens to be a subjective example that the people of the
 us would happen to agree on.  continue to move the price up; 
 at some point a few people would accept then more then more until 
 probably all would accept at a high enough number.
 
 endpoints of a subjective scale are not the given homes of 
 objective viewpoints.
