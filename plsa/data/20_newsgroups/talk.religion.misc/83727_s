 sorry, the san jose based rosicrucian order is called a.m.o.r.c, 
 i don't remember for the time being what the a.m. stand for
 but o.r.c is ordo rosae crucis, in other words latin for
 order of the rose cross. 
 
 
 response:
 
 yes, very true.  the entire title is 'the ancient and mystical order
  rosae crucis'.  they are located at 1342 naglee avenue, san jose,
 california, 95191-0001, usa.
 
 they are considered different and largely unrelated by a number of
 sources.  i've seen documentation which links them through the figure
 of h. spencer lewis.  lewis was apparently involved with reuss, who
 was the o.h.o. of ordo templi orientis for many years.  apparently it
 is also true that lewis had a charter to form an o.t.o. body and then
 created a.m.o.r.c. (as a subsidiary?  an interesting question).

 otherwise their headquarters in san jose has a pretty decent
 metaphysical bookstore, if any of you are interested in such books.
 and my son loves to run around in their egyptian museum.
 
 
 response:
 
 indeed, and diagonally across the street is another metaphysical
 book store called 'ram metaphysical', wherein i've purchased some
 wonderful works by crowley and others.  ram metaphysical books,
 1749 park ave., san jose, ca.  (408) 294-2651.
 
 
 invoke me under my stars.  love is the law, love under will.
