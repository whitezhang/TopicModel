 
     please excuse the length of this post, but for personal reasons, 
 i must go on at some length.

     perhaps it would be instructive to see what my original post had
 to say:

     i was extremely careful in this posting not to say anything which
 was not factual.  i made no judgement about hitching or the quality of 
 the quotation attributed to him.  i have not read any of the books 
 listed (although i did glimpse briefly at "earth magic", i saw nothing 
 that i would care to comment on).  it was solely in response to an
 inquiry by warren about hitching, and your assertion that he is a
 paleontologist.  i do not know whether he is or is not a paleontologist.
 i do not claim to know anything about him, except this listing of his
 publications.
 
     however, i get the decided impression that i am being included
 among the "branch atheists" on the basis of this post.  if that 
 impression is mistaken, please let me know.  otherwise, i should let
 you know that the implications are very offensive to me, and i 
 would certainly appreciate a clarification of your posting.
