 i think this is a weak argument.  the fact is, there are *two* references to
 jesus in _antiquities of the jews_, one of which has unquestionably at least
 been altered by christians.  origen wrote, in the third century, that
 josephus did not recognize jesus as the messiah, while the long passage
 says the opposite.  there is an arabic manuscript of _antiquities of the
 jews_ which contains a version of the passage which is much less gung-ho
 for jesus and may be authentic.
    there is no question that origen, in the third century, saw a reference
 to jesus in josephus.  there are no manuscripts of _antiquities_ which
 lack the references.
 
 it is possible that it was fabricated out of whole cloth and inserted, but
 i don't think it's very likely--nor do i think there is a consensus in
 the scholarly community that this is the case. (i know g.a. wells takes
 this position, but that's because he takes the very small minority view
 that jesus never existed.  and he is a professor of german, not of
 biblical history or new testament or anything directly relevant to
 the historicity of jesus.)
