 jesus did not say that he was the fulfillment of the law, and, unless
 i'm mistaken, heaven and earth have not yet passed away. am i mistaken?
 and, even assuming that one can just gloss over that portion of the word
 of jesus, do you really think that "all is accomplished?"
 
 >verse 19:  "whoever then annuls one of the least of these commandments,

 then why didn't jesus say "any jew who annuls ..." in v. 19? are you
 saying that all of jesus' recorded words mean nothing to gentiles? are
 you really saying that jesus only spoke for and to the jews? jesus
 didn't mention your name, does that mean he wasn't speaking to you? when
 you read the words of jesus, do you think he is speaking to someone
 other than you?

 you said above that jesus was the "fulfillment" of the law. are you
 saying that does not mean "doing away with the law"?

 gen3:15(jps) i will put enmity between you and the woman, and between

 strike at their heel.
 
 gen3:15(nrsv) i will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your
 offspring and hers; he will strike your head, and you will strike his
 heel."
 
 gen3:15(kjv) and i will put enmity between thee and the woman, and
 between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt
 bruise his heel.
 
 looks like your translation has taken a few liberties with the word?

 only "helping the jewish people?"

 you are using your interpretation of paul as an argument against the
 clear words of jesus?

 "re-expressed?" care to define that a bit better?
 
 >on the other hand, now that the law has fulfilled it's purpose and 
 
 what? are heaven and earth gone away? where did they go? is all
 accomplished, for example revelations? explain please.
 
 >christians relate to god through christ, not the law, it also makes

 >the lord's supper as a memorial to his sacrifice (i cor. 11:26), and
 >sunday as a day of worship commemorating his resurrection (matt 28:1ff,
 >acts 20:7)
 
 again, your interpretation of paul versus the clear word of jesus. do
 you see any problems here? when did heaven and earth go away? when was
 all accomplished?
