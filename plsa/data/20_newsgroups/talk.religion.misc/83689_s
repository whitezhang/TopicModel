 dr. tahir ijaz comments on esam abdel-rahem's statement:

 mr. jawad ali then comments on tahir ijaz's statement:

 the argument by jawad ali is funny, he writes:
 "the converse would be that the problem is that muslims dont consider
 ahmadies to be muslims"
 
 which is a wrong statement. in the light of dr. ijaz's statement, the
 above statement should be corrected:
 ".......................................is that (some) non-ahmadi muslims
 don't consider ahmadi-muslims as muslims"
 
 so, the problem does not get solved:-) who is a muslims and who is not?
 humans cannot decide. humans may not declare others faiths. its that 
 simple. i don't understand, why the mere use of the word "islam" is
 becomming such a big issue. i have seen numorous postings on the net
 on this subject, and all they say, "no, no, you cannot use islam as 
 the name of your newsgroup". ?? 
 
 i haven't seen a single posting stating what right do they have in declaring
 the name of other's faiths? who gives them this authority? quran? or
 hadith? or something else? i want to know this! 
 
 just a small reminder to all my muslim brothers, did _ever_ the 
 holy prophet of islam (muhammad pbuh), say to anyone who called
 himself a muslim:
 
 no, you are not a muslim ! ???????
 
 never! i challenge all my muslim brothers to produce a single 
 such evidence from the history of islam!
 
 hence, if the prophet muhammad could never do that to anyone, how
 could the muslims, mullahs or even governments of today do
 it to anyone. do you consider yourself above the holy prophet 
 muhammad (pbuh) ?? 
 
 
 sincerely,
 nabeel.
