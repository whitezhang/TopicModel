 hmm...are you a taoist?  imposing limits *does* do something useful...it gives
 you something to go beyond.

 i tend to be a bit critical of any stratification of taoism.  i especially
 tend to frown on any suggestion that "orthodoxy" or "classics" have any
 special place in tao.

 so rather than debate what "taoism *really* means" you are suggesting that
 we take someone else's word for it and work thusly?  i'd rather not, thank
 you.

 whereas you, of course, have a clear idea of what the word means?  can
 you tell the tao? :-)

 wonderful idea.

 only if you choose to define failure in that way.  or to define it at all.
