 my theory is that koresh was seriously wounded in the initial gunbattle
 and died on day 9 of the siege.  on day 11 of the siege he rose from the
 dead and periodically appeared to his followers and the fbi over the
 next 40 days.  living with someone who's risen from the dead isn't easy,
 as timmy baterman's father in *pet*sematary* could attest, so after 40
 days they did what baterman did--shot themselves and burned the place
 to the ground.
 
 consistent with the facts, isn't it?  did anyone actually *see* koresh
 between day 9 and day 11?
