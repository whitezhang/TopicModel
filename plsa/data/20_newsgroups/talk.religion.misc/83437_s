 i noticed this dead horse in your keywords line. is this the famous scarlet horse
 of babylon that the beast (that's 666 for you illuminatti) rides on in those
 wonderful mediaeval manuscripts. if so, i fear your announcement that the old
 girl is dead may be premature. i bet $20 on her to place in the 6th race at the
 downs last sunday, and she slid in a bad fifth. so she is not dead. she is just
 comatose. (like god that way, i suppose).
