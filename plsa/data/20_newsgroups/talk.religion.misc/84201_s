 	the word "released" is loaded:  until convicted in cxourt,
 	my children are my own.
 
 	when the feds use this type of loaded logic, you cannot win:
 		1)  we accuse you
 		2) we shoot a couple of your kids
 		3)  we blame you for those shots
 		4) we harrass you for 51 days
 		5) we tell you to come out or die
 		6) we gas you
 		7) you burn to death
 		8)  we blame you (prior to trial) for all of it
