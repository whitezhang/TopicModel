 if that was really what the fbi said, i'm extrelemy suspicious: they
 _knew_ the branch davidian was a very paranoid group. to say, "...or
 you will be gassed" would probably have been understood as _poison_
 gas, not tear gas. if the fbi made that remark, i'd say they were
 encouraging an extreme reaction.
