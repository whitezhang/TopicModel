 i think you are leaving out a great deal of other "value".  there is no
 rational reason to give an "abortionist" a "value" 10 million times that
 of a fetus.  (why not 10 billion, for instance...oh, but then you would
 loose on the deal.)
 
 instead we should look at what is *really* involved in each abortion.
 there is the loss of a human life, a life that would otherwise have
 eventually become a member of society.  that is certainly a non-zero
 value.  there is the physical and emotional suffering of a woman who
 finds herself with an unwanted pregnancy, and the greater suffering
 caused by the refusal of society to allow her to deal with it.  that
 woman is *already* a member of society.
 
 i argue that the cost of suffering of a *real* member of society is
 far greater than the loss of a *potential* future member of society.
 
 now, as for your "deal".  suppose you "pay" the value of all the suffering
 of every woman who *was* denied an abortion, or *would have been* denied
 an abortion, under your desired position.  and "we" will "pay" the value
 of all the potential future members of society that never became a part of
 it (or *would* not have been a part of it, under *our* desired position).
 
 think about it.
 
 of course, i expect you will object to my argument that suffering of
 on-going life is worse than loss of just-starting life.  if so, please
 put forth some rational argument for how the life of a (currently)
 non-sentient creature is somehow worth the suffering of a sentient being.
 (i figure if i ask enough places, and such an arguement exists, i should
 eventually see it.)
