 the observation that the tree of life would rotate clockwise in the
 northern hemisphere and counterclockwise in the southern probably doesn't
 give enough consideration to the feebleness of the coriolis force compared
 to, say, the phototropism of vegetation.  a much more likely explanation
 is the classic one: that the clockwise swastika is the sun-wheel, because
 the sun progresses across the sky that way.  (although that's not the
 historical way it happened; clocks were first made as little imitation
 images of the sun moving thru the heavens.  so it's more valid to talk of
 the clock going sunwise, but do the engineers listen to me?  of course
 not.)  anyway, there is still much uncertainty about whether the
 anti-swastika goes counter-sunwise because that represents evil, or
 because it is the sun's twin-opposite, the moonwheel.  the use of anti-sun
 to represent evil may be because humans are so strongly visually-oriented,
 but i'm not going to try to settle that one just now.
