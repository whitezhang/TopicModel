 i see the point on falsifying god as per the scientific method.  a question
 i've always wanted to ask is this: when scientists say that the second law
 does not apply to the earth they say it is because it is not a closed system, 
 i.e. there is energy coming in from an outside force -- namely, the sun.  is 
 the universe a closed or open system, and how could either be proven? if it is
 a closed system, have you been to the outside to look in?  if it is open, how 
 do you know?

 with new taxes and spending cuts we'll still have 310 billion dollar deficits.
