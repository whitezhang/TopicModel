 where does it say in the bible that christians are supposed to persecute
 jews?  isn't it love your enemies instead?  they may say they are "christian"
 but do their actions speak differently?  do you believe what everyone tells
 you?  i don't.  i came to believe in god by my own investigation and conclusions.
 and ultimately by my own choice.  salvation, however, was granted only through
 the grace of god.

 to be a christian is to model oneself after jesus christ as implied by the
 very name christian.  if you say you believe in your head but do not feel in
 your heart, what does that say of your belief?

 white supremists and neo-nazis are not any brand of christian.
 
 "if you hate your whom you can see then how can you love god whom you cannot
  see?"
 
 what does this belief entail?  believing in christ and having your sins
 forgiven in his name does not give a christian a free licence to sin.  to
 repent of a sin is to ask forgiveness of that sin and try not to do it
 again.  i am a christian, but if you lump me in with racists and accuse me
 of being such, then are you not pre-judging me?  btw, i am of chinese racial
 background and i know what it is to be part of a visible minority in this
 country.  i don't think that i would be favourably looked upon by these
 white supremist "christians" as you call them.
 
 anyone can say what they believe, but if they don't practice what they preach,
 then their belief is false.  do you concur?

 nazis and racists in general are the ones that come to my immediate attention.
 what i believe is that such people may be using the bible to mask their racial
 intolerance and bigotry.  they can do as they do and hide behind christianity
 but i tell you that jesus would have nothing to do with them.

 no arguement there.

 the only point i'm trying to make is that those who call themselves christian
 may not be christian.  i ask that you draw your own conclusions by what they
 do and what they say.  if they are not modelled after the example of jesus
 christ then they are not christian.  if they have not repented of their sins
 and accepted jesus christ as their personal lord and saviour then they are 
 not christian.  these are the only criteria to being a christian.
 
 may god be with you,
