 boy is this guy in for a shock when he hits the real world!  our tax rate 
 is incredibly high, higher than many european countries -- it is just
 packaged differently (income, social insecurity, medicare, payroll taxes,
 property taxes, sales taxes, fees, mandatory disability insurance, state, 
 federal, local, etc. etc. etc.).  other countries just haven't found as
 many ways to hide "revenue enhancers" as our clever american politicians.
 
 i hope you enjoy the $8k you actually get to spend from your first $25k
 job out of school, rob, you patriot you.

 liborgalism:
            thinking is irrelevant. integrity is irrelevant.
           free speech is irrelevant. private property is irrelevant.
                      conservativism is futile.
                       you will be assimilated.
