 i'm not expert on christianity, but i know a little about history
 and how the repeated instances of messianic figures (jesus was neither
 the first, last nor most serious of those pretenders) related
 to the history of the period.
 
 a messiah in those days was to bring salvation from the romans!
 he was supposed to reclaim israel and judaea, bring the israelites
 back from what is now iraq-persia-afghanistan, and do so
 not only by faith, but by real war.  any messianic pretender
 would tell his followers to get ready for war, since they
 were going to throw the romans out of judaea and free the
 israelites.
 
 for those interested, bar kochba's claim was taken far more
 seriously than jesus' among the jews.  they revolted and
 600,000 were slaughtered by the romans.  his claim was only
 rejected after his defeat, although for a short time he looked
 as though he would win.  they even got to mint coins before
 the romans triumphed.
 
 now how that has played into christianity is rather interesting
 given your use of the statement attributed to jesus.  did koresh
 figure he had to get rid of the us government to free israel?
 had he the foggiest notion of who are todays descendants of
 the israelites? (one hint, almost none of them are christians,
 look at the three countries listed above, they were their
 and jewish until at least the 10th century)
