 oops! quite right. i got so busy that i saved frank's last post back then,

 well, yes, maybe i am. i'm trying to have people buy and take on my opinions,
 thus causing said opinions to spread in time-honoured memetic virus mode until
 the world is a veritable paradise. so how about it, folks? as they say over
 here, you know it makes sense.
