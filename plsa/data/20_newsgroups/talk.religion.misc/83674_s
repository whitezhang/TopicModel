 no.  there are two problems here:
 
 (1) peter died two millenia ago.  the original letters he wrote have
 long since decayed into dust.  if he were alive today and i could
 question him, then this might lend credibility to your claims (but
 probably not much, because after all, i've heard people claim with all
 sincerity that they've spoken with elvis recently).  but after his
 death, peter's writings were transcribed by monks for centuries, and i
 find it hard to believe that one of them somewhere didn't decide to
 change the wording of something to make it (in his opinion) a little
 easier to understand.
 
 (2) even if peter did witness the miracles of jesus two millenia ago,
 that doesn't mean that your deity is what the bible says it is (god
 might just be satan, trying to convince everyone that he's a nice
 guy), or even that your deity is still alive and active in the world
 today.
 
 nice try, but it just isn't enough to convince me, especially since
 your wild claims about your deity seem to fly in the face of the way
 i've observed the world to work.  please find something more compelling.
