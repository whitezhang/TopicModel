   unfortunately, it's not that simple.  the kjv is preferred by the majority
 of fundamentalists (at least here).  the second part of your argument fails
 as well, since that statement can be used against any version (not just the
 kjv).

   i would not find this statement to be very useful since it is an appeal
 to authority and the opposition will just claim that their authorities are
 "better".  a second tact that local creationists have used is to reply "but
 those scholars are atheists and cannot be believed" (they will also use this
 phrase to describe any theologians that they don't agree with).

   the verse being discussed clearly claims that sympathetic magic works (i.e.
 placing stripped sticks in the cattle breeding grounds causes stripped and
 spotted calves to be born) and should be attacked on that basis (no biologist
 has ever observed this claimed correlation).
