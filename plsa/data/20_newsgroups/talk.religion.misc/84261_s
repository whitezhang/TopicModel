 so, it's _sometimes_ correct to say that morality is objective, or what?
 after all, i could hardly be wrong, without dragging in the o-word.
 for your part, when you say that relativism is true, that's just
 your opinion.  why do folk get so heated then, if a belief in relativism
 is merely a matter of taste?  (to be fair, _you_ have been very calm,
 i get the impression that's because you don't care about notions of
 objectivity in any flavour.  right?)
