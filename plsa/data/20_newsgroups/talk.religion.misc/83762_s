 "well, i'll know right away by the look in her eyes
 she's lost all illusions and she's worldly wise, and i know
 if i give her a listen, she's what i've been missing, what i've been missing
 i'll be lost in love and havin' some fun with my cynical girl
 who's got no use for the real world, i'm looking for a cynical girl"
