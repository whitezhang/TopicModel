 precisely.
 
 there's no objective medicine; some people get marvellous results from
 alternative therapy, others only respond to traditional medicine.
 
 there's no objective physics; einstein and bohr have told us that.
 
 there's no objective reality.  lsd should be sufficient to prove that.

 i consider it to be a useful fiction; an abstract ideal we can strive
 towards.  like an ideal gas or a light inextensible string, it doesn't
 actually exist; but we can talk about things as if they were like it, and not
 be too far wrong.
