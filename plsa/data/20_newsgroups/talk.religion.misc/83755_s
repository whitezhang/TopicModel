 pilgrim ... founding forgot the taxonomy for a mo.
 
 jefferson etc were pretty hot on religious freedom in part because they
 were freemasons. at the time freemasonry was bing pushed as a sort of
 alternative to christianity which was a little out of favour amongst
 the intellectuals because of the propensity for religious wars. on the
 continent the masons were pretty much a way of denying the pope's 
 authority.
 
 latter on it science came up with an alternative explanation for why
 the universe existed and the intellectual necessity of creating a
 creator lessened. if you don't have darwin though freemasonry is
 probably the next best explanation as to the creation of the earth.
