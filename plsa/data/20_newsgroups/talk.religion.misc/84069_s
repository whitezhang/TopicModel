 if you would like to understand better the sort of behavior
 that we saw in connection with the waco tragedy, i'd strongly
 recommend reading _when prophecy fails_, by leon festinger,
 henry riecken, and stanley schachter (available as a harper
 torchbook). it goes a long way towards explaining how a 
 belief system can be so strong as to withstand even overwhelming
 disconfirmatory evidence. at least, read the first chapter.
 interestingly, just as the branch davidians had roots in the
 seventh-day adventist movement, the sdas themselves had their
 roots in the millerite movement of the first half of the 19th
 century--a movement that expected the end of the world in 1843,
 was disappointed when it did not take place, and wound up as
 a church.
