 and what is "better?" better is a subjective value judgement.
 
 i tell you a lie, and as a result you give me all your millions of dollars
 of assets and move to india. from my perspective, falsehood was a 
 substantially "better" than telling the truth. (how do you think a
 log of gurus make a living?)
 
 i attack your country in war, kill everyone and take your rich
 natural resources. before i did this, i was living in poverty.
 looks to me like war was much "better" than peace.
 
 i see no need to go any further. once you address this little issue
 of "betterness" being non-relativistic we can continue.
