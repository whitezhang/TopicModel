 he is god.

 god granted you the gift of life whether you were sinner or saint.

 the scientist creates the living creature to examine it, poke and prod it and
 learn about its behaviour.  he will kill it if it becomes a threat.  for
 example, let's say the scientist creates a tyrannosaurus rex and it breaks
 free of its confines and starts devouring the population.  the scientist
 would not hesitate in killing it.
 
 god creates us to be his loving companions.  he knows whether we are true in 
 our love for him or not.  and he lets us know the consequences of rejecting him.
 god cannot abide by sin.  by rejecting god, a person becomes an enemy of god,
 one that must be killed by him.  note:  i say that god and god alone is
 worthy to be judge, jury and executioner.  we are not called to carry out
 such duties because we are not worthy.

 god is god.  who are we to question the creator?  if you doubt god's doing
 in certain situations, do you claim to know a better solution?  would you
 be playing the role of god?
