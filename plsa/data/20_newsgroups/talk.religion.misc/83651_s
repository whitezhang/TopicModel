 would you consider the word of an eye-witness (peter) to testify to the
 events surrounding jesus' life?
 
 
  2pe 1 16 ¶ we did not follow cleverly invented stories when we told you
  about the power and coming of our lord jesus christ, but we were 
  eyewitnesses of his majesty.
 
  2pe 1 17 for he received honor and glory from god the father when the
  voice came to him from the majestic glory, saying, "this is my son, whom 
  i love; with him i am well pleased."¹
 
  2pe 1 18 we ourselves heard this voice that came from heaven when we
  were with him on the sacred mountain.
 
  2pe 1 19 ¶ and we have the word of the prophets made more certain, and
  you will do well to pay attention to it, as to a light shining in a dark
  place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts.
 
 this is a documented testimony. perhaps further research on your part is
 warranted before making more statements. there is considerably more to study
 in peters' two books of testimony regarding the messiah. it is well worth 
 your time, mr. brian.
