 most of the key issues in the 284 line post to which i am following up are
 dealt with in the following post i made on talk.abortion yesterday,
 modified to correct the next to last paragraph.

 dean did not.  he called them "the great commission" but this is not
 descriptive of jesus's words in matt. 10:15.
 
 matt. 10:14, jerusalem bible translation:
 
 	"and if anyone does not welcome you or listen to what you have
 	to say, as you walk out of the house or town shake the dust
 	from your feet."
 
 matt. 10:15:
 
  	"i tell you solemnly, on the day of judgment it will not 
  	go as hard with the land of sodom and gomorrah as with 
  	that town."
 
 in the post to which dean is referring above, i said:
 
 "> the above is a good description of kaflowitz, who keeps harping on
  > shaking the dust off the feet but ignoring what christ said next."
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^                                ^^^^
 
 the highlighted words refer to matt 10:14 and 10:15 respectively.
 
 and dean countered:
 
 "actually, this comment of your's is a perfect example of what an
 intellectually dishonest little sparrowfart you are, since i
 specifically acknowledged the great commission and the entreaty
 to spread the word.  in fact, it is the combination of the two
 statements i was addressing, and not just the one, and for you to
 characterize that as "ignoring" the instruction to spread the
 word is a good example of what a dishonest little fellow you are."
 
 of course, matt 10:15 [quoted above] makes no mention of "instruction
 to spread the word."
 
 all these quotes btw are from:
 
 message-id: <1993apr13.121624.3400@cbnewsj.cb.att.com>
 
 >in which, at the end, he claims i did not answer a question
 >which i answered, and which he deleted (to get the chronology
 >right, he deleted the answer and then said i didn't answer).
 
 and i claim it correctly, because my question went:
 
 "do you, too, measure
 the goodness of a post by its entertainment value, and care not
 a whit for such mundane things as truth and falsehood?"
 
 and the closest dean came to an answer was:
 
 "peter, peter, peter.  you're just so stupid, pretentious, dull,
 and generally unworthy of the value you place on yourself that
 the sport is all there is."
 
 of course, this does not answer my question, which has to do with posts
 in general and not my posts in particular.  surely even dean knows this,
 yet he brazenly asserts otherwise, reinforcing his claim with an insult:
 
 "so i now restore the answer to your question
 that you deleted.  if you're still unable to figure it out, ask
 a nice kid at the local junior high to help you.  it really
 doesn't take much sophistication to understand."
 
 on top of which, i doubt that the "answer" is at all representative
 of dean's true frame of mind.  the insults you have seen quoted thus
 far are but a small sample of the stream that oozes out of dean's 
 mind throughout the 284-line post from which these quotes were taken.
 one wonders whether dean's mind is so warped as to find sport in all
 this.
 
 he even dredges up a falsified account of
 events that transpired earlier on another thread:
 
 "you made an ass of yourself by claiming that it
 				^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 was in the tradition of lent to make public announcements of
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 the "sins" of other individuals."
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 
 false.  i said it was the tradition to recall and atone for one's sins.
 that i made public announcements of the "sins" of others
 --"sins", btw, that were a matter of public record, documented in
 the posts of others-- is a different matter.
 
 many of the individuals involved are so nearly amoral that
 they do not see as sins what morally upright people see as sins, so
 i pointed some of them out.  and i expressly set up a whole thread,
 your turn, to let people point out my sins to me.
 
 dean again:
 
 "you made an ass of yourself
 by saying that my statement of the tradition of tzedukkah was
 somehow an attempt to "paint jews as plaster saints," thereby
 revealing your inability to understand the discussion as well
 as showing your dislike for people saying positive things
 about jews, and now you show your intellectual dishonesty by
 repeatedly ignoring the simple argument being made, and then
 claiming i am ignoring the very argument i acknowledge."
 
 actually, what happened was that dean made it seem like any jew
 who gave alms or did other acts of charity in public was a hypocrite
 according to jewish customs.  in doing so, he was caricaturing
 jewish customs as being almost impossibly demanding, as well as
 implicitly slandering all jews who make public their acts of charity.
 
 i went very easily on dean for this, giving him the benefit of
 the doubt in a post following my initial crack about "plaster saints", 
 suggesting that he had been merely careless in his wording.
 
 in an astonishing act of ingratitude, dean now serves up an incredibly
 distorted picture of what took place between us, and using it as
 the basis of one insult after another.
