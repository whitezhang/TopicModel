 so it was a complete non-sequitur, is that it?     how does coming
 up with a derisory deal tell us anything about the existence of
 "objective" values.
 
 you're asking us to accept that the deal you offered would be turned
 down, and we believe that, not because we appeal to objective values
 but becasue we know, or think we know, something about people.
 
 all the people we know exhibit *subjective* values that would lead
 them to reject a deal of $1 for all of the land in america.
 
 great.   now, so what?
