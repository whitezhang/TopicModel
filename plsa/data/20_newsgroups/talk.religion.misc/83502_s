 hmmm, give everyone a gun, free.  what a thought.  let's see where it would
 lead...  i have a gun, i don't like your attitude, i shoot you.  your friends
 have guns, they don't like me shooting your, they shoot me.  my friends have
 guns, they don't like your friends shooting me, they shoot them. . . . does
 this sound like a good thing?  sounds like it would set society back over a
 hundred years.

 funding abortion for those women who can't afford it would save the
 government money, not cost it.  the cost of delivery is much higher,
 and those women can't afford that either.  funding guns, as you suggest
 as an "analogy" would *cost* the government money and would lead to
 effective anarchy.  see the difference?  somehow i doubt you can.
