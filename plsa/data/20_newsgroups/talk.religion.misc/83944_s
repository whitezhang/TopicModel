 i think i see where you are coming from kent.  jesus doesn't view
 guilt like our modern venacular colors it.   
 
 "feelings" have nothing to do with guilt.  feelings arise from the state of 
 being guilty.  feeling and guilt are mutally exclusive.  feelings are a 
 reaction from guilt.  jesus is talking about the guilt state, not the 
 reaction.   let me give you an example:
 
 have you ever made a mistake?  have you ever lied to someone?  even a
 little white lie?   have you ever claimed to know something that you really 
 didn't know?  have you ever hated someone?  have you ever been selfish?
 are you guilty of any one of these?   the answer is of course, yes.  you
 are guilty.  period.  that is it what jesus is getting at.  no big surprise.  
 feelings do not even enter the picture.   consider jesus's use of the word
 "guilt" as how a court uses it.
 
 jesus is concerned that everyone should admit that they are guilty of being
 imperfect.  the bible calls it the state that we are all sinners.  we all do
 bad things.  even the most insignficant thing that we do wrong is proof of our 
 guilt that we are all sinners.     it is it in our nature to do bad things. 
 we are sinners, therefore we do bad things.  being a sinner is fact.  it is
 not a pleasant fact.  but it is just a fact.  we are not perfect.   calling us
 sinners should have no more emotional charge to you than calling you a
 human being.  guilty as charged.

 you can handle your guilt in one of two ways:  acknowledge you
 made a mistake, learn from it, and try to not do it again--in
 the meantime, not punishing yourself for it:  which is the
 way jesus wants you to handle or it.  this is the healthy way.
 
 or two, the destructive way:  put yourself down, slap yourself
 and feel like crap, never forgive yourself, force yourself to
 say a thousand hail marys . . . even to suicide.  this the way 
 jesus does not want us to deal with it.   all people fall into this 
 category to some extent in their lives.
 
 jesus is not in the business of saving us from this guilt
 feeling.  jesus is in the business of showing us how much he
 loves us despite our guilt.  jesus knows we are guilty.  that
 isn't new to him.  it is no big deal to him. he just wants you to realize 
 that this sinful nature destroys the relationship between you and him.
 that is what he wants you to know.  why, because he wants to 
 have your company.  you are immensely valuable to him.
 jesus wants a relationship with you, however, in our present
 sinful nature, we are incapable of having this relationship.  
 
 god is perfect.  we are not.  you cannot fit a square peg into
 a round hole.  however, god has provided a way for us to
 change our nature so that we can have a relationship with him.
 god has provided jesus, so that whosoever just believes in
 jesus, will have their nature changed.  the holy spirit will
 move it.  and now divine nature is now within lives our very
 being--and us and god communicate with each through his
 unifying holy spirit.  the benefits of this are endless.  for
 with the divine nature living within us, we can now see
 our imperfections better.  we can now head them off at the pass.  with
 the power of the holy spirit living in us, we now have his power
 to help us overcome our shortcomings.   because the divine nature lives 
 within us, we can now understand profound bible passages that never before
 we could understand.  because the divine nature now lives within us, we now 
 have authority over demonic forces.  and lastly, because the divine 
 nature now lives within us, we have eternal life--for the holy spirit
 is eternal.
 
 the relationship with jesus is of the utmost importance.  because
 it is not what you do in life that qualifies you to belong to
 heavenly kingdom, it is your relationship to the living god.
 remember what jesus said at the tail end of matthew when he
 separated the "goats from the sheep".   many people in the
 last day will ask him, "didn't i prophesy in your name and do
 miracles, and do good things in your name?"   and what did jesus say?
 "depart from me, for i never *knew* you."  that is the cornerstone of 
 christianity, kent.  jesus must know you as his friend.  it is your 
 relationship to jesus.  if he is your friend and you are his, you will
 be counted among those who will share in his inheritance in heaven.

 good.  it shows that you have a strong self-image--that you
 love yourself.  that is the second greatest commandment jesus
 taught.  if only more people could do as you do.   as i said before, 
 in the common english venacular, "feeling guilty" has a
 different meaning than the state of guilt.

 i believe what we all need in our personalities is a lot less ego,
 a lot less self-centeredness, and a lot more unconditional love.

 yes.  you have stated what jesus said.  remember?  "come to me,
 take my yoke upon your shoulders, for my burden is light."  a yoke
 is used to direct oxen to do work.  once you have a relationship with 
 jesus, you and him share the yoke and the burdens of life.  having 
 god at your side is of great advantage.
