 bill, i have taken the time to explain that biblical scholars consider the
 josephus reference to be an early christian insert.  by biblical scholar i mean
 an expert who, in the course of his or her research, is willing to let the
 chips fall where they may.  this excludes literalists, who may otherwise be
 defined as biblical apologists.  they find what they want to find.  they are
 not trustworthy by scholarly standards (and others).
 
 why an insert?  read it - i have, a number of times.  the passage is glaringly
 out of context, and josephus, a superb writer, had no such problem elsewhere 
 in his work.  the passage has *nothing* to do with the subject matter in which 
 it lies.  it suddenly appears and then just as quickly disappears.
 
 until you can demonstrate how and why the scholarly community is wrong about
 the josephus insert, your "proof" is meaningless and it should not be repeated
 here.  what's more, even if josephus happened to be legitimate, it would "prove"
 nothing.  scholars speak of the "weight of evidence."  far more independent
 evidence would be required to validate your claim.  until forthcoming, your
 belief is based on faith.  that's ok, but you exceed your rights when you pass
 faith off as fact.
 
 as for the gospels, there are parallels, but there are also glaring
 inconsistencies and contradictions.  shouldn't a perfect canon be perfect? 
 shouldn't there be absolutely no room for debate?  i suggest you read _gospel 
 fictions_ by randel helms, and _the unauthorized version_ by robin fox (for 
 herb huston, no known kinship or familial relationship, but we do indeed share 
 an evolutionary ancestry).
 
 the fact that there are inconsistencies, gaps and contradictions does not deny
 your position.  on the other hand, neither do the gospels "prove" your faith. 
 independent evidence is necessary, and i know of none (which we have already
 discussed, and so far you have not provided any).  until then, its faith. 
 moreover, you have committed a fundamental error in logic.  you have attempted
 to "prove" your claim with that which you want to prove.  its no different than
 saying "i am right because i say so."  
 
 your logic is full of circles.  it reminds me a bit of the 1910 presbyterian 
 general assembly.  the assembly defined five fundamentals (this is where
 "fundamentalist" came from) of orthodox protestant christianity, to wit: 1)
 jesus performed miracles, 2) jesus was born of a virgin, 3) jesus was bodily
 resurrected, 4) jesus' crucifixion atoned for human sin, and - here is the
 clincher - 5) the bible is the inerrant word of god.  presbyterians construe
 "inerrant" broadly as spritually inerrant.  fundamentalists take the
 first four as literally true, and then validate them with a literally inerrant
 bible, which contains the first four, and which is the only thing known to 
 contain the first four.  
 
 smoke and mirrors and wands and hand waving if ever there was!
 
 its faith, bill.  you don't have any more or better truths than anyone else. 
 whatever works for you.  just don't foist it on others. 
 
 regards,
 
 rich fox, anthro, usouthdakota
