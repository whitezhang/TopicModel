 oh, yes he did.  you may not agree with his premises, and what he proved may
 not apply to "reality" (if such a thing exists), but he certainly proved
 something.

 got it in one.  similarly, a moral relativist will not judge one moral system
 to be better than another in every possible circumstance.  this does not,
 however, preclude him from judging one moral system to be better than another
 in a specific set of circumstances.  nor does it preclude a set of moral
 relativists from collectively judging a moral system, from some set of
 circumstances which they all agree they are in.

 eh?  could you explain this?  which "that statement" are you talking about?

 i still don't quite see what you're trying to say.  i assume by "values" you
 mean moral values, yes?  in which case, what do you mean by "real"?  what is
 a "real" moral value, as opposed to an unreal one?

 sorry, but in what way is it an infinite regress?  it looks extremely finite
 to me.

 sorry, but that's not so.  i can provide a justification for asserting that
 the moral system of the terrorist is inferior to that of the man of peace.  i
 just can't provide a justification which works in all possible circumstances.
 
 similarly, i can provide a justification for asserting that bullets move
 faster than snails.  that justification won't hold in all possible frames of
 reference, but it will hold in almost all the frames of reference i am ever
 likely to be in.

 i don't think i agree with this.  my saying it *does* make it so *from my
 point of view* and according to *my premises*, unless the argument is invalid.
 it may indeed not make it so from your point of view, but i never claimed
 that it did.  in fact, i don't even claim that you exist enough to have a
 point of view.
