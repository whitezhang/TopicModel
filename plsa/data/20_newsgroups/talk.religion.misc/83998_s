 and does it not say in scripture that no man knows the hour of his coming, not
 even the angels in heaven but only the father himself?  dk was trying to play
 god by breaking the seals himself.  dk killed himself and as many of his
 followers as he could.  btw, god did save the children.  they are in heaven,
 a far better place.  how do i know?  by faith.
 
 god be with you,
