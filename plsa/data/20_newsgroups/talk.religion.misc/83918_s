 sorry if this is late for the thread, but...
 
 i thought god was supposed to be constant and never-changing.  how do
 you reconcile this common christian view with the paragraph above?
 
 also, while we're at it:
 
 1. how do you reconcile "a kind and loving god!!" with the
 judeo-christian view that sin was at one time "immediately punishable
 by death"?  was killing people for sinning god's way of showing
 kindness and love?
 
 2. is the fact the he no longer does this an admission on his part of
 having made a mistake?
 
 3. now that we are "living in the age of grace", does this mean that
 for our sins, god now damns us to eternal hell after we die, rather
 than killing us immediately?  if so, is this eternal damnation an
 example of "a kind and loving god!!"?
 
 just curious.
