 only my common sense.  the fire was caused by either koresh and his
 followers or by the fbi/atf/cia/kgb/and maybe the harper valley pta.  since

 you prove any government agency did it?  (please don't resort to "they 
 covered it up so that proves they did it" or any wild theories about how
 the government agencies intentionally started the fire.  the key words
 are proof and evidence.)
