 i'm curious to know if christians ever read books based on critique
 on the religion, classical text such as "age of reason" by paine,
 or "the myth maker" by jacobi. sometimes it is good to know your
 enemy, and if you want to do serious research you have to understand
 both sides, and not solely the one and only right one.
 
 cheers,
 kent
