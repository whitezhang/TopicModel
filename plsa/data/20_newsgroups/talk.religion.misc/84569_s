 for my money the primary danger of anti-cult groups is that they are
 every bit as wacky as the groups they oppose and that by and large
 they have no compunctions about printing lies, half-truths and
 misleading innuendos as part of their exposes.  a recent book on
 cults i picked up by a "christian" author quite simply mixed in
 all non-christian religions (except the jews) and various new age
 groups with various fringe groups of dubious intent and legality.

 given the record of american christianity, any group that falls
 into the category of fundamentalist or born-again is automatically
 into the inquisition business.  it is an unavoidable affliction
 of those who have a proprietary license on the truth (tm).
 and let's not forget that jonestown and the branch davidians are
 just as much a part of the christian tradition as the missouri synod
 lutherans, and may in fact be the massadas of true christian believers.
 
 i am far more concerned about the encroachment of overtly christian
 indoctrination into public schools than i am about yoga classes there.
 
 for those concerned with religious freedom without a selective
 inquisitiorial bent:
