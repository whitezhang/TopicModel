 the thing is, i know what arms and legs are.  it's therefore generally easy to
 tell whether or not someone has arms and legs.  this "sinful nature", since it
 does not require that the baby actually perform any sins, seems to be totally
 invisible.  as far as i know, maybe half the babies have a sinful nature and
 half don't--it'd look exactly the same, since there is no way to tell the
 difference.

 so what's so bad about a sinful nature, then?  i could understand it being
 bad if it always results in people committing sins, but babies can have it,
 never commit sins, die, and they still have it.  so the bad part about can't
 merely be that it results in people committing sins--so what _is_ bad about it?
