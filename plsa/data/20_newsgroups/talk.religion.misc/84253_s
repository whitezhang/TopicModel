 thank you, steve.  it is refreshing to have someone accuse me of being
 a christian.  i only hope enough evidence can be garnered to get a
 conviction.  i am not certain what you mean by the "fundy" part as the
 term fundamentalist has a wide variety of uses.  if you refer to
 those who actually believe jesus is the messiah and son of god and
 wish to follow in his way, then i plead guilty.  but what does it
 matter what i think.  the roman circus is over.  the lions have been
 satisfied -- for now.  the emperor, after the long and gruelling
 struggle, sensed the crowd was tiring and gave thumbs down.
 
 with respect to my previous comments about david koresh, i urge you
 to re-examine my previous posts.  i believe you mistakenly assume
 that defense of koresh' right to his own personal beliefs and his
 right to express them to others implies agreement with koresh'
 theology.  actually i understand little about the details of branch-
 davidian teachings and regret so many are hung-up on that aspect
 of the tragic events of the past few days.
 
 nor do i think koresh' sex life should be of any interest to the
 federal government.  of course hillary says he had been molesting
 infants so it must be true even though such allegations do not
 fall under the jurisdiction of the federal government; they are
 state and local matters and have been thoroughly reviewed at the
 local level by proper authorities with no successful charge having
 ever been levied against him.  under american law, he was innocent
 as americans are presumed innocent until proven guilty.  at least
 that's how it is suppposed to be.  but he was demonized and propa-
 gandized against by a powerful machine to have him appear as a
 lustful beast and therefore deserving of every ill the fates might
 bring upon him.  
 
 but evidence trickles in that the twenty-one children, who left the
 building in the early days of the siege,  were carefully examined
 by qualified authorities for evidence of physical or sexual abuse
 and none was found.  deguerin, one of the attorneys who met with
 davidians several times before the conflagration, reported that
 the children seemed well adjusted and showed no sign of abuse.
 
 ultimately, steve, what i think about the heart of david koresh
 is quite unimportant.  today he is in the benevolent hands of a
 most wise and merciful judge who will one day surely judge us all.
 so i withhold any judgment of david koresh and defer to the one
 who has all knowledge.  meanwhile, let's clean up the mess left
 on earth and keep this from happening again by sending a strong
 message to the government to respect the inalienable rights of the
 people it serves.
