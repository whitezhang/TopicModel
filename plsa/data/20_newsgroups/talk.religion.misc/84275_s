 if you say x statement and give it the authority of fact, i will respond
 by asking you why. you aren't obligated to say anything, but if your
 intent is to convince me that x statement is true, then yes, the burden
 of proof is upon you. 
 
 if you are merely giving testimony to your beliefs, then you are an egotist.
 why would i care?
 
 to surmise, the burden of proof is upon you if you wish us to believe that
 what you say is true.
