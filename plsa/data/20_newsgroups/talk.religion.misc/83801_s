 very well put.  and, in the case of someone who calls himself a christian
 brother yet continues in his sin (and claims that his sin is not a sin at 
 all, but perfectly acceptable), what should be done?  should christians 
 just ignore a sinful lifestyle in order to not offend the person?  by 
 reaffirming that the lifestyle is sinful according to the bible, are 
 they using "a bullwhip to drive people from jesus"? 
 
 frankly, i find the occurance of a homosexual christian attempting to 
 pass himself off as a 'straight' christian in order to have other 
 christians accept his chastisement better a *lot* more serious than 
 people reaffirming that the bible teaches homosexuality is a sin.
