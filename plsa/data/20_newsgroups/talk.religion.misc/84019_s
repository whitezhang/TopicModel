 never lived out in the country i see. 4 years ago i had a place
 where i had to carry in propane every month, hook the bottle up 
 to copper line, to supply both the stove, and a type of water-
 heater called a flash-heater. a flash heater has a pilot lamp.
 
 here's the point. if the davidians had their propane tanks hooked 
 up to copper (or some such) lines, run through the ceiling spaces
 -- when the fbi started wrecking the place, they could easily have
 ruptured the lines. which then would start spreading out through
 the overhead. and since it was a country home, it wasn't necessarily
 built with non-flamable insulation. 
 
 it's probably more plausible than anything else, that the fire started
 mainly as a result of accident -- or willful negligence on the part of
 the fbi, which should have known better (ie. manslaughter).
 
 it's certain that if the tanks hadn't been used that day -- the fire
 wouldn't have started.

 paul, what "fact?"
