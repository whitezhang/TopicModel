 i would just go fetch my parents, and show them to you, and thereby
 prove quite definitively that my mother is not named merlyn, she is
 not nine feet tall, and my father is quite alive.
 
 then i would assert quite simply that your deity does not exist, and
 wait for a similar demonstration from you.
