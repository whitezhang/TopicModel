 bhoga--to material enjoyment; aisvarya--and opulence; prasaktanam--for
 those who are attached; taya--by such things;
 apahrta-cetasam--bewildered in mind; vyavasaya-atmika--fixed in
 determination; buddhih--devotional service to the lord; samadhau--in
 the controlled mind; na--never; vidhiyate--does take place.
     
                               translation
 
 	in the minds of those who are too attached to sense enjoyment and
 material opulence, and who are bewildered by such things, the resolute
 determination for devotional service to the supreme lord does not take
 place.
   
                                 purport
 
 	samadhi means ``fixed mind.'' the vedic dictionary, the nirukti,
 says, samyag adhiyate 'sminn atma-tattva-yathatmyam: ``when the mind is
 fixed for understanding the self, it is said to be in samadhi.''
 samadhi is never possible for persons interested in material sense
 enjoyment, nor for those who are bewildered by such temporary things.
 they are more or less condemned by the process of material energy.
