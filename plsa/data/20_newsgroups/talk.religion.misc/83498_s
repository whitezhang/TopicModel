 "you are the light of the world. a city can't be hidden lying on a
 mountaintop. nor do people light a candle and cover it with a big
 basket; they put it up on a tall candlestick where it can shine for
 everyone in the house. that's how your light must shine in front of the
 world, so that people see your good deeds and give credit to your father
 in the skies. don't think i came to dissolve the law [torah aka first
 five books] or the prophets: [7 major plus 12 minor] i didn't come to
 dissolve them, i came to fulfill them. i assure you, till the sky and
 the earth go away, not one letter or punctuation mark of the law will
 ever go away until everthing has come to pass. so anyone who dissolves
 even one of the smallest commandments and teaches others the same way,
 will be known as the lowest in the kingdom of the skies; whereas anyone
 who keeps the commands and teaches them too, will be known as someone
 great in the kingdom of the skies."  matt5:14-19, gaus, isbn:0-933999-99-2
