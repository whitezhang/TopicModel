 i will clarify my earlier quote.  god's laws were originally written for 
 the israelites.  jesus changed that fact by now making the law applicable to
 all people, not just the jews.  gentiles could be part of the kingdom of
 heaven through the saving grace of god.  i never said that the law was made
 obsolete by jesus.
 
 if anything, he clarified the law such as in that quote you made.  in the
 following verses, jesus takes several portions of the law and expounds upon
 the law giving clearer meaning to what god intended.  if you'll notice, he
 also reams into the pharisees for mucking up the law with their own contrived
 interpretations.  they knew every letter of the law and followed it with their
 heads but not their hearts.  that is why he points out that our righteousness
 must surpass that of the pharisees in order to be accepted into the kingdom
 of heaven.  people such as the pharisees are those who really go out of their
 way to debate about the number of angels that can dance on the head of a pin.
 they had become legalistic, rule-makers - religious lawyers who practiced the
 letter of the law but never really believed in it.  
 
 i think you will agree with me that there are in today's world, a lot of
 modern-day pharisees who know the bible from end to end but do not believe
 in it.  what good is head knowledge if there is nothing in the heart?
 
 christianity is not just a set of rules; it's a lifestyle that changes one's
 perspectives and personal conduct.  and it demands obedience to god's will.
 some people can live by it, but many others cannot or will not.  that is their
 choice and i have to respect it because god respects it too.
 
 god be with you,
 
 malcolm lee  :)
