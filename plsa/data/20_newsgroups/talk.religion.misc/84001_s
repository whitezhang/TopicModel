 
 	i was slightly surprised to see the "guns of roston" open up on me here.
 but gerry has his posting record and i have mine. although i'm usually more 
 polite than gerry is, i'm not afraid of controversy either. if this looks like
 an argument that he started just to be contrary, or to pander to the sci.skeptic
 masses (to say nothing of the libertarian masses), i'll certainly bow out.
 my schedule for the next two weeks does not read, "23 april through 8 may:
 debate gerry roston on the true meaning of the declaration of independence
 and the bill of rights; include a long discourse on the validity of jefferson's
 claims in the  declaration of independence." 
 
 	i've crossposted this to misc.legal, so that real lawyers can pass 
 judgement on gerry's legal arguments...

 	the first question is, "did the 'tip-off' call indicate to the
 branch davidians that a "no-knock warrant" was in use (and they could
 therefore presumably go into 'weapons free' once the compound property 
 was entered ?" the second question is, "what makes gerry think that the
 davidians' actions would have been different had another type of warrant
 been in use ?"
 
 	i'd like to see both of these questions answered before seeking
 judgment as to any claims about my iq.

 	a spurious analogy, especially for one so skeptical as gerry. 
 the davidians were not drug dealers, and by all accounts feared no one
 but the feds. any evidence to the contrary ?
