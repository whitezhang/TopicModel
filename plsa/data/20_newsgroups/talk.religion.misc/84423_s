 that is indeed the present consensus.  contrary to what dr. fox has
 been saying, however, present consensus is *not* that the longer
 passage in josephus about jesus was inserted, but only that it was
 modified.
    there is no question that it was *at least* modified (based on what
 origen says--that josephus did not recognize jesus as the messiah), but
 i don't think the argument that it appears "out of context" is a very
 good one.  (i haven't looked at the context for a while; perhaps somebody
 could give some of the sentences which precede and follow the jesus
 passage.)
