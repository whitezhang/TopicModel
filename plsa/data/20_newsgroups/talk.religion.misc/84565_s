 well, let me see if i can explain it.  it's similar to collecting coins,
 or stamps, or campaign buttons, or coke bottles, or juke boxes, or model
 trains, or just about anything else that is collected (and just about
 everything is collected).  in all cases, you might consider it something
 of an aberration; i mean, what purpose does it serve?  not much really;
 it's just a hobby.  the collector yearns for diversity (not much use in
 having two of the same thing, except for trading/selling it), historical
 significance (this was the thingy used by so-and-so), technical significance
 (this is the only one that does such-and-such like this; this is the first
 one to do it this way), rarity, and so on.
 
 some people use their collections, other people do not.  as you state, you
 use your collection.  in one sense, this diminishes the value of your
 collection as the items suffer wear and exposure.  in another sense, it
 can enhance your own enjoyment of your collection.  some people collect
 firearms that they do not use; other people use some or all of the firearms
 they collect.  it's just personal preference.
 
 oops, 'personal preference' ... i guess we're not supposed to have that any
 more, are we?
