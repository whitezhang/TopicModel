 imo, a christian has no need of weapons.  i know it is very contrary to the
 american nra ethos of the right to bear arms, but christians should rely on
 the strength of god to protect them.  note that i say *should*.  we are
 inherently insecure but i feel that that is not proper justification to be
 armed to the teeth.  a christian should not have to rely on physical weapons
 to defend himself.  a christian should rely on his faith and intelligence.
 for instance, i have the faith that god will protect me but god also gave
 me the intelligence to know not to go walking down that dark alley at night.
 to jump off a cliff and say that god will save me would be putting god to the
 test.  and who are we to test god?
 
 god be with you,
