 do you consider neo-nazis and white supremists to be christian?  i'd hardly
 classify them as christian.  do they follow the teachings of christ?  love
 one another.  love your neighbour as yourself.  love your enemies.  is jesus
 christ their lord and saviour?  by the persecution of jews, they are violating
 all the precepts of what christ died for.  they are in direct violation of
 the teachings of christ.  even jesus who was crucified by the jewish leaders
 of that time, loved his enemies by asking the father for forgiveness of their
 sins.  i am a christian and i bear no animosity towards jews or any one else.
 the enemy is satan, not our fellow man.
 
 god be with you,
