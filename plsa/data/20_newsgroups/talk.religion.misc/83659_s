 i understand and sympathize with your pain.  what happened in waco was a very
 sad tradgedy.  don't take it out on us christians though.  the branch
 davidians were not an organized religion.  they were a cult led by a ego-maniac
 cult leader.  the christian faith stands only on the shoulders of one man,
 the lord of lords and king of kings, jesus christ.   btw, david koresh was not
 jesus christ as he claimed.
 
 god be with you,
