 but didn't he credit the actual flag design to a party member - some dentist or

 well, i'm no expert, but all of the histories of nazi germany assert this. they
 make reference to several scandals that occurred long before "the night of the
 long knives". the impression that i got was that homosexuality in portions of
 the sa was common knowledge. also, a book (by a homosexual author whose name
 escapes me at the moment) called "homosexuals in history" asserts that roehm
 and heines were homosexuals, as well as others in roehm's sa circle.

 well, you're the one who is in germany. if you don't believe the history books,
 look up the primary sources yourself. those of us outside of germany do not
 have access to these. you do. it seems to me that there were plenty of
 documented instances - several scandals, the fact that on the "knight of the
 long knives" several sa members (including heines) were found sleeping
 together, etc. also i believe some people were complaining about the sa's
 homosexual activities (seducing young boys, etc). the histories that i've 
 read make a very convincing case. none of this sounds like urban legend to me.

 i know next to nothing about irving and nothing about funk. what precisely do
 you know, that would contradict all of the other history books that i have
 read concerning the existence of homosexual nazis? are you trying to say that 
 all historians are taking part in an anti-homosexual smear? what about 
 homosexual writers who agree with the official history? don't you think they 
 would have found out the truth by now if roehm and heines were not homosexuals?
 i would think they would want to disassociate homosexuality from nazism. no one 
 should use any connection between the two to bash homosexuals in any case. 
 
 >i challenge anyone to document this claim.
 
 if you are going to challenge *all* historians on this point (not just irving),
 then the burden of proof is on you. track down the references. find out where
 the stories originate from. again, you are the one in germany, close to
 archival material - most people on the net are not.

 eh? what is your agenda here? to prove that the nazis were heterosexuals, so
 that you can bash heterosexuals? does it bother you that some of the nazis
 might have been homosexuals? does this make all homosexuals bad if this is
 true? of course not. and what about bisexuals? are they half-nazis?
 
 i don't know why it would be so difficult to believe that some nazis were
 homosexuals. the german officer corps before ww1, for instance, was notorious
 for its homosexuality. there were numerous scandals which rocked the german
 govt. during the late 19th and early 20th century. many of the kaiser's friends
 were prosecuted - the kaiser was no homosexual, but the germany army had a long
 tradition of tolerating homosexuality, going far back into prussian history -
 back to frederick the great at least, who was himself a homosexual. roehm was a 
 product of this prussian officer tradition, and the old german army (like the
 english public school system), being a well known center of homosexuality,
 would have been quite willing to overlook roehm's homosexuality.
 
 in addition, some nazis complained of homosexuality in the hitler youth. the
 hitler youth swallowed up all pre-nazi youth groups, and some of the various 
 pre-war vandervogel, bund, and volkish youth groups were known to promote 
 homoerotic ideals and friendship, and in many cases, homosexuality itself. so 
 it seems to me not unlikely that there were plenty of homosexual nazis, 
 regardless of the official nazi dogmas concerning the "evils" of homosexuality.
 why should this suprise anyone? homosexuality has always existed, in all 
 societies - it would be most unusual if the nazis were an exception.
 
 no, i don't have any sources for you, as i think the only kind of proof you
 will accept would be citations from archival material, and i do not have access 
 to these. nor do i intend to reread every book on the nazis and on modern
 homosexuality that i have ever read - i don't have the time. nothing is
 stopping you, however, from chasing down those sources. until you prove
 otherwise, though, i will stick with the established histories.
