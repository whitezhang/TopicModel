 um, i think you and the bible are the ones inside the wall.  there's a
 really wonderful world out here.  you really should peek out at it sometime.
 
 the silly things you keep saying only reinforce the fact that we *are*
 on opposite sides of a very high wall.  i see how incredibly beautiful
 things are on my side, and i only keep telling you about it because
 i'd like to you come join me here.

 i never said that.  i said that i would prefer to cease to exist than
 to be tossed into any god's version of hell.

 you say to me, "brian, come up here and take a look from this vantage
 point."  but you're in a valley, looking at a crayon drawing of a sun
 and a tree, and i can't for the life of me figure out why you're so
 immersed in it.  *i*'m the one trying to get you to come up here,
 don't you see?
