 definitely, j.r. "bob" dobbs, numero uno, top dog, not one can touch, not
 one can knock bob out of the box. bob kills me mon! everyday!
 
 but close el segundo (el subliminal) is the infamous paul (birthname saul) the
 evangeline who became famous as a result of his numerous trampoline act 
 tours of the eastern mediterranean.
 
 jesus on the other hand was duped, a pawn of the con, fell pray to the
 holywood paradox (ain't nothing but a sign in the hills!). like many
 afro-asians, jesus found the earth all too pink! and to think that after
 his death, the con changed him into a tall blond holywood sun god! and i 
 do mean that in the kindest way possums! now jesus does gigs with hendrix, 
 joplin, morrison, lennon, marley, tosh, etc. mostly ska beat jah-know!
