 speed is a quantifiable measure resulting from a set of methods that
 will result in the same value measured no matter the reference.  a 
 bullet with zero velocity sitting on a table on a train moving 60mph
 will be moving at a speed of
 
         (a) 0mph to someone on the train.
         (b) 60mph to someone stationary next to the train.
 
 the reference frame makes the speed relative.  but what's interesting
 here is that every person on the train will see a stationary bullet.
 every person off, a bullet moving 60mph.  
 
 i know of no train where all the people on it, every time it is
 filled, will see a moral problem in exactly the same way.
