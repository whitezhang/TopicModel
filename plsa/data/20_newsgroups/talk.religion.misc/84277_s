 everything we need to know about the seven seals is already
 in the bible.  there is no "knowledge" of the seals that
 koresh could have.
 
 unless the fbi were to kill all publishers of the bible, it
 would seem the story of the seven seals would be bound to
 leak out.
 
 assuming for the moment that the fbi believed in the bible and 
 were afraid of the seven seals, then they would also know
 that god is the one who has to open the seals, not some
 little prophet like koresh.
