 if what was being discussed could be established or disproven by 
 experiment and observation, then i would agree with you, chris.  
 the burden of proof would belong to bill. but the source
 document for christianity, the bible, simply assumes god exists
 and makes it clear (to us calvinists, anyway :-)) that when a person
 is in fellowship with god, it is because god has taken the initiative
 in revealing himself to that person. so from a christian point of
 view, the burden of proof belongs to god. bill is being consistent
 with what the bible teaches in relating his own experience with god,
 but it would be an error on his part to assume that there is a direct,
 causal relationship between his testimony and someone else becoming
 convinced that god exists and that he needs to be reconciled to god.

 please excuse me if i missed an earlier part of this thread
 in which bill came across like an egotist. what i saw was simply
 obedience to the scriptural command to "always be ready
 to give a reason for the joy that is in you".
