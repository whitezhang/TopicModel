      just briefly, on something that you mentioned in passing. you refer to
      differing interpretations of "create," and say that many christians may
      not agree. so what? that is really irrelevant. we do not base our faith
      on how many people think one way or another, do we? the bottom line is
      truth, regardless of popularity of opinions.
 
      also, i find it rather strange that in trying to persuade that created
      and eternally existent are equivalent, you say "granted the mormon
      belief..." you can't grant your conclusion and then expect the point to
      have been addressed. in order to reply to the issue, you have to address
      and answer the point that was raised, and not just jump to the
      conclusion that you grant.
 
      the bible states that lucifer was created.  the bible states that jesus
      is the creator of all. the contradiction that we have is that the lds
      belief is that jesus and lucifer were the same.

 ra>    has it occured to you, robert, that being "born of" someone or being

      the mormon belief is that all are children of god. literally. there is
      nothing symbolic about it. this however, contradicts what the bible
      says. the bible teaches that not everyone is a child of god:
 
           the field is the world; the good seed are the children of the 
           kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked [one];
           (matthew 13:38)
 
           i speak that which i have seen with my father: and ye do that which 
           ye have seen with your father. (john 8:38)
 
           ye do the deeds of your father. then said they to him, we be not 
           born of fornication; we have one father, [even] god.  jesus said 
           unto them, if god were your father, ye would love me: for i 
           proceeded forth and came from god; neither came i of myself, but he 
           sent me.  why do ye not understand my speech? [even] because ye 
           cannot hear my word.  ye are of [your] father the devil, and the 
           lusts of your father ye will do. he was a murderer from the 
           beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in 
           him. when he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a 
           liar, and the father of it. (john 8:41-44)
 
           and said, o full of all subtilty and all mischief, [thou] child of 
           the devil, [thou] enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease 
           to pervert the right ways of the lord? (acts 13:10)
 
           wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this 
           world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit 
           that now worketh in the children of disobedience: (ephesians 2:2)
 
           in this the children of god are manifest, and the children of the 
           devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of god, neither he 
           that loveth not his brother. (1 john 3:10)
 
      one becomes a child of god...
 
           but as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the
           sons of god, [even] to them that believe on his name: (john 1:12)
 
           behold, what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us, that
           we should be called the sons of god: therefore the world knoweth us
           not, because it knew him not.  beloved, now are we the sons of god,
           and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when
           he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he
           is. (1 john 3:1-2)
 
      ...when he is born again through faith in jesus christ:
 
           which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of
           the will of man, but of god. (john 1:13)
 
           having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus
           christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,
           (ephesians 1:5)
 
           of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should
           be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures. (james 1:18)
 
           for as many as are led by the spirit of god, they are the sons of
           god. for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear;
           but ye have received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, abba,
           father. the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we
           are the children of god: (romans 8:14-16)
 
           beloved, let us love one another: for love is of god; and every one
           that loveth is born of god, and knoweth god. (1 john 4:7)
 
           whosoever believeth that jesus is the christ is born of god: and
           every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is
           begotten of him. (1 john 5:1)
 
           for ye are all the children of god by faith in christ jesus.
           (galatians 3:26)

 ra>    robert, with all due respect, who died and left you chief arbiter of
 ra> correct biblical interpretation?  i don't mean to be snotty about this,
 ra> but the fact is that the bible is so differently interpreted by different
 ra> groups of biblical scholars (what do you think of the jehovah's
 ra> witnesses, for example?) that to make reference to the "jesus of the
 ra> bible" is simply ridiculous.  whose "jesus of the bible" do you mean?
 
      this is really a red herring. it doesn't address any issue raised, but 
      rather, it seeks to obfuscate. the fact that some groups try to read 
      something into the bible, doesn't change what the bible teaches. for 
      example, the fact that the jehovah's witnesses deny the deity of christ 
      does not alter what the bible teaches [ "looking for that blessed hope,
      and the glorious appearing of the great god and our saviour jesus
      christ;" (titus 2:13),"simon peter, a servant and an apostle of jesus
      christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through
      the righteousness of god and our saviour jesus christ:" (2 peter 1:1)] 
      on the deity of christ.
 
      we first look to the bible to see what it teaches. to discount, or not 
      even address, what the bible teaches because there are some groups that 
      have differing views is self-defeating. to see what the bible teaches, 
      you have to look at the bible.

      i find this rather curious. when i mentioned that the mormon belief is
      that jesus needed to be saved, i put forward some quotes from the late
      apostle, bruce mcconkie. the curious part is that no one addressed the
      issue of `jesus needing to be saved.' rick comes the closest with his "i
      have my own conclusions" to addressing the point.
 
      most of the other replies have instead hop-scotched to the issue of
      bruce mcconkie and whether his views were 'official doctrine.' i don't
      think that it matters if mcconkie's views were canon. that is not the
      issue.  were mcconkie's writings indicative of mormon belief on this
      subject is the real issue. the indication from rick is that they may 
      certainly be.
