 #it is significant to remember that these secular positions were held by

 #homogeonously christian. it was largely the mainstream christian's disgust

 true, but that is exactly the "problem": the mormon extermination order
 was issued not just by a christian, it was allowed under the constitution
 of the united states, which was instituted precisely to prevent incidents
 like this "order" from occurring in the first place...  as i indicated in
 an earlier posting, your "irrational hatred" is clearly evidenced by
 individuals like robert weiss (who could have been gov. boggs' lieutenant;
 he would have fitted right in, drewling et al), and seems a modern-day
 occurrence, based on results (slander, persecution, misrepresentation,
 lies, denying mormons representation in their own user group, etc. etc.
 
 in intent and purpose, what really has changed?
 
 #the situation is not entirely different today.  many irrational feelings
 #and beliefs are justified through religion.  i don't think most of them
 #are started because of religion, but religion certainly helps justify and
 #perpetuate prejudices and practices by providing a neat justification
 #which discourages critical thought.
 
 true, as evidenced by numerous examples, as i am sure you're aware.

  ^^^^^^^^
 (correction: the majority of utahn's are mormon (60-70% i believe, up to a
  100% in many cities and settlements throughout the western states.)
 
 #conspiracies.  it is paranoid to believe that everything that affects you
 #badly must have been done primarily for that purpose.
 
 what i mean is that secular authorities are to be watched, as we believe
 that satan has been given some power and dominion over the earth to divert
 truth, judgment, and justice.  in addition, we believe that the adversary
 has power to influence the unjust and idolatrous (greed for money would be
 a good example) in order to bring about persecution, war, oppression, and
 evil combinations.  as an intelligent being, don't you suppose that the
 destroyer would yield his influence foremost on those with political power?
 
 as far as utah is concerned, what i pointed out were some horrible examples
 of environmental nightmares imposed upon by secular authorities, which have
 brought death, disease, (i.e. the "downwinders") and environmental contami-
 nation.  i am hardly "paranoid," i am just not "expecting" too much from a
 secular government that may not share our values and faith, and which indeed
 (as gov. boggs et al.) may be out to harm and destroy us.  as a matter of
 fact, prophecies in my church indicate that in future years, (global)
 persecution against mormons will so increase in intensity and scope, that
 (paraphrasing) "all those who wish to escape persecution and murder must
 flee to zion."  zion (the "pure in heart") will be re-established in those
 days, and it ain't our current secular authorities who will rule over it...

 #i personally feel that we should try to stop anyone who is a threat to the
 #life of even one person.  sure, he did not pose a threat to the security of

 #much is definite.
 
 hmmm.  "definite" by whom?  --until such has been established beyond reason-
 able doubt, this alleged "threat" may have been less than the "threat"
 imposed upon him and his followers by the batf and fbi...

 #
 #this is like asking who really caused the deaths of the israeli olympic
 #team in 1976?  in that case, the police botched the job as well.  but to
 #lay a heavier burden on them than the terrorists would be a terrible
 #mistake.  i think the same sort of reasoning applies in this case.
 #certainly, if david koresh chose any peaceful option, the atf and fbi
 #would have complied.  the responsibility is more his than the authorities.
 
 come now, at issue is in how much the authorities escalated an otherwise
 peaceful stand-off: "let's get it over with, and "force" david koresh to
 come out???"  --by gassing them???  were they naive, or what?  they played
 right into the hands of an apocalyptic-thinking individual (he had prepared
 his people for this eventuality for years), and not *one* firetruck or plan
 was in place to deal with this scenario???  i feel that the authorities
 had "some" responsibility to protect their own citizens, even if they were
 religious zealots, and guilty of ... not paying a $200 gun license???
 (has the batf become an extension of the local tax-collectors?)
 
 #>david koresh, no doubt, will be described as the "evil" guy (by the
 #>executioners), while the actions of all those "valiant and brave" officers
 #
 #characterizing the atf/fbi as executioners is inaccurate and unfair.  in
 #order to be an executioner, the least one must have done is have the intent
 #to kill.
 
 que?? --intrusion into private property with semi's, loaded with life
 ammunition, isn't that implicit "intent (or at least "prepared") to kill"?
 i ask you, would the batf warrant stand up in a civil court of justice?
 i do not mind if criminals (such as dangerous drug lords) are brought to
 justice, but escalating events to the point of allowing to, if not compli-
 city with, the destruction of a people?
