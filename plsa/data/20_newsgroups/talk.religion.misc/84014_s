   nut or not, he was clearly a liar.  he said he would surrender after
   local radio stations broadcast his message, but he didn't.  then he
   said he would surrender after passover, but he didn't.
 
   none of which excuses the gross incompetence and disregard for the
   safety of the children displayed by the feds.   as someone else
   pointed out, if it had been chelsea clinton in there you would 
   probably have seen more restraint.
