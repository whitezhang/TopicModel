 suppose you had the option to specify that your tax money can't pay for
 abortions.  do you think that that should entitle you to pay *less* taxes?
 since refusing to fund abortions would lead to an even larger increase in
 funding for pre-natal care and delivery, if anything you should pay *more*
 taxes.  suppose we let your taxes stay at the same level.
 
 do you really think that funding for abortion would be reduced?  no, your
 taxes would go towards other things, and more taxes from those who don't
 object to paying for abortion would be moved from those other things to
 pay for abortions.  all that happens is that the funds get shuffled around,
 to give you a clear conscience.  why put the government through all that
 paperwork when the end result is no different?  why worry about it when
 it makes no difference and it doesn't hurt you in the least.

 that is the most rediculous out-of-context analogy i have every heard.  i
 do not advocate any such "advice".  there is quite a difference between
 the illegal violation called "rape", and the constitutionally granted power
 of taxation along with the funding of legal procedures.  if you can't see
 the difference you can go to hell.

 your yanking followups to posts of mine (from other threads?) does not
 demonstrate any deliberate lack of response on my part.  there is a great
 deal of bandwidth on talk.abortion, and it can take a long time to get
 through to the followups to articles i have posted, and many times responses
 expire before i get to reading them.
 
 it is pretty fucking arrogant of you to pull copies here and demand that
 i respond to them here when they were posted already and quite possibly
 responded to separately.  i believe i *have* indeed responded to some of
 the following previously--though probably not each of them.

 i have done so in the past.  it isn't my fault that you never saw it.
 
 here is a *brief* explanation.
 
 a person has a right to do anything that does not interfere with the rights
 of another person.  if you want to hear more about this aspect of "personity"
 go read the thread "why is bodily autonomy so important?" on talk.abortion.
 you may have to look at all unexpired posts on that thread to find the post
 where i give a fairly detailed explanation.  i believe it was posted on
 april 18 or 19.
 
 the second part is a definition of a person.  a simplistic explanation is
 that a "person" is a member of society.  most normal adult human beings are
 good examples of "people".  most children over two years old are "people" as
 well.  the simple way of determining this is that you can have a conversation
 with them.  it is actually more complicated than that, but i have no desire
 to spend the time it would take to explain it to you.  read the thread "why
 is bodily autonomy so important?" for more explanation and justification.

 actually, i was refering to the minority that objects to abortion, not
 those who object to federal funding.  i admit i did not say it very
 clearly, and apologize for that.
 
 do you have statistics that might answer this question?  or are you just
 blowing smoke.

 if you disagree then give us some "reasons".  given that abortion is
 *legal* and the right to abortion is supported by the majority of the
 population (or can you provide unbiased statistics?  i doubt you can
 because i have never heard of an unbiased poll that has been conducted.)
 ...it is not justifiable to refuse abortions to women who can not afford
 them, who will simply require even greater funds for the delivery you
 would force upon them.  i refuse to pay *more taxes* to remove choice
 from those women just because you object to a legal medical procedure.

 more guns in society does not reduce the burden on the police;
 it increases it.

 now this is rediculous.  public transportation puts less of a burden on
 transportation routes (roads, rails, etc) than private transportation.
 it also puts a lesser burden on the environment.

 not "infants" you idiot.  infants are born.
 
 who has a "right to life"?  people who have not violated other's rights,
 have a "right to life".  a fetus is not a person.  you can not have a
 conversation with them.  they are not biologically independent.  their
 awareness is questionable.  they have no experiences in the "real world"
 to make up a personality.

 ever hear of "euthanasia"?  ever hear of insurance companies refusing to

 sufficient evidence that it will work to be worth the expense?  which one
 gets you angrier?  why is that?
