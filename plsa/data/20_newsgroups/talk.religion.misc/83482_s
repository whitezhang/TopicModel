 it may be "irrelevant" to you and *your* personal beliefs (or should i say
 "bias"?), but it is relevant to me and many others.  you're right, "the
 bottom line is truth," independant from you or anyone else.  since you
 proclaim "truths" as a self-proclaimed appointee, may i ask you by what
 authority you do this?  because "it says so in the bible?"  --does the
 bible "say so," or is it you, or someone else, who interprets whether a
 scripture or doctrine conforms to your particular liking or "disapproval"?
 
 excuse moi, but your line of "truths" haven't moved me one bit to persuade
 me that my beliefs are erroneous.  of all the "preachers" of "truth" on
 this net, you have struck me as a self-righteous member of the wrecking
 crew, with no positive message to me or other latter-day saints whatsoever.
 btw, this entire discussion reminds me a lot of the things said by jesus
 to the pharisees: "ye hypocrite(s) . . . ye preach about me with your lips,
 but your hearts are far removed from me..."

 sophistry.  look who's talking: "jumping to conclusions?"  you wouldn't do
 that yourself, right?  all you address is your own convictions, regardless
 whether we come up with any biblical scriptures which supports our points
 of view, because you reject such interpretations without any consideration
 whatsoever.

 a beautiful example of disinformation and a deliberate misrepresentation
 of lds doctrine.  the former kgb would have loved to employ you.
 jesus and lucifer are not "the same," silly, and you know it.

 correction: it may contradict would you think the bible says.  the bible
 indeed does teach that not all are children of god in the sense that they
 "belong to" or follow god in his footsteps.  satan and his followers have
 rebelled against god, and are not "children (=followers/redeemed) of god,"
 but it doesn't mean that they were not once created by god, but chose to
 separate themselves from those who chose to follow god and his plan of
 salvation.

 so?  --this illustrates nicely what i just said: the children of the
 kingdom are those who have remained valiant in their testimony of jesus
 (and have shown "works of repentance, etc.), and the children of the
 wicked one are those who rebelled against god and the lamb.  the issue
 of satan's spirit-offspring (and those who followed him) has not been
 addressed in this and other verses you copied from your bible.  you
 purposefully obscured the subject by swamping your "right" with non-
 related scriptures.

 in this single posting of yours, i've seen more "constructs of imagination"
 than in all of the pro-lds mails combined i have read so far in this news
 group.  first get your lds-facts straight before you dare preaching to us
 about "the only true god," whom you interpret according to your own likes
 and dislikes, but whose image i cannot reconcile with what i know about
 him myself.  i guess your grandiose self-image does not allow for other
 faiths, believing in the divinity of jesus christ, but in a different
 way or fashion than your own.  not that it really matters, the mission
 and progress of the lds church will go on, boldly and nobly, and no mob
 or opponent can stop the work from progressing, until it has visited
 every continent, swept every clime, and sounded in every ear.
 
 #  this is really a red herring. it doesn't address any issue raised, but

 sigh.  "what the bible teaches"?  or: "what the bible teaches according to
 robert weiss and co.?"  i respect the former, i reject the latter without
 the remotest feeling that i have rejected jesus.  on the contrary.  and by
 the way, i do respect your interpretations of the bible, i even grant you
 being a christian (following your own image of him), as much as i am a
 christian (following my own image of him in my heart).

 the issue is, of course, that you love to use anything to either mis-
 represent or ridicule the lds church.  the issue of "official doctrine"
 is obviously very important.  mcconkie's views have been controversial
 (e.g. "the seven deadly heresies" has made me a heretic!  ;-) at best,
 or erroneous at worst ("blacks not to receive the priesthood in this
 dispensation").  i respect him as someone who has made his valuable
 contribution to the church, but i personally do not rely on his personal
 interpretations (his book "mormon doctrine" is oftentimes referred to
 as "mcconkie's bible" in mormon circles) on mormon doctrine.  i rather
 look to official (doctrinal) sources, and... to hugh nibley's books!
 (the last comment is an lds-insider reference.)  summarizing: mcconkie
 was a wise man who contributed undoubtedly far more to the kingdom of
 god than i have, but whose views are by no means dogma or accepted
 doctrine, some of it clearly belongs to personal interpretation and
 speculation.  but having said this, i find mcconkie (even in his most
 biased and speculative moments) far more thought-provoking than the
 trash coming from your proverbial pen.  i'm somewhat appalled that i have
 allowed myself to sink as low as you in this posting...
