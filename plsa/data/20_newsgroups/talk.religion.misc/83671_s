 is there evidence independent of the fbi that indicates that the branch
 davidians set the fire?  what have the survivors said?  did the press see
 anything?
 
 there is, unfortunately, precedent for the u.s. government saving children by
 roasting them alive.  (there is precedent for religious self-imolation
 as well.)
 
 i still wonder why the government couldn't just leave them alone.
