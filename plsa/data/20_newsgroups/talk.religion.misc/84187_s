 i'm having trouble receiving news at the moment due to an overloaded
 news server. i think that i can post out reasonably quickly, though.
 
 i'm in a couple of threads at the moment which may be pending replies.
 if anyone wants a reply from me over something i've posted then i
 suggest sending an e-mail copy of the point to me so that i can reply by
 news.
 
 this is one way to shut me up!!
 
 cheers,
 
 david.
