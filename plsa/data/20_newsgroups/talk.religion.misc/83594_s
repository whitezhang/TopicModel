 this was an open question.  i assumed that if mr. archer is a chronic
 liar, someone whould have documented it.   this assumption is based on
 how talk.origins regulars have documented numerous cases of creationist
 deceptions (such as duane guish and his friends).
 
 no long list of archer mistakes has yet been given, so this may be just
 an isolated incident...
