 i guess my news reader deleted the lines of the 4th amendment which deal
 with no-knock warrants.  how do you deduce that they are in clear violation?
 now maybe no-knock warrants should be illegal.  but until the supreme court
 says so, your own pronouncements on the warrant's constitutionality are just
 wishful thinking.
