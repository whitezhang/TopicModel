 is there any difference in saying 
 
 "absolute truth exists, but some people think its a lie"
 
 and
 
 "truth is relative" ?
 
 i think there is:  in both examples, the first statement is a
 fundamental disagreement between at least two people; the 
 second statement is agreed upon by all.
 
 to put it another way, someone who says objective values exist
 does not agree that values are subjective.
