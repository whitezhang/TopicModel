 i also heard the romans had a large solar festival on this day because this
 day, about 3 days after the winter solstice, was when you could notice a
 change in the shadows and be sure that the sun was indeed returning. in fact,
 i remember the latin phrase natalis solis invicti (sp!) associated here.
 
 i can't say for certain when saturnalia was, since i can't locate my master
 holiday list. i think it was 2 weeks or so however.
