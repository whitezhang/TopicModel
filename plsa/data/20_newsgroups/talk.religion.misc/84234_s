 i think that if a theist were truly objective and throws out the notion that
 god definitely exists and starts from scratch to prove to themselves that
 the scriptures are the whole truth then that person would no longer be a
 theist.

 you're missing something here.  there are people who convert from
 non-theism to theism after being brought up in a non-theist household.  (i
 don't have any statistics as to how many though.  that would be an
 interesting thing to know.)  i think that religion is a crutch.  people are
 naturally afraid of the unknown and the unexplainable.  people don't want
 to believe that when they die, they are dead, finished.  that there is
 nothing else after that.  and so religion is kind of a nice fantasy.
 religion also describes things we don't know about the universe (things
 science has not yet described) and it also gives people a feeling of
 security... that if they just do this one thing and everything will be ok.
 that they are being watched over by a higher power and its minions.  this
 has a very high psychological attraction for quite a few people and these
 people are willing to put up with a few discrepancies and holes in their
 belief system for what it gains them.  this is why i think it's kind of
 useless to try too hard to convert theists to atheism.  they are happy with
 their fantasy and they feel that other people will be happy with it too
 (they can't accept the fact that there are people who would rather accept
 the harsh reality that they are running from).
 
 anyway, i'm getting kind of carried away here.  but my point is that theism
 doesn't have to be ingrained into a child's mindset for that person to grow
 up as a theist (although this happens far too often).  theism is designed
 to have its own attractions.
