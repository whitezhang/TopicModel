 my online bible is on a cd, but i don't own a cd-rom system for the
 time being, so i can't search for the famous cite where jesus explicitly
 states that he didn't want to break existing (jewish) laws. in other
 words technically speaking christians should use saturday and not sunday
 as their holy day, if they want to conform to the teachings of jesus.
 
 cheers,
