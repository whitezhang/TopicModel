 this group killed itself to fulfill its interpretation of prophecy
 and to book a suite in paradise, taking innocent kids along for the
 ride. i hardly think the feds were motivated by persecution. if they
 were, all koresh would have had to do was surrender quietly to the
 authorities, without firing a shot, to get the american people behind
 him and put the feds in the hot seat. but no, god told him to play
 the tough guy. there's great strength in yielding, but few appreciate
 this.
