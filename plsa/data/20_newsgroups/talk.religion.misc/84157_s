      now doesn't this sound a lot like the "colorful (or otherwise) story 
      from antiquity that somehow tries to (or does) explain natural pheno-
      mena"?  i think i hear what you're saying, but i'm not convinced that
      i know what you mean.  the possibility exists that what _looks_ like
      "myth" on the surface may be after all much more than "just" a story.
