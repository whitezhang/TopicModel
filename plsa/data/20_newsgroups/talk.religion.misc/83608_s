 glad to hear this, just a note, osiris, mithras and many other
 cult gods resurrected as well, so there's a good chance for all of
 us to maybe end up in a virtual reality simulator, and live forever,
 hurrah!
 
 sorry, this was a joke, some sort of one anyway. i'm the first
 that connected osiris with a virtual reality personality database.
 time to write a book.
 
 
 cheers,
 kent
