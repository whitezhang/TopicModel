 if no-one looks at the results, or acknowledges their correctness, in what
 meaningful sense can the chip be said to "work"?? does flibozity exist?
 by "flibozity", i mean a particular, extremely complex configuration of 
 physical phenomena, which no-one, absolutely no-one cares about in the 
 slightest. does it exist, eric?
 
 getting back to the question of whether the des chip "works", doesn't "work" 
 mean something like "achieving the desired/expected effect"? note the way 
 intentionality subtly underlies that definition. even if we take the 
 definition as "expected", instead of "desired", can you deny that conformance 
 to expectations is itself a value of sorts, namely the scientific values of 
 accuracy-of-prediction and reproducibility-of-results?
 
 the phenomenologist husserl, for one, considered intentionality to be the
 primary ontological "stuff" from which all other ontology was built --
 perceptions, consciousness, thoughts, etc. frank is by no means alone in
 seeing intentionality (or "values", as he puts it) underlying all human
 experience, even the so-called "objective" experiences, such as 
 measurements of the natural world, or the output of your des chip.
