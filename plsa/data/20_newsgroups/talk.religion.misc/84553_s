    as opposed to universal or catholic or "foursquare gosple". i think that
    the greek orthodox church would take high offense at your misuse of the
    word. your version of christianity is neither mainstream nor bible derived
    you make claims of bible-centricity that are not derivable soley from the
    bible.  about six-seven months ago, you claimed that your primary objection
    to the lds was that "our" doctrine was not bible-derived, and now this
    (and other) claims can be shown, are also not bible interpeting bible.

        "paradise exalted to heaven"
 
 	paradise wasn't equal to heaven and _now_ it is? yet you claim that
  	peeple can not be exalted to heaven, nicht wahr?

 	when i read the story, i found that  "abraham's bosom" wasn't so much
 	a place, but somewhere the rich man could see and talk to abraham?

 	gee this is fairly close to what the lds call spirit prison, and what
         you have called false doctrine...

    this part is _not_ supported from scripture, nor does it support your
    claim that the "paradise" where christ descended was exalted.
 
    making such claims on this little "evidence" ignores the witness of the
    scripture

    using this to argue that paradise or spirit prison, is now changed from
    a pre-easter postion to post-easter by god postion is not supportable.
  
    makeing such a claim requires more evidence than you have given here...

   yes, and your reasons are in general not supported by any direct reading
   of the scriptures. you have demonstrated that you claims to scriptural 
   "proof" need to be cross-checked. the referencs that you supply often do
   not support your postion, if they are read in the context of the scripture.

 	how about that those who have been in paradise, and have accepted
 	the gosple will be judged of jesus christ, and then return to the
 	presence of god. is that somehow different from your expressed view
 	that the paradise spoken of (or "abraham's bosom")
