 to repeat what i said in an earlier post: evolution is theory and fact.  if you
 accept the facts, then that is a display of reason and intelligence and much
 different from anachronistic religion.  if you assess the theories of evolution
 objectively, then there can be 0% religion involved and evolution remains
 useful in the realm of science.
 
 simply put, evolution/creation when each is looked at properly - theory/fact
 vs. assertion/fiction - is a specific example of exactly what separates reason
 and science from nonsense.
