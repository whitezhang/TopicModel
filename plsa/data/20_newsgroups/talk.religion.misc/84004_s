 you could argue that if you wanted, but i think a more reasonable 
 argument would point out the fact that the remembrance feast was
 very similar to the pesach (passover) meal during seder, a very
 jewish ritual.
  
 the fact that there appears to be an abuse in the early church of
 people eating too much (a very real concern with some passover meals)
 and not treating the meal with respect, shows the simplifying of the
 ritual to just bread and wine to be a way of dealing with the
 inherent problems of people's human nature, and trying to keep the
 essentials of the remembrance aspects.
