         the problem is that most scientists exclude the possibility of the
         supernatural in the question of origins.  is this is a fair premise?
         i utterly reject the hypothesis that science is the highest form of
         truth.

         some of these so-called human-like creatures were apes.  some were
         humans.  some were fancifully reconstructed from fragments.

            good deeds do not justify a person in god's sight.
            an atonement (jesus) is needed to atone for sin.

      my point: god is the creator.  look's like we agree.
