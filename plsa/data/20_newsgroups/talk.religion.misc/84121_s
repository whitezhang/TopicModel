 hmm.  the police strategy of bursting in with weapons drawn, clearly marked as
 officers and yelling "police" repeatedly.  this is used every day to bust drug
 houses.  the idea is to awe the suspects into submission with surprise and
 display of firepowere in order to avoid a gun fight.  as for not knocking, it's
 a sad necessity in many cases since the suspects will attempt to escape or even
 fight.  usually this strategy works; if it didn't, then it wouldn't be used so
 commonly, now would it?
 
 whether or not it was appropriate to use this strategy on the bd is not my
 point, since i don't think any of us have enough information to make a clear
 judgement on this issue.
 
 i merely point out that it is a valid strategy which is used every day.
 furthermore, we don't know of any substitute strategy capable of apprehending
 potentially dangerous and armed suspects.  do you suggest that the police
 always knock with guns holstered and never arrest any suspects until they have
 been allowed to inspect the officers's badges?  just what should the police do
 when apprehending potentially dangerous and armed suspects?  how far can they
 reasonably go to identiy themselves?  what do you suggest they can do which
 can't be faked by the "competition"?
 
 even if you've got deadly enemies who may pretend to be cops, that's not an
 excuse to murder police.  in the case of the bd's, there was almost definitely
 at most the paranoid delusion of deadly enimies who would pretend to be cops.
