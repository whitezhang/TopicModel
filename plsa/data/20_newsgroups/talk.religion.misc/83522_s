 	just wondering, do you mean the "lectorium rosicrucianum"?
 warning: there is no point in arguing who's "legit" and who's not. *which*
 golden dawn are you talking about?
 
 	just for the sake of argument, (reflecting no affiliation)
 i am going to say that the true rosicrucian order is the fraternitas
 rosae crucis in quakertown, penn.,
 
 	any takers? :-)
 
 fraternally,
