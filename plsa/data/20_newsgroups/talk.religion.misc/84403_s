 false.  (not (stating (x))) is not equivalent to (stating (not (x))).

 there is no objective way of measuring the `goodness' of a moral
 system.  it's a value judgement.  therefore there is so objective
 comparison for moral systems.  therefore there is no `best' moral
 system.

 similarly, there is no frame of reference that can be used to
 objectively compare frames of reference.  any such choice is
 arbitrary.
 
 which is not to say that one should not take up reference frames for
 various purposes.
 
 there is nothing to believe -- not even this statement.
