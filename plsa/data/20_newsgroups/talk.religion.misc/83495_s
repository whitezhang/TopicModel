 well, i am not andy, but if you had familiarized yourself with some of
 the current theories/hypotheses about abiogenesis before posting :-), you
 would be aware of the fact that none of them claims that proteins were
 assembled randomly from amino acids. it is current thinking that rna-
 based replicators came before proteinaceous enzymes, and that proteins
 were assembled by some kind of primitive translation machinery.
 
 now respond to 2. :-)
