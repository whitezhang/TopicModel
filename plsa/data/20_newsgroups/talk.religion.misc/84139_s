 	would someone be kind enought to document the exact
 nature of the evidence against the bd's without reference to
 hearsay or newsreports. i would also like to know more about
 their past record etc. but again based on solid not media
 reports. 
 
 	my reason for asking for such evidence is that last night
 on larry king live a so-called "cult-expert" was interviewed from
 australia who claimed that it was his evidence which led to the
 original raid. this admission, if true, raises the nasty
 possibility that the government acted in good faith, which i
 believe they did, on faulty evidence. it also raises the
 possibility that other self proclaimed cult experts were advising
 them and giving ver poor advice.
 
 	a few years ago anson shupe and david bromley published
 strange gods: the great american cult scare (beacon, boston, 1981
 - and the new vigilantes: anti-cultists and new religions -sage,
 beverly hills, 1980. both books suggested the possibility of
 tragic results if self-proclaimed cult experts were ever taken
 seriously. perhaps their diagnosis of the anit-cult movement
 needs investigating in light of the waco tragedy.
