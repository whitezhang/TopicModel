 ks, i see you're wanting malcolm's response. allow me one last inter-
 jection then please:
 
 distinguishing among the religious jews, you've excepted the messianic
 for obvious reasons. specifically, are you saying it's these religious 
 jews, who trace their lineage back to abraham by blood and orthodoxy, 
 rather than by faith, who won't agree?  orthodox jews?  
 
 as to the a/a (if i understand your direction), the issue remains 
 unproven i suspect, considering how atheists and agnostics so often 
 look to reason. atheist, it is reasonable to conclude will not agree.
 for agnostics, a poll seems in order. who knows?  myself, i'm not so 
 sure the atheists can be counted out. 
 
 for the orthodox, i wonder how many would follow moses, or abraham,
 or david in accepting god's word? is the particular covenant to which
 one adheres, more important than god promisimg? i reckon for many it
 depends on the ongoing dialogue. under these considerations, you might 
 understand why i think it's premature to assert who will and won't agree.
