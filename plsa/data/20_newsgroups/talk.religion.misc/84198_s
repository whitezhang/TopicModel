 	take a second look at "non-toxic, non-flammable":
 
 		mace (sold tothe public) is supposedly nontoxic.
 		whatthey do not tell you is that if you get mace directly
 		on the linings of the lungs (such as a direct snort to
 		the face) above certain quantities, it reacts similarly
 		to a mustard gas inhalation.
 
 			i know:  my father and grandfather were exposed
 			to poison gas in wwi and wwii; dad went through
 			the side effects of any weapon, including those
 			"non-toxic" aerosols.
 
 		what the label actually means is ::
 
 			usually, it wont kill you
 			it may give you permanent css asthsma
 			but that's better than blowing a hole in your
 				head ...
 
 		all aerosols are flammable if you have enough oxygen
 		and hit it with the right igniter.  some of the most
 		non-flammable substances known will boom or searflame
 		if you hit it with the right combo.
 
 
 		let's take one:  a trash can fire.  makes black smoke;
 		already burned right?  can't go boom, right?  wrong.
 
 		suck that smoke (made up of paper that has carbonized,
 		or burned about 35% of the fuel in it) into an air
 		conditioning return, mix with about 5:1 air, and light
 		a match.  200 feet of conduit is about the same, when
 		filled with that smoke mixture, as oh, say 200 pounds tnt
 
 			that is why the fire codes say no open ceiling
 			tiles in buildings.  because 3-5 stories of
 			a building have blown out by "nonflammable _smoke_"
 
 	so:
 		take a little "nonflammable aerosol"
 		mix with gasoline or kerosene fumes
 
 			no electricity, remeber?  a bit of heating
 			on the waco plains?  boil water to drink
 			since the water was cut off?
 
 		liberally mix and allow to settle for 1-4 hours
 
 		fumes vent down into the bus underground, and the davidians
 		move the children upstairs to a saferoom (they had one,
 		armor plated, remember?) to breath, because kids get sick
 		and die from tear gas.
 
 		and along comes a tracer, a spark, what have you:
 
 			everyone burns to death.
 
 try thinking before opening mouth: it may not have happened the
 way the gmen say it did.
