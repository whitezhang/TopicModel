 
 	there are actually a few important things we can glean from this mess:
 1)	when they start getting desperate for an answer to the question: "what's
 it all about. mr. natural?", pinkboys will buy darn near *anything*, which
 means:
 2)	there's still plenty of $$$$ to be made in the false jesus business
 by enterprising subgenii.  just remember that:
 3)	once you've separated the pinks from their green, don't blow it all
 on automatic weapons from mexico.  put it in a swiss bank account.  smile a
 lot.  have your flunkies hand out flowers in airports.  the con will just
 shrug you off as long as:
 4)	you never, never, never start to believe your own bulldada!  if
 "david koresh" hand't started swallowing his own "apocalypso now" crap, he'd
 be working crossword puzzles in the bahamas today instead of contributing to
 the mulch layer in waco.  this is because:
 5)	when you start shooting at cops, they're likely to shoot back.  and 
 most of 'em are better shots than you are.
 
 	in short:
 	- p.t. barnum was right 
 		and
 	- stupidity is self-correcting
 thus endeth the lesson.
