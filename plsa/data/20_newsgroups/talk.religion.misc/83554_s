 	yes:
 
 	if one's particular goal is to land a man on the moon, or to 
 put a communication sattelite into a orbit within which it will operate; 
 then orbital astronomy will be more important.
 
 	however, if one is a particular fan sonic's singing, or a competator 
 of sonic, say mario and the toadstools; knowing when he will record an ablum 
 would be more important.
 
 	i fail to see how this is connected in any way, nor where you are 
 driving too.
