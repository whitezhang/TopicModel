 if the children are not being fed, whose fault is that?  you and i
 have plenty of food on our tables while others starve.  why is that?
 god gave us this earth to manage.  i don't think we're doing a very
 good job of it.  the only consolation i have for those suffering
 children is that they will be received into the kingdom of heaven
 where they will never thirst and never hunger again.
 
 peace be with you,
