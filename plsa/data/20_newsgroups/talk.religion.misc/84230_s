 yes, that's true, but you have to be clear exactly what is
 an uninterpreted observation. it's pretty low level stuff.
 'the sun shines' is already a lot higher level than that. we
 can agree that 'i perceive brightness' perhaps.

 huh? what do you mean 'all in the same situation?' let's take me
 and dennis kriz as examples. we're in pretty different situations,
 but i think we can agree as to whether it's day or night. i don't
 think we can agree as to whether or not abortion is morally
 acceptable. yet we are certainly in the same difference of
 situations with respect to each other. looks like weasel-words
 to me, frank.

 that's up to you, i guess.

 this 'different situations' stuff is pretty confusing, frank. how
 do we decide if we are in the same situation? you mind explaining?

 huh? i don't think so. i think that people disagree about
 fundamental goals.
