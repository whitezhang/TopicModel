 and we do not end perfect either.  we are never perfect.  can you name
 one person, young or old, past or present, that you deem perfect? 
 good luck.

 then you lie to yourself.  you do not know your shortcomings.  i have clearly
 shown one of your shortcomings, if not two.  that is, ignorance of the bible
 and the arrogance you demonstrate butchering it without even knowing its 
 contents.
 
 > i regard christ as a myth. 
 
 because you have been too prideful to examine the record of him for yourself.
 and to demonstate your lack of support for your conclusion, i bet you do not
 even know what the word "christ" means.  or which prophet used "christ" to 
 describe the "son of man".

 yes.  i agree with that.  so we must learn first.  read the bible.  come
 up with our own interpretation.   evaluate what is being said
 and by whom.  check the history books as well.  compare someone else's
 interpretation with your own.  then make a judgment.  but i tell you the
 truth, 99% of what is being said in the bible needs interpretation as 
 much as a coffee cup needs interpretation.
 
 and remember, the bible isn't a guru's esoteric guide to metaphysics.  
 it doesn't take a theologian to understand what is being said.    the 
 bible is a bunch of testimonies from people like you and i addressed 
 to people like you and i.  these guys wrote down what they saw and heard.  is it 
 their open diary--and they want to tell you something.  and because they
 want you to know something, they make it very clear what they want you to
 know.   they didn't encouch their ideas in esoteric rhetoric, but in simple
 straight-forward language.

 you have chosen the road that avoids the bible.  you have chosen the
 road that avoids a confrontation with the living god because that
 road doesn't look appealing to you.  you rather build your own road.  one
 that goes far away from that confrontation.   but be assured of this,
 you will have to confront him one day willingly or unwillingly.

 i see what you mean.  i hear what your saying.  i am not degrading your
 life.  but i have heard the same irrational excuses for years.  there is nothing 
 new in what you are saying.  and by your own words, you are "spouting off" 
 contradictions.   if contradictions give you meaning, then your life must
 be sad.

 bingo.  for god so loved the world, he gave his only begotton to son
 so that whososever belives in him will have ever lasting life.   i look
 what god *did*.  he has given his son, even to his death, so that i can have 
 hope in his resurrection and know that life isn't for nothing, but has
 glorious purpose.
 
 > you can't even convince me that it exists! 
 
 because you turn your eyes away from testimony and history.  you choose to
 lie to yourself that he doesn't exist, for you ignore what has been said for 
 thousands of years.  you sound exactly, almost verbatim, like the lazarus of 
 jesus's story starting in luke 16:19.  and the conclusion of that story is a 
 bleak one.  lazarus wound up in hell.  the story ends like this:
 
       "for if lazarus doesn't even listen to moses and the prophets,
        he won't even believe if a man rose from the dead."

 arrogance at its best.   the fact is, you are not rational.  several specific
 cases  have already been cited.   and again with this new statement, you show more irrationality with regards to heaven.  jesus does tell you something of what to expect
 in heaven.  jesus expects you to use your brain to believe in him.  jesus does
 not expect you to placate either.  jesus wants you to willingly come to him, but not
 as his grovelling slave, but rather as his brother who will share in his
 glorious riches.  why do you not pick up the bible and read it for yourself.  
 you maintain you have an open mind.  see whether you are lying to yourself for
 yourself.

 >that paragraph demonstrates that you haven't listened to a single word
 >i've said.
 
 i do understand what you said.   but that's is not what i feel went amiss here.
 
 you missed the point.  living a "good life" has no eternal consequences.
 once they close the amusement park of life, to you that is the end.  to you, it 
 is over.  to you, therefore, your time spent in the amusement park is meaningless. 
 it has no eternal consequences to you nor to anyone left on earth. 
 
 but then you contradict yourself.  from a previous post, you said doing evil things 
 is bad.  to you, it shouldn't matter if you do evil things or good things.  it is
 all meaningless in the end anyway.  so go rob a bank.  go tell someone
 you dislike that he is a dirty rotten slime bag.  what's restraining you?
 life after all, has no eternal consequences and accountability is irrelevant.

 at which time, you are truly not the master of yourself.

 so you (and your holy book) say.  by the same token, therefore, santa
 claus delivers toys every xmas.  don't you see?  i have no reason to
 believe that what you say is true.  please give me some reason that i
 can't similarly apply to santa claus.
 
 you have every reason to believe that what jesus says and the witnesses
 of jesus say are true.  but you choose to be unreasonable and "ignore" the
 reasons.  by definition, "ignorance". 
 
 santa claus is said to live at the north pole and have a squad of elves
 and flying reindeer.   ever see a flying reindeer?  has anyone in human
 history seen a flying reindeer?  has anyone seen a reindeer whose nose 
 blinks red?    
 
 on the other hand, are people born in bethlehem?  was nebuchandezzar really
 a king?  was daniel really one of his court officials?  were david and solomon
 really kings of israel and judah?  was their really a king called jehoachin?
 did sennecherib really attack jerusalem 600 years before christ?  did
 sennacherib really lose his battle--and badly?   was there really a 
 caiaphas who interrogated jesus?   yes, yes, yes . . . history verifies
 it.  it is nonfiction.
 
 do you have a problem discerning truth from fiction?  perhaps you
 can't evaluate the context of grimm's fairy tales apart from
 that of the scientific american.  i suppose you treat both with equal
 truthfulness or equal falsity.  is this what you are telling me?  or
 is it that just do want to read the scientific american and find out
 that it's not a fairy tale?

 get real.  have you ever been to zaire?  do you have to go there
 to be  assured that there really is such a place?  given your 
 irrationality, i take it you have never used a map in your life.
 
 > why do you believe what you believe?
 
 given the overwhelming evidence as well as my personal experience with the living
 god, i'd be an irrational unreasoning ignorant fool if i didn't follow jesus.
