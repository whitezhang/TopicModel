 an extremely good example of "circumstantial evidence!"
 every time these right-wing control-freaks start spouting
 about prayer in schools, i get this nagging commentary
 from the sermon on the mount [matt: 6:5-6] "and when you
 pray, do not imitate the hypocrites: they love to say their
 prayers standing up in the synagogues and at the street
 corners for people to see them.  i tell you solemnly, they
 have had their reward.  but when you pray, go to your
 private room and, when you have shut your door, pray to
 your father who is in that secret place."
 
 but no. they want public prayers, the better to manipulate
 children.  "amen" indeed.

 i hope you don't mind if i say "amen" to this? :-)
