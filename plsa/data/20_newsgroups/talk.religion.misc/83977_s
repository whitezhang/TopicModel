     interesting idea.
 
     this suggestion has inspired me to post, under the title "theories 
 of creation", a collection of various "philosophies" of creation that 
 i am aware of.  could you explain which of these theories you would
 want taught, and which ones you would not?  or, perhaps, i haven't
 included a favorite theory of yours (if so, could you describe it for
 me for inclusion in an updated list)?
