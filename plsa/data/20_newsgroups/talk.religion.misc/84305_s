 i am not exactly known as a flower child pacifist, but lets call
 cowpoop cowpoop.
 
 "the peaceful attempt to serve the warrant" consisted of the following
 actions, in order:
 
 1) batf agents forcing their entry of the "compound" through second
 story windows.
 
 2) batf agents loosing some grenades (allegedly "stun" or "flash"
 grenades) which promptly detonated.
 
 *after* which, according to the tapes i have seen, the b-d
 started shooting back.
 
 now exactly how is it that someone breaking into private property
 and tossing grenades around is considered "peaceful" by
 *anyone*? you *think* on that.
 
 (which is not to say i do not still hold my previous and
 entirely correct notions about what should be worn and
 what arms should be used in assaulting a building.)
