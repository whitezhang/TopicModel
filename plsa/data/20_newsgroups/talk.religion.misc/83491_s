 christian anti-semitism comes from the obvious fact that the jews should
 know the hebrew scriptures better than anyone else, yet they did not
 convert to christianity en mass, thus rejecting "christian love."

 i don't see why not. where are the rest of the tribal people? what
 happened to the tribes of the americas? culture is seen as different and
 undesirable in the west, particular in the us with its failed "melting
 pot concept." most tribes have been hunted to extinction, the hebrew
 tribe is one of the few survivers from the neolithic. of course it
 becomes difficult at times to separate christianity from the western
 experience, so perhaps you are right, perhaps it would have been a better 
 world if the cultural experiment in christianity never happened.
