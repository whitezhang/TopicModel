 you have clearly demonstrated that you do not even know
 what my religion is in order to make that assumption.

 how i can present any argument when you put your hands over your
 eyes and devise new irrevelant excuses each time?  the fact remains,
 you want to argue about something that you do not know anything about.
 do you not have to learn a topic first before you can reasonably debate
 the topic?  
 
 which brings us about to the start of this thread.  you began
 perverting bible verses, interpreting them without investigation.
 for if you desired to investigate, you would have changed your
 tune immediately.   thus it is clear to me.  you do not believe
 what i am saying because "you don't want to" check it out.

 then you must have also ignored every other post i have written
 to you.  this would seem to go along with your character.
 
 
 brian, it doesn't offend me if you decide to reject jesus
 christ.  i only wish you would make that decision after you
 learn who jesus is.
