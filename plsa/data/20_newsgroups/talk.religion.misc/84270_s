 looking at your discussion i would say that you both operate
 from your own reference frame. there's no inside and no outside,
 there are just two polarized views. as for statements inside the
 bible, things are still not that clear, we don't have any indications
 for instance why jobs was placed in the old testament, one of the 
 few books that actually talks about satan. jobs is very much out
 of line with the rest of the ot books, and there's a chance that
 someone added this book later into the group of ot scriptures.

 this operates the other way around as well. you have to understand
 the mind of an atheist, agnostic, or as in my case, a radical
 relativist. if you don't understand the underlying concepts, it is 
 pretty hard to continue with a dialogue. i'm not a perfect christian,
 however about 20+ years of christian teaching should have provided
 me with a pretty good picture of the christian mind frame.
 
 cheers,
 kent
