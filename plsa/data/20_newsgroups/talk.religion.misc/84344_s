 i use it to refer to those christians who take a more
 conservative-literalist approach to the bible, as distinct from
 "liberals".

 i would use the word "christian" (unqualified) to describe someone to
 whom the above definition applied.  btw, it applies to me.
 
 [deletia: joe gaut indicates his interest in the bd disaster is from a
 civil liberties issue, not an attempt to justify koresh's beliefs
 and/or practices.]
 
 i agree with joe about this: if some group wants to believe in
 whatever god or invisible pink unicorns and go off and live together
 and have group sex, or no sex, or sex only for the leaders (but not
 with children), then, as much as i might believe them to be misguided,
 i think they should have the legal right.  and i hope the
 investigation will start by determining whether the feds had any
 *legitimate* reason for going after koresh in the first place (before
 moving on to consider the wisdom of various tactics used).
 
 [joe goes on to dispute the child-abuse allegations.  i'll
 (provisionally) accept this, unless someone has evidence to support
 the allegations?]
 
 actually i wasn't thinking about the (alleged) child abuse, but about
 the reports that he had sex with, and fathered children by, several
 women in the cult.  i agree this is not a legal matter - consenting
 adults and all that - but stephen tice seems to be defending koresh's
 beliefs and practices from specifically *christian* perspective, not a
 civil liberties perspective.  
 
 i think my question is not really aimed at joe (and possibly not at
 ray cote either, who seems to also be taking the political angle), but
 at stephen tice.
