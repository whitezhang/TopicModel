 	it's amazing how everyone automatically blames one side or the other.
 	one thing for sure:  koresh will have no chance to defend himself
 	against the statements (lacking in fact or court sponsored verification)
 	made  by agents who participated in the situation that killed him.
 
 		i don't know they murdered him; i also don't know
 		that the branch davidians set a fire and suicidede.

 		comments in advance of forensic pathology.

 	bingo.  am i the only one  to notice:
 	a)	no peaceful attempt to serve a warrant.
 	b)	six months to develop a scene and six days to end it?
 	c)	.... ah god:
 
 			25 children
 			at least 64 adults
 			plus 6 at the beginning
 			and more batf agents
 
 			all dead.

 	has anyone asked themselves these questions:
 
 	1)  have you seen the entire video sequences taken during the
 	  opening rounds?  i seem to recall missing several key parts:
 		a)  the first five minutes of day one; only the shooting
 		  part comes out.
 		b)  what happened to the feds video units?  you mean they do
 		  not carry helmet cams?  wonder why not?
 	2)   how is it you can have camera crews with live transmission
 	  video present and not have an uninterrupted record?
 
 		a)  you realize the units carry ittle bitty 8mm backups?
 			that hold 90 minutes per unit?  and there are
 			twounits on the professional handhelds (so no
 			tape turnover gaps)?
 		b)  until all views are seen, it is premature to point
 			fingers in either direction.
 
 	as you well point out, stephen.

 	yes.  but it is so hard toremain human under the full

 	more to the point:  when someone dies (almost like it was intended
 	that way), both sides will kill to maintain their innocence --
 		a contradiction in terms.

 	true.  usually i pick the unpopular side and point out
 	from the evidence seen what might have alternatively happened.

 	this requires someone interested in god's will.  please note
 	that the outstanding _overt_ problem in this country today
 	is one where the government:
 
 		wants caesar's coin to pay off the debt.

 	and if it is not spent towards that end, _no_one_ deserves
 	the coin.

 	i wish you were wrong.  many pundits are saying 3 years.

 	exposure to the damned (pardon me) american divorce attorney
 	is:
 
 		i have no money left to lose to taxes or inflation.

 	25 children dead.  if anyone thinks blaming koresh -- or the batf
 	helps this any at all, is sick.  and wrong.
 
 		the reason you can tell that the batf may not be entirely
 		straight on this is that the leaders at press conferences
 		havew made any comments about even the possibility that
 		koresh or his followers caused this.
 
 		the batf agentss are more concerned with their repuations
 		and morals ("not my fault, koresh did it!") than they
 		are with:
 
 			25 dead children.
 
 	same goes for koresh & his followers - who are all (mostly) dead.

 	the day i _need_ a gun or abomb to protect myself in this
 	society is the day that society is already beyond redemption
 
 		and that aint' redundant, if you have any christian
 		belief aytall.
 
 	... and the day that i cannot peacefully enjoin others in the
 	act that thoreau called civil disobedience to rectify the
 	wrongs that my society practises, without undue harm or
 	punishment befalling me, is the day that society has ceased to
 	be a human society, and become a society of animals.
 
 		we are _very_ cclose to that.

 	six years fighting an unjust court issue:  still struggling to be
 	patient.
 
 for those who like contrary questions:
 
 	nb:  i was not there.  i am not a branch davidian nor a     law
 	official hater.  i do hate liars or the six letter variety of same.
 	the official side has its advocates already; lets balance the
 	equation and asj a few questions on the other side, for the sake
 	of an old saw the batf abd fbi seem to want to bypass:
 
 		innocent until proven guilty.
 	not
 		innocent until presumed guilty.
 
 	1)  where are the video tapes from the tanks?  all of them.
 
 		don't tell me they do not exist.  they are standard
 		equipment.
 
 	2)  so you think koresh fired the place, because of the explosion?
 
 		a)  tear gas comes with an aerosol to spread it.  this
 		  aerosol is deliberately made to be as non-flammable
 		  as possible.  it is as non-flammable as possible.
 
 			.... gotcha!
 
 		  ... when in isolation from other substances.
 
 		  why was a pipe deliveryu system used rather than remote
 		  launchers?  why did the fbi not announce "this window,
 		  blown in plus tear gas, five minutes; then the wall come
 		  down", and maintain a left to right sequence?
 
 		b)  most aerosols also have a secondary compound, that when
 		  mixed in, becomes a very flammable (and difficult to trace)
 		  suspension, with a very special property:  exposure to
 		  brief eruptions of high heat (muzzle blasts) or long
 		  exposure to low heat (matches, a stove) will not tend
 		  to ignite.
 
 			what other chemicals come up in the forensics?
 			who else will be allowed to test the site?
 
 		c)  after a few minutes to hours (ifdesired, the combnation
 		  rate can be controlled as desired), the mixture can be made
 		  to become veryignitable onb exposure to a temperature
 		  above a certain point (a tracer round) for a certain
 		  heat quantity (a small explosive charge) or for a length
 		  of time (start a wall fire and wait).
 
 			check your military records; look at the tapes.
 			why were tanks (large capacity delivey systems),
 			tear gas (why not somnorifics?), and now (why
 			the hurry. was there still a comm channel open
 			to the outside?).
 
 			do you see any trace of fire coming back to the
 			compound in the videos?  all the videos?  which ones
 			are missing?
 
 	do i sound paranoid?  maybe.  am i? probably not.
 	you trust the fbi and batf  to render judgement?
 		in advance of a court?  god help us.
 			(for we are surely not helping ourselves).
 	you trut the federal gevernment to give us a clean slate?
 
 		you are 4.3 trillion (admitted!) down and counting.
 		look again.
 
 	did it happen that way?  i do not know.  i was not there.
 		and it should wait for a court to decide.
 	but will that happen?  89 people will not have the chance
 		to tell their side as the batf leader was, on camera.
 
 no one wins.  except:  more force next time.
 
 	listen to your hearts, people.
 
 thanx again stephen.
