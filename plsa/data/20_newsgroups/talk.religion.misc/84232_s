 possibly the parallel just stems from your tending to use bad sources...
 anyway, don't you think that similarity is rather shallow?  you're only
 looking at the surface, at the way of argumentation.  
 and now you should perhaps go a little deeper and try to find the difference,
 for example, find out whether you can find real science done by hitching.
 if you can't, will you then admit that your attempt at quoting an authority
 has backfired?

 and if that doesn't sound reasonable to you, you'll just have to accept it...
