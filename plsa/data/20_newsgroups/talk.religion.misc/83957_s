 like "it is held that..." (cf. "kermit" thread).  on what exact body of
 theology are you drawing for what you call "orthodox?"  who is that "holds
 that" luke meant what you said he meant?  whenever your personal interpretation
 of biblical passages is challenged, your only response seems
 to be that one needs merely to "look at the bible" in order to see the truth,
 but what of those who see biblical things differently from you?  are we to
 simply assume that you are the only one who really understands it?
   just curious,
