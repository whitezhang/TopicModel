 no.  it follows from the fact that most christians' choice of
 interpretation stems from a mix of beliefs that are influenced by
 the secular ethics of their culture and that are not fully
 determined by scripture.  whether or not there is some "right"
 interpretation matters not; few christians claim the ability to
 read the mind of their god.  dave davis should note that it was
 michael who first stated the importance of secular and cultural
 influence in this thread.  i think michael is right in this, but
 regardless, it should be noted that this has *not* been a point
 of contention between michael and myself. 
 
 i have argued -- beyond michael's claims -- that the christian
 scriptures are open to so many interpretations -- including a
 wide divergence within the christian tradition -- that even their
 most important themes are vague.  again, it does not matter that
 there is some "right" interpretation *unless* there is a way to
 determine what that "right" interpretation is.  it is the lack of
 an objective measure, not the presumed lack of an answer, that
 puts the force behind the line i argue.

 there are enough christian glasses, varying over a sufficiently
 broad range of color, that i can find a few that support my
 example.

 in my opinion, what makes michael radical is that he fully
 acknowledges that christian scripture and tradition fail to
 determine the doctrines that so many branches within christianity
 hold dear.  he is willing to live and practice his religion
 within this indeterminacy, and he is willing to acknowledge that
 much of his understanding of things christian is influenced by
 ideas that are not purely christian.  those christians i have
 called conservative must also interpret, but they do not
 recognize -- or at least, are unwilling to admit -- the extent and
 importance of this.

 i recognize that michael is part of the tradition.  but what does
 it tell one about a tradition covering origen, aquinas, jerry
 fallwell, and jesse jackson that it also includes michael siemon?
 not very much!

 i think the conclusion does follow.  the purely christian
 principles that michael has are the ones he shares with others in
 the christian tradition or that can be derived from christian
 scripture.  these, necessarily vague, are not enough to drive his
 political stances.  that one should love one's neighbor is a 
 purely christian principle.  that this means showing tolerance 
 for homosexuality is *not*.
 
 as to these political stances, they are often at odds with what
 is commonly held in most of current christendom, and so i 
 suspect they could be better pressed outside it.  (on the other
 hand, i can well understand the counterpoint, that these 
 political stances become most influential when presented to 
 those who need them most.)

 having barely survived the effort to finish in computer science, i
 doubt i will attempt a more difficult field any time soon!
