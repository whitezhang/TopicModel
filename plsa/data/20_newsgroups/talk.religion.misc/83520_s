 
 on the subject of how many competing rc orders there are, let me point out the
 golden dawn is only the *outer* order of that tradition.  the inner order is
 the roseae rubeae et aurae crucis.  that's ruby rose and gold cross, in rough
 translation.  the g.'.d.'. is a rosicrucian order, as are all derivative
 groups.  of course, real rosicrucians never admit to being rosicrucian.
 
 enjoy the journey!
