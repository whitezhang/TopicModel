 the two commandments *are* rules; they are merely rules that are
 so vague that they are practically devoid of meaning.  michael
 siemon acknowledges this every time he writes that the resolution
 of an argument over them turns on secular and cultural
 assumptions that are independent of these rules.

 the commandment to love your neighbor as yourself can be viewed,
 in part, as reminding man that he is not god and cannot act as if
 he has "ultimate responsibility." indeed, many traditions present
 an interpretation where believers are supposed to interpret
 loving one's neighbor as following various other rules, and
 relying on their god to make things come out right, precisely
 because it would be wrong for man to assume such "ultimate
 responsibility." once again, we are confronted with good sounding
 goo that means whatever the reader wants it to mean.

 and who is to say that this interpretation is "twisted"?  there
 are many passages in the bible that in their most straightforward
 reading show the christian god behaving in just this way.
 michael cannot refer to "base" claims or base commandments to
 show that such readings are "twisted," because this divergence in
 understanding occurs even in trying to interpret the "base"
 claims and commandments.  in addressing conservative christians,
 michael will necessarily draw upon secular and cultural notions
 that these conservative christians will reject.

 but these base commandments are too vague to serve as  "a
 principle for the critique of ethical systems." the meaning of
 these base commandments for any believer derives from the secular
 and cultural notions that the believer brings to them, from how
 the believer mixes their demands with straightforward readings of
 other biblical passages, from a particular sectarian tradition,
 or from some combination of these things.  these commandments
 lack sufficient substance in themself to serve as a basis for
 criticizing ethical systems.  what meaning they have comes from
 the ethical system the believer brings to these commandments.

 jesus explicitly states that this summarizes jewish law, which
 would seem to bring in all of it if we properly understand what
 it means to love god and love our neighbors.  there are *many*
 parables and teachings the gospels attribute to jesus that are
 straightforwardly read as ethical commandments.  the pauline
 epistles are similarly full.  if it is not clear that these all
 come together in a sensible understanding of ethical behavior,
 the problem is *not* a lack of raw material.

 no, michael, the conservative christians also take the gospel 
 seriously.  what differentiates you is the way you interpret the
 gospel.

 in a sense, the wide variety of interpretations does tell us
 something about christianity.  it tells us that the new testament
 authors left a sufficiently vague hodge-podge that it can serve
 as the source text for many, vastly different beliefs about the
 nature of the christian god and about what men should and
 shouldn't do. 
 
 the irony here is that there is *nothing* in christianity per
 se that michael can use to support the cause of lesbians and
 gays.  *every* christian principle he turns to this cause is
 effective only through the extra-christian principles through
 which michael interprets his religion, and the homophobes apply
 the *same* christian principles, with equal justification, to
 their cause.  in short, it is the extra-christian principles that
 make michael's christianity beneficial, and i suspect they would
 be as beneficial, perhaps moreso, without being filtered by
 christian interpretation.  
 
 michael paints a picture of "standard american atheism" as the
 rejection of the evil in many conservative christian
 interpretations of the bible.  but i think it is even more
 damaging to christianity to note that the new testament presents
 such a vague hodge-podge of notions about the nature of god and
 the nature of the good (except, of course, when it is ordered by
 an interpretation that relies on extraneous principles).  here, i
 think we should apply a christian parable, where a cold drink can
 have its value and a hot drink can have its value, but the
 lukewarm we should spit out.
