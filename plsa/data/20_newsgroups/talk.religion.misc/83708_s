 i appreciate the narrow-mindedness of the view expressed in
 the text you quoted.  i also appreciate your being amused
 by such determined ignorance.  without taking anything away
 from your mirth, i want to say that these views sadden me.
 i can only hope that that sort of narrow-mindedness will
 die with the generations that have promoted it.  teach 
 your children well.
