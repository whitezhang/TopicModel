 how does husserl deal with the problem of recursion?  if 
 intentionality lies behind the actions of a des chip, then
 intentionality of *what*, and what lies behind the phenomena 
 in the world of this "what"?   is there a grounding stage in
 a world of pure phenomena with no intentionality behind them, 
 or do we have an infinite series of worlds?   if there is a
 grounding stage, how do we know we're not it?
