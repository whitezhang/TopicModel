 i hope i didn't award custody, rich.  i purposely used "handle" in order to 
 avoid doing so - i.e., that happens to be what religions do (of course there are
 aberrations like "scientific" creationism).  i used "best" in part to indicate 
 that science currently has a time of it with why and who, so these domains are
 mostly ignored.  i also attempted to be brief, which no doubt confused the
 matter.  as an aside, for science i should have written "how and when".  nobody
 seems to argue over what.

 seems to me that the answer would vary from individual to individual.  i'm not
 trying to be evasive on this, but from a societal perspective, religion works.
 on the other hand, sometimes it is abused and misused, and many suffer, which
 you know.  but the net result seems positive, this from the anthropological
 perspective on human affairs.  you might call me a neo-fruedian insofar as i 
 think the masses can't get along without religion.  not that generally they are 
 incapable; they just don't, and for myriad reasons, but the main one seems to 
 be the promise of immortality.  very seductive, that immortality.  therefore 
 it seems that theologians are better equipped than the others you mention for 
 dispensing answers to "who and why".  i suggest that this holds regardless of 
 the "truth" in their answers to who and why simply because people believe.  
 in the end, spiritual beliefs are just as "real" as scientific facts and 
 explanation (caution to some: do not take this out of context).  
 
 >do you suggest that the "who and why" will forever be closed to scientific 
 >investigation?
 
 no.  in fact, i don't think it is closed now, at least for some individuals. 
 isn't there a group of theoretical physicists who argue that matter was 
 created from nothing in a big bang singularity?  this approach might 
 presuppose an absence of who and why, except that it seems it could be argued 
 that something had to be responsible for nothing?  maybe that something doesn't
 have to be supernatural, maybe just mechanistic.  but that's a tough one for
 people today to grasp.  in any case, theory without empirical data is not 
 explanation, but then your question does not require data.  in other words, 
 i agree that theorizing (within scientific parameters) is just as scientific 
 as explaining.  so the answer is, who and why are not closed to scientists, but 
 i sense that science in these realms is currently very inadequate.  data will 
 be necessary for improvement, and that seems a long way off, if ever.  pretty 
 convoluted here; i hope i've made sense.

 i agree generally.  but i prefer to put it this way - the *questions* of how, 
 when, who and why were not open to inquiry.  during the enlightenment, 
 reason was reponsible for questioning the theological answers to how and when, 
 and not, for the most part, who and why.  science was thus born out of the 
 naturalists' curiosity, eventually carting away the how and when while largely 
 leaving behind the who and why.  the ignorant, the selfish, the intolerant, and
 the arrogant, of course, still claim authority in all four domains.

 much obliged.  funny how facts tend to muddle things, isn't it?  well, i am
 sure there are plenty of "scientific" creationist "rebuttals" out there 
 somewhere, even if they have to be created from nothing.
