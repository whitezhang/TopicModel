 how incredibly fucking stupid.  of *course* the text is referring to the city
 itself (buildings, bricks, mortar, etc.)  otherwise it makes no sense to
 refer to the future of tyre as being reduced to nothing but a _place_ to spread 
 fishing nets.
 
 is there any twisting of text or semantic game that you *won't* do to preserve 
 your faith from admission of error, decenso?
