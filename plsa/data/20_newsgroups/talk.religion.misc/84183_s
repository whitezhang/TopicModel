 of course.  the feast was the seder, and the accounts of it are very clear
 on this point.
 
 the difference is the connection between the bread and wine and the body
 and blood of god.  this is an old association of the tammuz/osiris/mithras
 line, and not really related to judaism.  in any case, i didn't really
 intend to argue the point.  i saw a possible association and pointed it
 out, but i haven't the foggiest notion what really happened.
