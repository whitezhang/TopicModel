 how would someone named "dennis" be stuck paying for "abortion
 coverage" ... if abortion is put under a catagory of a "general
 medical procedure."  you have to ask the insurer: "would my policy
 cover an abortion?" to find out.  if it does, you should have a
 right to decline that "coverage" if you don't want it.
 
 the basic premise in private insurance is that you pay for the
 coverage you want.  if basically you want "catastrophic coverage"
 you get a policy with a high deductible (with a correspondingly
 lower premium).  similarly, you don't have to be compelled to
 take on a policy covering things like liposuction or hair
 transplantation, if you don't want that kind of coverage, again,
 at a corresponding savings to you.
 
 if you don't want to be "covered" for abortion, you should not be
 compelled to.  to millions of christians, abortion is not a
 "gynocological examination" or a "pap smear."  to them abortion
 is murder.  to them, being "covered for abortion" means that they
 are paying for a "service," which they think is evil, clearly
 don't want, and will never use.  in such a case, all that is
 happening is that they are being compelled to help pay for other
 people's abortions.
 
 when you are being forced to buy something you don't want and
 will never use, this is called extortion.
 
 when the mafia tells a restaurant owner to "buy" a "juke-box" for
 the owner's "protection" this is called racketeering. 
 
 and if one's access to health care is held hostage to signing a
 defacto "loyalty oath" in support of abortion, by promising to
 help pay for other people's abortions (when one is clearly
 opposed to this procedure) this is tantamount to the same thing.
