 i share dennis's outrage over a similar manner.  i have recently become aware
 that my health insurance includes coverage for illness and injuries
 suffered by christians.  it disturbs me deeply to know that my premiums
 may be used to pay for that which i sincerely believe is divine
 punishment for their sinful conduct.  in addition these folks are able to
 avail themselves of such alternative therapies as lourdes, fatima,
 morris cerullo, benny hinn, etc.  in any case as "jesus saves' i feel
 that there is no reason for them to be covering their bets at my
 expense.  i would like to request that i be exempted from christian
 coverage with my health premiums reduced accordingly.
