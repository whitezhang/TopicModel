 my last response in this thread fell into a bit-bucket and vanished
 (though appearing locally).  i'll repost it, since i always feel
 slighted when someone appears to ignore one of my postings in a
 conversational thread, i don't want rob to think i'm doing so.  since
 this is now dated, however, don't feel compelled to respond...

 i suspect you meant this in context of the jewish tradition you have
 been referring to; one problem with a highly-interpreted tradition
 like this is what happens when a schism occurs, and over time certain
 large and influential branches of the heretical group come to favor
 exactly a "face value" interpretation...

 while the context of the time is important, value judgments must
 ultimately be according to current understanding, or at least to some
 base standard (relative stability/success of a society, e.g.).  this
 is obviously true in comparing it to practices of surrounding people,
 for instance: according to the bible, the surrounding people were
 immoral savages with repulsive and inhuman habits.  we need to look
 rather at what those peoples were *really* like.  for instance, in
 what way is it better to worship a single god whose presence is
 symbolically strongest in a tent or temple over multiple gods some of
 whose presence is symbolically represented in a statue?  by the
 bible's own terms idolatry is inherently evil, but i see no evidence
 that the followers of the various other religions of the area and time
 were particularly bad people, relative to the people in the bible.

 sounds good, but it presupposes teeth-rending neighbors, which i see
 no support for.  one can argue that post-facto assertion of inhumane
 neighbors can be used to make moral points, but that doesn't mean that
 the actual neighbors really were inhuman.  more to the point, such
 dehumanization of the people across the river or over the mountain, or
 even of a different people dwelling among us, is all too common.

 note that i'm speaking of historical interpretation here, for instance
 claiming that hammurabi's "an eye for an eye" was primitive brutal
 retribution, while moses' version was an enlightened benign fine
 (because the tradition has since interpreted the phrase that way).  as
 of 3000 years ago or so, they probably both meant the same thing.

 i don't belittle the accomplishments, particularly the intellectual
 ones, of the jewish people.  i have given up on trying to think by
 analogy, since i don't know of any other 'tribe' that is at all
 similar (the closest i can think of are the romany, but i don't know
 enough about them to make a meaningful comparison).  i think a
 tradition of reflective study, of flexible rather than dogmatic
 interpretation, is a good thing.  i think that with such an attitude a
 case could be made that you could have done as well starting with a
 1943 captain america comic (or whatever the babylonian equivalent
 would have been).
