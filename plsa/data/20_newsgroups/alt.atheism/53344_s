 : the willingness of true believers
 : to die for their belief, be it in jesus or jim jones, is
 : well-documented, so martyrdom in and of itself says little.
 
 it does say something about the depth of their belief.  religion has
 both deluded believers and con men.  the difference is often how far
 they will follow their beliefs.
 
 i have no first hand, or even second hand, knowledge of how the 
 original apostles died.  if they began a myth in hopes of exploiting
 it for profit, and followed that myth to the death, that would be
 inconsistent.  real con men would bail out when it was obvious it would 
 lead to discomfort, pain and death.
 
 the story in 1 kings regarding the 450 prophets of baal is of no
 help in this debate.  one can easily assume that they believed that
 no overwhelming vindication of elijah would be forthcoming.  he was
 simply a fool, who would be shown to be so.  the fire from heaven was
 swift and their seizure and deaths were equally swift.
