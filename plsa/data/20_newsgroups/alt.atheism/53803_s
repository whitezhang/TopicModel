 on a similar note, a good friend of mine worked as a clerk in a
 chain bookstore.  several of his peers were amazing, one woman in
 particular:
 
 a customer asked her if they had _the autobiography of benjamin
 franklin_.  "who's it by?" was her first question.  then, "is he
 still alive?"  then, "is it fiction or non-fiction?" 
 
 finally my friend intervened, and showed the guy where it was.
  
 it makes one wonder what the standards of employment are.
