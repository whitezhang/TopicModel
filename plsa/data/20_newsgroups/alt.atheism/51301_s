 from what i read, the other fellow told salameh how to put it together
 over the phone.  the bomb was supposedly some sort of sophisticated
 type, so to put a (i assume complicated) sophisticated bomb together
 from instructions _over the phone_ (!) one must need some brains i would
 expect.

 i read this in an article in "the australian muslim times", the
 newspaper (weekly) of the australian muslim community.  
 
 if this is true, perhaps one of the muslims based in north america (if
 they see this posting) can elaborate.

 i don't deny this fact.
 
 the thrust of my argument here is that 
 
 (a) salameh is, according to us law, innocent as he has not been found
 guilty in a court of law.  as his guilt has not been established, it is
 wrong for people to make postings based on this assumption.
 
 (b) islam teaches us _not_ to harm innocents.  if muslims -- who perhaps
 have not realized that islam teaches this -- perform such actions, it is
 _not_ _because_ of the teachings of islam, but rather _in spite of_ and
 _in contradiction to_ the  teachings of islam.  this is an important 
 distinction.
 
 i should clarify what muslims usually mean when they say "muslim".  in
 general, anyone who calls themselves a "muslim" and does not do or 
 outwardly profess
 something in clear contradiction with the essential teachings of islam
 is considered to be a muslim.  thus, one who might do things contrary to
 islam (through ignorance, for example) does not suddenly _not_ become a
 muslim.  if one knowingly transgresses islamic teachings and essential
 principles, though, then one does leave islam.
 
 the term "muslim" is to be contrasted with "mu'min", which means "true
 believer".  however, whether a muslim is in reality a mu'min is
 something known only by god (and perhaps that person himself).  so you
 will not find the term mu'min used very much by muslims in alt.atheism,
 because it is not known to anybody (except myself and god), whether i,
 for example, am a "true believer" or not.  for example, i could just be
 putting on a show here, and in reality believe something opposite to
 what i write here, without anyone knowing.  thus, when we say "muslims"
 we mean all those who outwardly profess to follow islam, whether in
 practice they might, in ignorance, transgress islamic teachings.  by
 "muslim" we do not necessarily mean "mu'min", or "true believer" in
 islam.
