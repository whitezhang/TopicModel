 first of all, i'm not your buddy!  second, read what i wrote.  i'm not
 talking about what muslims are allowed to do, merely what *some*
 practice.  they consider themselves as muslim as you, so don't retort
 with the old and tired "they must not be true muslims" bullshit.  if i
 gave you the names what will you do with this information?  is a fatwa
 going to be leashed out against the perpetrators?  do you honestly think
 that someone who did it would voluntarily come forward and confess? 
 with the kind of extremism shown by your co-religionaries?  fat chance.
 
 at any rate, there can be no conclusive "proof" by the very nature of
 the act.  perhaps people that indulge in this practice agree with you in
 theory, but hope that allah will forgive them in the end.
 
 i think it's rather arrogant of you to pretend to speak for all muslims
 in this regard.  also, kind of silly.  are you insinuating that because
 the koranic law forbids it, there are no criminals in muslim countries? 
 
 this is as far as i care to go on this subject.  the weakness of your
 arguments are for all netters to see.  over and out...
