 i am one of those people who always willl have unlimited stores of unfounded
 respect for people who have been on newsgroups/mailing lists longer than i
 have, so you certainly have my sympathy tom.  i have only been semi-regularly
 posting (it is toughto keep up) since this february, but i have been reading
 and following the threads since last august: my school's newsreader was down
 for months and our incompetent computing services never bothered to find a new
 feed site, so it wasn't accepting outgoing postings.  i don't think anyone
 keeps track of where other posters go: it's that old love 'em and leave 'em
 internet for you again...
