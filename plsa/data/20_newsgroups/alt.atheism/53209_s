 but now you are contradicting yourself in a pretty massive way,
 and i don't think you've even noticed.
 
 in another part of this thread, you've been telling us that the
 "goal" of a natural morality is what animals do to survive.
 
 but suppose that your omniscient being told you that the long
 term survival of humanity requires us to exterminate some 
 other species, either terrestrial or alien.
 
 does that make it moral to do so?
