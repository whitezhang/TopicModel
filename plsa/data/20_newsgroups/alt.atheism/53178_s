 i don't feel that i'm preaching. i'm just trying to answer people's 
 questions and talking about my religion, my beliefs.
 when it comes to what i post, i don't do it with the intent of converting 
 anyone.  i don't expect for the atheists in this newsgroup to take what i 
 say with a grain of salt if they so wish.
 i just state what i beleve, they ask me how i believeit and why and we all 
 go on. 
 if that's preaching, then i'm soory and i'll get off the soapbox.
