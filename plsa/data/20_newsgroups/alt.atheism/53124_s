 converts to xtianity have this tendency to excessively darken their
 pre-xtian past, frequently falsely.  anyone who embarks on an
 effort to "destroy" xtianity is suffering from deep megalomania, a
 defect which is not cured by religious conversion.

 different perspective?  different perspective??  bwahahahahahahahah!!!

 (sigh!)  perhaps big j was just mistaken about some of his claims.
 perhaps he was normally insightful, but had a few off days.  perhaps
 many (most?) of the statements attributed to jesus were not made by
 him, but were put into his mouth by later authors.  other possibilities
 abound.  surely, someone seriously examining this question could
 come up with a decent list of possible alternatives, unless the task
 is not serious examination of the question (much less "destroying"
 xtianity) but rather religious salesmanship.

 how many germans died for nazism?  how many russians died in the name
 of the proletarian dictatorship?  how many americans died to make the
 world safe for "democracy".  what a silly question!

 is everyone who performs a healing = god?

 it's probably hard to "draw" an entire nation to you unless you 
 are crazy.

 anyone who is convinced by this laughable logic deserves
 to be a xtian.

 don't bother.  many of the "prophecies" were "fulfilled" only in the
 eyes of xtian apologists, who distort the meaning of isaiah and
 other ot books.
