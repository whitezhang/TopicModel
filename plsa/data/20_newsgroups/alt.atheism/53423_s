 as many posters have said in as many posts lately, this is just
 not true.  for to show no interest in the existence of god takes no
 faith at all.  you make the presumption that the _knowledge_ of the 
 _possibility_ of something is enough to require faith to render 
 that possibilty of no interest.  it is a very different thing to say
 that you don't believe something than it is to say that you don't
 have sufficent reason to believe something is even interesting to 
 think about.  it's not either or.  sometimes is just something else
 more interesting that occupies your mind.  
 
 i agree that faith and dogma are inevitable, but not necessarily
 applied to god and religion.  it takes both faith and dogma to
 expect the sun to come up every morning, but there is overwhelming
 reason every single day, day in and day out, for _everyone_ to put 
 his faith and dogma there.  not so with the christian religion.
