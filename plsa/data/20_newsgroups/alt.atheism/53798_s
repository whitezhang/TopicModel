 i believe that there's a 10 year period from time of death until
 a person can be on a commemorative stamp.  it was broken once
 for lyndon johnson (i think) but other than that it has held for
 awhile.  of course, we can still start now -- the elvis stamp
 was petitioned for ages and things really moved once it got
 past the 10 year anniversary of his death.
