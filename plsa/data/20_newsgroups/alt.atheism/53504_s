 personal attacks?

 >stayed out of all conflicts or issues"?  i bet you wouldn't.  you'd love it. 
 
 deliberate misinterpretation of a persons statement?  (by cutting out
 the part of the statement, he tries to blunt the thrust of the sentence.
 he never addresses the issue of extreemist peace people not holding true
 to their ideals.)

 ignoring the challenge?  (he ignores the challenge that extreemists for
 peace tend to be quite insistent that everyone accept their ideals for
 the world, and have even turned quite violent.  (witness, chicago, summer
 1968)).

 paranoia?  (he assumes that anyone who argues against his viewpoint must
 "masturbate over guns'n'ammo.")
