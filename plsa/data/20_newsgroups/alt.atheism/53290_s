 leaves the choices up to us but gives us no better reason
 to believe than an odd story of his alleged son getting
 killed for us?  and little new in the past few thousand
 years, leaving us with only the texts passed down through
 centuries of meddling with the meaning and even wording.
 ...most of this passing down and interpretation of course
 coming from those who have a vested interest in not allowing
 the possibility that it might not be the ultimate truth.
 what about maybe talking to us directly, eh?
 he's a big god, right?  he ought to be able to make time
 for the creations he loves so much...at least enough to
 give us each a few words of direct conversation.
 what, he's too busy to get around to all of us?
 or maybe a few unquestionably-miraculous works here and
 there?
 ...speaks volumes upon volumes to me that i've never
 gotten a chance to meet the guy and chat with him.
