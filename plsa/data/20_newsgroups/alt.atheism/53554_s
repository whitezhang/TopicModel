 saudi arabia is an oppressive regime that has been recently interfering
 in the politcs of newly renunified yemen, including assasinations and 
 border incursions. it is entirely possible that they will soon invade.
 unluckily for yemen it is not popular in the west as they managed to put
 aside political differences during reunification and thus the west has
 effectively lost one half (north?) as a client state.
