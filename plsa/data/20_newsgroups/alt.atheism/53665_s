 not necessarily. it is much the same problem as the eve hypothesis. if
 all, or most, of the copies that were available when printing became
 common were decended from the same copy, a change in that copy would
 propagate to all modern copies, even if there were other copies in 
 existence at the time of the change. very few libraries would have
 duplicates of a non-religious book, so there would be few opportunities
 for anyone to notice that there were variations. even if someone did
 notice, they would be more likely to copy the variation that conformed
 to their expectations and ignore the others.
