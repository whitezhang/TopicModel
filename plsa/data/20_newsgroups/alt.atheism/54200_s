       ah! but what, exactly, is "inherently abhorrent" and why is it so?
 what you're saying is, in effect, "i think some things are repulsive,
 and i know a whole bunch of other people who agree with me, so they
 should be deemed absolutely immoral now and forever, period".
 
       which in and of itself is nice enough; to some extent i agree with
 you. but i do _not_ agree that things are 'inherently' or 'absolutely'
 immoral; they are labeled 'immoral' each for its own good reason, and if
 the reason can even theoretically change, then so can the label.

       no it doesn't. humans are to some extent similar, because we all
 belong to the same species; that that species has evolved is another
 story altogether. to a certain extent evolution can even lend credence
 to moral absolutism (of a flavour).

       you're saying morality is what'll keep society alive and kicking.
 it is, i think, up to a point; but societies are not all alike, and
 neither are their moralities.

       similar != identical.

       no, it's falsifiable through finding someoe who was "created
 different", whatever that might be in the "real" world.
