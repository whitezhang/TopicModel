 well, i've provided examples to show that the trend was general, and you
 (or others) have provided some counterexamples, mostly ones surrounding
 mating practices, etc.  i don't think that these few cases are enough to
 disprove the general trend of natural morality.  and, again, the mating
 practices need to be reexamined...

 no, but mating practices are a special case.  i'll have to think about it
 some more.

 indeed.  but, while the natural system is objective, all objective systems
 are not the natural one.  so, the terms can not be equated.  the natural
 system is a subset of the objective ones.

 i don't claim that homosexuality is immoral.  it isn't harmful, although
 it isn't helpful either (to the mating process).  and, when you say that
 homosexuality is observed in the animal kingdom, don't you mean "bisexuality?"

 this is standard jargon.  read any textbook.  the "we" forms are used
 throughout.

 that's right.  the goals themselves aren't inherent.

 you could, but such would contradict observations.

 but a postulate is something that is generally (or always) found to be
 true.  i don't think your postulate would be valid.

 yes, and i think the goals of survival and happiness *do* work.  you think
 they don't?  or are they not good goals?
