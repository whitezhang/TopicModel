 to all a.a readers:
      i have been asked be several of you to post a list of the sda church's 
 27 fundamental beliefs.  i warn you now, it's a long list.  however, i'll 
 post it on sunday.  sabbath is coming up soon so i won't be reading on 
 saturday.  and i don't have time to do it now.
      i would greatly appreciate it if you would keep me in touch with what's 
 going on.
      i hope all of you have a reastful and relaxing weekend.  i hope it's 
 the best one so far!!
