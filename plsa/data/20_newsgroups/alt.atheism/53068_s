 i am not familiar with, or knowledgeable about the original language,
 but i believe there is a word for "idol" and that the translator
 would have used the word "idol" instead of "graven image" had
 the original said "idol."  so i think you're wrong here, but
 then again i could be too.  i just suggesting a way to determine
 whether the interpretation you offer is correct.
