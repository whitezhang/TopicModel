 university of new hampshire. vonnegut succeeded isaac asimov as the 
 (honorary?) head of the american humanist association. (vonnegut is
 an atheist, and so was asimov) before asimov's funeral, vonnegut stood up
 and said about asimov, "he's in heaven now," which ignited uproarious 
 laughter in the room. (from the people he was speaking to around the time
 of the funeral)
 
 	 "it's the funniest thing i could have possibly said
 to a room full of humanists," vonnegut said at yesterday's lecture. 
 
          if vonnegut comes to speak at your university, i highly recommend
 going to see him even if you've never read any of his novels. in my opinion,
 he's the greatest living humorist. (greatest living humanist humorist as well)
