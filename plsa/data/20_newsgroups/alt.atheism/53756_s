 sure. yes, i did. you see i don't think that rape and murder should
 be dealt with lightly. you, being so interested in leniency for
 leniency's sake, apparently think that people should simply be
 told the "did a _bad_ thing."
 
 
 >and what about the simple chance of misjudgements?
 
 misjudgments should be avoided as much as possible.
 i suspect that it's pretty unlikely that, given my requirement
 of repeated offenses, that misjudgments are very likely.

 again, not all of the orient follows the qur'an. so you'll have to do
 better than that.
 
 
 sorry, you haven't "put out" enough.

 this is an argument for why _you_ don't like religions that suppress
 sex. a such it's an irrelevant argument.
 
 if you'd like to generalize it to an objective statement then 
 fine. my response is then: you have given no reason for your statement
 that sex is not the business of religion (one of your "arguments").
 
 the urge for sex in adolescents is not so strong that any overly strong
 measures are required to suppress it. if the urge to have sex is so
 strong in an adult then that adult can make a commensurate effort to
 find a marriage partner.
