 kent,
 
 i'll accept this as a compliment although i'm always a little paranoid
 when visiting a.a, thanks. yes i do know the extent of the statements
 relevence, it's what i think of as human nature. i'm not sure it
 undermines either religion or atheism since both claim special
 knowledge about the truth and since such claims are always suspect,
 all we can learn from it is that humans are a very arrogant species.
 my point is that we cannot ignore human nature when examining human
 claims. the trick here then, is to find some way to abstract our
 infinitely fallible nature from whatever reality is out there so we
 can see what there is to see. i can think of no way this can be done.
