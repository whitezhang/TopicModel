 the majority of those who can open their mouths in public perhaps.
 there seems quite alot of incentive for the british to have control
 of ni, like using the north channel and irish sea as a waste dump (i was
 appalled at the dumping i saw in the harbor in belfast). it is my
 understanding that quite alot of radioactivity enters the water --
 it'd be quite a problem if ni got its independence from britain and
 then stopped accepting the waste. are you suggesting that british
 industry isn't making profit off the situation as well?
