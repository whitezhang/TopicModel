 well, again, i am doing as much as the poster i was replying too. i am
 quite busy and really don't have the time to respond in full scholarly
 form to every accusation that is flippantly made by someone who's 
 being clearly antagonistic.

 i have considered it. but if someone spreads falsehoods out of
 ignorance then they are still spreading falsehoods. those falsehoods
 generally do not come out of nowhere but are produced by people
 who know that what they are saying is (at _least_) not the whole
 truth. i still consider such spreading of falsehoods propaganda
 on some level.

 bob, i never accused you of having your head up your ass! it takes
 me quite some time in dealing with someone before accusing them of
 having their head up their ass. i was accusing the original poster
 (benedikt, i believe) of being so impaired.
