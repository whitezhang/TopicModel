 great start.  i realize immediately that you are not interested
 in discussion and are going to thump your babble at me.  i would
 much prefer an answer from ms healy, who seems to have a
 reasonable and reasoned approach to things.  say, aren't you the
 creationist guy who made a lot of silly statements about
 evolution some time ago?

 duh, gee, then we must be talking christian mythology now.  i
 was hoping to discuss something with a reasonable, logical
 person, but all you seem to have for your side is a repetition
 of the same boring mythology i've seen a thousand times before.
 i am deleting the rest of your remarks, unless i spot something
 that approaches an answer, because they are merely a repetition
 of some uninteresting doctrine or other and contain no thought
 at all.

 i have to congratulate you, though, bill.  you wouldn't
 know a logical argument if it bit you on the balls.  such
 a persistent lack of function in the face of repeated
 attempts to assist you in learning (which i have seen
 in this forum and others in the past) speaks of a talent
 that goes well beyond my own, meager abilities.  i just don't
 seem to have that capacity for ignoring outside influences.
