 i would be happy to discuss the  issue of the 12 imams with you, although
 my preference would be to move the discussion to another
 newsgroup.  i feel a philosophy
 or religion group would be more appropriate. the topic is deeply
 embedded in the world view of islam and the
 esoteric teachings of the prophet (s.a.). heresy does not enter
 into it at all except for those who see islam only as an exoteric
 religion that is only nominally (if at all) concerned with the metaphysical
 substance of man's being and nature.
 
 a good introductory book (in fact one of the best introductory
 books to islam in general) is murtaza mutahhari's "fundamental's
 of islamic thought - god, man, and the universe" - mizan press,
 translated by r. campbell. truly a beautiful book. a follow-up book
 (if you can find a decent translation) is "wilaya - the station
 of the master" by the same author. i think it also goes under the
 title of "master and mastership" - it's a very small book - really
 just a transcription of a lecture by the author.
 the introduction to the beautiful "psalms of islam" - translated
 by william c. chittick (available through muhammadi trust of
 great britain) is also an excellent introduction to the subject. we
 have these books in our university library - i imagine any well
 stocked university library will have them.
 
 from your posts, you seem fairly well versed in sunni thought. you
 should seek to know shi'ite thought through knowledgeable 
 shi'ite authors as well - at least that much respect is due before the
 charge of heresy is levelled.
