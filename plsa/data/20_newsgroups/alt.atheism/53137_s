 this is a good point, but i think "average" people do not take up christianity
 so much out of fear or escapism, but, quite simply, as a way to improve their
 social life, or to get more involved with american culture, if they are kids of
 immigrants for example.  since it is the overwhelming major religion in the
 western world (in some form or other), it is simply the choice people take if
 they are bored and want to do something new with their lives, but not somethong
 too new, or too out of the ordinary.  seems a little weak, but as long as it
 doesn't hurt anybody...

 these are good quotes, and i agree with both of them, but let's make sure to
 alter the scond one so that includes something like "...let him be, as long as
 he is not preventing others from finding their peace." or something like that. 
 (of course, i suppose, if someone were really "at peace", there would be no
 need for inflicting evangelism)

 well, it is a sure thing we will have to live with them all our lives.  their
 popularity seems to come and go.  i remember when i first entered high school,
 i was an atheist (always had been) and so were about 7 of my friends.  at this
 time, 5 of those 7 have converted, always to christianity (they were all also
 immigrants from taiwan, or sons of immigrants, hence my earlier gross
 generalization).  christianity seems a lot more popular to people now than it
 ever has before (since i've been noticing).  maybe it is just my perceptions
 that are chagning.  who knows?
 i for one am perfectly willing to live and let live with them, so long as we
 have some set of abstract rights/agreements on how we should treat each other:
 i have no desire to be hurt by them or their notions.  for all the well-put
 arguments on this usenet, it never does any good.  argumentation does not
 really seem to apply to christians (or even some atheists)- it must simply be a
 step the person takes naturally, almost, "instinctively"...
