 that's right, and this is pretty impossible, right?  it would be ideal if
 we could believe for a while, just to try out religion, and only then
 determine which course of thought suits us best.  but again, this is not
 possible.  not that religion warrants belief, but the belief carries with
 it some psychological benefits.  there are also some psychological
 burdens, too.

 well, if there were some psychological or other benefits gained from racism,
 they could only be fully understood or judged by persons actually "believing"
 in racism.  of course, the parallel happens to be a poor one, but you
 originated it.
