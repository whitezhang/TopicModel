 i agree, i reckon it's television and the increase in fundamentalism.. you
 think its the increase in pre-marital sex... others thinks its because
 psychologists have taken over the criminal justice system and let violent
 criminals con them into letting them out into the streets... others think
 it's the increase in designer drugs... others think it's a communist plot.
 basically the social interactions of all the changing factors in our society
 are far too complicated for us to control. we just have to hold on to the
 panic handles and hope that we are heading for a soft landing. but one
 things for sure, depression and the destruction of the nuclear family is not
 due solely to sex out of marriage.
