   yes, i do.  
 
   my argument is that the sole purpose of the death penalty is to
   kill people.  that is it's primary (and i would argue only)
   purpose.  to continue to kill people by a practice that has
   almost no utility, especially when you know you will be killing
   innocents, is unconscionable.
 
   at the very least, the existence of the prison system and our
   transportation system are based on their merits to society, not
   their detriments.  we are willing to accept a few lost innocent
   lives because there is an overwhelming benefit to the continued
   existence of these systems.  one has to stretch the evidence and
   the arguments to make the same claim for capital punishment.
 
   just in case i wasn't clear again:  we maintain a capital
   punsihment system that kills innocent people and provides us with
   no net positive gain.  why?
 
   were you to pin me in a corner and ask, i would have to respond
   that i don't belief the state should have the right to take life
   at all.  but i won't open that debate, as it seems others are
   tiring of this thread on a.a anyway.
