 i think that domestication will change behavior to a large degree.
 domesticated animals exhibit behaviors not found in the wild.  i
 don't think that they can be viewed as good representatives of the
 wild animal kingdom, since they have been bred for thousands of years
 to produce certain behaviors, etc.
