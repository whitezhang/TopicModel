  as you have presented it, it is indeed an argument from incredulity.
 however, from what i have seen, it is not often presented in this manner.
 it is usually presented more in the form, "and *besides*, i cannot see...
 ...nor have i ever been offered a convincing explanation."
  moreover, it is not unreasonable to ask for an explanation for such
 phenomena. that theism does not provide a convincing explanation is not
 an argument in theism's favor. especially when different theisms offer 
 different explanations, and even different adherents of what is purportedly
 the same theism give different explanations...

  not im my experience. in my experience, the most common reason is the
 lack of evidence in theism's favor. you mileage may vary. :->

  oh, heck, i'll be snide this once. :-> it's also fairly easy to attack
 arguments that are not made. (i.e. 'strawmen'.)

  sage advice indeed.
