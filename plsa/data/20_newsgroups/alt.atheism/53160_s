       one thing i think is interesting about alt.athiesm is the fact that
 without bible-thumpers and their ilk this would be a much duller newsgroup.
 it almost needs the deluded masses to write silly things for athiests to
 tear apart. oh well, that little tidbit aside here is what i really wanted
 write about.
 
       how can anyone believe in such a sorry document as the bible? if you
 want to be religious aren't there more plausable books out there? seriously,
 the bible was written by multiple authors who repeatedly contradict each
 other. one minute it tells you to kill your kid if he talks back and the next
 it says not to kill at all. i think that if xtians really want to follow a
 deity they should pick one that can be consistent, unlike the last one they
 invented.
 
       for people who say jesus was the son of god, didn't god say not to
 ever put anyone else before him? looks like you did just that. didn't god
 say not to make any symbols or idols? what are crosses then? don't you think
 that if you do in fact believe in the bible that you are rather far off track?
 
 was jesus illiterate? why didn't he write anything? anyone know?
 
       i honestly hope that people who believe in the bible understand that
 it is just one of the religious texts out there and that it is one of the
 poorer quality ones to boot. the only reason xtianity escaped the middle east
 is because a certain roman who's wine was poisoned with lead made all of rome
 xtian after a bad dream.
 
       if this posting keeps one person, just one person, from standing on a
 streetcorner and telling people they are going to hell i will be happy.
