   if your science teacher tells you glass is a liquid, try to get a different
 science teacher b^).  glass is a supercooled fluid, it is not a liquid (except
 at very high temperatures).  the definition of liquid includes "readily takes
 the form of its container".  let's try to be more accurate here.  we don't want
 people to think we're creationists now do we?
