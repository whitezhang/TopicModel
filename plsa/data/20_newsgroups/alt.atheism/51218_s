 no, mathew is proposing a public defence mechanism, not treating the
 electronic device as an impropriety on the wearer. what he is saying is that
 the next step beyond what you propose is the permanent bugging of potential
 criminals.  this may not, on the surface, sound like a bad thing, but who
 defines what a potential criminal is? if the government of the day decides
 that being a member of an opposition party makes you a potential criminal
 then openly defying the government becomes a lethal practice, this is not
 conducive to a free society.
 
 mathew is saying that implanting electronic surveillance devices upon people
 is an impropriety upon that person, regardless of what type of crime or
 what chance of recidivism there is. basically you see the criminal justice
 system as a punishment for the offender and possibly, therefore, a deterrant
 to future offenders. mathew sees it, most probably, as a means of
 rehabilitation for the offender. so he was being cynical at you, okay?
