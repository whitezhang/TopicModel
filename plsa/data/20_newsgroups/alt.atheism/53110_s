 false dichotomy.  you claimed the killing were *not* religiously
 motivated, and i'm saying that's wrong.   i'm not saying that
 each and every killing is religiously motivate, as i spelled out
 in detail.

 does anyone else see the contradiction in this paragraph?

 sorry, frank, but what i put in quotes is your own words from your
 posting <1qi83b$ec4@horus.ap.mchp.sni.de>.  don't tell us now that 
 it's a different claim.   if you can no longer stand behind your 
 original claim, just say so.
