 that's fascinating.  i take it that you're expressing skepticism
 at the idea that those ignorant savages could have influenced
 the constitution of the people who stole their continent.  you
 could be right, but it sounds plausible to me.  is there any
 reason that you dismiss it out-of-hand?  here's some more:
 
    recent scholarship has shown that in the mid-1700s indians were not
    only invited to participate in the deliberations of our "founding
    fathers," but that the great binding law of the iroquois confederacy
    arguably became the single most important model for the 1754 albany
    plan of union, and later the articles of confederation and the
    constitution.  that this would be absent from our school texts,
    and from history, and from media is not surprising given the devotion
    americans feel to our founding myth: great men gathered to express
    a new vision that has withstood the test of time.  if it were
    revealed that indians had a role in it, imagine the blow to the
    american psyche.
    ...
       by 1754, when most of these men and others gathered to creat the
    albany plan of union, the first try at confederation, they invited
    forty-two members of the iroquois grand council to serve as advisors
    on confederate structures.  benjamin franklin freely acknowledged
    his interest in the iroquois achievement in a famous speech at
    albany congress: "it would be a strange thing...if six nations
    of ignorant savages[sic] should be capable of forming such a union
    and be able to execute it in such a manner that it has subsisted
    for ages and appears indissoluble, and yet that a like union should
    be impractical for ten or a dozen english colonies."
       according to grinde, franklin convened meetings of iroquois chiefs
    and congressional delegates in order to "hammer out a plan that he
    acknowedged to be similar to the iroquois confederacy."
 
 grinde is professor donald grinde,jr., of the university of california
 at riverside whose book _the iroquois and the founding fathers of the
 american nation_ addresses this issue.
