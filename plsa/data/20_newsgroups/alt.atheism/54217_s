 maddi,
 
 i see that you still can't grasp the obvious, is it because your are devious
 by nature, or can you only find fault with an argument by
 misrepresenting it?
 
 i plainly said that i was stating the christian position as i
 understand it, i did not say whether i agree with it since my point
 was that the only flaws in that position are those atheists invent.
 i have never claimed to be an expert on anything and especially
 christianity, but i have made it an object of pretty intense study
 over the years, so i feel qualified to discuss what its general
 propositions are.
 
 what offends you is that i have exposed the distortions and
 misrepresentations of christianity you contrive and then rail against,
 (which seems more like the classical strawman dodge than what i said)
 this leaves you with nothing but to attack but me. as usual, you
 avoid the larger issues by picking away at the insignificant stuff, why not
 find one particular thing in my post that we can discuss, or can you
 even tell me what the issues are?
 
 bill
