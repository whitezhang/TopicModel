                                    overview
 
 welcome to alt.atheism and alt.atheism.moderated.
 
 this is the first in a series of regular postings aimed at new readers of the
 newsgroups.
 
 many groups of a 'controversial' nature have noticed that new readers often
 come up with the same questions, mis-statements or misconceptions and post
 them to the net.  in addition, people often request information which has
 been posted time and time again.  in order to try and cut down on this, the
 alt.atheism groups have a series of five regular postings under the following
 titles:
 
    1.  alt.atheism faq: overview for new readers
    2.  alt.atheism faq: introduction to atheism
    3.  alt.atheism faq: frequently asked questions (faq)
    4.  alt.atheism faq: constructing a logical argument
    5.  alt.atheism faq: atheist resources
 
 this is article number 1.  please read numbers 2 and 3 before posting.  the
 others are entirely optional.
 
 if you are new to usenet, you may also find it helpful to read the newsgroup
 news.announce.newusers.  the articles titled "a primer on how to work with
 the usenet community", "answers to frequently asked questions about usenet"
 and "hints on writing style for usenet" are particularly relevant.  questions
 concerning how news works are best asked in news.newusers.questions.
 
 if you are unable to find any of the articles listed above, see the "finding
 stuff" section below.

 ...and countless others i've forgotten.
 
 these articles are free.  truly free.  you may copy them and distribute them
 to anyone you wish.  however, please send any changes or corrections to the
 author, and please do not re-post copies of the articles to alt.atheism; it
 does nobody any good to have multiple versions of the same document floating
 around the network.
 
 
                                 finding stuff
 
 all of the faq files *should* be somewhere on your news system.  here are
 some suggestions on what to do if you can't find them:
 
 1. check the newsgroup alt.atheism.  look for subject lines starting with
    "alt.atheism faq:".
 
 2. check the newsgroup news.answers for the same subject lines.
 
    if you don't find anything in steps 1 or 2, your news system isn't set up
    correctly, and you may wish to tell your system administrator about the
    problem.
 
 3. if you have anonymous ftp access, connect to rtfm.mit.edu [18.172.1.27].
    go to the directory /pub/usenet/alt.atheism, and you'll find the latest
    versions of the faq files there.
 
    ftp is a a way of copying files between networked computers.  if you
    need help in using or getting started with ftp, send e-mail to
    mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with
 
       send usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq
 
    in the body.
 
 4. there are other sites which also carry news.answers postings.  the article
    "introduction to the news.answers newsgroup" carries a list of these
    sites; the article is posted regularly to news.answers.
 
 5. if you don't have ftp, send mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu
    consisting of the following lines:
 
       send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources
       send usenet/alt.atheism/faq
       send usenet/alt.atheism/introduction
       send usenet/alt.atheism/logic
       send usenet/alt.atheism/resources
 
 5. (penultimate resort)  send mail to mail-server@mantis.co.uk consisting of
    the following lines:
 
       send atheism/faq/faq.txt
       send atheism/faq/logic.txt
       send atheism/faq/intro.txt
       send atheism/faq/resource.txt
 
    and our poor overworked modems will try and send you a copy of the files.
    there's other stuff, too; interesting commands to try are "help" and
    "send atheism/index".
 
 6. (last resort)  mail mathew@mantis.co.uk, or post an article to the
    newsgroup asking how you can get the faq files.  you should only do this
    if you've tried the above methods and they've failed; it's not nice to
    clutter the newsgroup or people's mailboxes with requests for files.
    it's better than posting without reading the faq, though!  for instance,
    people whose email addresses get mangled in transit and who don't have 
    ftp will probably need assistance obtaining the faq files.
