 unfortunately your phrasing is ambiguous.  re-writing more carefully, we have
 (at least) two possibilities.  the first:
 
 things called "mercedes" are cars
 that girl is called "mercedes"
 therefore that girl is a car
 
 that is entirely valid as a piece of logical deduction.  it is not sound,
 because the first statement is false.  similarly, i would hold that jim's
 example is valid but not sound.
 
 another possible interpretation of what you wrote is:
 
 there exists at least one car called "mercedes"
 that girl is called "mercedes"
 therefore that girl is a car
 
 -- which isn't valid.
