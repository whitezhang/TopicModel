 true.  at first, the news media seemed entranced by all the new gizmos
 the military was using, not to mention the taped video transmissions from
 the missiles as they zeroed in on their targets.  but later, and especially
 after the bunker full of civilians was hit, they changed their tone.  it
 seemed to me that they didn't have the stomach for the reality of war,
 that innocent people really do die and are maimed in warfare.  it's like
 they were only pro-gulf-war as long as it was "nice and clean" (smart
 missiles dropping in on military hqs), but not when pictures of dead,
 dying, and maimed civilians started cropping up.  what naive hypocrites!

 i should have said here "militarily justified".  it seems from your
 comments below that you understood this as meaning "morally justified".
 i apologize.

 i have often wondered about this.  i've always thought that the first bomb
 should have been dropped on japan's island fortress of truk.  a good,
 inpenatrable military target.  the second bomb could've been held back
 for use on an industrial center if need be.  but i digress.
 
 yes, i have heard that we found evidence (after the war, btw) that japan
 was seriously considering surrender after the first bomb.  unfortunately,
 the military junta won out over the moderates and rejected the us's
 ulimatum.  therefore the second bomb was dropped.  most unfortunate, imo.

 i don't regret the fact that sometimes military decisions have to be made
 which affect the lives of innocent people.  but i do regret the 
 circumstances which make those decisions necessary, and i regret the
 suffering caused by those decisions.

 actually, it was the fact that both situations existed that prompted us
 and allied action.  if some back-water country took over some other
 back-water country, we probably wouldn't intervene.  not that we don't
 care, but we can't be the world's policman.  or if a coup had occured
 in kuwait (instead of an invasion), then we still wouldn't have acted
 because there would not have been the imminent danger perceived to
 saudi arabia.  but the combination of the two, an unprovoked invasion
 by a genocidal tyrant and the potential danger to the west's oil 
 interests, caused us to take action.

 i'm not setting up a strawman at all.  if you want to argue against the
 war, then the only logical alternative was to allow hussein to keep
 kuwait.  diplomatic alternatives, including sanctions, were ineffective.

 they suffered along with the rest.  why does this bother you so much?
 the world is full of evil, and circumstances are not perfect.  many
 innocents suffer due to the wrongful actions of others.  it it regretable,
 but that's the-way-it-is.  there are no perfect solutions.

 probably because we're not the saviors of the world.  we can't police each
 and every country that decides to self-destruct or invade another.  nor
 are we in a strategic position to get relief to tibet, east timor, or
 some other places.

 tell me how we could stop them and i'll support it.  i, for one, do not
 agree with the present us policy of "sucking up to them" as you put it.
 i agree that it is deplorable.

 are they?  or are they supposed to reflect the population of the locale
 where the trial is held?  (normally this is where the crime is committed
 unless one party or the other can convince the judge a change of venue
 is in order.)  i'm not an expert on california law, or even us law, but
 it seems that this is the way the system is set up.  you can criticize
 the system, but let's not have unfounded allegations of racial 
 prejudice thrown around.

 no, not at all.  the point is that the fact that there were no blacks
 on the first jury and that rodney king is black is totally irrelevant.

 germans, perhaps.  "peers" doesn't mean "those who do the same thing",
 like having murderers judge murderers.  it means "having people from
 the same station in life", presumably because they are in a better
 position to understand the defendent's motivation(s).

 ok, granted.  however, you are using this reasoning as part of *your*
 logical argument in this discussion.  this is not a court of law.

 the media is not totally monolithic.  even though there is a prevailing
 liberal bias, programs such as the macneil-lehrer news hour try to give
 a balanced and fair reporting of the news.  there are even conservative
 sources out there if you know where to look.  (hurrah for rush!)
 
 btw, i never used the word "conspiracy".  i don't accept (without *far*
 more evidence) theories that there is some all-pervading liberal
 conspiracy attempting to take over all news sources.

 hardly.  i didn't say that it's a good thing [tm] to kill innocent people
 if the end is just.  unfortunately, we don't live in a perfect world and
 there are no perfect solutions.  if one is going to  resist tyranny, then
 innocent people on both sides are going to suffer and die.  i didn't say
 it is ok -- it is unfortunate, but sometimes necessary.

 i would agree that it was evil in the sense that it caused much pain
 and suffering.  i'm not so sure that it was unnecessary as you say.  that
 conclusion can only be arrived at by evaluating all the factors involved.
 and perhaps it *was* unnecessary as (let's say) we now know.  that doesn't
 mean that those who had to make the decision to bomb didn't see it as
 being necessary.  rarely can one have full known of the consequences of
 an action before making a decision.  at the time it may have seemed
 necessary enough to go ahead with it.
 
 but don't assume that i feel the bombing was *morally* justified -- i
 don't!  i just don't condemn those who had to make a difficult
 decision under difficult circumstances.

 you certainly are not in such a position if you are a moral relativist.
 i, as an absolutist, am in a position to judge, but i defer judgment.

 wrong.  they were neither moral then nor now.  they seemed necessary to
 those making the decisions to bring a quick end to the war.  i simply
 refuse to condemn them for their decision.

 one day i will stand before jesus and give account of every word and action;
 even this discourse in this forum.  i understand the full ramifications of
 that, and i am prepared to do so.  i don't believe that you can make the
 same claim.

 and btw, the reason i brought up the blanket-bombing in germany was
 because you were bemoaning the iraqi civilian casualties as being 
 "so deplorable".  yet blanket bombing was instituted because bombing
 wasn't accurate enough to hit industrial/military targets in a
 decisive way by any other method at that time.  but in the gulf war,
 precision bombing was the norm.  so the point was, why make a big
 stink about the relatively few civilian casualties that resulted
 *in spite of* precision bombing, when so many more civilians
 (proportionately and quantitatively) died under the blanket bombing
 in ww2?  even with precision bombing, mistakes happen and some
 civilians suffer.  but less civilians suffered in this war than
 any other iany other in history!  many iraqi civilians went about their lives
 with minimal interference from the allied air raids.  the stories
 of "hundreds of thousands" of iraqi civilian dead is just plain bunk.
 yes, bunk.  the us lost 230,000 servicemen in ww2 over four years
 and the majority of them were directly involved in fighting!  but 
 we are expected to swallow that "hundreds of thousands" of 
 *civilian* iraqis died in a war lasting about 2 months!  and with 
 the allies using the most precise bombs ever created at that!  
 what hogwash.  if "hundreds of thousands" of iraqi civilians died, 
 it was due to actions hussein took on his own people, not due to 
 the allied bombing.
