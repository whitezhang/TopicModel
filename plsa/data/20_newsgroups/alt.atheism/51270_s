 assuming you are presenting it accurately, i don't see how this argument
 really leads to any firm conclusion.  the material in john (i'm not sure
 exactly what is referred to here, but i'll take for granted the similarity
 to the matt./luke "q" material) is different; hence, one could have almost
 any relationship between the two, right up to john getting it straight from
 jesus' mouth.

 the version of the "usual theory" i have heard has matthew and luke
 independently relying on mark and "q".  one would think that if luke relied
 on matthew, we wouldn't have the grating inconsistencies in the geneologies,
 for one thing.

 this is the part that is particularly new to me.  if it were possible that
 you could point me to a reference, i'd be grateful.

 because it closes up the gap between (supposed) writing and the existing
 copy quit a bit.  the further away from the original, the more copies can be
 written, and therefore survival becomes more probable.

 i'm not really impressed with the "theology" argument.  but i'm really
 pointing this out as an "if".  and as i pointed out earlier, one cannot make
 these arguments about i peter; i see no reason not to accept it as an
 authentic letter.

 the best analogy would be reporters talking to the participants, which is
 not so bad.

 but the statement of divinity is not in that section, and in any case, it's
 agreed that the most important epistles predate mark.
