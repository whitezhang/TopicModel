 wait a minute.  i thought you said that allah (i presume allah == god) was unknowable,
 and yet here you are claiming to know a very concrete fact about him.
 
 you say that god does not have a "face".  doesn't the bible say that god has hindparts?
 
 how do you suggest i decide which (if any) of you is right?  or are you both right?
 god has hindparts but no face?  or does your use of quotation marks:
 
 	god does not have a "face".
 
 allow you to interpret this to mean whatever you like?
