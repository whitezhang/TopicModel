 there is also the question of what is meant by "atheist".  a familiar
 example of the importance of the meaning of the word is as follows.
 
 the two statements following are consistent:
 
 (1) i do not believe that you are wearing lilac socks
 (2) i do not believe that you are are not wearing lilac socks
 
 the two statements following are not consistent:
 
 (3) i do believe that you are wearing lilac socks
 (4) i do believe that you are are not wearing lilac socks
 
 statements (1) and (2) require no faith, they make no presumptions about
 the nature of reality.  statements (3) and (4) require belief.  many
 atheists (myself included) take the following position:
 
 (5) i do not believe that there is a god.
 (6) i do not believe that there is not a god.
 
 that is , i harbor no beliefs at all, there is no good evidence
 for god existing or not.  some folks call this agnosticism.  it does not
 suffer from "blind faith" at all.  i think of it as "don't worry, be happy".
