 actually, i've got an entire list of books written by various atheist
 authors and i went to the largest bookstore in my area (pittsburgh) and
 couldn't find _any_ of them.  what section of the bookstore do you find
 these kinds of books in?  do you have to look in an "alternative" bookstore
 for most of them?  any help would be appreciated (i can send you the list
 if you want).
 
 thanks,
 nanci
