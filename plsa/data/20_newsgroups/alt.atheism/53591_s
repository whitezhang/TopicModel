 that's a fallacy, and it is not the first time it is pointed out.
 for one, you have never given a set of morals people agree upon. unlike
 a football. further, you conveniently ignore here that there are
 many who would not agree on tghe morality of something. the analogy
 does not hold.
  
 one can expect sufficiently many people to agree on its being a football,
 while you have to give the evidence that only vanishing number disagrees
 with a set of morals you have to give.
  
 further, the above is evidence, not proof. proof would evolve out of testing
 your theory of absolute morals against competing theories.
  
  
 the above is one of the arguments you reiterate while you never answer
 the objections. evidence that you are a preacher.
