 it's only one aspect of morality.  societal morality is necessarily
 very crude and broad-brush stuff which attempts to deal with what
 is necessary to keep that society going  - and often it's a little
 over-enthusiastic about doing so.  individual morality is a different
 thing, it often includes societal mores (or society is in trouble),
 but is stronger.  for example, some people are vegetarian, though eating
 meat may be perfectly legal.

 no.  often the answer is "we are".  but if society is those who make
 the rules, that's a different question.  if society is who should
 make the rules, that's yet another.  i don't claim to have the answers, either,
 but i don't think we do it very well in ireland, and i like some things
 about the us system, at least in principle.

 well, ideally they don't, but if they must they should do it by consensus, imo.
 #

 because sometimes that's necessary.  the hard trick is to recognise when
 it is, and equally importantly, when it isn't.

 #
 #why would it be necessary?  what right do we have to interfere?
 
 imo, it isn't often that interference (i.e. jail, and force of various
 kinds and degrees) is both necessary and effective.  where you derive 
 the right to interfere is a difficult question - it's a sort of
 liar's paradox: "force is necessary for freedom".   one possible justification
 is that people who wish to take away freedom shouldn't object if
 their own freedom is taken away - the paradox doesn't arise if
 we don't actively wish to take way anyone's freedom.

 #

 only by consensus, i guess.

 what i mean is that, while thus-and-such may be legal, thus-and-such may
 also be seen as immoral.   the law lets you do it, but you don't let yourself
 do it.  eating meat, for example.
