 for me, it is a "i believe no gods exist" and a "i don't believe gods exist".
  
 in other words, i think that statements like gods are or somehow interfere
 with this world are false or meaningless. in ontology, one can fairly
 conclude that when "a exist" is meaningless a does not exist. under the
 pragmatic definition of truth, "a exists" is meaningless makes a exist
 even logically false.
  
 a problem with such statements is that one can't disprove a subjective god
 by definition, and there might be cases where a subjective god would even
 make sense. the trouble with most god definitions is that they include
 some form of objective existence with the consequence of the gods affecting
 all. believers derive from it a right to interfere with the life of others.
