 from _free inquiry_, winter 83/84,  the following is an
 introduction to the article "joseph smith and the book of
 mormon", by george d. smith.  the introduction is written by
 paul kurtz. 
 
 	mormonism -- the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints
 	-- claims a worldwide membership 5.2 million.  it is one of
 	the world's fastest growing religions, with as many as
 	200,000 new converst in 1982 alone.  because of the church's
 	aggressive missionary program, covering more than one
 	hundred countries, it is spreading even to third world
 	countries.
 	
 	mormonism is both puritanical in moral outlook and
 	evangelical in preachment.  the church is run along strict
 	authoritarian lines.  led by a president, who allegedly
 	receives revelations directly form god, and a group of
 	twelve apostles who attempt to maintain orthodoxy in belief
 	and practice, the church is opposed to abortion,
 	pornography, sexual freedom, women's rights, and other, in
 	its view, immoral influences of secular society, and it
 	forbids the use of tobacco, alcohol, coffee, and tea.
 	
 	centered in salt lake city, the church is extremely wealthy
 	and politically powerful in utal and many other western
 	states.  among well-know present-day mormons are ezra taft
 	benson (former secretary of agriculture), the osmond family,
 	the mariotts of the hotel empire, and a score of high-placed
 	government officials.
 	
 	the mormon church was founded in western new york in 1830 by
 	joseph smith who claimed that by divine revelation be had
 	found gold plates containing hieroglyphics buried on a hill
 	and that with the help of visits from the angel moroni he
 	had been able to translate the writing into the _book of
 	mormon_, the basis of mormon belief.  this book, written "by
 	the commandment of god," claims that the ancient hebrews
 	settled in america about 600 b.c.e. and were the ancestors
 	of the american indians.  mormons believe that those who
 	have been baptized in the "true church" will be reunited
 	after death and that deceased non-mormon family members can
 	be baptized by proxy and thus join their relatives in the
 	hereafter.  because of these beliefs, mormons have been
 	considered outcasts by mainline christian denominations and
 	as heretics by religious fundamentalists.
 	
 	joseph smith was a controversial figure in his day -- he was
 	both worshiped as a saint and denounced as a fraud.  because
 	of persecution he led his band of loyal followers from
 	palmyra, new york, westward to ohio and then to illinois,
 	where in 1844 he was shot to death by an agry mob.  brigham
 	young, who reportedly had as many as eighty wives, took over
 	the leadership of the church and led the mormons further
 	westward, to found the new zion in salt lake city. 
 	following the teachings of joseph smith in the practice of
 	polygamy was perhaps the mormons most controversial practice
 	in nineteenth-century america.
 	
 	while other religions go back many centuries --
 	muhammadanism, 1200 years; christianity, 2000; and judaism,
 	3000 -- and attempts to examine their beginnings are
 	difficult, extensive historical investigation of mormon
 	roots is possible.  some mormons are willing to examine this
 	history objectively, bu others maintain that such scrutiny
 	is dangerous to the faith.
 	
 	in the following pages, _free inquiry_ presents two articles
 	about the mormon church.  first, george d. smith, a lifelong
 	member of the church, provides a detailed critical
 	examination of joseph smith and his claim the the _book of
 	mormon_ was divinely revealed.  second, we present a portion
 	of an interview with philosopher sterling mcmurrin, also a
 	mormon since birth, who questions the treatment of the
 	history of the church by mormon authorities. -- paul kurtz
 	
 
 the article itself is super.
