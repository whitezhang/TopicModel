 you can tell your friend from me that i was in a publisher's
 warehouse one time and saw thousands of copies of the joy of
 cooking and every one of them was syllable-perfect.
 
 i have since sold all i own and become a follower of the joy
 of cooking.  the incident i mentioned convinced me, once and
 for all, that the joy of cooking is inspired by god and the
 one true path to his glory.
