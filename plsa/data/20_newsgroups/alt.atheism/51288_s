 i could give much the same testimonial about my experience as a scout
 back in the 1960s. the issue wasn't gays, but the principles were the
 same. thanks for a well put testimonial. stan krieger and his kind who
 think this discussion doesn't belong here and his intolerance is the
 only acceptable position in scouting should take notice. the bsa has
 been hijacked by the religious right, but some of the core values have
 survived in spite of the leadership and some scouts and former scouts
 haven't given up. seeing a testimonial like this reminds me that
 scouting is still worth fighting for.
 
 on a cautionary note, you must realize that if your experience with this
 camp leader was in the bsa you may be putting him at risk by publicizing
 it. word could leak out to the bsa gestapo.
