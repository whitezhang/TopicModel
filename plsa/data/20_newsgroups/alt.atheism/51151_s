                      formal announcement
                      -------------------

                         enviroleague
  
 a new youth movement,"enviroleague," was recently born, according to its
 founder, boyd r. critz, iii (cis id# 71611,365), of peoria, illinois.
 enviroleague exists for the education of youth, both male and female, in
 matters concerning their values related to and responsibility for our
 environment.
  
 incorporated as an illinois not-for-profit corporation, its articles and
 initial applications for a service mark have now been filed.  according to
 critz, its draft bylaws contain the following statement of mission and
 objectives:
  
                            mission
  
    it is the mission of enviroleague and its adult members
    to foster and implement the improved education of young
    people in the need to conduct their lives as stewards
    of the earth, to leave the earth in a better condition
    than they found it, and to otherwise act as responsible,
    moral and ethical users of their environment.  to pursue
    the accomplishment of this mission, enviroleague shall
    seek to serve as a catalyst, focusing in common cause the
    separate efforts of all groups desiring the preservation,
    improvement, and responsible use of the environment in
    which we must all live.
  
                          objectives
  
    in pursuit of the mission of enviroleague, its primary
    objectives shall be:
        (1)  to establish a movement involving as many
             environmentally concerned organizations as
             possible, said movement having as its primary
             focus the education and participatory
             involvement of young people in appropriate areas
             of environmental concern;
        (2)  to develop and provide to such organizations and
             their branches a full complement of program
             materials for their use, including suitable
             uniforms, insignia and other badges, written
             ideas, syllabi and information, literature and
             other items as shall seem appropriate and
             desirable;
        (3)  to serve as a "clearing house" for the exchange
             of program ideas, materials and information
             among said organizations;  and
        (4)  to assist environmentally concerned
             organizations to recruit and train the necessary
             adult leadership for their youth programs.
  
 enviroleague will operate through three "program divisions" serving youth in
 the elementary, middle and high school grades, respectively.  service shall be
 through formation of "enviroleague teams," either by enviroleague itself or by
 environmentally conscious organizations (or their local branches) wishing a
 charter to use programs developed by enviroleague.
  
 enviroleague, as it develops, will be controlled by the actual adult leaders
 of each local team, and will have no nationally imposed obstacles to
 membership or adult leadership status not based upon relevant improper
 conduct. organizations accepting a charter may, however, impose certain
 additional standards for their own use of the program material.  should such
 organizations do so, enviroleague will commit itself to forming, as soon as
 possible, new nearby teams having no such restrictions, particularly as to
 youth membership.
  
 enviroleague will operate on the principle that youth will have much to
 contribute to developing its programs.  thus, the top youth leaders of its
 teams for middle and high school youth may become involved in governing any
 local administrative groups, and those for its high school youth may be
 involved in similar functions at the national level.
  
 program materials are in development at this time.  copies of the "draft"
 portions of the mentor's manual (manual for adult leadership) will be in the
 earth forum, library 17. these files will be updated as development takes
 place.
  
 compuserve is particularly proud that enviroleague's founder chose this
 electronic medium to make the first public announcement of its formation.
 this announcement is being made simultaneously in both the outdoor and earth
 forums.
  
 the electronic home of enviroleague is in compuserve's earth forum - go
 earth - message and library areas 17, both named "enviroleague."
 ============================================================================
  
 subsequently, enviroleague's initial governance council has held its first
 meeting.  boyd critz was elected as the first enviroleague chief guardian
 (equivalent to chairman of the board or ceo).  he can be reached at home
 (309) 675-4483 in case of real need.  also, mail can be addressed to:
        enviroleague
        p.o. box 418
        peoria, il  61651-0418
  
 those interested in starting an enviroleague team might just establish
 contact, to receive a diskette (ibm dos, ascii) with initial information.
