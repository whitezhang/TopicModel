 this posting is totally uncalled for in rec.scouting.
 
 the point has been raised and has been answered.  roger and i have
 clearly stated our support of the bsa position on the issue;
 specifically, that homosexual behavior constitutes a violation of
 the scout oath (specifically, the promise to live "morally straight").
 
 there is really nothing else to discuss.  trying to cloud the issue
 with comparisons to blacks or other minorities is also meaningless
 because it's like comparing apples to oranges (i.e., people can't
 control their race but they can control their behavior).
 
 what else is there to possibly discuss on rec.scouting on this issue?
 nobody, including bsa, is denying anybody the right to live and/or
 worship as they please or don't please,  but it doesn't mean that bsa
 is the big bad wolf for adhering to the recognized, positive, religious
 and moral standards on which our society has been established and on
 which it should continue to be based.
