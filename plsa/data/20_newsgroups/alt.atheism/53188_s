 righto, dan, try this one with your cornflakes...
 
 the book says that muhammad was either a liar, or he was crazy ( a 
 modern day mad mahdi) or he was actually who he said he was.
 some reasons why he wouldn't be a liar are as follows.  who would 
 die for a lie?  wouldn't people be able to tell if he was a liar?  people 
 gathered around him and kept doing it, many gathered from hearing or seeing 
 how his son-in-law made the sun stand still.  call me a fool, but i believe 
 he did make the sun stand still.  
 niether was he a lunatic.  would more than an entire nation be drawn 
 to someone who was crazy.  very doubtful, in fact rediculous.  for example 
 anyone who is drawn to the mad mahdi is obviously a fool, logical people see 
 this right away.
 therefore since he wasn't a liar or a lunatic, he must have been the 
 real thing.
