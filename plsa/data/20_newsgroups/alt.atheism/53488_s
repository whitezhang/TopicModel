 an "islamic bank" is something which operates in a different fashion to
 your modern bank, as i have explained here (on another thread) before.
 for example, islamic banks don't pay fixed interests on deposits, but a
 return on investments (which varies according to the market, and is not
 fixed like interest is).
 
 islamic banks are a relatively new phenomenon in the islamic world.
 there are no islamic banks in "the west", including the usa, to my
 knowledge.  i doubt if the market for them exists there -- at least not
 while "islamic banks" are at a relatively early stage of their
 development as is the case now.  bcci is most certainly not an "islamic
 bank" -- did bcci ever pay a fixed interest rate on deposits?  if the
 answer to this question is "yes", then bcci was not an islamic bank, as
 islamic banks are specifically set up to _not_ pay or charge interest.
 
 whether some muslims partially owned the bank or whatever is completely
 irrelevant.
