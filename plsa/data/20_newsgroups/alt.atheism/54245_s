 you would have us believe that what the eye perceives as images are
 actaully there - as perceived? this may be interesting. i thought
 that an electron microscope was used because no wavelength of "light"
 can illuminate any "object" of atomic scale. if this image is to have
 useful resolution, wouldn't the illuminating sources wavelength have
 to be several orders of magnitude less than size of thing observed?
 
 if an atom is a "probablity cloud", lower resolutions would give the
 appearance of solidity, but it seems fairly certain that an atom is
 not an object is any conventional sense. obviously i am not a
 physicist, but the question does have ramification of a philosophic
 nature. anyway, just a stray thought, carry on ...
