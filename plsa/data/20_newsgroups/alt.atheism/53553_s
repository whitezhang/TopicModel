 this figure would not simply be deaths by bombing, but also death later
 from disease (the sewer system of baghdad was deliberately targeted) and
 starvation. i believe (but when i get a copy of the latest research in
 june or july) that this was the figure proposed in the census bureau 
 report on the matter. the report was suppressed and the cb attempted to
 sack the author of the report, but failed due to procedural technicality.
 the author is now on permanent leave.
