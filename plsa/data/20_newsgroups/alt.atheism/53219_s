 of course, the list has to agree with the nickname laws laid down by the
 gipu almost 2000 years ago (you know... the 9 of them that were written on
 the iron tablets that melted once and had to be reinscribed?).  since i am
 a prophet of the gipu i decree that you should post the whole list of
 nicknames for the frequent posters here!
