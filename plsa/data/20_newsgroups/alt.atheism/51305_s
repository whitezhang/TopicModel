 but, the goal need not be a subjective one.  for instance, the goal of
 natural morality is the propogation of a species, perhaps.  it wasn't
 really until the more intelligent animals came along that some revisions
 to this were necessary.  intelligent animals have different needs than
 the others, and hence a morality suited to them must be a bit more
 complicated than "the law of the jungle."  i don't think that
 self-actualization is so subjective as you might think.  and, by
 objectivity, i am assuming that the ideals of any such system could be
 carried out completely.
