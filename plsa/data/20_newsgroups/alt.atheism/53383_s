 i am fairly sure that she could obtain citizenship by making an
 application for it. it might require immigration to germany, but
 i am almost certain that once applied for citizenship is inevitable
 in this case.

 more interesting only for your propaganda purposes. i have said several
 times now that i don't consider iran particularly exemplary as a good
 islamic state. we might talk about the rights of people in "capitalist
 secular" third world countries to give other examples of the lack of
 rights in third world countries broadly. say, for example, central
 american secular capitalist countries whose govt's the us supports
 but who amnesty international has pointed out are human rights vacua.
