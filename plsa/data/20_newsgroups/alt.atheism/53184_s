 my point is that you set up your views as the only way to believe.  saying 
 that all eveil in this world is caused by atheism is ridiculous and 
 counterproductive to dialogue in this newsgroups.  i see in your posts a 
 spirit of condemnation of the atheists in this newsgroup bacause they don'
 t believe exactly as you do.  if you're here to try to convert the atheists 
 here, you're failing miserably.  who wants to be in position of constantly 
 defending themselves agaist insulting attacks, like you seem to like to do?!
 i'm sorry you're so blind that you didn't get the messgae in the quote, 
 everyone else has seemed to.
