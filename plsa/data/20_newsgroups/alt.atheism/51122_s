 define perfect then.

 take your foot out of your mouth, i wondered about that already when i
 was a catholic christian. the fact that the contradiction is unresolvable
 is one of the reasons why i am an atheist.
  
 believe me, i believed similar sentences for a long time. but that shows
 the power of religion and not anything about its claims.

 it follows from a definition of evil as ordinarily used. letting evil
 happen or allowing evil to take place, in this place even causing evil,
 is another evil.

 the omniscient attribute of god will know what the creatures will do even
 before the omnipotent has created them. there is no choice left. all is known,
 the course of events is fixed.
  
 not even for the omniscient itself, to extend an argument by james tims.

 and when i am not omnipotent, how can i have free will? you have said
 something about choices and the scenario gives them. therefore we have
 what you define as free will.
  
 imagine the following. i can do good to other beings, but i cannot harm them.
 easily implemented by making everyone appreciate being the object of good
 deeds, but don't make them long for them, so they can not feel the absence
 of good as evil.
  
 but whose case am i arguing? it is conceivable, so the omnipotent can do it.
 or it would not be omnipotent. if you want logically consistent as well, you
 have to give up the pet idea of an omnipotent first.

 that the bible describes an omniscient and omnipotent god destroys
 the credibility of the bible, nothing less.
  
 and a lot of people would be interested in evidence for a god,
 unfortunately, there can't be any with these definitions.
