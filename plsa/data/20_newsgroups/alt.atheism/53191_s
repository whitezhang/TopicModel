 then not murdering would have no moral significance, since there
 would be nothing voluntary about it.

 you are starting to get the point.   mimicry is not necessarily the 
 same as the action being imitated.   a parrot saying "pretty polly" 
 isn't necessarily commenting on the pulchritude of polly.

 they do.   i and other posters have given you many examples of exactly
 this, but you seem to have a very short memory.

 i'm saying:
 
 	"there must be the possibility that the organism - it's not 
 	just people we are talking about - can consider alternatives."
 
 it's right there in the posting you are replying to.
