 what is your degree in again - or should i say when.  this is a 1960's
 view of abiogenesis.  please read something modern like carle woose's
 "on the origins" which he beats these "warm little ponds" into the ground.
 
 look at archeobacteria - they live in areas so hot you would melt.  
                         
 and, believe it or not, we use their machinery everday in the pursuit of
 new drugs, therapies, and knowledge.

 ^^^^^^^^^^^
 you mean your theory.  again, arguing this point is like telling a child
 that the sky will not fall.  if the child is stubborn you will not get anywhere.

 the p=1.  they are left handed :)  really, this is not a big deal.  there are
 many problems with abiogenisis but these are really trivial.

 please jack rad some modern biololgy - i do not mean books by creationists
 about modern biology.  pick up a text book and read.  i think you
 would like woose's "on the origins."  he is an arogant man but his writting
 and research is brilliant.
