   damn right you can't provide any evidence for it.  
 
   rarely are any widespread social phenomenon reducible to such a
   simple premise.  if they were, psychology would be a hard science
   with roughly the same mathematical soundness as physics.  
 
   your premise may well be right.  it is much more likely, however,
   that it reflects your socialization and religious background, as
   well as your need to validate your religious beliefs.  were i to
   pretend to have all the answers (and i don't), i would say that the
   xenophobia, guilt, and intolerance brought about by adherence to 
   fundamentalist religions play just as large a role in depressing
   the members of our society.
 
   your mileage obviously varies.
