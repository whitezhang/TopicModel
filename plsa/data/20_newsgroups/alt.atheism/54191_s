 sorry, fred, but for the purposes under discussion here, i must
 disagree.  your point is true only in the sense that one cannot argue
 against communism by reference to the chinese or soviet empires, since
 those did not represent *true* communism.  in judging the practical
 consequences of islam as a force to contend with in the world today,
 it is precisely the khomeini's of the world, the rushdie-fatwa
 supporters, and perhaps more importantly, the reaction of the world
 muslim community to those extremists, that we must look to.  perhaps
 unfortunately from your perspective, most people are not concerned
 with whether islam is the right religion for them, or whether the
 qur'an could be used as a guidebook for a hypothetical utopia, but how
 islam affects the world around them, or what their lives might be like
 if islam gains in influence.  when i consider such possibilities, it
 is with not inconsiderable fear.
