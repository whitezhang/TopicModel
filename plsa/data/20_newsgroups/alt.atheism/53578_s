 bruce,
 
    it seems like you are advocating social change based on your
 concept of human nature, and that concept seems pretty utopian. it's
 obvious from even a cursory study of history that no system,
 regardless of the authority it may claim for its basis, will make
 people act any better. until human nature changes, the products of our
 nature won't change, and that has to include society. i think your
 assessment of human potential in this regard is too optimistic.
 
    what is needed is an absolute moral standard if -all- people are to
 create any utopias. by implying a utopian future, you also argue for
 an absolute standard that applies to everyone in every case. i realize
 that you may not acknowledge the connection, but it's there.
