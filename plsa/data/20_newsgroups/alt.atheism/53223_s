 sorry.   wrong.    this is how banks got started in the first place.
 sooner or later your father and his pals will lend money to someone
 who eventually goes broke, and then they will realise that they
 havn't been managing risk very well.   then they will ask themselves
 what it is that they need to quantify risk, and to persuade borrowers
 not to take on greater loans than they can carry.    and since they
 don't all want the worry of doing the calculations and handling the
 money, some of them will specialise in that.
 
 then they'll reinvent interest, but like good muslims, they'll call
 it something else.

 riiiight.   that's why john major opened a new government department
 a couple of months ago to help to promote minority business.   because
 they can do it all themselves by lending one another cups of sugar.
