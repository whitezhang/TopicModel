 most likely the tragic situation in bosnia is a combination of ethnical
 and religious motives, where religion is just one attribute that separates
 the groups from each other.
 
 but i must agree that the sad saga in bosnia is a terrible example
 of a case where religion is not helping, instead it is used as a weapon
 against other humans. and my sympathies are mostly on the bosnian side,
 it looks like the serbs are the oppressors, willing to use even
 christianity as a weapon against their former friends.
 
 cheers,
 kent
