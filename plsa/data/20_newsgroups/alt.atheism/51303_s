 but of course your version of your position has been included in the
 charley challenges, so your claim above is a flat-out lie.  further,
 only last week you claimed that you "might not" answer the challenges
 because you were turned off by "included text".  so which is it, do
 you want your context included in my articles or not?  come to think
 of it, this contradiction has the makings of a new entry in the next
 challenges post.
 
 by the way, i've kept every bloody thing that you've written related
 to this thread, and will be only too pleased to re-post any of it to
 back my position.  you seem to have forgotten that you leave an
 electronic paper trail on the net.

 now, now, let's not change the subject.  wouldn't it be best to finish
 up the thread in question before you begin new ones?
