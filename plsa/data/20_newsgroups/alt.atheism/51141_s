 this is a classic example of excessive faith in reason.  the fact that we
 have trouble talking about something doesn't imply that it is impossible; it
 simply implies that it is hard to talk about.  there is a very good chance
 that god *can* flibble glop ork groink.  charlie wingate can flibble glop
 ork groink, and he isn't even god.
