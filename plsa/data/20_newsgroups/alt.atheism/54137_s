 yup, i think you're right.  my mistake.  now, how do i make
 an "r" backwards using a computer keyboard?
 
 i'll bet the gods know how (this is alt.atheism, after
 all).  tell you what, if all my "r"s start coming out
 backwards when i type from now on, i'll become a believer.
 
 (and that's not asking for miracles.  if i asked for a miracle,
 i'd ask for a real miracle, like for pat buchanan to become
 an out-of-the-closet drag queen - well...maybe that wouldn't be
 so miraculous, but i think he'd look fabulous in a feather
 boa and a sequined hat like mia farrow wore in gatsby.)
