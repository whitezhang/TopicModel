 what i mean is what i said.   "what i want" does not automatically
 translate into "what i think is right."   that is, it does not 
 translate that way for me.
 
 if you reply that "i think it is ok to kill you because that is what 
 i decided" then what that means is that for you "what i want" does
 translate into "what i think is right".
 
 it just doesn't translate that way for me.
