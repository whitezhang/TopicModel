 absolutely not true. without religion - either an established one or
 one you invent for yourself - the theist and atheist are equally
 (not) interested in god, because without religious revelation there
 is _no_ information about god available. strip away the dogma and
 the theists/atheists are no different, simply holding a different
 opinion on a matter of little practical importance.

 sorry, but that doesn't help. what test will you apply to decide
 whether it is god or satan with whom you are speaking?
 how will you know that you have not simply gone insane, or having
 delusions? you are like a loaded gun.

 yes. we're all in this together - each human making up a small part of
 the definition of humanity.
