 straw man, you are trying to replace pragmatics by morals. and what about
 a subjectivis saying subjectivismis better for me?

 make those predictions and don't waste our time with circular definitions
 and assertions without evidence. in this example, when genocide is so
 commonly abhorred, why does it happen so often in the context of religion?
 does it allow to conclude that there is something about religion that
 catalyses genocide? or, in case it has nothing got to do with religion,
 that the premise is wrong, genocide is not abhorred?
