    although i agree that creation is nonsense, i submit that you are making
 the same mistake that creationists commonly do.  in this and previous posts,
 i think you have been engaging in the fallacy of false dichotomy; you have
 consistently characterized science/religion as rationalism/nonsense, when
 in fact the latter do not form a complete set of options.  neither do the
 former, for that matter.
 
    i wish that the semi-explicit linking of evolution to so-called "rational"
 atheism could be avoided; it just gives the creationists fuel for their
 often-repeated incantation that "evolution leads to atheism."
