 you misrepresent me, selim.  the hard evidence for my statements about
 his lack of objectivity are presented quite clearly in the book
 "orientalism" by edward said.  edward said, by the way, is a christian,
 not a muslim.

 regarding bernard lewis:
 
 him being a zionist gives him a political motive for his
 giving misrepresentations and half-truths about islam.
 
 read "orientalism" by edward said -- see the evidence for yourself.
 
 in fact, i may post some of it here (if it isn't too long).

 i haven't read lewis's article, so i can't comment directly upon it, and
 have only spoken about his writings _in general_ so far, that his
 political motives make him a biased writer on islam.  his anti-islamic
 polemics, as i understand it, are often quite subtle and are often based
 on telling half-truths.
 
 again, read "orientalism" by edward said.  i am _not_ asking you to take
 what i say on trust, in fact i am urging you not to do so but to get
 this book (it is a well-known book) and check the evidence out for
 _yourself_.

 if slavery is _in reality_ (as opposed to in the practice of some
 muslims) opposed by islam, then using slaves for sexual
 purposes is necessarily opposed too.

 i understand your point of view, selim -- i think, rather, it is _us_
 who are not getting through to _you_.
 
 some of the points you repeat above i have already answered before.
 
 regarding women, i have made posting after posting on this subject,
 showing that islam is not anti-woman, etc.  however, have you been
 completely ignoring my postings or just missing them?  i just reposted a
 very good one, under the title "islam and women", reposted from
 soc.religion.islam.  if this has already disappeared from your site,
 then please email me telling me so and i will email you a copy of this
 excellent article.  
 
 imho, your understanding of the issue of women in islam is sadly deficient.
 
 regarding slaves, _my_ posting on slavery -- the second one i made,
 which is a repost of an article i wrote early last year -- is based
 completely on the qur'an and contains numerous qur'anic verses and
 hadiths to support its point of view.
 
 our approaches are different -- you are arguing from a historical
 standpoint and i am arguing directly from the teachings of the qur'an
 and hadiths.  now, just because people say they are muslims and perform
 a particular action, does that automatically mean that their action is
 part of islam, even if it is opposed by the qur'an and sunnah?  no!  of
 course not.
 
 let me give you a concrete example, which might help clarify this for
 you.  the qur'an prohibits drinking.  now, if a person says "i am a
 muslim" and then proceeds to drink a bottle of beer, does this now mean
 that islam teaches that people should drink beer?  of course not, and
 only an idiot would think so.
 
 do you see my point?

 you are judging islam here on capitalist terms.  capitalism is an
 ideology based largely on the assumption that people want to maximise
 their wealth -- this assumption is in opposition to islamic teachings.
 to say islam is bad because it is not capitalist is pretty unthinking --
 islam does not pretend to be capitalist and does not try to be
 capitalist.  (this does not mean that islam does not support a
 free-market -- for it does in general -- but there are other parts of 
 capitalism which are opposed to islam as i understand it.)

 >you (and i) were left bare in the open for emperialists to devour.
 >no capital, no industry, very poor social services - the education

 one can postulate numerous reasons for this.  your theory is that it is
 because islam is not secularist and capitalist, etc. etc.
 
 selim, i will give you a clear historical example to show you the
 fallacy of your views if you think (as you obviously do) that
 islam => lack of education and power.
 
 for a large part of history, the islamic world was very powerful.  for a
 significant section of history, the islamic world was the foremost in
 the sciences.  so to say that islam is, for example, anti-education is
 completely absurd.  you try to blame this situation on islam -- history
 shows that your conclusion is false and that, instead, there must be
 other reasons for this situation.
 
 >you blame muslims for not following the quran, but i blame muslims 
 >for following the quran. 
 
 well, selim, your viewpoint on women in islam makes me question the extent
 of your knowledge of islam.  i really think you are not
 knowledgeable enough to be able to judge whether the muslims are
 following the qur'an or not.
 
 >your idea is baseless from historical
 >facts, it is a poor utopia, 
 
 the islamic world was at the forefront of the world in science at one
 stage -- yet somehow, in your theory, it is by "following the qur'an"
 that muslims are backwards in education.  selim, it is _your_ thesis
 that is anti-historical, for you conveniently overlook this historical
 fact which contradicts your theory. 
 
 >while my ideas are derived from social
 >and economic history. 
 
 you have certainly not shown this; you have merely stated it.
 so far, it seems to me that your view on islam being anti-education is
 quite contrary to history.  that you are so convinced of your views
 makes me wonder just how objectively you are trying to look at all of
 this.
 
 >my solution to all muslims is simple:
 >cut the crap, 
 
 i think, selim, you should consider taking your own advice.
 
 >get the facts straight 
 
 here too.
 
 >and work hard to reverse
 >the effects of 1300 years of ignorance.
 
 selim, you have such conviction of your viewpoint, yet you demonstrate
 ignorance, not only of islam but also of islamic history (particularly
 with respect to muslims being leaders of science till about 1400 or so i
 think).  yet you say that your viewpoint is based on history!
 
 selim, if i remember right, you say in one of your earlier posts that
 you are an apostate from islam.  i think you should slow down and start
 thinking clearly about the issues, and start _reading_ some of our
 postings about islam rather than ignoring them as you so obviously
 have.
