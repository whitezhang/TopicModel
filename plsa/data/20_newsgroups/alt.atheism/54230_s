 well, i was raised as an athiest, and eventually took on a theistic
 view. however i try to be a rationalist as well as a theist. anyhow,
 i will try to make some comments on your observations, just to 
 contribute some datapoints from a different perspective.

 religion _can_ be a crutch. before going much further on that thread,
 i would suggest that you take a closer look at the veriety of world
 religions out there, though. there are athiestic religions as well as
 theistic religions. there are religions that claim knowledge about
 such things as an afterlife, and there are religions that make no such
 claims. 
 
 my perspective is that lots of people talk, but all that means is that
 talk is cheap. when someone gives me substantial evidence about an
 afterlife, then i'll start believing in one. in the mean while, my
 religion deals with what we know exists, that is life here and now.

 again, some religions do, and others do not. some religions teach people
 that life is chaotic and to accept it for what it is.

 i'll tell you that i moved from an athiestic perspective to a theistic
 one because i believe that i observed phenomenon that was better 
 explained from the theistic perspective, while the athiestic perspective
 could not explain it. however that does not mean that i'm willing to
 accept a lot of fourth hand gobbly-gook that contridicts modern science
 along with my theistic perspective.
