 size of armies, duration, numbers of casualties both absolute and as a
 percentage of those involved, geographical area and numbers of countries
 too, are all measures of size.  in this case i'd say the relevant
 statistic would be the number of combatants (total troops) compared to
 total casualties from among the total civilian population in the
 affected geographical area.

 vietnam and korea might make good comparisons.

 western news in general, but in particular the american "mass media":
 cbs, nbc, abc, etc.  the general tone of the news during the whole
 war was one of "those poor, poor iraqis" along with "look how precisely
 this cruise missile blew this building to bits".

 perhaps so.  and maybe the atomic bomb was a mistake too.  but that's easy
 to say from our "enlightened" viewpoint here in the 90's, right?  back
 then, it was *all-out* war, and germany and japan had to be squashed.
 after all, a million or more british had already died, hundreds of 
 thousands of french, a couple hundread thousand or so americans, and 
 millions of russians, not to mention a few million jews, poles, and 
 other people of slavic descent in german concentration camps.  all 
 things considered, the fire-bombings and the atomic bomb were
 essential (and therefore justified) in bringing the war to a quick
 end to avoid even greater allied losses.
 
 i, for one, don't regret it.

 sure.  and it's the people who suffer because of them.  all the more
 reason to depose these "entrenched political rulers operating in their
 own selfish interests"!  or do you mean that this applies to the allies
 as well??

 i make no claim or effort to justify the misguided foreign policy of the
 west before the war.  it is evident that the west, especially america,
 misjudged hussein drastically.  but once hussein invaded kuwait and 
 threatened to militarily corner a significant portion of the world's
 oil supply, he had to be stopped.  sure the war could have been
 prevented by judicious and concerted effort on the part of the west
 before hussein invaded kuwait, but it is still *hussein* who is
 responsible for his decision to invade.  and once he did so, a
 strong response from the west was required.

 well, it's not very "loving" to allow a hussein or a hitler to gobble up
 nearby countries and keep them.  or to allow them to continue with mass
 slaughter of certain peoples under their dominion.  so, i'd have to
 say yes, stopping hussein was the most "loving" thing to do for the
 most people involved once he set his mind on military conquest.

 i mentioned it.
 
 if we hadn't intervened, allowing hussein to keep kuwait, then it would
 have been appeasement.  it is precisely the lessons the world learned
 in ww2 that motivated the western alliance to war.  letting hitler take
 austria and czechoslavkia did not stop ww2 from happening, and letting
 hussein keep kuwait would not have stopped an eventual gulf war to
 protect saudi arabia.

 sure.  what was truly unfortunate was that they followed hitler in
 his grandiose quest for a "thousand year reich".  the consequences
 stemmed from that.

 so?  it was the *policemen* on trial not rodney king!!  and under american
 law they deserved a jury of *their* peers!  if there had been black
 officers involved, i'm sure their would have been black jurors too.
 this point (of allegedly racial motivations) is really shallow.

 so?  it's "hard to imagine"?  so when has argument from incredulity
 gained acceptance from the revered author of "constructing a logical
 argument"?  can we expect another revision soon??  :)  (just kidding.)

 i have to admit that i wonder this too.  but *neither* the prosecution
 nor the defense is talking.  so one cannot conclude either way due to
 the silence of the principals.

 ok.  it certainly seemed to me that there was excessive force involved.
 and frankly, the original "not guilty" verdict baffled me too.  but then
 i learned that the prosecution in the first case did not try to convict
 on a charge of excessive force or simple assault which they probably
 would have won, they tried to get a conviction on a charge of aggravated
 assault with intent to inflict serious bodily harm.  a charge, which
 news commentators said, was akin to attempted murder under california
 law.  based on what the prosecution was asking for, it's evident that 
 the first jury decided that the officers were "not guilty".  note, 
 not "not guilty" of doing wrong, but "not guilty" of aggravated assault 
 with the *intent* of inflicting serious bodily harm.  the seeds of the 
 prosecutions defeat were in their own overconfidence in obtaining a 
 verdict such that they went for the most extreme charge they could.
 
 if the facts as the news commentators presented them are true, then
 i feel the "not guilty" verdict was a reasonable one.

 thanks mathew, i like the quote.  pretty funny actually.  (i'm a 
 monty python fan, you know.  kind of seems in that vein.)
 
 of course, oversimplifying any moral argument can make it seem
 contradictory.  but then, you know that already.
