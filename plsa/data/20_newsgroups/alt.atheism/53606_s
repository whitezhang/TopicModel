 i think this should be illuminating to all. let me make a first
 suggestion. when arabic words, especially technical ones, become of use 
 let us define them for those, especially atheists, to whom they may not be
 terribly familiar. please also note that though i did initially refer
 to khomeini as a heretic for what i understood to be a claim -- rejected 
 by you since -- of personal infallibility, i withdraw this as a basis
 for such a statement. i conditionally retain this reference in regard
 to khomeini's advocacy of the thesis of the infallibility of the 
 so-called "twelve imams," which is in clear conflict with the qur'an 
 in that it places the twelve imams in a category of behavior and example
 higher than that of the muhammad, in that the qur'an shows that the
 prophet was clearly fallible, as well as (it appears, given your
 abstruse theological statment regarding the "natures"  of the twelve
 imams) placing them in a different metaphysical category than the 
 remainder of humanity, with the possible exception of muhammad, 
 something which verges on the sin of association.
