 it's about time.  why do atheists spend so much time paying attention
 to the bible, anyway?
 
 face it, there are better things to do with your life!  i used to
 chuckle and snort over the silliness in that book and the absurdity
 of people believing in it as truth, etc.  why do we spend so little
 time on the mayan religion, or the native americans?  heck, the native
 americans have signifigantly more interesting myths.  also, what
 about the egyptians.
 
 i think we pay so much attention to christianity because we accept
 it as a _religion_ and not a mythology, which i find more accurate.
 
 
 i try to be tolerant.  it gets very hard when someone places a book
 under my nose and tells me it's special.  it's not.
