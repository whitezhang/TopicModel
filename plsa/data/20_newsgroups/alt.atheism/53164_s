 i have made this clear elsewhere but will do so again. khomeini put a 
 price on the head of someone in another country, this makes him a jerk
 as well as an international outlaw. khomeini advocates the view that
 there was a series of twelve islamic leaders (the twelve imams) who
 are free of error or sin. this makes him a heretic. in the qur'an 
 muhammad is chastised for error directly by god; the qur'an says that
 muhammad is the greatest example of proper islamic behavior; thus
 no muslim is free from error.

 perhaps it seems so to you, but this is hardly the case. there is
 widespread agreement about matters of islam. there certainly are
 many viewpoints on issues which are not particularly islamic in
 and of themselves, but this is so for any large group of people
 under the same name. 
 
 >it all comes back to the koran being so imprecise in its wording.
 
 the qur'an is not particularly imprecise in wording, though it is true
 that several interpretations are possible in the interpretations of
 many words. however, as an entire text the qur'an makes its meanings
 precise enough for intelligent people free from power lust to come
 to agreement about them.
