 they spent quite a bit of time on the wording of the constitution.  they
 picked words whose meanings implied the intent.  we have already looked
 in the dictionary to define the word.  isn't this sufficient?

 but we were discussing it in relation to the death penalty.  and, the
 constitution need not define each of the words within.  anyone who doesn't
 know what cruel is can look in the dictionary (and we did).
