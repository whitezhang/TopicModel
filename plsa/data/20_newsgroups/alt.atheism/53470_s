 yes, when you tag on the "unfortunately, ...", then to all intents and
 purposes you are saying the same thing.
 
 #would you say this of any two statements, one saying "x is moral" and
 #the other saying "x is immoral?"   how would you decided when two

 what they prescribe that one should do is a pretty good indicator.

 that's not true.  you could formulate a pragmatic belief in minimum 
 force and still be a pacifist.  if the minimum is 0, great  - but one is
 always trying to get as close to 0 force as possible under that belief.
 not the same as 'force is immoral, period', but still tending to pacifism.
