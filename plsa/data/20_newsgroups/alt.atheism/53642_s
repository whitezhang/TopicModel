 i'd say the majority of people have a moral system that instructs them
 to kill under certain circumstances.  i do get your distinction between
 motivate and allow, and i do agree that if a flavour of theism 'allows'
 atoricities, then that's an indictment of that theism.  but it rather
 depends on what the 'certain circumstances' are.  when you talk about
 christianity, or islam, then at least your claims can be understood.
 it's when people go to a general statement about theism that it falls
 apart.  one could believe in a god which instructs one to be utterly
 harmless.

 not necessarily.  "love thy neighbour" does not supply a them/us - it
 demolishes it.  and my definition of religion is broader than my
 definition of theism, as i have explained.

 #
 #what about the protestant extremists who killed four catholic 
 #labourers?     that *wasn't* religiously motivated?
 
 not in my opinion.  if they were doing it because of some obscure
 point of theology, then yes.  but since all protestants don't do this
 (nor do they elect extremists to do it for them), it's just too broad
 too say "religion did this".  i'm saying that the causes are far more
 complex than that - take away the religious element, and you'd still
 have the powerful motives of revenge and misguided patriotism.  you
 know, when most catholics and protestants worldwide say 'stop the 
 killing', one might listen to that, especially when you claim not
 to read minds.

 #what's so special about these exceptions?    isn't this all just a

 #all this?
 
 the general principle is that it's fairly clear (to me, at least) that
 religion is the primary motivator (enabler, whatever) of these.  it's
 not nearly so obvious what's going on when one looks at ni, apart
 from violence of course.

 #i'm still listening to what they say, and you are still telling us

 you've speculated on my motives often enough, and you don't take
 my statements of my own beliefs at face value - therefore your claim 
 not to read minds has no credibility with me, sorry.   i also note that 
 you fail to answer my question.  it just looks to me very much like
 you have an axe to grind - especially as you are indeed ignoring what 
 most protestants say - which is @stop the killing".  the people you
 refer to are properly described as unionists, not protestants.
 #
 #as for their position of privilege, what is that if not religion-
 #based?
 
 it is based on politics, bigotry, and heartless extremism.  none of these
 things are synonymous with religion, though there is certainly some
 overlap.
