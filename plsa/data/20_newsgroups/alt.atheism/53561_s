 it is worth noting that the dozen or so references to jesus
 outside of christian scripture provide us *no* evidence of what
 he taught or what he did beyond the fact that the early
 christians claimed him as their founder.  all of the writers must
 have received their information from the early christians,
 perhaps second or third hand.  none of these references give any
 hint that the writers had any independent information about
 jesus. 
 
 these references do show that the early christians were having an
 influence, at least enough to earn a few lines here and there in
 other peoples' writings.  but the typical use to which they are
 put by some christian apologists, in making psuedo-historical
 arguments a la josh, is totally specious.
