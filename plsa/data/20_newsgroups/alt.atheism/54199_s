 that means that it is an effective anti-recidivism measure.  it does
 not say that it deters an individual from committing a capital crime
 in the first place.
 
 the true question is whether the threat of death is likely to actually
 stop one from murdering.  (or commiting treason -- are there any other
 capital crimes anywhere in the usa?)  that is, if there were no death
 penalty, would its introduction deter a would-be criminal from
 committing her/his crime?  i doubt it.
 
 this is only the first step.  even if it were a strong deterrent
 (short of being a complete deterrent) i would reject it.  for what
 about the case of the innocent executed?
 
 and even if we could eliminate this possibility, i would reject the
 death penalty as immoral. this makes me something of a radical on
 the issue, although i think there are many opponents of captial
 punishment who agree with me, but who find the innocent executed the
 strongest argument to make.
 
 i would, if magically placed in charge, facilitate state-aided suicide
 for criminals who have life-sentences.  this could be a replacement
 for capital punishment.  those who don't want to live the rest of
 their lives in jail would always have this option.
