 it is good to remember that every translation is to some extent an
 interpretation, so (as you point out below) one must really go back to
 the original arabic.  regarding the verses relevant to nature, i prefer
 to use dr. maurice bucaille's translations (in his book, "the bible, the
 qur'an and science") for in general his translations are more literal.
  
 maurice bucaille translates the portion of the verse you are addressing
 as 
 
 "...each one is travelling with an orbit in its own motion."
 
 (also note that "the celestial bodies" in the first translation quoted
 by you above is the translator's interpolation -- it is not existent in
 the original arabic, which is why it is included in brackets.)

 you're right, what the verses _do_ contain isn't all that remarkable.
 
 however, dr. bucaille (a surgeon, that's how he's a "dr.") thinks it is
 significant that the above verse contains no geocentric ideas, even
 though geocentrism was all the rage up until the 17th century (?) or so.
 (and this goes for the rest of the qur'an as well, which has about 750
 verses or so regarding nature, i think i remember reading once.)
