 the "`little' things" above were in reference to germany, clearly.  people
 said that there were similar things in germany, but no one could name any.
 they said that these were things that everyone should know, and that they
 weren't going to waste their time repeating them.  sounds to me like no one
 knew, either.  i looked in some books, but to no avail.

 it has *caused* problems?  again, no one has shown that things were better
 before the motto, or that they'd likely be better after.  i don't think
 the motto initiates any sort of harassment.  harassment will occur whether
 or not the motto is present.
