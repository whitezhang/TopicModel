 i'll take a wild guess and say freedom is objectively valuable.  i base
 this on the assumption that if everyone in the world were deprived utterly
 of their freedom (so that their every act was contrary to their volition),
 almost all would want to complain.  therefore i take it that to assert or
 believe that "freedom is not very valuable", when almost everyone can see
 that it is, is every bit as absurd as to assert "it is not raining" on
 a rainy day.  i take this to be a candidate for an objective value, and it
 it is a necessary condition for objective morality that objective values
 such as this exist.
