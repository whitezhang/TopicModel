 i think this is a big leap sex->depression.  one example is myself,
 where no sex->depression :)  but, seriously 1) promiscuity is on a decline,
 depression is not and 2) it might be more reasonable to say 
 depression->promiscuity.  i think depression is more likely to come
 from emotional problems (relationships, family, job, friends) and
 promiscuity is used as an escape.
 since i see marriage as a civil and religious bond rather than an
 emotional bond, i don't see a problem with sex before (not outside of)
 marriage so long as you have the same commitment and devotion as
 what is expected from a married couple.  of course, this is just 
 my opinion.
