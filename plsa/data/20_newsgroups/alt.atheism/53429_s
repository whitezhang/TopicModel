 faith and dogma are dangerous because they cause people to act on
 faith alone, which by its nature is without justification.  that
 is what i mean by the word ``faith'': belief without justification, or
 belief with arbitrary justification, or with emotional (irrational)
 justification.
 
 for example, when someone says that god exists, that they don't know
 why they believe god exists, they can just feel it, that's faith.
 
 dogma is bad because it precludes positive change in belief based
 on new information, or increased mental faculty.

 faith and dogma are irrational.  the faith and dogma part of any religion
 are responsible for the irrationality of the individuals.  i claim that
 faith and dogma are the quintessential part of any religion.  if that
 makes (the much overused in this context) buddism a philosophy rather
 than a religion, i can live with that.  science is not a religion,
 because there is no faith nor dogma.

 have you noticed that philosophers tend to be atheists?  if a philosopher
 is not an atheist, s/he tends to be called a theologian.
 
 a christian tends to consider christianity sacred.  christianity is
 a special set of beliefs, sanctioned by god himself, and therefore,
 to conceive of changing those beliefs is to question the existence
 of that being who makes no mistakes.  faith comes into play.  dogma
 comes into play.  ``the lord works in mysterious ways'' is an example
 of faith being used to reconcile evidence that the beliefs are flawed.
 sure, interpretations of what ``god said'' are changed to satisfy the
 needs of society, but when god says something, that's it.  it was said,
 and that's that.  since god said it, it is unflawed, even if the
 interpretations are flawed.
 
 science, (as would be practiced by atheists) in contrast, has a
 built in defence against faith and dogma.
 a scientist holds sacred the idea that beliefs should change to
 suit whatever is the best information available at the time, and,
 *and*, ****and***, a scientist understands that any current beliefs
 are deficient in some way.  the goal is to keep improving
 the beliefs.  the goal is to keep changing the beliefs to reflect
 the best information currently available.  that's the only rational
 thing to do.  that's good philosophy.
 
 can you see the difference?  science views beliefs as being flawed,
 and new information can be obtained to improve them.  (how many
 scientists would claim to have complete and perfect understanding
 of everything?  none---it would put them out of a job!)  religion
 views its beliefs as being perfect, and the interpretations of
 those beliefs must be changed as new information is acquired which
 conflicts with them.

 it's easier for someone to kill a person when s/he doesn't require
 a good rational justification of the killing.  i don't consider
 ``he's jewish'', or ``he was born of jewish parents'', or
 ``this document says he's jewish'' to be good rational justification.

 clinton and the fbi would love for you to convince them of this.
 it would save the us taxpayer a lot of money if you could.
