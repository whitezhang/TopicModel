 i would recomend to anyone out there to visit your local christian bookstore
 and become aware of the stuff they sell.	quite
 interesting.  most of the stuff is far from intelectual.  (about the level of
 chick pamphelets...)  if it is a common fundie bookstore, it should have at
 least one section about how you should hate wiccans, pagans, catholics,
 mormons, rock musicians, and anyone else who is not as fanatical as them. 
 (hate for the "love of god(tm)"!) it is even more interesting watching the
 people who frequent such places.  very scary people.  they hear voices from
 "god" telling them whatever they want to hear.  (if they were not christians,
 most of them would be locked away.  maybe this is why federal money was
 reduced to mental institutions by the reagan administration...	had to get
 their religious leaders out...)
