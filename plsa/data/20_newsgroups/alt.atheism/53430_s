 consider special relativity.  it hasn't be proved, nor has it been
 disproved.  no one has a proof one way or the other, but many people
 are interested in it!
  
 i've satisfied myself that nothing could indicate absolutely the
 existence of god one way or the other.  the two possibilities
 are supernaturalism and naturalism.  of course no set of circumstances can
 be inconsistent with supernaturalism, but similarly, no set of circumstances
 can be inconsistent with naturalism.  in naturalism, any phenomenon that
 could be described as god is considered part of the natural world, to
 be studied as any other natural phenomenon (gravity, for instance).  
 for example, if a loud ``godlike'' voice vociferously announced, ``i
 am god, i exist, and i will prove it by reversing the force of gravity,''
 and if then gravity did indeed reverse, a naturalist (probably a scientist)
 would say, ``boy, we sure didn't understand gravity as well as we
 thought we did, and that loud voice is something new.  perhaps we
 didn't understand thunder as well as we thought we did either.''

 i'm sure glad you don't know where i live, since you don't seem
 to realize it is impossible for you to distinguish between voices
 in your head, and god's voice.

 you seem to have missed my point.  even if jim jones and david koresh
 were not religious people, my point remains that faith and dogma
 are dangerous, and religion encourages them.  jim jones and david koresh
 also encouraged them.  my point does not rely on jim jones and david
 koresh being religious.
