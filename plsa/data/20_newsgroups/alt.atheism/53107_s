 	one need not have have the notion that science is useful. for 
 example: many christian scientists do not believe medical science to be 
 usefor or worthy. that does not make medical science subjective.
 
 	in any event, i fail to see what you mean by "subjective" science.
 are you suggesting that it is, and that if i step of a building, i may fall, 
 while you may not?
 
 	i assure you, it is a very objective conclusion that you will fall 
 ( without any other outside means of support ). if you do not believe this, 
 i suggest you step off of a building, and subjectively believe that you will 
 not fall.
