 this is a standard argument for fundies.  can you spot the falicy? the
 statement is arguing from the assumption that jesus actually existed.  so far,
 they have not been able to offer real proof of that existance.  most of them
 try it using the (very) flawed writings of josh mcdowell and others to prove
 it, but those writers use very flawed sources.  (if they are real sources at
 all, some are not.)  when will they ever learn to do real research, instead of
 believing the drivel sold in the christian bookstores.
