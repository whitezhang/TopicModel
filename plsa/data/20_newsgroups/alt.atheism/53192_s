 see, we are disagreeing on the definition of moral here.  earlier, you said
 that it must be a conscious act.  by your definition, no instinctive
 behavior pattern could be an act of morality.  you are trying to apply
 human terms to non-humans.  i think that even if someone is not conscious
 of an alternative, this does not prevent his behavior from being moral.

 i try to show it, but by your definition, it can't be shown.
 
 and, morality can be thought of a large class of princples.  it could be
 defined in terms of many things--the laws of physics if you wish.  however,
 it seems silly to talk of a "moral" planet because it obeys the laws of
 phyics.  it is less silly to talk about animals, as they have at least
 some free will.
