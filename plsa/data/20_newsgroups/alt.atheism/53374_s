 but you have been courteous and therefore received courtesy in return.  this
 person instead has posted one of the worst arguments i have ever seen
 made from the pro-christian people.  i've known several jesuits who would
 laugh in his face if he presented such an argument to them.
 
 let's ignore the fact that it's not a true trilemma for the moment (nice
 word maddi, original or is it a real word?) and concentrate on the
 liar, lunatic part.
 
 the argument claims that no one would follow a liar, let alone thousands
 of people.  look at l. ron hubbard.  now, he was probably not all there,
 but i think he was mostly a liar and a con-artist.  but look at how many
 thousands of people follow dianetics and scientology.  i think the 
 baker's and swaggert along with several other televangelists lie all
 the time, but look at the number of follower they have.
 
 as for lunatics, the best example is hitler.  he was obviously insane,
 his advisors certainly thought so.  yet he had a whole country entralled
 and came close to ruling all of europe.  how many germans gave their lives
 for him?  to this day he has his followers.
 
 i'm just amazed that people still try to use this argument.  it's just
 so obviously *wrong*.
