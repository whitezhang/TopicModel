 are you making a meta-argument here?  in any case, you are wrong.  
 think of those invisible pink unicorns.

 i was responding to the "historical accuracy... of biblical claims",
 of which the existence of jesus is only one, and one that was not even
 mentioned in my post.

 wrong.  that was exactly the issue.  go back and read the context
 included within my post, and you'll see what i mean.
 
 now that i've done you the kindness of responding to your questions,
 please do the same for me.  answer the charley challenges.  your claim
 that they are of the "did not!/ did so!" variety is a dishonest dodge
 that i feel certain fools only one person.
