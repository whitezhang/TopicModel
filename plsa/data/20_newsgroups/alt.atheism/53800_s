 of course.  hitchings believes in evolution.  the purpose of the quote i
 sited was to show the ambivalance that evolutionists have with their own
 theory.  for example, on page 107 he states, "...one may question an 
 evolution theory so beset by doubts among even those who teach it.  if
 darwinism is truely the great unifying principle of biology, it encompasses
 extraordinarily large areas of ignorance.  it fails to explain some of the
 basic questions of all -- how lifeless chemicals came alive, what rules of
 grammer lie behind the genetic code, how genes shap and form living things."
