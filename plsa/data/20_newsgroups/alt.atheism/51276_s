 my argument is mainly a proposal of what i think is a plausible argument
 against extra-marital sex -- one which i personally believe has some
 truth.  my main purpose for posting it here is to show that a
 _plausible_ argument can be made against extra-marital sex.  at this
 stage i am not saying that this particular viewpoint is proven or
 anything like that, just that it is plausible.  to try to convince you
 all of this particular point of view, i would probably have to do a lot
 of work researching what has been done in this field, etc., in order to
 gather further evidence, which i simply do not have time to do now.  
 
 also note that i said that i think extra-marital sex is "a prime cause"
 (in my opinion) of the generally greater levels of psychological
 problems, especially depression, in western societies.  i am not saying
 it is "the prime cause" or "the only cause", just "a prime cause" --
 i.e. one of the significant contributions to this trend.  i think when
 you say you think my view is simplistic, you have forgotten this -- i
 admit that there are probably other factors, but i do think that
 extra-marital sex (and, imo, subsequent destabilization of the family)
 is a significant factor in the rise in psychological problems like
 depression in western society this century.
