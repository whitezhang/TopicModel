 science is the process of modeling the real world based on commonly agreed
 interpretations of our observations (perceptions).

 values can also refer to meaning.  for example in computer science the
 value of 1 is true, and 0 is false.  science is based on commonly agreed
 values (interpretation of observations), although science can result in a
 reinterpretation of these values.

 the values underlaying science are not objective since they have never been
 fully agreed, and the change with time.  the values of newtonian physic are
 certainly different to those of quantum mechanics.
