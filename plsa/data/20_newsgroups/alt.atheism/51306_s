 respond to the "charley challenges" (and judging from my e-mail, there
 appear to be quite a few of you.)  
 
 it is clear that mr. wingate intends to continue to post tangential or
 unrelated articles while ingoring the challenges themselves.  between
 the last two re-postings of the challenges, i noted perhaps a dozen or
 more posts by mr. wingate, none of which answered a single challenge.  
 
 it seems unmistakable to me that mr. wingate hopes that the questions
 will just go away, and he is doing his level best to change the
 subject.  given that this seems a rather common net.theist tactic, i
 would like to suggest that we impress upon him our desire for answers,
 in the following manner:
 
 1. ignore any future articles by mr. wingate that do not address the
 challenges, until he answers them or explictly announces that he
 refuses to do so.
 
 --or--
 
 2. if you must respond to one of his articles, include within it
 something similar to the following:
 
     "please answer the questions posed to you in the charley challenges."
 
 really, i'm not looking to humiliate anyone here, i just want some
 honest answers.  you wouldn't think that honesty would be too much to
 ask from a devout christian, would you?  
 
 nevermind, that was a rhetorical question.
