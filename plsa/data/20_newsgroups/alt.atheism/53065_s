 thanks to whoever posted this wonderful parody of people who post without 
 reading the faq!  i was laughing for a good 5 minutes.  were there any 
 parts of the faq that weren't mentioned?  i think there might have been one
 or two...
 
 please don't tell me this wasn't a joke.  i'm not ready to hear that yet...
