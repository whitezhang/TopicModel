 obviously, we have different sources. bill moyers (who happens to be a
 theist, to tie this to alt.atheism!) in his pbs documentary "after the
 war" is my main source. (i think i still have it on videotape.) others
 include the nation and the progressive.
 
 the rest of the article is mere rationalisation. you may claim that
 sanitation plants are strategic "legitimate" targets, but what happens to
 the civilians in a city with no sewer system? what happens to the
 civilians when you destroy water purification plants? and when hospitals
 can't handle the resultant epidemics, because there is no more electricity?
 
 and what exactly are your sources? we have all, i'm sure, seen postol's
 interviews in the media where he demostrates how the pentagon lied about
 the patriot's effectiveness; what is your source for the 70%
 effectiveness you claim?
 
 in any case, i don't know if this is relevant to alt.atheism. how about
 if we move it somewhere else?
