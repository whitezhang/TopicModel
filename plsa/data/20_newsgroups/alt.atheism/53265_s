 some people might think it takes faith to be an atheist... but faith in
 what?  does it take some kind of faith to say that the great invisible pink
 unicorn does not exist?  does it take some kind of faith to say that santa
 claus does not exist?  if it does (and it may for some people i suppose) it
 certainly isn't as big a leap of faith to say that these things (and god)
 do exist.  (i suppose it depends on your notion and definition of "faith".)
 
 besides... not believing in a god means one doesn't have to deal with all
 of the extra baggage that comes with it!  this leaves a person feeling
 wonderfully free, especially after beaten over the head with it for years!
 i agree that religion and belief is often an important psychological healer
 for many people and for that reason i think it's important.  however,
 trying to force a psychological fantasy (i don't mean that in a bad way,
 but that's what it really is) on someone else who isn't interested is
 extremely rude.  what if i still believed in santa claus and said that my
 belief in santa did wonderful things for my life (making me a better
 person, allowing me to live without guilt, etc...) and then tried to get
 you to believe in santa too just 'cuz he did so much for me?  you'd call
 the men in white coats as soon as you could get to a phone.
