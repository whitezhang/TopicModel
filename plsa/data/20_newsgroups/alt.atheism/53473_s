 i can't. it seems jesus used logic to make people using logic
 look like fools? no, that does not sound right, he maybe just
 told they were fools, and that's it, and people believed that...
 hmm, does not sound reasonable either...
 
 i find it always very intriguing to see people stating that
 transcendental values can't be explained, and then in the
 next sentence they try to explain these unexplained values.
 highly strange.
 
 cheers,
