 you have done no such thing.

 an islamic bank is a bank which operates according to the rules
 of islam in regard to banking. this is done explicitly by the
 bank. this was not the case with bcci.

 this is crap. bcci was motivated by the same motives as other
 international banks, with perhaps an emphasis on dealing with
 outlaws and the intelligence services of various governments.

 back to childish propaganda again. you really ought to get a life
 rather than wasting bandwith on such empty typing. there are thousands
 of islamic banks operating throughout the world which no-one ever hears
 about. if you want to talk about corrupted banks we can talk about
 all the people who've been robbed by american banks.
