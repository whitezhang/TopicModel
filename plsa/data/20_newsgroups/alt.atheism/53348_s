  but how does one handle the nonrepeatability of the experiment? in many types ofexperiments the "prediction" is that the observed phenomena will happen again
 and be capable of being observed. for example, in chemistry someone may predict
 : the outcome of a chemical reaction and then actually observe that reaction
 repeatedly. you can't repeat or ever know for sure the original conditions that produced life. so it seems we could never say, "that's exactly how it happened."as far as we know that event was unobserved. (at least no one has admitted
 : it. :-) ) so unlike the chemistry experiment repeatability and observability,
 : strictly speaking, are lacking.

 	can't resist, because i've thought about it...
 
 	basically what is being constructed is a theory of abiogenesis.
 there are any number of criterion that would have to be satisfied for
 the theory to be accurate, such as the hotly discussed topic of
 stereoisomerism.  just making life in the lab wouldn't suffice (for
 all the wonder that would engender!), because for the theory of
 abiogenesis to be accurate, the life would have to resemble the best
 idea we have of what the earliest lifeforms resembled.
 
 	comes down to that old question "can we ever really be sure?"
 
 	but if were to examine a claim that abiogenesis had been
 demonstrated in the laboratory and was the most likely path followed on
 primordial earth, i would look for the following:
 
 	1)  experiment reproduced a plausible primordial earth
 	environment;
 
 	2)  all contamination sources were eliminated;
 
 	3)  the lifeform produced resembles primitive/simple earth
 	lifeforms;
 
 	4)  the theory accounts for differences in the modern
 	earth environment and primitive earth environment.
 
 now, if those criteria were satisfied, dr. abio, who performed the
 experiment, would then be in possession of the best candidate for
 a theory of abiogenesis on the primordial earth.  at which point dr.
 bbio could then counter with a decisive critique keyed on an aspect
 of the theory which doesn't match the early earth environment, or
 a characteristic of the new "lifeform" that doesn't resemble life
 on earth.  were he to suggest an improvement to eliminate the
 discrepancies, and perform an experiment to demonstrate his claims,
 dr. bbio would then have the best theory.
 	never provable;  constantly modifiable;  progressing ever
 closer to the "correct" answer, until the evidence is overwhelming
 (and even when it is, a theory that explains even more may take its
 place) ---
 
 	---- that's a scientific theory.
