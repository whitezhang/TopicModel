 john:
 
     isn't there one of the ten commandments that says something like "you
 shall not bear false witness?"  and doesn't quoting someone in a way that
 completely inverts what they were trying to say constitute bearing false
 witness?  doesn't this cause you any internal conflict at all?
 
     i ask this because i am a christian and i am very perturbed to see the
 "creation-science" camp use what i would characterize as sleazy tactics in
 order to try to win the "debate."  there is a long tradition of christian
 thought that maintains that an essential christian ethic is that the end does
 not justify the means.  in other words, how you do something is as important
 as what it is intended to accomplish.  i don't think that using misquoted
 excerpts from people who disagree with you brings very much glory to god,
 do you?
