 so?
 what's your point?

 maybe to me! (in this example, and as i argue below, that's not even
 true.)

 but science is also good for technology, which may or may not
 have anything to do with truth. i may value technology and
 not truth, after all.

 spare me. this is nonsense, frank. pregnancy is sometimes referred
 to as having a "bun in the oven." does this mean that the uterus
 is at 450 f? argument by idiom is weak indeed, and it's what
 you're engaging in here.

 of course it's different. $3!=ma. what is at issue is accuracy,
 not difference.

 this is the result of a chain of deduction about the value
 of understanding the universe. one can make the observation
 that if one wanted to understand the universe, f=ma would be
 valuable without believing f=ma to be valuable, frank.

 things which have a basis in reality are different from things
 which have a basis in reality. quantum mechanics is very different
 from biochemistry, yet they both (allegedly) have basises in reality.
 look, frank, noone said that people didn't do science because they
 value it(in the sense of think it is good), but that is not necessary
 to make the observation that it's results have value (in the sense
 that they are accurate.) allow me to give you an example: i think
 that knowing the byte order on ibm 3090s is pretty much worthless
 (i don't care to know it) but i would be quite prepared to
 note as valuable (i.e. accurate) the claim that it was big-endian
 if it was shown to be so (like, by showing me the manual.)

 no, it's fleeking not. scientific judgement is solely the sense
 of evaluating an expression (accuracy). it has nothing to do with
 importance, worthiness, or usefulness. choice of problems does
 have to do with those factors, but they are orthogonal to
 evaluating (for accuracy) solutions to chosen problems.

 no, i was saying that it works independently of whether i measure
 it, which is something quite different.

 it would if they were the same thing, which they are not.

 frank, you are attempting to inject "goodness" judgements where there
 are only "accuracy" judgements, by essentially punning on the word
 'value' which has both meanings. "useful" is a goodness judgement.
 "reasonable" is an accuracy judgement. they are not the same
 thing at all. ("useful in making some conclusion" is an accuracy
 judgement again, i'm afraid.) sorry, frank, but all you're doing is
 using the ambiguity of english to obfuscate the issue. if you
 mean to say that science is based on value (accuracy) judgements,
 i have no problem with that. if you mean to say that it's based
 on value (goodness) judgements, that's nonsense. by contrast,
 morality is clearly based on goodness judgements.
