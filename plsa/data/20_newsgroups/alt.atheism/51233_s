 no, you don't understand.  i said that i don't think people can discuss
 the subjective merits of religion objectively.  this should be obvious.
 people here have said that everyone would be better off without religion,
 but this almost certainly isn't true.

 but, guns and axes are tools, both of which have been used for murder.
 should both be taken away?  that is to say, i don't think motto misuse
 warrants its removal.  at least not in this case.
