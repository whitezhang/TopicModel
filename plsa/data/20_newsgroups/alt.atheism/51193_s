 do you honestly hold to that tripe charley? for a start there are enough
 current versions of the bible to make comparisons to show that what you write
 above is utter garbage. witness jw, mormon, catholic, anglican, and greek
 orthodox bibles. but to really convince you i'd have to take you to a good
 old library. in our local library we had a 1804 king james which i compared
 to a brand new, hot of god's tongue good news bible. genesis was almost
 unrecognisable, many of the discrepencies between the four gospels had been
 edited from the good news bible. in fact the god of good news was a much
 more congenial fellow i must say. 
 
 if you like i'll get the 1804 king james out again and actually give you
 some quotes. at least the headings haven't changed much.
