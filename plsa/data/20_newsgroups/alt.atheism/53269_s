 oops, sorry, my words, not the words of the qur'an.

 note that "(the celestial bodies)" in the above verse is an
 interpolation (which is why it is in brackets) -- it is the translator's 
 (incorrect, imho) interpretation.
 
 here is maurice bucaille's translation (he studied arabic for his
 research into the qur'an and science) of this verse:
 
 "(god is) the one who created the night, the day, the sun and the moon.
 each is travelling in an orbit with its own motion." (qur'an :33)
 
 the positive aspect of this verse noted by dr. maurice bucaille is that
 while geocentrism was the commonly accepted notion at the time (and for
 a long time afterwards), there is no notion of geocentrism in this verse
 (or anywhere in the qur'an).
