 this is really tedious. every bad thing that's ever happened is
 because the malefactors were under the influence of religion - does
 anyone -really- believe that. i've seen it so often it must be a
 pretty general opinion in a.a, but i want to believe that atheists are
 really not that dishonest. please, stick to the facts and, having
 accomplished that, interpret them correctly.
