 i was replying to a person who attempted to justify the fatwa
 against rushdie on the grounds that his work was intentionally
 insulting. 
 
 i think that to take a single sentence from a fairly long
 posting, and to say 
 
 	"i don't know if you are doing so, but it 
 	seems you are implying....."
 
 is at the very best quite disingenuous, and perhaps even
 dishonest.    if anyone care to dig back and read the full
 posting, they will see nothing of the kind.
 
 i trust you don't deny that islamic teaching has "something
 to do" with the fatwa against rushdie?
