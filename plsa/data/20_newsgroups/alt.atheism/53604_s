 i bought a copy of the satanic verses when there was talk of the british
 government banning it.  there's nothing interests me in a book more than
 making it illegal.
 
 however, it's still sitting on my shelf unread.  perhaps i'll get round to it
 soon.  i've still got a pile of lem, bulgakov and zamyatin to go through; i
 don't find nearly enough time to read.  in fact, there are far more
 interesting things to do than i can ever find time for; how anyone ever
 manages to be bored is beyond me.  if i didn't have to sleep, maybe i could
 manage it.
