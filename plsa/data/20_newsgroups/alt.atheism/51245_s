       in the deletions somewhere, it mentioned something about chopping
 off of hands being a punishment for theft in saudi arabia. assuming this
 is so (i wouldn't know), and assuming it is done by people fitting your
 requirement for "muslim" (which i find highly likely), then would you
 please try to convince bobby mozumder that muslims chop people's hands
 off?
 
       come back when you've succeeded.
