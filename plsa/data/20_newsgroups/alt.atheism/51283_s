 arguments against homosexuality, but these don't qualify.

  oh? i guess all those social insects (e.g. ants, bees, etc.) which
 have one breeding queen and a whole passel of sterile workers are on
 the way out, huh?

  i refer you to the bonobos, a species of primate as closeley related to
 humans as chimpanzees (that is, very closely). they have sex all the
 time, homosexual as well as heterosexual. when the group finds food, they
 have sex. before the go to sleep at night, they have sex. after they
 escape from or fight off prdators, they have sex. sex serves a very important
 social function above and beyond reproduction in this species. a species
 closely related to humans. there is some indication that sex performs
 a social function in humans, as well, but even if not, this shows that
 such a function is not *impossible*.
