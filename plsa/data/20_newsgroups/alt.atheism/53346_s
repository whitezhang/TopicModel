 okay, i see smilies, so this isn't supposed to be a serious post.
 on the other hand, i would suppose it does has some motivation behind
 it. apparently the idea is to poke fun at religion, but there is 
 presumably some sort of reasoning behind it. as an argument, this 
 statement is worthless. presuming the qur'an is a perfect religious 
 text (whatever that might be) there is still plenty of room for 
 disagreement about its implications for issues far from essentials.
 
 i've already responded to the question of how a judgment might be made
 between two people who in fact _do_ disagree about islam, which doesn't
 presume anything about the qur'an other than its having sufficient
 clarity for all important disputes about the basic principles of
 islam. this hardly constitutes a claim that no two people could have
 disagreements about _all_ issues relevant to islam.
