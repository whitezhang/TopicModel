 as i understand things, this is just a matter of perspective. if you are
 on the outside looking in, it appears that nothing can ever enter the
 black hole; as something approaches the event horizon it appears to slow,
 and never gets there. however if you are on the object looking out you
 get an entirely different view. as you look out you will see the universe
 speed up, and ultimately will witness the collapse or heat death of
 the universe without.
