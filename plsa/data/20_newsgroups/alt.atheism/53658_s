 (short reply to kent sandvik's post remarking how it is strange that
 somehow sufism is related to islam, as [to him] they seem quite
 different.)
 
 if one really understands islam, it is not strange that sufism is
 associated with it.  in fact, sufism is (in general) seen as the "inner
 dimension" of islam.
 
 one of the "roots" of the word "islam" is "submission" -- "islam"
 denotes submission to god.  sufism is the most complete submission to
 god imaginable, in "annihilating" oneself in god.
 
 (i am not a sufi or on the sufi path, but have read a lot and recently
 have been discussing a number of things with others who are on the sufi
 path.)
