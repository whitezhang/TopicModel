 i have an addition to the faq regarding "why are there no atheist
 hospitals."
 
 if i recall correctly, johns hopkins was built to provide medical
 services without the "backing" of a religious group...thus making it a
 hospital "dedicated to the glory of [weak] atheism."
 
 might someone check up on this?
