 oh no, not again.
 
 there is a difference between believing that god exists, and loving him.
 (for instance, satan certainly believes god exists, but does not love him.)
 what unbelievers request in situations like this is that god provide evidence
 compelling enough to believe he exists, not to compel them to love him.
