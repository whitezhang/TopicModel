 my own personal and highly subjective opinion is that freedom
 is a good thing.
 
 however, when i here people assert that the only "true" freedom
 is in following the words of this and that messiah, i realise
 that people don't even agree on the meaning of the word.
 
 what does it mean to say that word x represents an objective
 value when word x has no objective meaning?
