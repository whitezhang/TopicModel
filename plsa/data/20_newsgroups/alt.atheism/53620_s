 sounds like more of the same.  gods were used to describe almost
 everything in the past.  as we come to understand the underpinnings of
 more and more, the less we credit to a god.  now, the not-so-well
 understood elements (at least by the author) includes quarks and tectonic
 drift.  i guess that's better than describing the perceived patterns of
 stars in the sky as heroes being immortalized by the gods.
 
 kinda sounds like old-earth creation--it seems that life did, indeed, evolve
 from a common ancestor.  what caused that initial common ancestor?
 
 are we going to hear another debate on causeless events? ;-)
