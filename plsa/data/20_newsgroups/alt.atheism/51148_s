 ok, this is the only thing i will comment on from stan at this time...
 part of this forum we call rec.scouting is for policy discussions and
 related topics.  this is a policy discussion, and involves related 
 topics.  this is not a "fringe" group discussion.  obviously, it 
 engenders strong feelings from all sides of the issues at hand. 
 wether a particular view is anti-societal or not is your opinion, 
 and yours alone, don't try to make it seem otherwise. 
 if you do not wish to engage in this discussion, use a kill file. 
 if you wish to continue in this discussion, please do so, knowing 
 full well the implications that apply.
 i know for myself that i plan on continuing with the discussion when 
 i have the wish to have input.  i for one am tired of people trying to 
 say that this is not a matter significant for this group!  it is, and 
 quite so. especially for those of us who feel the impact more closely.
