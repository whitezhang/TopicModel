 on one of the morning shows (i think is was the today show), david koresh's
 lawyer was interviewed. during that interview he flipped through some letters
 that david koresh wrote. on one of letters was written in hebrew (near the
 bottom of the page):
 
   koresh adonai
 
 did anyone else see that? what could this mean by him (david) writing this?
