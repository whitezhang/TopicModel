 for the last time, bobby. lack of belief in your god does not imply
 atheism. just because some moslems aren't moral does not mean they don't
 believe in a god named allah, although their allah may not do the things
 your allah does. if a moslem says he/she believes that a god exists, he/she
 is a theist (though maybe not a true follower of islam).
