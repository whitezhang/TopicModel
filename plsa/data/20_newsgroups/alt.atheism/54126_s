 i once heard an arguement from a xtian friend similar to this.
 "christianity is a higher logic.  athiest like u will not be able
 to understand it.  your atheist logic is very low.  only thru faith can 
 we understand the higher logic in god".
 
 so i asked him, "so what is this higher logic?"
 
 his answer, "i don't know."
 
 this, & the posting above highlights one of the worst things about
 xtainity.  it is abundantly clear to both atheists & xtains that
 their believe is both illogical & irrational.  their tactics, therefore:
 to disregard logic & rationality altogether.  silly excuses such as
 the ones above and those such as, "how can u trust science, science
 was invented by man!", only goes to further show the weakness of
 their religion.
 
 in my country where xtainity was and still is rapidly growing, xtains
 never try to convert people by appealing to their brains or senses.
 they know it would be a fruitless act, given the irrational nature
 of their faith.
 they would wait until a person is in distress, then they would comfort
 him/her and addict them to their emotional opium.
 
 never in my life had i met a person who converted to xtainity coz it's
 "reasonable".  rationality has no place in xtainity (see xtian arguement
 against "reason" above).
