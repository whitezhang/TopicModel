 it has. there is a guy running around in switzerland who claims to have
 been conceived similarly. his mother says the same. his father is said to
 be a bit surprised.
  
 but anyway, there have been a lot of messiahs, and many have had a similar
 story about their birth. or their death. a list of messiahs could be quite
 interesting.

 i would wonder why an omnipotent god pulls such stunts instead of providing
 evidence for everyone to check. and the whole question is absurd.
  
 wouldn't you feel bad if you'd find out that stones are sentient, and that
 you have stepped on them all your life? and wouldn't you feel bad when you'd
 see the proof that jesus was just a plot of satan?

 you've forgotten the pride factor.

 the argument is a fallacy. it is like "thanks for reading this far" on the end
 of a letter. most religions claim that they won't fizzle because they contain
 some eternal truth. so does christianity. since there are old religions it is
 no wonder to find old religions that have it that they would last.
  
 roll twelve dice. calculate the chance for the result. argue that there must
 be something special about the result because an event with a chance of
 1/(6**12) could hardly happen by chance only. feel elevated because you have
 participated in letting that special event take place.
