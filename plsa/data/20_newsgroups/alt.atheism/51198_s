 	this is not  strickly correct. only by incorrect application of the 
 rules of language, does it seem to work.
 
 	the mercedes in the first premis, and the one in the second are not 
 the same mercedes. 
 
 	in your case, 
 
 	a = b
 	c = d
 	
 	a and d are not equal. one is a name of a person, the other the
 name of a object. you can not simply extract a word without taking the 
 context into account. 
 
 	of course, your case doesn't imply that a = d.
 
 	in his case, a does equal d.
 
 
 	try again...
