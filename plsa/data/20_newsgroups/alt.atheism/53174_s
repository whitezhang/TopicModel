 what i've been saying is that moral behavior is likely the null behavior.
 that is, it doesn't take much work to be moral, but it certainly does to
 be immoral (in some cases).  also, i've said that morality is a remnant
 of evolution.  our moral system is based on concepts well practiced in
 the animal kingdom.

 but, this doesn't get us anywhere.  your particular beliefs are irrelevant
 unless you can share them or discuss them...
