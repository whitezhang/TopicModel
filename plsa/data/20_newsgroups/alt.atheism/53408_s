 for example, i would claim that the recent assassination of four
 catholic construction workers who had no connection with the ira
 was probably religously motivated.

 what would you call is when someone writes "the killings in n.i 
 are not religously motivated?"

 given that the avowed aim of the ira is to take northern ireland
 into a country that has a particular church written into its 
 constitution, and which has restriction on civil rights dictated
 by that church, i fail to see why the word "past" is appropriate.

 you don't have to hand us a bunch of double-talk about what
 i was "seemingly" attacking.   i *quoted* what i was attacking.
