 no, look again. while you never *said* it, the implication is pretty clear.
 i'm sorry, but i can only respond to your words, not your true meaning. usenet
 is a slippery medium.

 look, i'm not supporting *any* dogmatic position. i'd be a fool to say that
 in the large group of people that are atheists, no people exist who wish to
 proselytize in the same fashion as religion. how many hard atheists do you 
 see posting here, anyway? maybe i'mm just not looking hard enough...

 i never meant to do so, although i understand where you might get that idea.
 i was merely using the 'bible' example as an allegory to illustrate my
 point.

 evidence for what? who? i think i may have lost this thread...

 guilty as charged. what i *meant* to say was, the theists who *are* arrogant
 are this way because they say ...  other than that, i thought my meaning
 was clear enough. any position that claims itself as superior to another with
 no supporting evidence is arrogant. thanks for your apology, btw.
