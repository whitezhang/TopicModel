 as far as i know, tigers are not sentient.  if i were pushed into a pool with
 some dolphins and they attacked me, i might be inclined to blame the dolphins
 rather than the person doing the pushing, as (a) dolphins are not usually
 aggressive and (b) they seem to have well-developed brains and a capacity for
 abstract thought.
 
 as a matter of fact, tigers rarely attack humans unless the human provokes
 them.  of course, if they are in a cage which is far too small, that might
 count as provocation...
