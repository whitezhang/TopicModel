 	a human has greater control over his/her actions, than a 
 predominately instictive tiger.
 
 	a proper analogy would be:
 
 	if you are thrown into a cage with a person and get mauled, do you 
 blame that person?
 
 	yes. [ providing that that person was in a responsible frame of 
 mind, eg not clinicaly insane, on pcb's, etc. ]
