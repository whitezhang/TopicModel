 "contradictory" is a property of language.  if i correct this to
 
 
       things defined by contradictory language do not exist
 
 i will object to definitions as reality.  if you then amend it to
 
       things described by contradictory language do not exist
 
 then we've come to something which is plainly false.  failures in
 description are merely failures in description.
