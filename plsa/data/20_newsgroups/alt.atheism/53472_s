 bill, i think you have a misunderstanding about atheism. lack of 
 belief in god does not directly imply lack of understanding
 transcendental values. i hope you would accept the fact that 
 for instance buddhists appreciate issues related to non-empirical
 reasoning without the need to automatically believe in theism.
 
 i think reading a couple of books related to buddhism might 
 revise and fine tune your understanding of non-christian systems.
 
 cheers,
 kent
