   precisely my position.  
 
   as a newbie, i tried the point-by-point approach to debate with
   these types.  it wasted both my time and my lifespan.  ignoring
   them is not an option, since they don't go away, and doing so
   would leave one with large stretches of complete anonymity in this
   group.
 
   what's left?  healthy flaming.  i'm sure on occassion i've
   appeared to be little more than a caustic boob to some of the
   bobby types.  but why waste breath arguing with someone whose most
   rational though process involves his excretory system?
 
   and i stand by my record of recognizing these people long before
   most of the rest of the group.  so let's see what this timmons
   character has in store for us...
