  as evidence for the resurrection, it is often claimed that the disciples
 were tortured to death for their beliefs and still did not renounce
 their claim that jesus had come back from the dead.
  now, i skimmed acts and such, and i found a reference to this happening
 to stephen, but no others. where does this apparently very widely held
 belief come from? is there any evidence outside the bible? is there any
 evidence *in* the bible? i sure haven't found any...
 
 briefly, no.  there is widespread folklore, but no good documentary
 evidence, or even solid rumor, concerning the deaths of the apostles.
 further, the usual context of such arguments, as you observe, is "no
 martyrs for a lie": i.e. the willingness of these people to die rather
 than recant is evidence for the truth of their belief.  this adds the
 quite stronger twist that the proposed martyrs must have been offered
 the chance of life by recanting.  since we don't even know how or
 where they died, we certainly don't have this information.  (by the
 way, even in the case of stephen it is not at all clear that he could
 have saved himself by recanting).  the willingness of true believers
 to die for their belief, be it in jesus or jim jones, is
 well-documented, so martyrdom in and of itself says little.  [see
 1kings18:20-40 for a biblical account of the martyrdom of 450 priests
 of baal].
