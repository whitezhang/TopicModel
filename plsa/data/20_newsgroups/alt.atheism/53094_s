 1.  did you read the faqs?
 
 2.  if no, read the faqs.
 
 3.  if yes, you wouldn't have posted such drivel.  the "lord, liar
     or lunatic" argument is a false trilemma.  even if you disprove
     liar and lunatic (which you haven't), you have not eliminated
     the other possibilities, such as mistaken, misdirected, or
     misunderstood.  you have arbitrarily set up three and only
     three possibilities without considering others.
 
 4.  read a good book on rhetoric and critical thinking.  if
     you think the "lord, liar, or lunatic" discussion is an
     example of a good argument, you are in need of learning.
 
 5.  read the faqs again, especially "constructing a logical
     argument."
 
 ignore these instructions at your peril.  disobeying them
 leaves you open for righteous flaming.
