 it's not really their _decision_ to be tried. the rulings _do_ have
 legal consequences, but only in islamic law and not in uk law (this
 should be obvious). enforcing a judgment is distinct from the making
 of a judgment. take for example the judgments of the world court. this
 is an internationally recognized tribunal whose judgments often have no
 physical or economic effect but which _are_ important despite the fact
 that their judgments cannot be enforced

 of course, it is a sort of anarchism. anarchism is explicitly against
 islam. thank you for your well reasoned response, but it is beside the
 points i've been making in this thread.
