 #no, interest is different from a return on an investment.  for one

 #(i.e. the amount of money you make can go up or down, or you might even
 #lose money).  the difference is, the risk of loss is shared by the
 #investor, rather than practically all the risk being taken by the
 #borrower when the borrower borrows from the bank.
 #
 
 but is it different from stocks ?  if you wish to call an investor in stocks as
 a banker, well then its your choice .....
 
 #>relabeling does not make it interest free !!
 #
 #it is not just relabeling, as i have explained above.
 
 it  *is* relabeling ...
 also its still not interest free. the investor is still taking some money ... as
 dividend on his investment ... ofcourse the investor (in islamic *banking*, its your
 so called *bank*)  is taking more risk than the usual bank, but its still getting some
 thing back in return .... 
 
 also have you heard of junk bonds ???
