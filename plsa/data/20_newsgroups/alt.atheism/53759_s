 writing the seven seals or something along those lines.  he's already
 written the first of the seven which was around 30 pages or so and has
 handed it over to an assistant for proofreading!.  i would expect any
 decent messiah to have a built-in spellchecker.  maybe koresh 2.0 will
 come with one.
