 not any more so than
 
       holding people against their will is wrong
       if you hold people against their will we will punish you
       our punishment will be to hold you against your will
 
 is there any punishment which isn't something which, if done by a private
 person to another private person for no apparent reason, would lead to
 punishment?  (fines, i suppose.)
