 are we talking about me, or the majority of the people that support it?
 anyway, i think that "revenge" or "fairness" is why most people are in
 favor of the punishment.  if a murderer is going to be punished, people
 that think that he should "get what he deserves."  most people wouldn't
 think it would be fair for the murderer to live, while his victim died.

 perhaps you think that it is petty and pathetic, but your views are in the
 minority.

 where are we required to have compassion, forgiveness, and sympathy?  if
 someone wrongs me, i will take great lengths to make sure that his advantage
 is removed, or a similar situation is forced upon him.  if someone kills
 another, then we can apply the golden rule and kill this person in turn.
 is not our entire moral system based on such a concept?
 
 or, are you stating that human life is sacred, somehow, and that it should
 never be violated?  this would sound like some sort of religious view.

 once a criminal has committed a murder, his desires are irrelevant.
 
 and, you still have not answered my question.  if you are concerned about
 the death penalty due to the possibility of the execution of an innocent,
 then why isn't this same concern shared with imprisonment.  shouldn't we,
 by your logic, administer as minimum as punishment as possible, to avoid
 violating the liberty or happiness of an innocent person?
