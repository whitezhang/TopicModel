 #
 #this is still contradictory. it reduces to
 #
 #  (1): alterian dosh arriving in my account is due to [benefactor or bug].
 #
 #  (2): this is not evidence for [benefactor], neither is it evidence for
 #       [bug] (meaning that it doesn't lend more weight to one than to the
 #       other)
 #
 #  (3): therefore no evidence can exist for [benefactor] and no evidence
 #       can exist for [bug].
 #
 #but (3) relies on a shift in meaning from (2). when you say (paraphrased)
 #in (2) that this is not "evidence for [benefactor]", for example, what you
 #mean is that it's no *more* evidence for [benefactor] than it is for [bug].
 
 yes, that's what i mean.
 
 #in (3), however, you've shifted the meaning of "evidence for [benefactor]"
 #so that it now means `absolute' "evidence for [benefactor]" rather than
 #`relative' "evidence for [benefactor]" w.r.t. [bug].
 
 not really, i meant evidence that would tend to one over the other.  i
 think this is just a communications problem.   what i am trying to say,
 in my clumsy way, is that while i buy your theory as far as it relates
 to theism making predictions (prayer, your 'rapture' example), i don't
 buy your use of occam's razor in all cases where a=0.
 
 in my example, one couldn't dismiss
 [benefactor] or [bug] on the grounds of simplicity - one of these is necessary
 to explain the dosh.  i brought up the 'one-by-one dismissal' process to
 show that it would be wrong to do so.  from what you're saying in this
 post, it seems you agree, and we're talking at cross-purposes.
 
 #(3) is still in contradiction to (1).
 #
 #some sums may help. with b = benefactor, b = bug, d = dosh arrives in account:
 #
 #  (1) implies  p(b+b | d) = 1
 #
 #assuming that p(bb | d) = 0, so it's either the benefactor *or* a bug
 #which is responsible if the bucks arrive, but not both, then
 #
 #   p(b+b | d)   =   p(b | d) + p(b | d)
 #
 #so
 #
 #   p(b | d) + p(b | d)  =  1
 #
 #but (3) implies that
 #
 #   p(b | d)  =  0  and  p(b | d)  =  0.
 
 no, this isn't what i meant.  p(b | d) = 0.5 and p(b | d) = 0.5, with
 necessarily no new observation (we've already seen the dosh) to change
 those estimates.  i was trying to say (again, in my clumsy way) that
 it would be _wrong_ to assign 0 probability to either of these.  and that's
 precisely what use of the razor does in the case of gods - gods are
 one class of hypothesis (there are many others) belonging to a set of
 hypotheses _one_of_which_ is necessary to explain something which otherwise 
 would _not_ be satisfactorily explained.  it can be thrown out or
 retained on grounds of non-rational preference, not of science or statistics.   
 alternatively, one could chuck out or retain the lot, on the grounds
 that the answer can't be known, or that the notional probability estimates
 are effectively useless, being equal (agnosticism/weak atheism).

 #

 some people do, simon, and they think they are doing excellent science.
 my sole point was that they aren't.

 i was merely trying to illustrate the incorrectness of doing so.

 #
 #on the contrary, those for which it does not hold are *exactly* those which

 #thread.
 
 then you seem to be guilty of the contradiction you accuse me of.  if
 the razor holds for gods, then it holds for all like hypotheses.  which
 means that you're assigning p(x | h[i]) =0 for all i, though we've already
 established that it's not correct to do so when sum(p(x|h[i]))=1 over
 all i.

 #
 #luckily i make no such claim, and have specifically said as much on numerous
 #occasions. you wouldn't be constructing a strawman here, would you frank?
 #although that doesn't, of course, rule out my being barking mad in any case
 #(i could be barking mad in my spare time, with apologies to cleese et al).
 #
 #but i think you miss the point once again. when i say that something is
 #"evidence against" an hypothesis, that doesn't imply that observation of
 #the said something necessarily *falsifies* the hypothesis, reducing the
 #estimate of p(h | data) to zero. if it *reduces* this quantity, it's still
 #evidence against h.
 
 no, i got that.  i'm talking about the case when a=0.  you're clearly
 correct when a!=0.   and i'm not constructing a strawman (though it's
 certainly possible that i've misunderstood what you're saying).  however,
 by any standards, a system that says when a=0, gods are highly unlikely,
 and when a!=0 gods can be dismissed using the razor, is a system purporting
 to be an inductive proof that gods either don't exist, or are unnecessary
 to explain any or all phenomena.  in my experience, systems such as this
 (including those which purport to prove that gods exist) always contain
 a fallacy upon close examination.  if that's not what you're saying, then
 please put me straight.
