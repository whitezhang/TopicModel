 why are only those people in favor of the system to blame.  if society
 accepts such a system, then each member of society is to blame when
 an innocent person gets executed.  those that are not in favor should
 work to convince others.
 
 and, most members of our society have accepted the blame--they've considered
 the risk to be acceptable.  similarly, every person who drives must accept
 the blame for fatal traffic accidents.  this is something that is surely
 going to happen when so many people are driving.  it is all a question of
 what risk is acceptable.  it is much more likely that an innocent person
 will be killed driving than it is that one will be executed.
