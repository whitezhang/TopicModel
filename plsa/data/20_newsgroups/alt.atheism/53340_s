 yes.

 to be fair, you should really qualify this as semitic-western religions, but
 you basically go ahead and do this later on anyway.

 again, this should really be evaluated at a personal level.  for example, there
 was only one jesus (presumably), and he probably didn't say all that many
 things, and yet (seemingly) billions and billions of christian sects have
 arisen.  perhaps there is one that is totally dedicated to rationalism and
 believes in christ as in pantheism.  it would seem to go against the bible, but
 it is amazing what people come up with under the guise of "personal
 interpretation".

 this is a good point.  we have here the quintessential christian: he sets up a
 system of values/beliefs for himself, which work very well, and every
 event/experience is understandable and deablable within the framework of this
 system.  however, we also have an individual who has the inability (at least
 not without some difficulty) to change, which is important, because the problem
 with such a system is the same as with any system: one cannot be open minded to
 the point of "testing hypotheses" against the basic premise of the system
 without destroying whatever faith is invested therein, unless of course, all
 the tests fail.  in other words, the *fairer* way would be to test and evaluate
 moralities without the bias/responsibility of losing/retaining a system.

 interesting, but again, when it seems to basically boil down to individual
 nuances (although not always, i will admit, and probably it is the
 mass-oriented divisions which are the most appalling), it becomes irrelevant,
 unfortunately.

 in which case the people become the bullets, and the religion, as the gun,
 merely offers them a way to more adequately do some harm with themselves, if i
 may be so bold as to extend your similie?

 also understandable... ;)
