 most of scotty's followup *was* irrelevant to the original question,
 but this is not unusual, as threads often quickly evolve away from
 the original topic.  what i could not understand is why jim spent so
 much time responding to what he regarded as irrelevancies.

 well, i guess hypothetical adam was "the majority of mankind"
 seeing how he was the only man at the time.

 i understand what you mean by "collective," but i think it is an
 insane perversion of justice.  what sort of judge would punish the
 descendants for a crime committed by their ancestor?

 well, i must admit that you probably read a.a. more often than i read
 the bible these days.  but you missed a couple of good followups to
 your post.  i'm sending you a personal copy of my followup which i
 hope you will respond to publically in a.a.
