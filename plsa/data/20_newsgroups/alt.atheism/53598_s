 a world creator god does, the moment it creates the world. and to sayi
 that you can't recall *anyone* is even below your usual standard of
 a"arguing".
  
 my argument is based on quite usual theistic assumptions, namely god
 is perfect, god is all-knowing god sets the rules. the rules don't
 work for whatever reason. because of its omniscience, the god has
 known it. in advance.

 it is not a question of grammar, it is a question of modelling. has been
 discussed in the wonderful time when you were not posting to this group.
 when a is contradictorily defined a does not point to an instance in
 reality. unless there is more information in the definition of a that
 allows me to find it somehow. however, when the contradictory attribute
 is said to be essential, ie has not got that attribute => not the a i
 am looking for, i can conclude that a does not exist.

 that's quite like: i predict coins falling
    predicted            happened
 1.   heads                 tails
 2.   tails                 tails
 3.   heads                 tails
 4.   heads                 tails
  
 i take 2. and dismiss the rest because of the unnecessary complexity
 the other evidence causes.
  
  
 for an easy to understand explanation of why humans believe in gods
 read "manwatching" by desmond morris.
