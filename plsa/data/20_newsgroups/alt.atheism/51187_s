 no, bobby.  stalin killed millions in the name of socialism.  atheism was a
 characteristic of the lenin-stalin version of socialism, nothing more.
 another characteristic of lenin-stalin socialism was the centralization of
 food distribution.  would you therefore say that stalin and lenin killed
 millions in the name of rationing bread?  of course not.
 
 
 >more horrible deaths resulted from atheism than anything else.
 
 in earlier posts you stated that true (muslim) believers were incapable of
 evil.  i suppose if you believe that, you could reason that no one has ever
 been killed in the name of religion.  what a perfect world you live in,
 bobby.

 bobby is referring to a rather obscure law in _the good atheist's 
 handbook_:
 
 law xxvi.a.3: give that which you do not believe in a face.  
 
 you must excuse us, bobby.  when we argue against theism, we usually argue
 against the christian idea of god.  in the realm of christianity, man was
 created in god's image.
