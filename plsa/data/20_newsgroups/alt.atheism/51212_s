 i am not aware of any "turkish caliphate" viewpoint on this. can you
 reference?
 
 however, i found a quote due to imam ali, whom the shias follow:
 
 "men, never obey your women in any way whatsoever. never let them give their
 advice on any matter whatsoever, even those of everyday life. indeed, allow
 them freely to give advice on anything and they will fritter away one's
 wealth and disobey the wishes of the owner of this wealth.
   we see them without religion, when, alone, they are left to their own
 devices; they are lacking in both pity and virtue when their carnal
 desires are at stake. it is easy to enjoy them, but they cause great
 anxiety. the most virtious among them are libertines. but the most
 corrupt are whores. only those of them whom age has deprived of any
 charm are untainted by vice. they have three qualities particular to
 miscreants; they complain of being oppressed, whereas it is they
 who oppress; they make oaths, whereas they are lying; they pretend
 to refuse men's solicitations, whereas they desire them most ardently.
 let us beg the help of god to emerge victorious from their evil deeds.
 and preserve us in any case from their good ones."
 
 (quote from mas'ud al-qanawi, ref. a. bouhdiba, sexuality in islam, 
 p. 118).
 
 i wouldn't consider this quote as being exemplary of the islamic (tm)
 viewpoint though.  for all we know, the prophet's cousin and
 the fourth khalif hazret-i ali may have said this after a frustrating 
 night with a woman.
