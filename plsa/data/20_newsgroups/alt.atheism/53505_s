 as i understand, that number is deceptive.  the reason is that the money
 cost was in non-oil sales for the most part.  iraq still is not allowed
 to sell oil, or do many of the things under the initial sanctions, but
 is still surviving.

 of the ~93% (i have heard figures closer to 80%, but i won't quibble your
 figures), most was dropped in carpet bombing of regions only occupied by
 enemy troops.  a b-52 drops a lot of bombs in one sortie, and we used them
 around the clock.  not to mention other smaller aircraft using dumb
 munitions.  
 
 2.  the patriot uses a proximity fuse.  the adjusted figures for number
 of patriot kills of ss-1 derivitives is ~60-70%.  that figure came
 not from some fluke in the pentagon, but a someone working with such
 stuff in another part of dod.
 
 3.  the statement precision bombing was the norm, is true around areas
 where civilians were close to the target.  we dropped by tonnage very
 little bombs in populated regions, explaining the figures.  
 
 >and of the 7% that was the "smart" stuff, 35% hit. again - try to follow me

 this figure, is far below all the other figures i have seen.  if it
 is indeed accurate, then how do you explain the discrepancy between
 that figure, and other figures from international organizations?
 most figures i have seen place the hit ratio close to 70%, which is 
 still far higher than your 35%.  or does your figure say a bomb
 missed if the plane took off with it, and the bomb never hit the target,
 regardless of whether or not the bomb was dropped?  such methods
 are used all the time to lie with statistics.

 i have _never_ seen any source that was claiming such a figure.  please
 post the source so its reliability can be judged.
