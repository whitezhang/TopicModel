 i read an article about a poll done of students at the ivy league
 schools in which it was reported that a third of the students
 indentified themselves as atheists.  this is a lot higher than among the
 general population.  i wonder what the reasons for this discrepancy are?
 is it because they are more intelligent?  younger?  is this the wave of
 the future?
