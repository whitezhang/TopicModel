 #	so, if you were housing a jew in your home in holand, 1942; and

 #	of course, if you tell the truth, then the jew will be executed.

 good question, my point was that a world with truth is better than a world
 with falsehood.  a world in which it were possible to say "yes, i am
 holding a jew" (the truth) and you, me, the jew, and the ss guy all sit
 down to crack open a bottle of whiskey is better than the grim alternatives 
 you present. obviously, this is not possible, and the best alternative seems
 to be to lie.  that's because other values are involved, such as life.
 now that is just my opinion - don't confuse the claim 'objective morality
 exists' with the claim 'i have a lock on morals'.
 
 n.b., sir, i could have responded with 'according to you, truth does
 not exist, therefore it is impossible to tell it.  what is true for
 you may not be true for me'.
