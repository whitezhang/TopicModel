 i heard about the arms sale to saudi arabia.  now, how is it such a grave
 mistake to sell saudi arabia weapons?  or are you claiming that we shouldn't
 sell any weapons to other countries?  straightforward answer please.

 who benefits from arms sales?  hint, it isn't normally the gov't.  it is
 the contractor that builds that piece of equipment.  believe it or not,
 the us and uk don't export the huge quantities of arms that you have
 just accused them of doing.  arms exports are rare enough, that it
 requires an act of congress for non-small arms to most countries, if
 not all.  do you believe in telling everyone who can do what, and who
 can sell their goods to whom?
