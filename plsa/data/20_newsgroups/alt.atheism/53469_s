 firstly, an apology.  you hadn't deleted your claim, and i was mistaken in
 saying you had. sorry for any offence caused.
 
 secondly,  how can i refute your definition?  i can only point up its
 logical implications, and say that they seem to contradict the usage
 of the word "objective" in other areas.  indeed, by your definition, an
 objective x is an oxymoron, for all x.  i have no quibble with that
 belief, other than that it is useless, and that "objective" is a perfectly
 good word.

 #
 #      how many ages can the universe have, and still be internally self-
 #consistent? i'd be amazed if it was more than one. how many different
 #moral systems can different members of society have - indeed, single
 #individuals, in some cases - and humanity still stick together?
 
 begging the question.  people can have many opinions about the age
 of the universe and humanity can still stick together.   you are
 saying that the universe has a _real_ age, independent of my beliefs about
 it.  why?
 
 #      the age of the universe, like most scientific facts, can be
 #emirically verified through means that'll give the same result no matter
 #who performs the testing (albeit there are error bars that may be on the
 #largish side...). 
 
 this assumes that the universe has a real age, or any kind of reality
 which doesn't depend on what we think.   why should an extreme biblical
 creationist give a rat's ass about the means of which you speak?
 
 #i've heard of no way to verify morality in a
 #consistent way, much less compute the errors of the measurement; care to
 #enlighten me?
 
 the same is true of pain, but painkillers exist, and can be predicted
 to work with some accuracy better than a random guess.  i wrote
 elsewhere that morality should be hypotheses about observed value.
 if a moral system makes a prediction "it will be better if...",
 that can be tested, and is falsifiable in the same way as a prediction
 "this drug will relieve pain..."
 
 #      people's *ideas* about the age of object x are *not* objective;
 #you can have any idea you like, and i can't stop you. universae and
 #their ages is another ballgame; they are what they are, and if you

 sure.  assume an objective reality, and you get statements like this.
 
 #i claim that morality is an opinion of ours, and as such
 #subjective and individual. if i'm wrong, then some more-or-less
 #objectively "real" thing exists, which you label "objective morality";

 can you back up your positive claim above?  no.  that's because it's an
 assumption.  i make the same assumption about values, on the basis
 that there is no logical difference between the two, and the empirical
 basis of the two is precisely the same.

 #
 #      take a look on the desk - i.e., perform a test. if(football) then

 #
 #      now take a look at morality. see anything? if so, please inform me

 no. just look.  are you claiming never to know what good means?

 i think it's great, and should be applied to values.  i may be completely
 wrong, but that's what i conclude as a result of quite an amount of
 thought.
