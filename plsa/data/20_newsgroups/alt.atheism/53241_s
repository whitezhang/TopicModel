 if the quality x does not exist, nothing has quality x.  which part did
 you not understand?
 
 #frank, you're desperately confusing science with the reasons we, as

 peter, you may assert that i am confused about this all you want, but
 wishing it does not make it so.   a simple theory is not simple until
 someone judges it to be.  a theory merely makes predictions.  predictions
 are not accurate until someone judges them to be.  you are choosing
 theories at subjective whim, in other words?  at what point do things
 get objective, peter?
