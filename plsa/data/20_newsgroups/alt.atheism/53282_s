 hi!
 
 i don't know much about mormons, and i want to know about serious independent
 studies about the book of mormon.
 
 i don't buy the 'official' story about the gold original taken to heaven,
 but haven't read the book of mormon by myself (i have to much work learning
 biblical hebrew), i will appreciate any comment about the results of study
 in style, vocabulary, place-names, internal consistency, and so on.
 
 for example: there is evidence for one-writer or multiple writers?
 there are some mention about events, places, or historical persons later
 discovered by archeologist?
 
 yours in collen
