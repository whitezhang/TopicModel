       so long as you keep that "almost" in there, freedom will be a
 mostly valuable thing, to most people. that is, i think you're really
 saying, "a real big lot of people agree freedom is subjectively valuable
 to them". that's good, and a quite nice starting point for a moral
 system, but it's not universal, and thus not "objective".
