 if you force me to do something, am i morally responsible for it?

 well, make up your mind.    is it to be "instinctive not to murder"
 or not?

 it's not even correct.    animals of the same species do kill
 one another.

 sigh.   i wonder how many times we have been round this loop.
 
 i think that instinctive bahaviour has no moral significance.
 i am quite prepared to believe that higher animals, such as
 primates, have the beginnings of a moral sense, since they seem
 to exhibit self-awareness.

 has a moral significance and some does not?   is this your

 are you blind?   what do you think that this sentence means?
 
 	"there must be the possibility that the organism - it's not 
 	just people we are talking about - can consider alternatives."
 
 what would that imply?

 i find the fact that they do to be significant.
