 hi adda,
 
 most bible scholars agree that there was one copy of each book at a certain
 time -- the time when the author wrote it.  unfortunately, like all works
 from this time period and earlier, all that exists today are copies.

 there are parts of books, scraps really, that date from around the
 mid second century (a.d. 130+).  there are some complete books, letters,
 etc. from the middle third century.  the first complete collection of
 the new testament dates from the early 4th century (a.d. 325).  throughout
 this period are writings of various early church fathers/leaders who
 quoted various scriptures in their writings.

 if you mean that someone discovered thousands of "bibles" which were all
 perfect copies dating from the last part of the 1st century...no!
 
 if you mean that there are thousands of early manuscripts (within the
 dates given above, but not letter perfect) and that the most probable
 text can be reconstructed from these documents and that the earliest
 original autographs (now lost) probably were written starting sometime
 shortly after a.d. 50, then yes.
 
 > 3.  from who/where did the bible originate?
 
 from the original authors.  we call them matthew, mark, luke, john, peter,
 paul, james, and one other not identified.

 as long as you make it.
