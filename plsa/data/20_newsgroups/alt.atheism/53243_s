 you should have tried one of the soc.culture groups in the middle east
 or south asia area (they are a little more open than the islam channel).  
 i think someone defined atheists as polytheists cuz they say we think the 
 world created itself (or something like that) so each particle is a god 
 which created the other gods.  the soc.culture.african is also nice for 
 some contrasting viewpoints on the benevolence of religion.  especially 
 when sudan is mentioned.
