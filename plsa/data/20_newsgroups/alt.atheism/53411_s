 not true. only an observer at rest at infinite distance from the black hole
 will see the particle take infinite time to reach the horizon. in the
 particle's own reference frame, it takes a very finite time to reach the
 horizon and the singularity. the math does indeed predict this. take a look
 at mitchner, thorne, and wheeler's _gravitation_.

 don't forget to sing:
             they say there's a heaven for those who will wait
                 some say it's better, but i say it ain't
         i'd rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints
                      the sinners are much more fun
                          only the good die young!
