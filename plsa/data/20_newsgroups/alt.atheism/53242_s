 theories judged to be simple, by people.  predictions judged to
 be accurate, by people.   these are value judgements, and science doesn't 
 work without them.

 accurate in whose opinion?  yours?  is the fact that it seems to be an 
 accurate description which applies to everyone of *no* relevance?

 confidently asserted falsehood.  on the one hand, people can demonstrate 
 that they value freedom as consistently as they can report the rising of 
 the sun.  people will disagree if you say freeedom is worthless no less 
 often than they will disagree if you say evolution (or for that matter, qm or
 relativity) is an accurate description of observed phenomena.  on the
 other hand, even in the face of a certain amount of disagreement, it remains
 reasonable to believe in the value of freedom and that qm etc. is an accurate 
 description of observed phenomena.
