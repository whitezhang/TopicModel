 one book i have which presents a fairly unbiased account of many religions
 is called _man's religions_ by john b. noss.  it was a textbook in a class
 i had on comparative religion or some such thing.  it has some decent
 bibliographies on each chapter as a jumping off point for further reading.
 
 it doesn't "compare" religions directly but describes each one individually
 and notes a few similarities.  but nothing i have read in it could be even
 remotely described as preachy or christian based.  in fact, christianity
 mercifully consumes only 90 or so of its nearly 600 pages.  the book is
 divided according to major regions of the world where the biggies began 
 (india, east asia, near east).  there is nothing about new world religions
 from the aztecs, mayas, incas, etc.  just the stuff people kill each
 other over nowadays.  and a few of the older religions snuffed out along
 the way.  
 
 if you like the old stuff, then a couple of books called "the ancient near
 east" by james b. pritchard are pretty cool.  got the epic of gilgamesh,
 code of hammurabi, all the stuff from way back when men were gods and gods
 were men.  essential reading for anyone who wishes to make up their own
 religion and make it sound real good.
