 what are you taking issue with here, your remarks are merely
 parenthetical to mine and add nothing useful.

 consider the context, i'm talking about an evolutionary function. one
 of the most basic requirements of evolution is that members of a
 species procreate, those who don't have no purpose in that context.

 by your argument, homosexuality is genetically determined. as to your
 second point, you prove again that you have no idea what context
 means. i am talking about evolution, the preservation of the species,
 the fundamental premise of the whole process.

 yet another non-sequitur. sex is an evolutionary function that exists
 for procreation, that it is also recreation is incidental. that
 homosexuals don't procreate means that sex is -only- recreation and
 nothing more; they serve no -evolutionary- purpose.

 here's pretty obvious dodge, do you really think you've said anything
 or do you just feel obligated to respond to every statement? i am not
 telling anyone anything, i am demonstrating that there are arguments
 against the practice of homosexuality (providing it's a merely an
 alternate lifestlye) that are not homophobic, that one can reasonably
 call it perverse in a context even a atheist can understand. i realize
 of course that this comes dangerously close to establishing  a value,
 and that atheists are compelled to object on that basis, but if you
 are to be consistent, you have no case in this regard.

 i'm sure your comment pertains to something, but you've disguised it
 so well i can't see what. where did i mention ideals, out-dated or
 otherwise? your arguments are very reactionary; do you have anything
 at all to contribute?

 what has this got to do with anything? would you pick a single point
 that you find offensive and explain your objections, i would really
 like to believe that you can discuss this issue intelligibly.
