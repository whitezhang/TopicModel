 there are several problems here. first, you are discussing only
 experimental procedures. observational procedures are also useful.  the
 main criterion is attempting to verify an idea by using it to make
 prediction about as-yet unmade observations. the observations could be
 the result of an experiment, or they could be obsevations of activity
 occuring spontaneossly in nature, or they could even be observations of
 the lasting results of events long past. all that matters is that the
 observations be *new*.  this is what prediction is about in science -
 it is
 *not* about predicting the future except in this very restricted
 sense.
 
 secondly, repeatability can also take many forms.  it is really just
 the
 requirement that independent observers be able to verify the results.
 the
 observation of a fossil is 'repeatable', since any qualified observer
 may
 look at it (this is why the specimens are reqtined in a museum).  also,
 there is the implicit prediction that future fossil finds will
 correspond
 to the current one.  new fossils are found often enough that this is
 tested regularly.  many times a new fossil actually falsifies some
 conclusion made on the basis of previous fossils.
 
 unfortunately for you, the models that were falsified have alway been
 peripheral to the model of evolution we now have.  (for instance, the
 front legs of tyrannosaurus rex turned out to have tremendous muscles,
 rather than being weakly endowed as previously believed).
 
 so, in fact, histoircal science findings *are* repeatable in the
 necessary sense.  just becuase you cannot go out and repeat the
 original
 event does *not* make it impossible to make valid observations.
 
 [this is not to say that biologists would not go coo-coo if extra-
 terrestrial life were discovered - that could make the determination
 of the process of abiogenesis relatively easy].
