 anton lavey's interpretation of satanism has always puzzled me.  i
 read his "satanic bible" a few years ago for a social studies project,
 as well as a book by arthur lyons called "the cult of devil worship
 in america."  the latter included a very interesting interview with
 the black pope in which he did indeed say that satan was merely an
 instrument for one to realize the self.  
 
 when i refer to satanism, i am referring to the mishmash of rural satanic
 ritualism and witchcraft which existed before the church of satan.  i
 don't consider lavey's church to be at all "orthodox," nor do i consider
 its followers "satanists."  lavey combined the philosophies of nietzsche,
 crowley, and reich, slapped in some religious doctrine, added a little
 touch of p.t. barnum, and christened his creation the church of satan.
 no doubt the title was a calculated attempt to attract attention...i
 suppose he could have just as easily called it the church of free sex.
 
 at any rate, it worked (for a while).  in its heyday, the church had a
 huge following, including such hollywood celebrities as sammy davis, jr.
 and jayne mansfield.  (i have a picture of lavey with sammy, by the 
 way.)  
 
 i find the idea of a satanist not believing in satan about as credible as
 a christian not believing in christ.  but if you include the church of
 satan, then i suppose i need to alter my definition.  webster's dictionary
 and the american heritage dictionary will have to do the same.
