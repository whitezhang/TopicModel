 that's like saying that, since mathematics includes no instructions on
 how to act, it is evil.  atheism is not a moral system, so why should
 it speak of instructions on how to act?  *atheism is simply lack of
 belief in god*.
 
   plenty of theists

 i think the argument that a particular theist system causes genocide
 can be made more convincingly than an argument that atheism causes genocide.
 this is because theist systems contain instructions on how to act,
 and one or more of these can be shown to cause genocide.  however, since
 the atheist set of instructions is the null set, how can you show that
 atheism causes genocide?
