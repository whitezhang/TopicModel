 joel,
 
 the statements i made were illustrative of the inescapably
 anthrpomorphic quality of any desciption of an evolutionary process.
 there is no way evolution can be described or explained in terms other
 than teleological, that is my whole point. even those who have reason
 to believe they understand evolution (biologists for instance) tend to
 personify nature and i can't help but wonder if it's because of the
 limits of the language or the nature of nature.
