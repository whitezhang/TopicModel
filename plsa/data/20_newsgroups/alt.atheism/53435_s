 scott,
 
 i don't have to make outrageous claims about religion's affecting and
 effecting history, for the purpsoe of a.a, all i have to do point out
 that many claims made here are wrong and do nothing to validate
 atheism. at no time have i made any statement that religion was the
 sole cause of anything, what i have done is point out that those who
 do make that kind of claim are mistaken, usually deliberately. 
 
 to credit religion with the awesome power to dominate history is to
 misunderstand human nature, the function of religion and of course,
 history. i believe that those who distort history in this way know
 exaclty what they're doing, and do it only for affect.
