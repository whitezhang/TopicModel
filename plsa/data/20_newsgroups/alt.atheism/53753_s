 nope, germany has extremely restrictive citizenship laws.  the 
 ethnic germans who have lived in russia for over 100 years 
 automatically become citizens if they move to germany, but the
 turks who are now in their third generation in germany can't.
 it's not a very good example to show citizenship without descent.
