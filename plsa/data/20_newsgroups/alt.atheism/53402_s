 the clipper initiative is an announcement by clinton that all the 
 "secure" voice phones will use the same crypto chip, as a de-facto
 government standard.  problem is, the government is admitting that
 they hold the keys to break the code easily, and the justice department
 will be using the keys to listen in on "illegal activities."  many
 people are really scared about such an initiative because it is
 a major step towards outlawing real crypto protection on things
 like email if you read the press release.  the project was developed
 by nsa and given to nist.  it uses two keys s1 and s2 that the
 government claims are needed to break the code.  they claim that
 these keys will be handed to two different companies, and when they
 get a warrant to do a wiretap (the chip is nicknamed the wiretap chip),
 they have to get the keys from both companies.  people have poked holes
 through and through the press release official version and shown how
 it is nowhere near as nice as it sounds, and i have given the simplified
 version.  people over on sci.crypt are really scared about this
 proposal it seems.
