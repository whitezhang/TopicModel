     what do you accept as a fact --  the roundness of the earth (after 
 all, the ancient greeks thought it was a sphere, and then newton said 
 it was a spheroid, and now people say it's a geoid [?])?  yourself 
 (isn't your personal identity just a theoretical construct to make 
 sense of memories, feelings, perceptions)?  i'm trying to think of 
 anything that would be a fact for you.  give some examples, and let's
 see how factual they are by your criteria (btw, what are your
 criteria?).
 
     "gravity is _not_ a fact": is that a fact?  how about newton's 
 and einstein's thoughts about gravity -- is it a fact that they had 
 those thoughts?  i don't see how any of the things that you are 
 asserting are any more factual than things like gravity, atoms or 
 evolution.
 
     in short, before i am willing to consider your concept of what
 a fact is, i'm going to have to have, as a minimum, some examples of
 what you think are facts.
