 "counterfeit atheists". hmmmm. so, we're just cheap knock-offs of the
 true atheists. 
 
 religion demonstrates itself to be absurd. constantly. personally, if 
 someone asks, i'm happy to point out how this is so.

 man, what *is* your pill wrt atheists? if you're going to make such
 contentious statements, back them up! at least, read news: time-and-time
 again, we've hashed out the beliefs various religous doctrines hold. 
 try debating reasonably with someone who makes a statement like, 
 "...more accurately oxymoric is the a term like, reasonable atheist."
 then take a look at the responses we've given tammy. seem pretty
 "reasonable", nay, even "polite" to me.

 i saw your reference to "according to" in the original article.
 then you do such an excellent job of spewing dogma that, well, the
 implication was pretty clear (if wrong, in this case).

 if you had written your post with the same as care as the faq has been,
 we wouldn't be having this discussion.

 jeez, do i have to point this out to you? this discussion is not all
 instances of human reason. therefore, your implication is false.

 how lame can you get. who said anything about the 'truth' of things?
 read the faq very carefully, please. then report your findings about
 where it says the purpose of a.a is to find the 'truth' of things.
 
 and stop impressing your own misguided image of atheists upon us. it's
 really pissing me off.
