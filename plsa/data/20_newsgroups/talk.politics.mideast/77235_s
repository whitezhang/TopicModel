 the ny times is in error. this is not simply my opinion; even the arab sources
 that i use do not make this claim. this, of course, is assuming that the ny
 times was refering to the islands that i named above. of those islands, only
 abu musa has been in dispute and iranian occupation of that island predates
 the existence of the uae.
