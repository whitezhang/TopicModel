 "we armenians did not spare the tartars. if persisted in, the slaughtering 
  of prisoners, the looting, and the rape and massacre of the helpless become 
  commonplace actions expected and accepted as a matter of course.
 
  i have been on the scenes of massacres where the dead lay on the ground,
  in numbers, like the fallen leaves in a forest. they had been as helpless
  and as defenseless as sheep. they had not died as soldiers die in the
  heat of battle, fired with ardor and courage, with weapons in their hands,
  and exchanging blow for blow. they had died as the helpless must, with
  their hearts and brains bursting with horror worse than death itself."
