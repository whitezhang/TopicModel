 final solution for the gaza ghetto ?
 ------------------------------------
 
 while israeli jews fete the uprising of the warsaw ghetto, they
 repress by violent means the uprising of the gaza ghetto and
 attempt to starve the gazans.
 
 the gaza strip, this tiny area of land with the highest population
 density in the world, has been cut off from the world for weeks.
 the israeli occupier has decided to punish the whole population of
 gaza, some 700.000 people, by denying them the right to leave the
 strip and seek work in israel.
 
 while polish non-jews risked their lives to save jews from the
 ghetto, no israeli jew is known to have risked his life to help
 the gazan resistance. the only help given to gazans by israeli
 jews, only dozens of people, is humanitarian assistance.
 
 the right of the gazan population to resist occupation is
 recognized in international law and by any person with a sense of
 justice. a population denied basic human rights is entitled to
 rise up against its tormentors.
 
 as is known, the israeli regime is considering gazans unworthy of
 israeli citizenship and equal rights in israel, although they are
 considered worthy to do the dirty work in israeli hotels, shops
 and fields. many gazans are born in towns and villages located in
 israel. they may not live there, for these areas are reserved for
 the master race.
 
 the nazi regime accorded to the residents of the warsaw ghetto the
 right to self- administration.  they selected jews to pacify the
 occupied population and preventing any form of resistance. some
 jewish collaborators were killed. israel also wishes to rule over
 gaza through arab collaborators.
 
 as israel denies gazans the only two options which are compatible
 with basic human rights and international law, that of becoming
 israeli citizens with full rights or respecting their right for
 self-determination, it must be concluded that the israeli jewish
 society does not consider gazans full human beings. this attitude
 is consistent with the attitude of the nazis towards jews. the
 current policies by the israeli government of cutting off gaza are
 consistent with the wish publicly expressed by prime mininister
 yitzhak rabin that 'gaza sink into the sea'. one is led to ask
 oneself whether israeli leaders entertain still more sinister
 goals towards the gazans ? whether they have some final solution
 up their sleeve ?
 
 i urge all those who have slight human compassion to do whatever
 they can to help the gazans regain their full human, civil and
 political rights, to which they are entitled as human beings.
