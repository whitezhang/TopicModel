 dear mr. beyer:
 
 it is never wise to confuse "freedom of speech" with "freedom"
 of racism and violent deragatory."
 
 it is unfortunate that many fail to understand this crucial 
 distinction.
 
 indeed, i find the latter in absolute and complete contradiction
 to the former. racial invective tends to create an atmosphere of
 intimidation where certain individuals (who belong to the group
 under target group) do not feel the ease and liberty to exercise 
 *their* fundamental "freedom of speech."
 
 this brand of vilification is not sanctioned under "freedom of
 speech.
