 i don't think that, you are just making noise.

 that's true.  i try to learn from people who know more than me,
 not from useless farts.

 of course, i have said that more times in this group than
 anyone else, i'd think.

 quite true, that's why i am so careful in selecting quotes.

 how would you know what i consider?  read my mind?

 i looked very closely at a large number of sources.  you have no
 idea what you are talking about.

 that's true about the accounts of both irgun and arab propagandists.
 like begin, for example.

 no, i never got that feeling.  i got rather opposite feelings
 about people like you, though.

 honesty?  perhaps you would explain the testimony from members
 of the irgun, to be found in their own handwriting in the
 irgun archives in tel aviv, that the wounded arabs were killed,
 that a group of 80 prisoners was massacred, that lehi proposed
 exterminating everybody at the pre-raid meeting.  exactly what
 reasons can you propose that this testimony should be rejected
 in favour of begin's?

 this is very funny.  you carried on about unsupported evidence,
 propagandists, axes to grind, and you end up telling us to stick
 to the account of the leader of the alleged killers.  you are
 obviously a hopeless case, as everyone can plainly see.
