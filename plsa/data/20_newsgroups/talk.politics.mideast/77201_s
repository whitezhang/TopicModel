 which was my point. by converting to another religion i do not loose
 my cultural identity, i just loose my religious identification.
 i consider that defining the belonging to a nation that claims the 
 right to have a state based on religious belief is a form of racism.

 to be a part or not of the jeish nation is defined by my culture and not
 by my religion. actually, if i am an atheist, which is in fact like 
 converting into a non-jewish in terms of religion, i am still considered as
 part of the jewish nation.
 i can be proud of my jewish culture while not giving any importance to the
 jewish religion. or, even more, i can be proud of my jewish culture while
 still be convinced that the real god is another one.
 i do not know anyone who lost his memebership to the american nation 
 because he changed of god.

 i still believe that we should never confusse the actions of states with
 the individuals who happen to live there.
 in the same way that i do not think it is right to blame all israelis for the
 human rights violations of israel, i do not think that we should assume
 that all arabs are guilty of the actions of the arab states.
 some people fled their homes because they were scared. now they are in
 there, still suffering for what they are not responsible.
 and, remember that we also were told the same at some point. we ended in
 the diaspora. and, of course, i am not for doing to others what i did not
 want done to me.
