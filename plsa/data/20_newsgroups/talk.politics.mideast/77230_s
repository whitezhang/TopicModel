    it is your responsibility for posting quotes in context.  your
    phony 'research center' is the source of the most unscholarly,
    out-of-context, agenda-ridden, and sophmoric propaganda that i
    have ever seen.  don't believe me, folks?  let's take a little
    stroll through a few of elias davidsson's contributions to our 
    understanding of the middle east.
  
 ed> quotations from zionist leaders
 
 ed> 1. "there was no such thing as palestinians"
 ed> (golda meir, prime minister of israel, london sunday 
 ed> times, 15 june 1969)
 
     and what do suggest that she meant by this?  do you think she
     meant that the palestinians don't exist?  or does it actually
     mean that the people who self-identify as 'palestinians,' did
     not appear to be a distinct ethnic group in the eyes of golda
     meir?  
 
 
 ed> 2. "there is, however, a difficulty from which the zionist 
 ed> dares not avert his eyes, though he rarely likes to face it. 
 ed> palestine proper has already its inhabitants."
 ed> (israel zangwill, the voice of jerusalem, london 1920, 
 ed> p.88)
 
     when this was written, seventy three years ago, the people of
     the region were not all jews.  they are not all jews now.  no
     jew but the most rabid bigot has ever called for an israel to
     be only for jews.  that was true then.  it is true now.  
 
 
 ed> "[the palestinians are] beasts walking on two legs."
 ed> (menachem begin, prime minister of israel in a speech to 
 ed> the knesset,
 ed> quoted in amnon kapeliouk, 'begin and the "beasts", new 
 ed> statesman, 25 june 1982)
 
     since you inserted the words 'the palestinians are' we cannot
     know what begin was talking about.  
     
     for someone who wants to embellish his own importance with an 
     absurd pseudo-organizational name like the 'center for policy
     research,' you are not a very honest person. 
 
 
 ed> "both the process of expropriation [of the palestinians] 
 ed> and the removal of the poor must be carried out 
 ed> discreetly and circumspectly".
 ed> (dr. theodor herzl, the complete diaries, herzl press, 
 ed> 1960, i., p.88)
 
     herzl died eighty nine years ago.  are you suggesting that he
     has stated what is israel's policy today?  have you ever seen
     israel even entertain a policy to exclude non-jews, let alone  
     actually try to remove non-jews from israel?  if you actually 
     believe that this quote has anything to do with israel's non-
     jewish citizenry today, you are an idiot.  but if you realize
     that israel has no intention of removing non-jewish israelis,
     then you are nothing but a common liar.  this one time i will 
     give you the benefit of the doubt, and assume you are stupid. 
 
  
 ed> "we shall try to spirit the penniless population [the 
 ed> palestinians] across the border by procuring employment 
 ed> for it in the transit countries, while denying it any 
 ed> employment in our own country"
 ed> (theodor herzl, the complete diaries, herzl press, 1960, 
 ed> i, p.88)
 
     once again you quote a man gone for almost a century.  you do
     so within the context of modern day israel.  
     
     thomas jefferson owned slaves.  how does this fact define the
     united states today?
 
 
 ed> "[jews] must expel arabs and take their place" 
 ed> (david ben gurion, 1937, quoted in shabtai teveth, ben 
 ed> gurion and the palestine arabs, oxford university press, 
 ed> 1985, p. 89)
 
     did he say 'jews,' or did you add this?
  
     this was also a statement from ten years before israel became
     a state.  it has no bearing on israel.  
     
 
 ed> "we must do everything to ensure they [the 
 ed> palestinian refugees] never do return"
 ed> (david ben gurion, in his diary, 19 july 1948, quoted in 
 ed> michael bar zohar, ben gurion: the armed prophet, 
 ed> prentice-hall, 1967, p.157)
 
     you added the words 'the palestinian refugees.'  and by doing
     so, you are misleading people into believing that ben gurion,
     who was expressing his hope that people who fled their lands,
     at the encouragement of people such as king abdullah, and the  
     mufti of jerusalem, was gloating over people abandoning their
     homes.  what he was refering to were the arabs with whom jews
     were at war.  
 
 ed> "the country was mostly an empty desert, with only 
 ed> a few islands of arab settlement"
 ed> (shimon peres, minister of defense, quoted in david's 
 ed> sling: the arming of israel, weidenfeld and nicholson, 
 ed> 1970, p.249)
 
     at the time of the rebirth of israel this was certainly true,
     especially when compared to what israel has accomplished in a
     few short decades.
 
 
 ed> "all this story about the danger of extermination [of 
 ed> jews] has been blown up....to justify the annexation of 
 ed> new arab territories"
 ed> (mordechai bentov, israeli cabinet minister, al 
 ed> hamishmar, 14 april 1972)
 
     since israel has not annexed even one millimeter of territory 
     in more twenty six years, this quote is irrelevant. 
 
 
 ed> "neither jewish ethics nor jewish tradition can 
 ed> disqualify terrorism as a means of combat"
 ed> (yitzhak shamir, hehazit, summer 1943 [journal of the 
 ed> lehi, the stern gang], translated from the israeli daily 
 ed> al-hamishmar, 24 december 1987
 
     again, you are quoting a man who was fighting for what he had
     been promised from a time as ancient as biblical, to the time
     of the balfour declaration, just a few short years back.  and
     what was thought of and described as terrorism by jews didn't
     include slaughtering olympic athletes, brutally murdering the 
     innocent, attacking school buses, and murdering another human 
     being for the sole reason that he or she is an arab.
  
  
 ed> "the domination of jewish agriculture by arab 
 ed> workers is a cancer in our body"
 ed> (a. uzan, israeli minister of agriculture, ha'aretz, 13 
 ed> december 1974)
 
     there were serious concerns about a work force that consisted 
     of people from outside israel.  it is a wise to be concerned.
     a work force consisting of foreigners is not a good situation
     for a country.
 
 
 ed> "there can be only one national home in palestine, 
 ed> and that a jewish one, and no equality in the partnership 
 ed> between jews and arabs"

 ed> in doreen ingrams, comp., palestine papers 1917-1922, 
 ed> seeds of conflict, george braziller, 1973, p. 135)
 
     this also has no meaning for a country formed seventeen years
     after this statement was made.  obviously times change.  this
     is not what israel is about today.  i believe the peace talks
     make this quote irrelevant.
 
 
 ed> "there is not a single jewish village in this country 
 ed> that has not been built on the site of an arab village"
 ed> (moshe dayan, ha'aretz, 4 april 1969...)
 
     this is completely false.
 
 
 ed> "some people talk of expelling 700,000 to 800,000 
 ed> arabs in the event of a new war, and instruments have

 ed> (aharon yariv, former chief of israeli military 
 ed> intelligence, 1980, inquiry, 8 december 1980)
 
     expelled from where?  israel?  the occupied territories?  new
     jersey?  is there any way we can read this and get an idea as
     to what on earth he was talking about.  obviously not.
 
  
 ed> "we should there [in palestine] form a portion of the 
 ed> rampart of europe against asia, an outpost of civilization 
 ed> as opposed to barbarism."
 ed> (dr. theodor herzl, the jewish state, london, 1896, p. 
 ed> 29)
 
     interesting notion.  considering that this was written nearly
     a century ago, it is quite visionary.
 
 
 ed> "i deeply believe in launching preventive war 
 ed> against the arab states without further hesitation. by 
 ed> doing so we will achieve two targets: firstly, the

 ed> (menachem begin, in a speech to the knesset, 12 october 
 ed> 1955)
 
     this was said nearly forty years ago.  begin is dead.  and it
     should be obvious to anybody that if israel was expansionist,
     it would have annexed the occupied territories right after it
     captured them.  israel would not be negotiating to get rid of
     them.
 
 
 ed> "during the last 100 years our people have been in a

 ed> we are near the end of the road."
 ed> (moshe dayan, ma'ariv, 7 july 1968)
 
     he's dead, too.  and since israel has not annexed any land at 
     all since 1967, you are once again wasting bandwidth with all
     of these misleading quotes.  they are so out of sync with the
     reality of israel, that you do nothing but make yourself look
     like a fanatic desperate to sway people, by misleading them.

     interesting quote.  it's true that we should never lose sight
     of the plight of these people.  we should also recognize that
     this quote preceded the disgusting wave of arab terrorism and
     violence directed at innocent people, that began in 1972 with 
     the massacre of the israeli athletes in munich, and continues 
     to this day.
 
     if your ability to obscure was the equal of your desire to do
     so, truthseekers in this group would have a problem.  but you
     are an easily recognized fanatic, whose stream of misleading,
     partial, and out-of-context quotes are totally  unfettered by
     the burden of truth.
