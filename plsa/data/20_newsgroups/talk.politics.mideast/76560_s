 ah - palestine and the arab israeli conflict.  sounds interesting.

 this is misleading.  i supposed charles d. smith characterizes the bombing
 of the king david hotel as a civilian installation too.  any installation 
 attacked by etzel was linked to some sort of official function of the 
 mandatory government.

 what kind of civilians?  i assume charles d. smith means completely innocent
 people who were intentionally targeted, right?  please provide examples.

 nice strawman.  in _the revolt_ begin does state that the *myth* of a massacre
 at deir yassin may have had the effect of scaring some arabs into fleeing.
 however, nowhere does he claim that this was the result of any specific policy
 of the etzel.  thus, if it did happen, it was not so intended.  i think arab 
 calls for palestinians to leave and fear of a war started by arab hands had 
 a greater effecton arab migration than deir yassin.
 
 in fact these jewish terrorist groups managed

 really.  nice use of caps.  i like it.  very effective.  actually, according to 
 many sources, including american diplomatic officials, the greatest encouragment
 for arabs to leave their villages came from arab leaders.
