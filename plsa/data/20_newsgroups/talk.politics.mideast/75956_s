  well, if you put things into historical perspective, the turks
  moved into an area, which was inhabited by greeks.  this is how the history
  between the two nations started some centuries ago.  since then, it has been
  a continuous battle between the two nations.  from my perspective i can't see
  why i should say that greeks have been responsible for what has happened 
  between the two nations.  of course, it would not be reasonable to argue that
  the hostility should drag till we kick the turks out of this area.  this isn't
  going to happen, so the best would be to improve the relations between the two
  countries.  a golden oportunity exists with cyprus.  if things can't work
  there, there isn't any possible way that could work between our nations.

  i always avoid to discuss such things.  i consider it a waist of my time.
  besides, as i said, i do not want to open a new flame.

  i thought it was a smart move to receive more money from greek tourists.
  i bet that this week there should be about 200,000 tourists from greece
  in turkey.  each one will leave at least $1,000 so go and figure what this
  means to your economy.  if you had kept the visa requirement, how many
  greeks would bother to visit turkey?

  come on. do not extrapolate from your limited personal experience.  you err
  if you think you'd get a reasonable conclusion.
