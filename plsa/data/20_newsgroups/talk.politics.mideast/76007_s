 when the plo moved into lebanon and became, in parts of lebanon, an
 occupying power itself, these same practices were common against
 non-palestinean and palestinean alike.  they are simply standard
 operating procedures among palestineans and have been for a very long
 time.  in fact, the greatest bloodbath of palestineans will happen
 when they get self-rule.  can you possibly deny this? 
 
 when the plo is the occupier, who are you now going to blame?
