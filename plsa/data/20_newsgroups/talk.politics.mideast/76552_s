 that was uncalled for. i'm sure andi beyer or whatever his name is
 was a product of his environment before he came to school, and is
 enjoying the mantle of the university to make his viewpoint seem
 legitimate (well-reasoned). i'm at virginia, too, and i think 
 maligning uva is in poor taste, even if beyer did slip in here.
