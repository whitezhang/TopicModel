 and is there a reason or value for such a brainless shit for brains asshole
 to be haer.  you are a self hating bastard.  neither your name nor your
 ideas, which i've come across before and thought were too stupid and 
 uncivlized to respond to, prove your first-worldist claim and civility.

 there is nothing primitive about islam except in your mind.  i do read and
 live daily with disagreable facts, and i only ask them to prove themselves.
 the last time i checked, this was truly a 1st-worldist civilized approach to
 facts and figures.  i did not whine about  the jews, i merely stated a fact
 thet is strange to nobody.  as far as me being jerk, fuck you.  (sorry to
 other people that read this).
