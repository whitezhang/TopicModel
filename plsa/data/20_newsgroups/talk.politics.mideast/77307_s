     i too noticed that in all this screaming and shouting, not one 
 person brought up the question of atrocities being commited on non-muslims 
 by the sudanese government. could it be that they are africans and so who
 cares? i suggest that everyone cut the hypocrisy and bleating about bosnia 
 and go on to discuss something even more meaningless.
 
     the report below shows that the sudanese are acting in the finest
 traditions of islamic law as expounded by some die-hard people on the 
 net (who shall remain nameless).

 government troops 'steal women, children'
 
 
 washington - government troops in sudan are involved in massacres,
 kidnapping and the transporting of forced labor into libya, according
 to a state department document declassified wednesday.
 
     the report compiled by the u.s. embassy in khartoum said government
 forces, particularly arab militias organized as the popular defense
 forces, "routinely steal women and children" in southern sudan.
 
     "some women and girls are kept as wives, the others are shipped
 north where they perform forces labor on kordofan (central sudan) 
 farms or are exproted, notably to libya," it said.
