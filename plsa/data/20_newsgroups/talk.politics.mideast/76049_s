 it seems that president clinton can recognize jerusalem as israels capitol
 while still keeping his diplomatic rear door open by stating that the parties
 concerned should decide the city's final status. even as i endorse clintons vie
 w (of course), it is definitely a matter to be decided upon by israel (and
 other participating neighboring contries).
 i see no real conflict in stating both views, nor expect any better from
 politicians.
