 the us unlike israel has massive capital assets, to wit fort knox for 
 one. the accumulated assets of the british empire shiped over in bulk 
 to pay for our weapons bill in world war i. or maybe you thought that the
 us occupied the boer republic that is now south africa?

 not with bush at the helm. the gulf war meant that the middle east
 was no longer a fringe issue of us politics. the us people had to
 be convinced that the us could keep everything hunky dory in that
 region.
 
 you realise of course that all this is purely in the interests of allowing
 the us citizen to drive arround in a 6 litre car doing single digit
 miles to the gallon? were the us to act responsibly they cvould be
 self sufficient in oil.

 syrian occupation ended the civil war. israeli invasion worstened it.
 
 its a bit like the vietnamese invasion of cambodia, reprehensible but 
 it put an end to the far worse attrocity that preceeded it. now syria
 is in the us camp there might even be a possibility of some sort of
 democratisation.
 
 what do you expect from an ex french colony? they made a pigs ear of
 every single one. the british cocked up palestine and pakistan, most
 of the others managed to avoid a bloodbath. compared to algeria syria
 had it easy.

 clearly offensive in that the original intent was to disloge the plo from
 lebanon. in the process the civil war was dramatically worsened.

 not at all. israel is not in lebanon because to do that would have meant
 tens of thousands of dead. had the us not stopped the likud nutters from
 continuing they would have seriously have threatened israels survival.
 even in new york there was a massive feeling of revulsion for the israeli
 invasion. it was a complete disaster in pr terms.
