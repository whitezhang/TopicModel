 this clearly is a "fantastic" story, anas!  i am very curious as to who
 (or what) your sources are for this grossly exaggerated account (if not,
 blatant lie).  it surprises me that this "story" has not yet made it to
 the front pages of the major newspapers (which love to make the state of
 israel look as evil as humanly possible)!  such a story would be "eaten up"
 by some of the papers over here.  so please explain to me why i have never
 seen nor heard of it before!  - believe me, i'm not expecting a reply because
 we both know where the story came from... your dreams!!!!
