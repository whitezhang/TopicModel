 he is claiming that what the indonesians are up to in east timor is genocide.
 
 certainly what is going on is serious enough that it is way above the threshold
 where it should be brought to attention. pol pot did not kill nearly as many
 people as hitler but he is most certainly as evil.

 he fully accepts the differences in the intentions and situations. what he
 is saying is that the effect in both cases has been mass murder only we
 only get to hear about the one that supports the red scare merchants and the
 behaviour of our allies is conveniently ignored.
 
 a starker comparison is in el salvador where the allegations that the left
 were repeatedly making throughout the 1980s have been proven with the 
 discovery of mass graves. there was evidence enough at the time that duarte
 and his gang of thugs were mass murderers but regan and bush ignored it
 and gave them arms to repress the opposition. this must be contrasted with
 the events in nica<ragua where no evidence of sandinista attrocities such
 as mass murder of political opponents has come to light since they lost
 the democratic elections that they held. despite this the nicaraguan regime
 was held to justify the funding of a terrorist war fought mainly against
 civillians by the infamous contras.
