 but what is hasan b. multu's middle name?  i'm not sure, but i heard
 it was "bibo".  i also seem to recall that "argic" is azari for "bites
 the wax macedonian".
 
 we don't have a mail address, but how about finding a snail address?
 then instead of quashing shergold rumors, we could just redirect them
 - ahmed cosar is a seven year old greek boy with an incurable case of
 crossposting.  his wish is to get into the usenet book of world
 records for having the highest noise to signal ratio.
