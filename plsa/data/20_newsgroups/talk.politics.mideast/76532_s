 	and lebanon has a right to make this decision without syrian
 troops controlling the country.  until syria leaves, and free
 elections take place, its is rediculous to claim that the lebanese
 would even be involved in determining what happens to their country.

 	i expect you will agree that the same holds true for syria
 having no right to be in lebanon?

 	they lasted weeks against tanks in '48, and stopped those
 tanks from advancing.  they also lasted days in '73.  there is little
 evidence for the claim that they are military liabilities.
 
 	they evidence is there to show that when infiltrations take
 place over the jordan river, the existance of large, patrolled
 kibutzim forces terrorists into a very small area, where they are
 usually picked up in the morning.

 	nonsense.  israel has been trying to get its neighbors to the
 negotiating table for 40 years.  it was the gulf war that brought the
 arabs to the table, not the israelis.

 	nonsense.  according to arafat, israel must be destroyed.  he
 has never come clean and denied that this is his plan.  he always
 waffles on what he means.
