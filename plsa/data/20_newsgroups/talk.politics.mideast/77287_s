 i guess that it was not acceptable because germany *also* chose
 a path of aggression simultaneously that put the interests of
 other countries in peril. i wonder whether us or other countries
 would have risked themselves if only jews were persecuted and
 hitler had no imperialist ambitions. (i am no student of history
 and i am just asking questions.)
 
 if even for a moment you think that i am condoing ethnically
 motivated violence and killings, you are dead wrong. let me
 assure i am not. my only question is this: do powerful countries
 have a moral obligation to interefere in other countries if
 their own interests are not threatened. i cite an essay by
 charles krauthammer in the time (this week) that discusses
 this issue eloquently.
 
 for example, did us and other european countries abandon their
 moral compunctions when they chose not to send military troops
 to bombay when hindus, in a rare fit of impassioned rage, killed
 many muslims recently. i think not!
 
 under what conditions should us interfere in foregin countries,
 is an abstraction one must clarify before resorting to acrimonious
 accusations of religious bigotry and such.
