 don't worry, danny, every blatantly violent and abusive posting made by 
 hamzah is immediately forwarded to the operator of the system in which he 
 has an account.  i'd imagine they have quite a file started on this 
 fruitcake--and have already indicated that they have rules governing 
 racist and threatening use of their resources.  i'd imagine he'll be out 
 of our hair in a short while.
