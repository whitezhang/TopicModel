 throughout the years of the israel/arab-palestinian conflict, the internal
 palestinian popultation has found itself essentially relegated to the
 lower tiers of the economy. given the major kinds of positions required
 by the israeli and the "palestinian" economy, there are essentially two
 different ones existing side by side aren't holding down many of the "
 skilled" positions. so, when gaza has to operate on its own, there are 
 few residents trained to fill the need for middle and upper management.
