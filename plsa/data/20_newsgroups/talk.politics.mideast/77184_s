 pakistan definitely comes in ambit of the economic colonialism.
 the utility rates (electricity, water and gas) are set by imf and
 world bank. governments come and go at whims and fancy of the
 state department. i have yet to see a pakistani govt. survive that
 doesnot have the support of the state department.
