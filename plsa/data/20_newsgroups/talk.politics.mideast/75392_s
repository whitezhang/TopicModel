 "painful search .."
 
 the gruesome extent of february's killings of azeris by armenians
 in the town  of hojali is at last emerging  in azerbaijan - about
 600 men,  women and  children dead  in the  worst outrage  of the
 four-year war over nagorny karabakh.
 
 the figure  is drawn  from azeri investigators,  hojali officials
 and casualty lists published in the baku press. diplomats and aid
 workers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates.
 
 the 25  february attack on hojali  by armenian forces was  one of
 the last moves  in their four-year campaign to  take full control
 of nagorny karabakh,  the subject of a new  round of negotiations
 in rome on monday. the bloodshed was something between a fighting
 retreat and  a massacre, but  investigators say that most  of the
 dead were civilians. the awful  number of people killed was first
 suppressed by  the fearful  former communist government  in baku.
 later  it  was blurred  by  armenian  denials and  grief-stricken
 azerbaijan's wild  and contradictory  allegations of up  to 2,000
 dead.
 
 the state prosecuter, aydin rasulov,  the cheif investigator of a
 15-man  team  looking  into  what azerbaijan  calls  the  "hojali
 disaster", said  his figure of 600  people dead was a  minimum on
 preliminary  findings.  a similar  estimate  was  given by  elman
 memmedov, the mayor of hojali. an  even higher one was printed in
 the baku newspaper  ordu in may - 479 dead  people named and more
 than 200 bodies reported unidentified.  this figure of nearly 700
 dead is quoted as official by leila yunusova, the new spokeswoman
 of the azeri ministry of defence.
 
 francois zen  ruffinen, head  of delegation of  the international
 red cross  in baku, said  the muslim imam  of the nearby  city of
 agdam had reported a figure of  580 bodies received at his mosque
 from  hojali, most  of  them  civilians. "we  did  not count  the
 bodies. but  the figure seems  reasonable. it is no  fantasy," mr
 zen ruffinen said. "we have some idea since we gave the body bags
 and products to wash the dead."
 
 mr  rasulov endeavours  to give  an unemotional  estimate of  the
 number of  dead in the  massacre. "don't  get worked up.  it will
 take  several months  to  get a  final  figure," the  43-year-old
 lawyer said at his small office.
 
 mr rasulov  knows about these  things. it  took him two  years to
 reach  a firm  conclusion that  131  people were  killed and  714
 wounded  when  soviet  troops  and tanks  crushed  a  nationalist
 uprising in baku in january 1990.
 
 those  nationalists, the  popular  front, finally  came to  power
 three weeks  ago and  are applying pressure  to find  out exactly
 what  happened when  hojali, an  azeri town  which lies  about 70
 miles from the border with armenia, fell to the armenians.
 
 officially, 184 people have so  far been certified as dead, being
 the  number of  people that  could be  medically examined  by the
 republic's forensic department. "this  is just a small percentage
 of the dead," said rafiq youssifov, the republic's chief forensic
 scientist. "they were the only bodies brought to us. remember the
 chaos and the fact that we are  muslims and have to wash and bury
 our dead within 24 hours."
 
 of these 184 people, 51 were women, and 13 were children under 14
 years old.  gunshots killed  151 people,  shrapnel killed  20 and
 axes or  blunt instruments  killed 10.  exposure in  the highland
 snows killed the last three.  thirty-three people showed signs of
 deliberate mutilation, including ears,  noses, breasts or penises
 cut off and  eyes gouged out, according  to professor youssifov's
 report. those 184 bodies examined were less than a third of those
 believed to have been killed, mr rasulov said.
 
 files  from  mr  rasulov's  investigative  commission  are  still
 disorganised -  lists of 44  azeri militiamen are dead  here, six
 policemen there,  and in handwriting  of a mosque  attendant, the
 names of  111 corpses brought to  be washed in just  one day. the
 most heartbreaking account from  850 witnesses interviewed so far
 comes  from towfiq  manafov,  an azeri  investigator  who took  a
 helicopter  flight  over  the  escape route  from  hojali  on  27
 february.
 
 "there were too many bodies of  dead and wounded on the ground to
 count properly: 470-500  in hojali, 650-700 people  by the stream
 and the road and 85-100  visible around nakhchivanik village," mr
 manafov  wrote in  a  statement countersigned  by the  helicopter
 pilot.
 
 "people waved up  to us for help. we saw  three dead children and
 one  two-year-old alive  by  one  dead woman.  the  live one  was
 pulling at her arm for the mother to get up. we tried to land but
 armenians started a barrage against  our helicopter and we had to
 return."
 
 there  has been  no consolidation  of  the lists  and figures  in
 circulation because  of the political  upheavals of the  last few
 months and the  fact that nobody knows exactly who  was in hojali
 at the time - many inhabitants were displaced from other villages
 taken over by armenian forces.

 heroes who fought on amid the bodies
 
 aref  sadikov sat  quietly  in the  shade of  a  cafe-bar on  the
 caspian sea  esplanade of baku and  showed a line of  stitches in
 his trousers, torn  by an armenian bullet as he  fled the town of
 hojali just over three months ago, writes hugh pope.
 
 "i'm still  wearing the same  clothes, i don't have  any others,"
 the  51-year-old carpenter  said,  beginning his  account of  the
 hojali disaster. "i was wounded in five places, but i am lucky to
 be alive."
 
 mr sadikov and  his wife were short of  food, without electricity
 for more than a month, and cut off from helicopter flights for 12
 days. they  sensed the  armenian noose was tightening  around the
 2,000 to  3,000 people left in  the straggling azeri town  on the
 edge of karabakh.
 
 "at about 11pm  a bombardment started such as we  had never heard
 before,  eight  or  nine   kinds  of  weapons,  artillery,  heavy
 machine-guns, the lot," mr sadikov said.
 
 soon neighbours were  pouring down the street  from the direction
 of  the  attack. some  huddled  in  shelters but  others  started
 fleeing the town,  down a hill, through a stream  and through the
 snow into a forest on the other side.
 
 to escape, the  townspeople had to reach the azeri  town of agdam
 about 15  miles away. they  thought they  were going to  make it,
 until at  about dawn  they reached a  bottleneck between  the two
 armenian villages of nakhchivanik and saderak.
 
 "none of my group was hurt up to then ... then we were spotted by
 a  car on  the road,  and the  armenian outposts  started opening
 fire," mr sadikov said.
 
 azeri militiamen fighting their way  out of hojali rushed forward
 to force  open a  corridor for the  civilians, but  their efforts
 were mostly  in vain.  mr sadikov  said only  10 people  from his
 group of  80 made it  through, including his wife  and militiaman
 son.  seven  of  his  immediate  relations  died,  including  his
 67-year-old elder brother.
 
 "i only had time to reach down  and cover his face with his hat,"
 he said, pulling his own big  flat turkish cap over his eyes. "we
 have never got any of the bodies back."
 
 the first groups were lucky to have the benefit of covering fire.
 one hero  of the  evacuation, alif  hajief, was  shot dead  as he
 struggled to change  a magazine while covering  the third group's
 crossing, mr sadikov said.
 
 another hero,  elman memmedov, the  mayor of hojali, said  he and
 several others  spent the whole day  of 26 february in  the bushy
 hillside, surrounded by  dead bodies as they tried  to keep three
 armenian armoured personnel carriers at bay.
 
 as the  survivors staggered the  last mile into agdam,  there was
 little comfort  in a town from  which most of the  population was
 soon to flee.
 
 "the night  after we reached  the town  there was a  big armenian
 rocket attack. some people just  kept going," mr sadikov said. "i
 had to  get to the  hospital for treatment. i  was in a  bad way.
 they even found a bullet in my sock."

 another of the massacre victims. calculating the final death toll
 has been  complicated because muslims  bury their dead  within 24
 hours.
