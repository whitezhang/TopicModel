 it's not relevant whether i agree with you or not, there is some reasonable
 thought in what you say here an i appreciate your point. however, i would make 2
 remarks: 
 
  - you forgot about hate, and this is not only at government level.
  - it's not only 'arab' governments.
 
 now, about taugh talk and arrogance, we are adults, aren't we ? do you listen 
 to tough talk of american politicians ? or switch  the channel ? 
 i would rather be 'intimidated' by some dummy 'talking tough' then by a 
 bomb ready to blow under my seat in b747.
