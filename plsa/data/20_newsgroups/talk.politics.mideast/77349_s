 "it seems that terrorism against their own co-nationals has been a prominent
  part of the revolutionary activities of the dashnag leaders of the caucasus.
  organized to fight the turks, these chieftains have been more successful
  in their fight against their armenian opponents in turkey, and the caucasus,
  very often defenseless and innocent."

 "we were defeated".

 "the fact remains, however, that the leaders of the turkish armenian section
  of the dashnagtzoutune did not carry out their promise of loyalty to the
  turkish cause when the turks entered the war...and a call was sent for 
  armenian volunteers to fight the turks on the caucasian front."
 
 p. 38.
 
 "thousands of armenians from all over the world, flocked to the standards of
  such famous fighters as antranik, kery, dro, etc. the armenian volunteer
  regiments rendered valuable service to the russian army in the years of
  1914-15-16."
 
 
 by the way, here is the entire paragraph.
 
 "we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as 
  ways of escape for the tartars and then proceeded in the work 
  of extermination. our troops surrounded village after village. 
  little resistance was offered. our artillery knocked the huts 
  into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable 
  and inhabitants fled from them into fields, bullets and bayonets 
  completed the work. some of the tartars escaped of course. they 
  found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border 
  into turkey. the rest were killed. and so it is that the whole 
  length of the borderland of russian armenia from nakhitchevan to 
  akhalkalaki from the hot plains of ararat to the cold mountain 
  plateau of the north were dotted with mute mournful ruins of 
  tartar villages. they are quiet now, those villages, except for 
  howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the 
  scattered bones of the dead."
