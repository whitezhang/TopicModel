 i'm not aware that the us government considers me dangerous.  in any
 case, that has nothing to do with the current case.  the claim against
 the adl is that it illegally obtained and disseminated information that
 was gathered by state and/or federal agencies in the course of their
 standard interaction with citizens such as myself.  by that i refer to
 things such as: address and phone number, vehicle registration and
 license information, photographs, etc.
 
 > 2. why does the adl have an interest in that person ?
 
 you should ask the adl, if you want an authoritative answer.  my guess
 is that they collected information on anyone who did or might engage in
 political criticism of israel.  i further believe that they did this as
 agents of the israeli government, or at least in agreement with them.
 at least some of the information collected by the adl was passed on to
 israeli officials.  in some cases it was used to influence, or attempt
 to influence, people's access to jobs or public forums.  these matters
 will be brought out as the court case unfolds, since california law
 entitles people to compensation if such actions can be proven.  as my
 previous posting shows, california law entitles people to compensation
 even in the absence of any specific consequences -- just for the further
 dissemination of certain types of private information about them.
