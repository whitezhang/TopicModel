   i have never seen such immaturity among semitophiles.  this
 andi beyer character shows no signs of anti semitism, yet
 because he deviates from the norm of accepted opinion, you
 attack him.  why did not anyone venture to answer andi's
 question in an intelligent and unoffending manner?  the only
 ones guilty here of not backing up there viewpoints with fact
 are the israelophiles.  now will we please start having some
 intelligent conversation?  you all are an insult to you race!
 {assuming you are also semitic}
 	now i have a comment concerning israeli terrorism
 during the 1930's and 1940's.  the hirgun, and other branch -
 off militant groups, did fight the british do get them out of
 palestine.  yet i fail to see how this israeli form of
 terrorism was better than the terrorism practiced now by the
 arabs.  these jewish terrorist groups killed innocent british
 soldiers, but not only thta also killed many jews who were in
 favor of a compromise with the palestinians.  in addition, they
 massacred an entire palestinian village in 1948, contributing
 to the exodus of the frightened palestinians who feared their
 very lives.
 	i mention this not because i'm anti semitic [i'm part
 jewish] but because this self righteousness on the part of the
 israelites pisses me off so.  i'm not as critical of the
 palestinians because they were indeed screwed over by the
 jews.  it 's a damn shame that the palestinians had to pay for
 german and european anti semitism.
