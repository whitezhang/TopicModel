 dorin, of all the criticism of my post expressed on t.p.m., this one i accept.
 i regret that aspect of my post. it is my hope that the occupation will end (and
 the accompanying loss of life) but i believe that stiff resistance can help to 
 achieve that end. despite what some have said on t.p.m., i think that there is 
 a point when losses are unacceptable. the strategy drove u.s. troops out of 
 lebanon, at least.
