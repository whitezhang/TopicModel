 as i said, i do not want to convice anyone, so, why should my opinions
 convince anyone?
 i do not believe that my opinions are refuted by facts.

 maybe youy view of a dictionary is the problem here. one thing is the
 accepted meaning of a word by a dictionary, and sometimes a completely
 different thing is what that word came to mean after a long time.

 ok. tell me how many people in zionist movements define a jew in a 
 different way, and how many are who define jew based on a religious way.

 you need to start reading before answering. 
 my point was that because some movement claims to be nationalistic, it 
 does not mean that i consider it to be nationalistic. i did not comapre
 israel to the ira. i think that you are starting to put words on my 
 mouth and that is wrong.

 i never said that zionism is monolithic. if you are going to attribute
 me things, present the quotes where i said that.

 that is your problem. i could certainly interpret this like you are 
 running out of arguments. first, you put words in my mouth, now, you
 say you do ot believe me.

 why don't you try reading for a change? did i say that the law of return
 demand a person to be religious? now, how does the law of return define 
 who is a jew and who is not? i said that it uses a religious standard:
 if your mother is a jew, you are a jew, if your mother is not jewish,
 neither you are.
 do not twist my words, please.

 i am not talking about the debate. i am talking about how things are right
 now. when the debate is over, i'll see what happens.
 right now, things are like they are.
 let me ask you one thing. i understand that israel differenciates between
 citizenship and nationality. suppose m(ale) and f(emale) have a child in
 israel. which nationality will the child's id show, according to each one
 of the following cases:
 
 a) f and m are both jewish.
 b) f is jewsh and m is not.
 c) f is muslim and m is jewish.
 d) f is christian and m is jewish.
 e) f and m are both non-jewish.

 it called history. at some point it was ok. now, i believe, it is not.

 interesting. how do you know? had i ever talked to you about this and 
 forgotten about that?

 which definition are you now talking here about? 
 i do not know why you are so touchy. i never said that you did not support
 palestinian self-determination. i just gave an example of hypocrisy. i never
 said that someone in this net is guilty of it. it was just an example. nothing
 more, nothing less than that. why did you have to clarify what you think?
 
 >if you didn't use different meanings of words than are in the
 >dictionary, you might be believable.  
 
 here you have several problems.
 first, you should know that words have more meanings than those given in
 the dictionary.
 second, it may come to be a shock for you to know that there are more
 words than those in the dictionary.
 third, we can exchange ideas if you want, but you come out with this nonsense
 about being believable = using the definitions given in a dictionary.
 it seems that you cannot answer to the ideas given by others without insulting
 others. sad.
 
 >if your "facts" at all resembled
 >even the slightest bit of truth - which they do not - you might be 
 >believable.  
 
 if you did not put words in my mouth, it might be that you might
 start reading what i had actually said. so far, you come over and over
 twisting what i said or presenting things i never said as if i had said
 them. in this way, you are answering to yourself. that is why you do not
 find it believable. maybe, if you start reading what i had actually said,
 and not what you added, you might change your mind.
 
 >but the fact is that there is nothing resembling fact in

 >else does.
 
 first, there is nothing resembling a fact in what you added to what i said,
 as if i had said it. 
 seconf, anyone else is supposed to mean "than i do"?
