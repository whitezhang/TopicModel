 if you were to substitute the word "jew"/"jewish" in this posting where you  
 see the word "muslim"/"islamic", switch joachim and mohammed's names around,  
 and then repost this, you would get a flood of messages attacking the author  
 as an anti-semite. and rightly so. the author of this crap is a racist, pure  
 and simple. he obviously has no qualms about being open with it, either,  
 unlike some other arab- and mulsim-bashers on the net. 
 
 now, i for one, am not going to look at joachim's posting and infer from it  
 that all jews think this way. sure, there might be some, but this view is not  
 a part of judaism, and it is stupid to believe that all jews' minds are this  
 twisted. however, some muslims might look at joachim's flame as a  
 reaffirmation of their worst fears about jews: that they all hate arabs and  
 are racists.
 
 for this reason, i am alarmed that not more jews on the net have spoken out  
 against what joachim has said. they have the chance to possibly change the  
 anti-semitic views of some people on the net, to show them that all jews do  
 *not* hate all arabs and muslims, just like all muslims do *not* hate all  
 jews. yet they are missing that chance. remember, to many people, silence  
 implies consent.
 
 peace.
