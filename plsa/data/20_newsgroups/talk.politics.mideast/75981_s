 this a "tried and true" method utilized by guerilla and terrorists groups:
 to conduct operations in the midst of the local populace, thus forcing the
 opposing "state" to possible harm innocent civilians in their search or,
 in order to avoid the deaths of civilians, abandon the search. certainly the
 people who use the population for cover are *also* to blaim for dragging the
 innocent civilians into harm's way.
 
 are you suggesting that, when guerillas use the population for cover, israel
 should totally back down? so...the easiest way to get away with attacking
 another is to use an innocent as a shield and hope that the other respects
 innocent lives?

 your damn right israel insists on some sort of "demilitarized" or "buffer"
 zone. its had to put up with too many years of attacks from the territory
 of arab states and watched as the states did nothing. it is not exactly
 surprizing that israel decided that the only way to stop such actions is to 
 do it themselves.
 
 >if israel is interested in peace, than it should withdraw from our land.  
 
 what? so the whole bit about attacks on israel from neighboring arab states 
 can start all over again? while i also hope for this to happen, it will
 only occur when arab states show that they are *prepared* to take on the 
 responsibility and the duty to stop guerilla attacks on israel from their 
 soil. they have to prove it (or provide some "guaratees"), there is no way
 israel is going to accept their "word"- not with their past attitude of 
 tolerance towards "anti-israel guerillas in-residence".

 good lord, brad. what in the world goves you the idea that un troops stop
 anything? they are only stationed in a country because that country allows
 them in. it can ask them to leave *at any time*; as nasser did in '56 and
 '67. somehow, with that "limitation" on the troops "powers" i don't
 think that israel is going to be any more comfortable. without a *genuine* commitment to peace from the arab states, and concrete (not intellectual or political exercises in jargon) "guarantees" by other parties, the un is worthless
 to israel (but, perhaps useful as a "ruse"?).

 perhaps you are aware that, to most communities of people, there is
 the feeling that it is better that "many of us die fighting
 against those who attack us than for few to die while we silently 
 accept our fate." if,however, you call on israel to see the sense of 
 suffering fewer casualties, i suggest you apply the same to palestinian,
 arab and islamic groups.

 from israel's perspective, "concessions" gets it nothing...except the 
 realization that it has given "something" up and now *can only 
 hope* that the other side decides to do likewise. words *can be taken
 back* by merely doing so; to "take back" tangible items (land,
 control of land) requires the sort of action you say israel should
 stay away from.
  
 israel put up with attacks from arab state territories for decades 
 before essentially putting a stop to it through its invasion of lebanon.
 the entire basis of that reality was exactly as you state above: 1) israel 
 would express outrage at these attacks and protest to the arab state 
 involved, 2) that state promptly ignored the entire matter, secure 
 in the knowledge that it could not be held responsible for the acts 
 committed by "private groups", 3) israel would prepare for the next 
 round of attacks. what would israel want to return to those days (and
 don't be so idiotic as to suggest "trust" for the motivations of
 present-day arab states)?

 ah, ok...what is "different" about the present situation that tells
 us that the arab states will *not* pursue their past antagonistic 
 policies towards israel? now, don't talk about vague "political factors"
 but about those "tangible" (just like that which israel gave up)
 factors that "guarantee" the responsibility of those states. your
 assessment of "difference" here is based on a whole lot of assumptions,
 and most states don't feel confortable basing their existence on that
 sort of thing.

 it has not. without the support, and active involvement, of syria,
 lebanon would not have been able to accomplish all that has occurred.
 once syria leaves who is to say that lebanon will be able to retain 
 control? if syria stays thay may be even more dangerous for israel.

 your view of this entire matter is far too serenely one-sided and
 selectively naive.
