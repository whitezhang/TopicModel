 # the u.s. holocaust memorial museum: a costly and dangerous mistake

 letter from ss-standartenfuehrer sievers to ss-obersturmbannfuehrer

 ["the natzweiler trial", edited by anthony m. webb, p. 89]

 place, as far as i can remember, in spring 1944. in this case the
 corpses were sent to professor hirt of the department of anatomy in
 strasbourg.
