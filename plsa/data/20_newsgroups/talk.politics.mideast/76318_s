 if a landlord sells an apartment building "vacant" to another landlord
 and fails to notify his tenants, they just might find themselves out
 on the street all of a sudden.  the seller may be a scoundrel and a
 crook but this doesn't make the buyer a "thief", as israelis are so
 often called here on tpm.

 the arabs that lived along the coast in western palestine, later to be
 called israel, were shafted by their brother arabs just as they've
 been shafted for decades since then by their arab bretheren.  somehow,
 though, the arab call has continued to blame israel, not only for the
 syrian landowner sell-out in western palestine (israel) but even for
 the occupation of eastern palestine (jordan) by the hashemites.  this
 is just more of refusing to take blame for one's own actions.

 if your job was eliminated in a corporate takeover, you could probably
 go to court, too.  you'd probably lose, though.
