 although i don't want to muddy the waters unnecessarily i disagree. any
 discrimination based on religion is not and cannot be racist unless the
 sole qualification for religious membership is racial. this is not the
 case for israel although it might get a little closer than, say, islam.
 this of course raises the vexed question of church antisemitism. jews
 have been heavily discriminated against on the grounds of religion in
 many christian countries. if we take russia as an example jews were
 seriously persecuted but that persecution in the eyes of the church
 and state stopped at the baptismal font. officially anyway. if a jew
 converted there were no legal barriers in his way (that i know of anyway.)
 peter the great's interior minister came from such a convert background.
 can we then claim that the russian orthodox did not teach antisemitism
 and was not antisemitic? similarly for the roman catholic church? i
 suspect so as this is not a racial 'taint' but one based on belief
 and as is after all a form of racism. well maybe not. what is
 antisemitism then if not something racially based? i wonder if hitler
 killed converts of 'pure' german blood. does anyone know one way or
 the other?
