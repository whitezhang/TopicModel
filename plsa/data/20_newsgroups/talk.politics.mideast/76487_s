 yes it is, as has been evidenced by the previous two stages
 of withdrawal from the area and by the reductions in troops.
 currently the troops are kept at a level consistent with light
 and armored patrols.  no permanent installations have been
 built in the area, nor are any planned.
 
 as to the prodigal "water question",  you can continue to waste
 your time looking for non-existent proof, or you can accept the
 testimony of people here, some lebanese, who have acknowledged
 that they know of no evidence for these allegations.

 it depends which of those territories you refer to.
 in general, settlers were moved into the territories because
 at the time, in the context of the situations, it seemed the
 logical move.  this is not to say that views don't change
 or that mistakes are not made.  currently, i would say that
 the only "disputed territory" that does not appear to be temporary
 is that of eastern and northern jerusalem.
