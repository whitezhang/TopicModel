 i guess, i didn't make my point clear.  in the case of israel government, it 
 is not only tough talk for its intimidation policy.  after all, not many
 people are intimidated just by talking.  here how it goes: tough talks,
 followed by aggressive actions followed by taking pride of those actions and
 bragging about them.
