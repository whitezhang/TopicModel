 to andi,
 
 i have to disagree with you about the value of israeli news sources. if you
 want to know about events in palestine it makes more sense to get the news
 directly from the source. every news source is inherently biased to some
 extent and for various reasons, both intentional and otherwise. however, 
 the more sources relied upon the easier it is to see the "truth" and to discern 
 the bias. 
 
 go read or listen to some israeli media. you will learn more news and more
 opinion about israel and palestine by doing so. then you can form your own
 opinions and hopefully they will be more informed even if your views don't 
 change.
