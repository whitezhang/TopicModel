 the following flyer was distributed at aipac's 34th annual policy conference:
 
 because when we're not in israel, we're told to go back where we came from and
 when we come back to israel we're told to go back to where we came from and 
 when we're vocal we have too much influence and when we are quiet we can afford
 to be because we we control everything anyway and when we buy something we can
 afford to because jews are so rich and when we don't buy something it's because
 we're cheap and because when we are poor we're called dirty jew and ignorant
 and when we're not we're called called rich jew and jap and when we are visibly
 organized it's because there is a secret jewish conspiracy and when we're not it
 is because there is a secret jewish conspiracy and because we're told we're not
 a people and when we say we are we're still told that we're not and when we
 marry our own people we're called racist and we don't we're contaminating 
 someone else's "race" and because we're under fire from the left and from the 
 right and because there are whites who hate us for not being white and because
 there are non-whites who hate us for being white  and because anti-semitic 
 incidents are rising every year but we're told that anti-semitism doesn't 
 exist or that we're paranoid and because we're told to shut up about the 
 holocaust and yet holocaust revisionism is risng every year and when we are
 "obnoxious" we're called japs and when we are "nice" we're told we don't act
 jewish and because anti-semitism is now world-wide and because our people is
 not yet free and because we do not have to complete the work but neither are
 we free to desist from it for these reasons and many many more we are part of
 the jewish national liberation movement: zionism.
