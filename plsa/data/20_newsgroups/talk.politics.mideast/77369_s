 your ignorance is hardly characteristic of most '*ians'. sarkis atamian 
 explains in his book called 'the armenian community, new york 1955, 
 philosophical library' that, according to historians, original fatherland 
 of the armenians was in thessaly, greece. armenian invaders burned and 
 sacked the fatherland of urartus, massacred and exterminated its population 
 and presented to the world all those left from the urartus, as the armenian 
 civilization. all reliable western historians describe how armenians 
 ruthlessly exterminated 2.5 million muslim women, children and elderly 
 people of eastern anatolia and how they collaborated with the enemies of 
 the muslim people between 1914-1920. it is unfortunately a truth that 
 armenians are known as collaborators of the nazis during world war ii 
 and that, even today, criminal members of the asala/sdpa/arf terrorism 
 triangle preach and instigate racism, hatred, violence and terrorism 
 among peoples.

 who says 'arromdians' are no damn good? during world war ii armenians 
 were carried away with the german might and cringing and fawning over 
 the nazis. in that zeal, the armenian publication in germany, hairenik, 
 carried statements as follows:[1]
 
 "sometimes it is difficult to eradicate these poisonous elements (the jews)
  when they have struck deep root like a chronic disease, and when it 
  becomes necessary for a people (the nazis) to eradicate them in an uncommon
  method, these attempts are regarded as revolutionary. during the surgical
  operation, the flow of blood is a natural thing." 
 
 now for a brief view of the armenian genocide of the muslims and jews -
 extracts from a letter dated december 11, 1983, published in the san
 francisco chronicle, as an answer to a letter that had been published
 in the same journal under the signature of one b. amarian.
 
  "we have first hand information and evidence of armenian atrocities
   against our people (jews). members of our family witnessed the 
   murder of 148 members of our family near erzurum, turkey, by armenian 
   neighbors, bent on destroying anything and anybody remotely jewish 
   and/or muslim. armenians should look to their own history and see 
   the havoc they and their ancestors perpetrated upon their neighbors.
   armenians were in league with hitler in the last war, on his premise 
   to grant themselves government if, in return, the armenians would 
   help exterminate jews. armenians were also hearty proponents of
   the anti-semitic acts in league with the russian communists."
