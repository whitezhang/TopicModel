 i say despite all the bad news for muslims around the world, things are
 shaping up very well, a lot of killings might happen in the near future,
 though (as if bosnia is not a lot).
 right now, i feel like saying what martillo said : "the stage is set".
 i don't think that things will be the same in ten year, 
 on the pessimistic/realistic side, we can only see the stage set for more
 wars imposed on our people, and governments being remote controlled.
 to fight each other and to oppress their own people, but i am confident
 they will all fall:
 i venture to list the order: sudan/yemen alliance, algeria/libya in 5 years,
 tunisia one year later but egypt may face direct colonization very soon to
 prevent an islamic government which might take over after egypt attacks 
 sudan and is envolved in atrocities there as it fails to achieve
 victory.  meanwhile saudia faces a civil war and goes to war 
 with yemen/sudan over it,  the new north african 
 alliance (algeria/tun/libya) goes to war with morocco who attacks it.
 u.s/france involved everywhere but cannot concentrate on one place, 
 especially that syria/jordan/iraq have to be kept under control.
 
 after the cloud clears, i do not know what the end result will be,
 
 o.k back to reality:
 
  	cairo, egypt (upi) -- the cairo-based arab organization for human
  rights (aohr) sunday called on king fahd of saudi arabia to order the
  release of members of the kingdom's first human rights group.
 
 .....
 >	among those group wants released was mohamed ben abdullah al masaari,
  spokesman of the committee for the defense of legitimate rights (cdlr).
  al masaari was arrested just before dawn saturday at his residence in
  riyadh's king faisal university, where he worked as a physics professor,
 >human rights and media sources reported.
  	the media reports said saudi security forces also seized
  publications, books, correspondence and other documents and papers from
  al masaari's residence. he was reportedly taken to an unknown
 >destination.
  	the london-based liberty human rights group claimed that the other
 >five members who together with al massari formed cdlr on may 3, were
  summoned for police questioning and might have been detained as well.
  	on thursday, the saudi government ordered the firing and disbarment
  of the six activists because they established the group urging people in
 >the kingdom with grievances to report to cdlr.
 >	four of the activists were sacked from their positions with two
  state-run saudi universities and two government departments, and two
 >lawyers, including al masaari's father, were disbarred and their law
