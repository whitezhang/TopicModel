 living through those days at the age of 20 and following
 the internal and external news gives me that knowledge
 and position.  in 1974, turkey had a democratic goverment and free
 press at that time.  forget about internal news agencies, i haven't
 heard anything from any international source about any
 concentration camps with greek cypriot prisoners in turkey.
 however, i heard adana pow camp.  it was not secret and well 
 recognized pow camp.

 i see,  they vanished in turkish labor camps.  turks have
 decided to acknowledge their existence first but later
 changed their minds releasing them.  is that it?  what do
 you think happened to them?  i thought that mia's are only the subject 
 of rambo and chuck noris movies.  seems that i am wrong.

 you don't need to belive me.  turkiye was never a clandestine state
 in its history,  it has been a respected and continuous member of un 
 since the inception of un.  no body ever questioned the un membership of
 turkey because of what had happened in 1974a and after.  only a short 
 lived arms embargo was imposed unilaterally by usa to satisfy the 
 internal greek loby.  i know what you would say next.  let me answer it
 before wasting anytime.  yes!  un had a few condemning resolutions 
 against turkey because of handling the cyprus problem, especially after
 the 1980 coup.  well, us and israel had a few too.  what can i say?
 i am sure during athens junta duruing 1960-74, greeks had
 their own share too.

 have you looked at the latest un agenda for cyprus talks
 mediated by gali?  there was no issue whatsoever about any
 missing people among the negotiating parties.  was there?
 i heard many times from denktas interviews by turkish and
 international press.  he keeps saying that "this was no
 longer an issue for peace talks."  also, you don't want
 me fish for the greek cypriot politician's words (that argic
 had posted zillion times) describing missing peoples as 
 a greek-cypriot myth.  seems that there is a different opinions 
 among greek-cypriots as well about missing people in turkish 
 custody.

 i am not claiming anything.  i just told you what was
 given to greek cypriots as an answer by turkish
 goverment/turkish cypriots when they wanted to locate some
 of their own between july 15 and the final cease-fire in
 late august, 1974.  this answer seems to satisfy the international 
 community, the un, and the vasilu goverment (since he did not make it
 an issue for the peace talks).  also, i am not aware of any un
 condemnation against turkey about any missing greek-cypriot.  are you?  
 
 btw, do you mean that nicos sampson had a bloodless coup d'eta
 and nobody got hurt in those events?

 like i said before.  there is even a different opinion among
 greek-cypriots for this myth.   the officers in turkish army who
 governed the adana pow camp must be hell of clever dudes
 to cover up their tracks 8-).  i hope turkish army does't have 
 same type of morons for the security of turkiye.  however, this must 
 a good subject for a movie script.  one should inform oliver stone     
 about this.
