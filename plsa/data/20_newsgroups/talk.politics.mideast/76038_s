 a couple of months ago jle wrote a terrible c program (it would never have 
 passed compilation). this is one describes jle the great.

 	printf("even if she wanted, jle's mother couldn't abort this program");
 	printf("\n\n\n\n");
 }
 
 void
 main()
 {
 	signal(sigint,abort);
 	printf("this program does not help jewish-arab relations  :-( \n");
 
 	printf("hit ^c to abort \n");
 
 /* infinite loop, jle never comes out of his world 	*/
 
 	while(j_l_e);

 to compile this "wonderfool" program on a unix machine try.
 cc -o jle jle.c
 or 
 make jle
 
 then type jle at your prompt.
 
 i tried it, it works great ...
