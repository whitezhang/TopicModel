  no. i do not thing we are doing them a favor.  i have simply stated that
  they are not treated as a second class citizens. that was my point.
  i fail to see how my words show discrimination. and what do you mean that
  they do not get nothing? is, for example, helth insurance, food, and tuition
  nothing?

  i'm sorry, but i cannot see any logical order in the above argument.

  what part exactly is this one? the people cannot even sell their property
  if they want to leave turkey.  the patriarch could not get a permision to
  renovate some buildings for decades; it needed a special agreement between
  the two goverments for this. talk about a part of the society? why has the
  size of the greek community reduced to 1,500 old people and priests then?

  yeah, you bet.

  you are far off from the reality.
