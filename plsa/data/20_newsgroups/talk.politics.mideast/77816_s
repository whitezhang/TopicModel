 i caught the tail end of a piece on npr (national public radio) about
 chomsky.  apparently there is a new documentary about him and his
 concepts on the propagandist news media of the west, or some such.
 the funny thing is that npr painted chomsky and the documentary in
 such a positive light, or at least ended the report in a positive way.
 the documentary is just now showing in a few cities in the us, and
 will open in more cities in june.  sorry, forgot the title.
