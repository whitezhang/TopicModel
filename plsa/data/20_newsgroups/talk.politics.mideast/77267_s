 actually i am not sure you have understood what i have said. on several
 occasions a minor party has put up an arab for a cabinet position. that
 is the major party (labour in this case) has agreed that a minor party
 can have so many seats and that party nominates an arab for one. this is
 not acceptable to the major party which insists on the minor party
 appointing a jew. the favours owed, deals done, have all been settled.
 what remains is exactly who is going to sit in cabinet. the party that
 gets the seat wants an arab but that is not acceptable. this *is* racism.
 it has nothing to do with politics at all.
