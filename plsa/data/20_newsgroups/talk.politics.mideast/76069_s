 
 it seems to me that many readers of this conference are interested
 who is behind the center for polict research. i will oblige.
 
 my name is elias davidsson, icelandic citizen, born in palestine. my
 mother was thrown from germany because she belonged to the 'undesirables'
 (at that times this group was defined as 'jews'). she was forced to go
 to palestine due to many  cynical factors. i have meanwhile settled in
 iceland (30 years ago) and met many people who were thrown out from
 my homeland, palestine, because of the same reason (they belonged to
 the 'indesirables'). these people include my neighbors in jerusalem
 with the children of whom i played as child. their crime: theyare
 not jews. my conscience does not accept such injustice, period. my
 work for justice is done in the name of my principled opposition to racism
 and racial discrimination. those who protest against such practices
 in arab countries have my support - as long as their protest is based
 on a principled position, but not as a tactic to deflect criticism
 from israel. the struggle against discrimination and racism is universal.
 
 the center for policy research is a name i gave to those activities
 undertaken under my guidance in different domains, and which command
 the support of many volunteers in iceland. it is however not a formal
 institution and works with minimal funds.
 
 professionally i am music teacher and composer. i have published 
 several pieces and my piano music is taught widely in europe.
 
 i would hope that discussion about israel/palestine be conducted in
 a more civilized manner. calling names is not helpful.
