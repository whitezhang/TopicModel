 i agree with shai,  there are many references to israeli
 plans on the litani river but i have yet to find hard 
 evidence.  i had mentioned before that there is a report
 commissioned by the un to study the litani river, it is 
 still in draft form.  the israeli gov't also commissioned
 a study on the river that was done by dr. ben wolfe.
 the litani starts in the bekaa valley in lebanon,
 flows southward, then west across south lebanon and
 discharges into the mediterranean near the city of tyre.
 there are other rivers such as the hasbani and the wazzani
 that start in lebanese territory than join the jordan river.  
 the most mentioned plan was one that would divert water
 from the litani into these, then the water would flow
 naturally into the lac de houle.  but there is no evidence
 of any diversion structure (which would need to be at least
 3 km long).  the area is mountainous, inaccessible and
 occupied by israel so i have not seen any independent 
 reports of the existence of any diversion structure there.
 another often mentioned diversion is through deep wells.
 it is also rumored that israe has 600 m wells
 tapping into deep aquifers and drawing water on the
 israeli side of the border.  if such wells are indeed
 under use they would be costly to operate 
 (high energy costs) and the lebanese and israeli gov't should 
 agree on the distribution of water from shared aquifers
 as part of an overall peace plan and the bilateral
 negociations on "regional issues".  the fact that we have
 been at war all this time has led to the current state
 of affairs where withdrawals from such aquifers is
 completely unregulated.
