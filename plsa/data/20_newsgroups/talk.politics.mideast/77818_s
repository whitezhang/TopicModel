 well everybody,
 
 after reading tons of notes by serdar, i have come to the following conclusion.   
 turkey is perfect, and no turk has ever made a mistake.  he has proved to me at  
 least that the land occupied by turkey today, was always lived in peacefully by  
 turks.  (including istanbul aka constantinople)  they treat their minorities  
 like gods and have only done good while all of their evil neighbors attacked  
 them.  somehow, despite these evil neighbors capable of nothing but murder  
 their population has exploded to almost 60 million in turkey alone. (note,  
 armenian worldwide population is approximately 7 million total)  i want to go  
 to this heaven on earth and meet the race that has made serdar possible, that  
 has persevered, and has become a mecca for human rights lovers.  (amnesty  
 international must have bad sources, turkey would never torture its citizens,  
 treat minorities badly, or kidnap 7 foreign journalists last year alone, who  
 incidentally are still missing), what i am trying to say is i want to be a  
 turk!!!!
 
 now back to reality.  i have once again been astounded by serdars ability to  
 ignore all truth, all truly difficult questions, and go on to his encyclopedia  
 of quotes and sources that can be pasted into any note by the page!  anybody at  
 all who has believed anything he has said, please step forward.  let him know  
 he hasn't been wasting his time, that somebody out there can be convinced by  
 the volume of e-mail you can produce, not the quality of the content. well i am  
 off now.  i will go dream  some more about that perfect place, that nirvana,  
 that utopia, that xanadu, that turkey!
