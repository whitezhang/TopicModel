 stupid and loaded questions to this newsgroup.  what are you? - a
 think tank, or a fish tank?  every time i start to believe i have
 seen the outer boundaries of your stupidity, you come up with one
 step beyond.  when will it end, man?  can you actually have brain
 enough to dress and feed yourself each morning?
