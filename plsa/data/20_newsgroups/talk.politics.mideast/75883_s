 what the hell do you know about israeli policy?  what gives you the fiat
 to look into the minds of israeli generals?  has this 'policy of intimidation'
 been published somewhere?  for your information, the actions taken by arabs,
 specifically the plo, were not uncommon in the lebanon campaign of 1982.  my
 brain is full of shit?  at least i don't look into the minds of others and 
 make israeli policy for them!

 yeah, yeah, yeah.  we all suffer.  it's too bad that civilians get killed but
 i will blame their arab leaders who put them in positions of danger before i
 will blame the israelis.  just like palestinians who send their children into
 warzones to throw rocks at armed israeli soldiers.  what irresponsible parents!
 as golda meir said, peace will only come when the arabs start loving their
 children more than they hate the jews.
