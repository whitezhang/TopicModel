    are you trying to say that there were no massacres in deir yassin
    or in sabra and shatila? if so then let me tell you some good jokes:
 
    there is not and was not any such thing like jewish killing in wwii
 
    palestinians just did what davidians did for fourty years and more.
 
    in fact no one was killed in any war at any time or any place.
 
    people die that is all. no one gets killed.
 
    maybe also vietamiese didn't die in vietnam war killed by american
    napalm they were just pyromaniacs and that's all.
 
    maybe jews just liked gas chambers and no one forced them to get in there.they 
    may be thought it was like snifing cocaine. no?
 
    what do you think of this ? isn't it stupid to say so?
    well it is as stupid as what you said .next time you want to lie do it
    intelligently.
 
    sincerely yours.

 arab civilians did die at dir yassin. but there was no massacre. first
 of all, the village housed many *armed* troops. secondly, the irgun
 and stern fighters had absolutely no intentions of killing civilians.
 the village was attacked only for its military significance. in fact,
 a warning was given to the occupants of the village to leave before
 the attack was to begin.
 
 by all rational standards, dir yassin was not a massacre. the killing
 was unintentional. the village housed arab snipers and arab troops.
 thus it was attacked for its military significance. it was not
 attacked with intentions of killing any civilians.
 
 to even compare dir yassin, in which some 120 or so arabs died, to the
 holocaust is absurd. the irgun did not want to kill any civilians. the
 village had almost 1000 inhabitants, most of whom survived.
