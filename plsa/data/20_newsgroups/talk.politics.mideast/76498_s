 this could be accomplished by other criteria.  one must remember
 that children often bring stress into households. as an alternative,
 one could consider financial incentives for every sexual act performed
 by two partners of different ethnic backgrounds.  the plan could
 be entitled "peace income sexual security", or piss for short.
 
 every time an israeli gets screwed
 by a palestinian or visa versa, they would be eligible for income.
 in keeping with the spirit of the times, condoms would be a tax deductible
 expense.  this policy does not discriminate on a gender basis nor
 would it apply to domestic animals of either nationality.
 
 joint palestinan-israeli teams would be obligated to ensure that all
 acts were voluntary and promptly rewarded. the teams of palestinian-israel
 morals patrols, or pimps, would receive a percentage of the financial
 income in order to encourage their participation and add to their
 incentive in locating suitable candidates.
