 well, -i've- been reading t.p.m. for a while and here is what i saw

 your statment clearly tries to "balance" arab atrocities by noting a
 single incident by the israelis in war-time at their most holy site.
 you even characterize it as "an eye for an eye".

 so now you have to find some source that notes that more than 1 mosque
 was razed.  you then followed it with:

 really?  do you still feel that israelis are comparable in the running
 amok with power with, say, the iraqis?  your "eye for an eye"
 comparisons don't match the realities that most of us are familiar
 with.

 this happened to be during a war!  and a fierce and mighty war it was,
 too.  would you say that the jordanians "indiscriminately shot up
 ancient structures as is their custom" in describing bullet holes in
 the walls of the city?  this was war!  it was certainly not any "eye
 for an eye" characterstic.  israelis do not harbor the same feelings
 of revenge as the arabs generally do.  this is one of the reasons that
 the peace now movement exists in israel and nowhere else in the m.e.
