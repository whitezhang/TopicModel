 	there must be a guarantee of peace before this happens.  it
 seems that many of these lebanese youth are unable to restrain
 themselves from violence, and unable to to realize that their actions
 prolong israels stay in south lebanon.
 
 	if the lebanese army was able to maintain the peace, then
 israel would not have to be there.  until it is, israel prefers that
 its soldiers die rather than its children.

 	israel should withdraw from lebanon when a peace treaty is
 signed.  not a day before.  withdraw because of casualties would tell
 the lebanese people that all they need to do to push israel around is
 kill a few soldiers.  its not gonna happen.

 	why should israel not demand this while holding the buffer
 zone?  it seems to me that the better bargaining position is while
 holding your neighbors land.  if lebanon were willing to agree to
 those conditions, israel would quite probably have left already.
 unfortunately, it doesn't seem that the lebanese can disarm the
 hizbolah, and maintain the peace.
