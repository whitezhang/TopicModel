 you are somewhat close to truth. but you shouldn't forget that
 nationality is a recent invention of the western europe. in the
 days of the ottoman empire, the religion was the main point of
 difference between social classes. the ottomans didn't recognize
 turks, arabs, greeks, serbs... just christians, muslims, jews...
 so, for all the interested parties in the ottoman society the
 bosnian muslims were "turks". after all, there aren't many "real" 
 (ethnic) turks living even in turkey today. even in europe, it's
 the culture that defines the ethnicity and religion is part of
 one's culture.
