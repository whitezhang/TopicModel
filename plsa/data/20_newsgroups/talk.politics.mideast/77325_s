 in today's jerusalem post magazine there is a feature story about the
 ongoing restoration of synagogues in the jewish quarter.  the author,
 leah abramowitz, writes that there were fifty-seven synagogues in the
 quarter in 1948, all of which were destroyed, some, she says, used as
 donkey stables.  the building shells, that is.
 
 i still find it really, really hard to understand why the demolition
 of the buildings in front of the kotel continues to evoke more outrage
 than this.  everything is so much cheaper when it happens to the jews.
 
 why?
