 "in those moslem villages in the plain below which had been searched for
  arms by the armenians everything had been taken under the cloak of such
  search, and not only had many moslems been killed, but horrible tortures 
  had been inflicted in the endeavour to obtain information as to where
  valuables had been hidden, of which the armenians were aware of the 
  existence, although they had been unable to find them."
