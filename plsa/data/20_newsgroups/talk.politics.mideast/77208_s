   tim, you're missing the big sleight-of-hand here.  i can accept every
   word quoted from halabi and still have zero evidence of any mosques
   being razed.  note that what halabi refers to is not that mosques
   were razed but that people protested alleged razing.  too well we
   know that this is a common demagogic tactic (or has anyone forgotten
   the temple mount riots, when the moslem crowd was led to believe
   that the israeli guards were there to cover for the tmf instead of
   stop them?)
