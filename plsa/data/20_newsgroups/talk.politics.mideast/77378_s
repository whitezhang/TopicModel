 try coming up with your own definition of any or all "self-hating" peoples.
 to me, any who reject their culture to the point where they *only* see the
 absolute negatives of that culture (generally, or regarding a particular
 event) and accept *only* those views purely opposing aspects of that culture 
 (thus, selective belief in and use of historical facts and a complete ignoring
 of "context" results) "hate" their culture. that certainly describes elias, 
 since he has no intention of recognizing that, alongside the palestinian
 experience and perspective, there exists also that of israelis.

 and, this is precisely why israeli society has been tremendously harmed
 by the actions it (its government) has *felt it had to take* in response
 to an "other" perceived as a threat. just as with you, there has long 
 been a strident and emotional debate about the pain israelis feel when 
 forced to "balance" desires for survival and moral beliefs. the trauma
 of having to make that choice is made worse by the fact that neither
 can be conveniently brushed aside (as a result of a reasoned political
 debate) for the sake of the other, only reshaped.
