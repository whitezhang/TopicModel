 maybe i'm a bit old-fashioned, but have you heard about something
 called love? it used to play some role in people's considerations
 for getting married. of course i know some people who married 
 fictitiously in order to get a green card, but making a common
 child for 18,000$? the power of aa is limited. your proposal is
 indeed unconventional.
