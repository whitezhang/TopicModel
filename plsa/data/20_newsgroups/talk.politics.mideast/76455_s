 there were a great many germans, poles and others who did not
 sympathize with the victims of the holocaust but instead participated
 with enthusiasm in the killing.
 
 the holocaust wasn't a massacre, it wasn't even killing for sport; it
 was an entire industry of death.  german engineers, architects
 technicians and bureaucrats proudly put their best efforts into as
 efficient and methodical a killing machine as they could devise and
 operate.  and it certainly was something extraordinary.
 
 please don't bleat to us about how the nazis suffered from the
 holocaust.

 but what you did do, when waldo wrote:
   all jews suffered during wwii [...]
 was "correct" him with:
   all humans suffered [...]
 
 so what were you implying?

 are we supposed to thank you for your generosity?  
 or should we be pleased with your minimal common sense?

 why is it that when someone writes something simple like "all jews
 sufffered during wwii" that you feel the burning need to add
 commentary?  regardless of what people write, you keep trying to twist
 things into what you want to hear.  people with similar tendencies in
 more extreme form are sometimes called historical revisionists.  is
 this something that you aspire to?
