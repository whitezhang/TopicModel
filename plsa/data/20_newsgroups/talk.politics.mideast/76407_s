 from jaffa, and/or who fled jaffa, or anywhere else in israel, having
 the right to return is:  yes, unfortunately, they have the right to
 return.  they may apply for citizenship like any other non-israeli and
 then go to >jaffa and try to buy their house back from the jews who now
 own it.  
 
 	and now a question and answer for you:  can the jews who were
 born and raised in hebron, or their descendants go back to their homes
 in hebron?  the answer is: absolutely not, because they were almost all
 murdered by their arab neighbors - the "palestinians".
 
 	now, do i think the arabs should be allowed to even visit
 "their" homes in jaffa?  hell, no.  bring back the jews of hebron, petah
 tikva, jerusalem, safed, etc. then, perhaps i would be in favor of arabs
 returning to their jaffa homes.  however, seeing as no arab has yet been
 able to bring people back from the dead, i'd say that's out.
 
 with all the hope in the world,
