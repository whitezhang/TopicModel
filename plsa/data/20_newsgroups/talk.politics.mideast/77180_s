 i do not want to convince anyone. this is just usenet, not the real
 world. i just read the opinions others have about a subject, and sometimes
 i present my opinion. i think that this net is only useful to exchange
 ideas. i never wanted nor i want now to convince anyone of anything.

 first, and i repeat it, i never said that the idea of jews having the
 right to have a state is racist.
 zionism, as a movement, is more than just that idea. i think that zionism
 in the way it defines who is a jew, for example, is racist-like.
 in the same way i believe that irish have a right to nationalism but i do
 not support the bombing and killing of the ira, i believe that jews have
 a right to nationalism but i do not support zionism as it is right now.

 that is what makes the basis for zionist movements. however, i am not 
 considering just that, but the rest of it.

 which makes an interesting point. people living in a jewish state have
 shown that jewish culture includes in it jewish religion but they are
 not the same. so, the jewish people living in the jewish state have shown 
 us that there are some problems in a state where 80% of the people is secular
 but judaism is define according to religious standards, or where marriage
 is a religious stage, or where the law of return defines a jew according to
 a religious standard.
 did those israelis who do not believe in god and will never do become 
 non-jews? why should they still define then a jew based on what is a 
 religious definition?

 according to webster's ninth new collegiate dictionary, merriam-webster inc,
 publishers, springfield, massachusetts, u.s.a., 1986, page 593, 
 
 hy-poc-ri-sy: a feigning to be what one is nnot or to believe one does not.
 
 so, saying that one believes in zionism as a simple matter of people 
 having the right to nationalism, but disregarding the right of the palestinian
 people to do the same, according to this dictionary, is hypocrisy.

 i know what my words mean. i do stand by what i said i believe: zionism is
 a form of racism. of course, i tend to talk about things as they are and
 not as they are defined in a broad sense.
