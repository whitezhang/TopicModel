     this can be turned around.  the austrians who should feel guilty about
  their actions during wwii, but don't, justify their anti-semetism by making
  every israeli action into an atrocity.  the austrians, germans and other
  europeans have extensive trading relations with the arab block; being 
  pro-arab is good for business.  i don't think that ethics has a thing to
  do about it.
