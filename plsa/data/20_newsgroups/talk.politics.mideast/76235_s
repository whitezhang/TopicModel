 [dg] the u.s. holocaust memorial museum: a costly and dangerous mistake
 [dg] by theodore j. o'keefe
 [dg] hard by the washington monument, within clear view of the jefferson
 [dg] memorial, an easy stroll down the mall to the majestic lincoln memorial,
 [dg] has arisen, on some of the most hallowed territory of the united states of
 [dg] america, a costly and dangerous mistake.  on ground where no monument yet
 [dg] marks countless sacrifices and unheralded achievements of americans of all
 [dg] races and creeds in the building and defense of this nation, sits today a
 [dg] massive and costly edifice, devoted above all to a contentious and false
 [dg] version of the ordeal in europe during world war ii, of non-american
 [dg] members of a minority, sectarian group.  now, in the deceptive guise of
 [dg] tolerance, the united states holocaust memorial museum begins a propaganda
 [dg] campaign, financed through the unwitting largess of the american taxpayer,
 [dg] in the interests of israel and its adherents in america.
 
 [jake] after reading the first paragraph, a quick scan confirmed my first
 [jake] impression: this is a bunch of revisionist and anti-semitic hogwash.
 
 jake, i'm really disappointed in you. it took you a whole paragraph
 to see that it was "bunch of revisionist and anti-semitic hogwash". :-)
 
 the article title "the u.s. holocaust memorial museum: a costly and 
 dangerous mistake" should have been enough! :-)
