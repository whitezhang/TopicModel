 ok, you've already disqualified yourself (who ever you are) from
 being objective.

 jews are a people with a common cultural heritage, religion, and history.
 we are not a race.

 you don't see a difference between killing british soldiers (who were
 preventing jews who tried to escape the nazis from entering the
 british mandate) and arab terrorist who kill civilian men, women, and
 children?!?

 that's ridiculuous on atleast two counts.  first of all, even if you identify
 yourself as completely jewish that doesn't rule out the possibility that you're
 a self-hating anti-semite.  one can always find jews who are uncomfortable with
 their identities (since they only want jews to be cowering victims) and are
 willing to speak up for their enemies.  secondly, the strength or weakness of
 your arguments does not depend on your identity.
