 hadashot, 14 march 1993:
 
 the israeli police department announced on the evening of friday,
 march 12 that it is calling upon [jewish] israeli citizens with
 gun permits to carry them at all times "so as to contribute to
 their security and that of their surroundings".
 
 ha'aretz, 15 march 1993:
 
 yehoshua matza (likud), chair of the knesset interior committee,
 stated that he intends to demand that the police department make
 it clear to the public that anyone who wounds or kills
 [non-jewish] terrorists will not be put on trial.
 
 ha'aretz, 16 march1993:
 
 today a private security firm and units from the idf southern
 command will begin installation of four magnetic gates in the gaza
 strip, as an additional stage in the upgrading of security
 measures in the strip.
 
 the gates will aid in the searching of [non-jewish] gaza residents
 as they leave for work in israel. they can be used to reveal the
 presence of knives, axes, weapons and other sharp objects.
 
 in addition to the gates, which will be operated by a private
 civilian company, large quantities of magnetic-card reading
 devices are being brought to the inspection points, to facilitate
 the reading of the magnetic cards these [non-jewish] workers must
 carry.
