 	do you have a problem with the language? i said
 everyone suffered emotionally because they sympathyzed with the
 victims of holocaust. i wasn't implying that anyone suffered
 more than the actual victims. neither was i implying any
 wrongdoing on the part of the jews as the cause for the
 holocaust. what is wrong with you guys? regardless of what one 
 says you keep hearing what you want to hear.
