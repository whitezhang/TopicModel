 	a neutral organization would report on the situation in
 israel, where the elderly and children are the victims of stabbings by
 hamas "activists."  a neutral organization might also report that
 israeli arabs have full civil rights.

 	care to name names, or is this yet another unsubstantiated
 slander?

 	terrorism, as you would know if you had a spine that allowed
 you to stand up, is random attacks on civilians.  terorism includes
 such things as shooting a cripple and thowing him off the side of a
 boat because he happens to be jewish.  not allowing people to go where
 they are likely to be stabbed and killed, like a certain lawyer killed
 last week, is not terorism.
