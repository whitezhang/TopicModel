 you're just beginning to scratch the surface.  do you know how much
 military equipment costs?  when was the last time you tried to buy a
 mil-spec hammer, coffee-pot or toilet seat?

 american soldiers's lives on the line is much, much, much cheaper than
 uncle sam's arrangements with much of the rest of the world.
