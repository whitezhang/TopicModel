 
     april 24th is approaching, and armenians around the world
 are getting ready to remember the massacres of their family members
 by the turkish government between 1915 and 1920.  
     at least 1.5 million armenians perished during that period,
 and it is important to note that those who deny that this event
 ever took place, either supported the policy of 1915 to exterminate
 the armenians, or, as we have painfully witnessed in azerbaijan,
 would like to see it happen again...
     thank you for taking the time to read this post.
