 henrik]  country. turks and azeris consistantly want to drag armenia into the
 henrik]  karabakh conflict with azerbaijan. 
 
 bm] gimme a break.  capital letters, or not, the above is pure nonsense.  it
 bm] seems to me that short sighted armenians are escalating the hostilities
 		     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
      again, armenians in karabakh are simply defending themselves. what do
      want them to do. lay down their arms and let azeris walk all over them.
 
 bm] while hoping that turkey will stay out.  stop and think for a moment,
 bm] will you?  armenia doesn't need anyone to drag her into the conflict, it
 bm] is a part of it.  
 
 armenians knew from the begining that turks were fully engaged 
 training azeris militarily to fight against  karabakhi-armenians.
 	
 henrik] the karabakhi-armenians who have lived in their homeland for 3000 
 henrik] years (cut off from armenia and given to azeris by stalin) are the 
 henrik] ones directly involved in the conflict. they are defending 
 henrik] themselves against azeri aggression. 
 
 bm]  huh?  you didn't expect azeri's to be friendly to forces fighting with them
 bm]  within their borders?  
 
 	well, history is sad. remember, those are relocated azeris into 
         the armenian land of karabakh by the stalin regime.
 
 henrik] at last, i hope that the u.s. insists that turkey stay out of the 
 henrik] karabakh crisis so that the repeat of the cyprus invasion will never 
 henrik] occur again.
 
 bm] you're not playing with a full deck, are you?  where would turkey invade?
 
    it is not up to me to speculate but i am sure turkey would have stepped
    into armenia if she could.
  
 bm] are you throwing the cyprus buzzword around with s.c.g. in the header
 bm] in hopes that the greek netters will jump the gun?  
 
 	absolutely not ! i am merely trying to emphasize that in many
         cases, history repeats itself. 
 
 bm] yes indeed turkey has the military prowess to intervene, what she wishes 
 bm] she had, however, is the diplomatic power to stop the hostilities and bring
 bm] the parties to the negotiating table.  that's hard to do when armenians 
 bm] are attacking azeri towns.
 
 	so, let me understand in plain words what you are saying; turkey
         wants a peaceful end to this conflict. not !!
 
 	i will believe it when i see it.
 
 	now, as far as attacking, what do you do when you see a gun pointing
         to your head ? do you sit there and watch or defend yoursef(fat chance)?
 	do you remember what azeris did to the armenians in baku ? all the
 	barberian acts especially against mothers and their children. i mean
 	burning people alive !
 
 bm] armenian leaders are lacking the statesmanship to recognize the 
 bm] futility of armed conflict and convince their nation that a compromise that 
 bm] leads to stability is much better than a military faits accomplis that's 
 bm] going to cause incessant skirmishes.  
 
 	armenians in karabakh want peace and their own republic. they are 
         not asking much. they simply want to get back what was taken away 
 	from them and given to azeris by stalin. 
 
 bm] think of 10 or 20 years down the line -- both of the newly independent 
 bm] countries need to develop economically and neither one is going to wipe 
 bm] the other out.   these people will be neighbors, would it not be better 
 bm] to keep the bad blood between them minimal?
 
 	don't get me wrong. i also want peaceful solution to the
 	conflict. but until azeris realize that, the armenians in
 	karabakh will defend themselves against aggresion.
 
 bm] if you belong to the armenian diaspora, keep in mind that what strikes
 bm] your fancy on the map is costing the local armenians dearly in terms of 
 bm] their blood and future. 
 
 	again, you are taking different turns. armenia has no intension
         to grab any land from azerbaijan. the armenians in karabakh
         are simply defending themselves until a solution is set.
 
 bm] it's easy to be comfortable abroad and propagandize 
 bm] craziness to have your feelings about turks tickled.  the armenians
 bm] in armenia and n-k will be there, with the same people you seem to hate 
 bm] as their neighbors, for maybe 3000 years more.  the sooner there's peace in
 bm] the region the better it is for them and everyone else.  i'd push for
 bm] compromise if i were you instead of hitting the caps-lock and spreading
 bm] inflammatory half-truths.
 
 	it is not up to me to decide the peace initiative. i am absolutely
         for it. but, in the meantime, if you do not take care of yourself,
         you will be wiped out. such as the case in the era of 1915-20 of
 	the armenian massacres.
