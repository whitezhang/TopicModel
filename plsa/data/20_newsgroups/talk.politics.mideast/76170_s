 
 i don't know anything about this particular case, but *other*
 governments have been known to follow events on the usenet.  for
 example after tienanmien square in beijing the chinese government
 began monitoring cyberspace.  as the former director of peacenet,
 i am aware of many incidents of local, state, national and
 international authorities monitoring usenet and other conferences
 such as those on the institute for global communications.  but
 what's the big deal?  you shouldn't advocate illegal acts in this
 medium in any case.  if you are concerned about being monitored,
 you should use encyrption software (available in igc's "micro"
 conference).  i know for a fact that human rights activists in the
 balkan-mideast area use encryption software to send out their
 reports to international organizations.  such message *can* be
 decoded however by large computers consuming much cpu time, which
 probably the turkish government doesn't have access to.
