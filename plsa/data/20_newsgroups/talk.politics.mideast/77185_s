 i'll leave questions 1 and 2 to be answered elsewhere, but on question 3)
 something in the noos today might be an example of the restoration might be.
 namely, that the clinton administration is considering asking the un to 
 establish a police force for haiti.
 
 i didn't hear any thing that said that the current govt. of haiti asked for it,
 nor is there any real precedent (barring somalia) for the un getting involved
 in internal conflicts.
 
 that might also answer question 2). the neo-colonial countries are a diffuse
 lot - the un (security council).
 
 and while i am at it, i'll take a stab at 1) - the new colonialism, as defined in
 most articles i have read, would entail something of the nature of trusteeship
 under the un sec. council, democracy, aid, education, free-markets, free press
 and then out for the colonialists, now assured that there is a "civilized" 
 country that they have left behind.
 
 note i don't support this idealized concept, simply because i think it is a
 lot of hogwash.

 if the university of illinois shares these views, i'd be surprised.
 they aren't that smart generally -:).
