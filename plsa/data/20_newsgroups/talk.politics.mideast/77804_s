 what is so honorable about placing bombs in passenger airliners,
 promising to execute rushdie, killing 1-2 million people in the
 iran/iraq war, murdering tourists and persecuting ethinc christians in
 egypt, massacring christians in sudan, harassing christians in and 
 barring jews from saudi arabia?  how are paranoid muslims "righteous
 in defending themsselves" in these situations?  who are they even
 afraid of?
