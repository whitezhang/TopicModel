 "muslim" in ex-yugoslavia was a *nation* not a religion.  in fact, not
 all muslims in b-h are followers of islam.  therefore, there do (did?)
 exist in ex-yugoslavia "christian muslims."  tito defined the muslim 
 nation constitutionally, adding muslims to serbs, croats, and slovenes,
 the three founding nations which entered into a voluntary union at the
 end of wwi.  in addition, tito added two other nations constitutionally:
 montenegrins, and makedonijans. 
 
 nations had the right of secession, but republics did not.  so, "muslim"
 is much more a political term than a religious term (for those who 
 differentiate between religion and politics, that is) in b-h.  it was not 
 a "christo-slavic" ideology that made a muslim nation in yugoslavia, it
 was the "atheist communist" ideology of tito.  before tito, there was
 no muslim nation in yugoslavia.  
 
 the war is not a religious war, and it is not an ethnic war.  it is a
 civil war in which the terms of secession are being negotiated with guns
 instead of pens.  the croat, muslim, and serb political leaders *all*
 chose to fight over the terms of secession instead of compromising and
 peacefully negotiating multilateral secession agreements.
