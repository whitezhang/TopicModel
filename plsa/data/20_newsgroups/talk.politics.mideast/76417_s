 yesterday, i watched an outstanding documentary on pbs prepared for frontline
 by the documentary consortia.  it is called "memory of the camps" and shows some
 "un-censored" pictures taken immediately after the liberation of bergen-belsen
 and other death camps.
   
 i recommend it to everybody.  check with your pbs station for re-broadcast.
 it is a must see documentary.  
    
 in the seatle, vancouver area ksts-9 will re-broadcast the documentary
 on monday 01:30 am.
 you can also order a copy from pbs video 1-800-3287271.  the cost is $59.95.
