 i flipped on my local cable access channel (a channel where any
 community member can broadcast whatever they want for about $50
 per half hour) and saw a "documentary" (i use this term loosely)
 on the conflict in the west bank.
 
 it was apparently made with a hand held camcorder (the quality was
 terrible, and the camera was really jumpy).  the documentary (sic)
 told the tales of all of the children who died in the "war" against
 the jews as martyrs.  
 
 it was a regular sob story.  one "victimized youth" was recounting
 on how all he "really" wants to do is to get an education and that
 the big bad jews won't let him go to high school.  he admittedly 
 spent 4 years in prison (age 13 to 17) for murdering a jewish woman
 but claims that it was "for the cause."
 
 i have seen this kind of garbage before.  i have a lot of sympathy for
 the palestinian cause (as do many jews), but i think that even many
 arabs would be ashamed to call this a documentary!
 
 the most suprising part is that the only credits shown at the end
 was an address for the makers of the film named jewish comm. on
 the middle east.
 
 anybody heard of them?  they make peace now look like right-wingers.
