 timbo, israel has not been recognized as a state by the arabs, except for
 egypt, of course.  isn't that  a gesture?  what has israel offered?
 well, it has been calling for peace talks for 45 years, asked for
 economic relations, and asked for diplomatic ties.  what else is there?
 would you have israel sacrifice its security?  nay, i think not.
 
 peace,
 pete
