 i recently read that during bill clinton's campaign, he stated
 that if elected he would immediately recognize jerusalem as
 israel's capital.  according to the article, mr. clinton
 reaffirmed this after winning the presidency.  however,
 during recent talks with president mubarak, secretary of
 state christopher stated that "the status of jerusalem
 will be a final matter of discussion between the parties".
 
 now i don't want to start a big discussion over the status
 of jerusalem.  all i want to know is if anyone can 
 authenticate mr. clinton's statements with dates, places, etc.
 
 thank you.
 
 ben.
