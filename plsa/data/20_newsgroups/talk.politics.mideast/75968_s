 it's hard to beat a car-bomb with a suicidal driver in getting 
 right up to the target before blowing up.  even booby-traps and
 radio-controlled bombs under cars are pretty efficient killers.  
 you have a point.

 had israeli methods been anything like this, then iraq wouldn've been
 nuked long ago, entire arab towns deported and executions performed by
 the tens of thousands.  the fact is, though, that israeli methods
 aren't even 1/10,000th as evil as those which are common and everyday
 in arab states.

 "israeli soil"????  brad/ali!  just wait until the ayatollah's
 thought-police get wind of this.  it's all "holy muslim soil (tm)".
 have you forgotten?  may allah have mercy on you now.
