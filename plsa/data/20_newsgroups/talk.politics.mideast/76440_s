 i hope, i hope, that we can begin to involve ourselves in the issues
 and concerns related to this peace process. we have differing opinions,
 certainly, on these aspects but it is clear that we all share the hope
 that "resolution" of the tensions and conflict **will** happen.
 
 as we "run to the defense" of our side, there is no need to constantly 
 involve ourselves in name-calling. all of us are regularly confused by
 the "other's" reactive posting because "they" spend most of the post
 applying "labels" and presenting slogans than in just presenting their
 honest views. then...when we "react", we do the same thing.

 do you, as i do, agree that this (sort) of "peace process" is needed?
 what about the particular points mentioned in the article? is what
 israel is (supposedly) going to propose "good"? does it go too far?
 not far enough?
 
 if you don't agree that a "peace process" is needed, what is?
