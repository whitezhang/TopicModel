 right now, i'm just going to address this point.
 when the jewish national fund bought most of its land,
 it didn't buy it from the palestinians themselves, because,
 for the most part, they were tenant farmers (fallahin),
 living on land owned by wealthy arabs in syria and lebanon.
 the jnf offered a premium deal, so the owners took advantage of
 it.   it's called commerce.  the owners, however, made no 
 provisions for those who had worked for them, basically shafting 
 them by selling the land right out from under them.
 they are to blame, not the jews.
