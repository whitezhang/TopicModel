 actually, this is incorrect.  french resistance may have played some
 part in hindering the german war effort, however the crucial role was
 supplied on d-day.

 interesting statement.  especially when you consider that lebanon
 had claimed to have made progress in the peace talks, as well as
 israel.  of course, one of the prime obstacles to israel's complete
 withdrawal is the lack of governmental control that can be applied
 to the area as well as the large presence of syrian forces which
 have not been asked to withdraw as well.
