 i'm not sure about this but i hope the answer is that you can't apply under
 the law of return.  by conversion, you've elected not to be a part of the
 jewish nation.

 at the moment you converted, you officially anounced to the world that *you* do not
 consider yourself to be part of the jewish nation.  so, why should the jewish nation
 consider you to be a member?

 no.  as a result of wars brought by the arabs against the jews in an attempt to
 annihilate israel, the arabs have lost their claim to land there.  attacking israel
 is/was illegal and they now have to pay the price.  do i feel sorry for the
 palestinians?  yes i do.  but i blame the arab nations for their problems, not
 israel.
