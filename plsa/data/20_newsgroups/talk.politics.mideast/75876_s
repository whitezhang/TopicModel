 it is very encouraging that a number of people took so interest in my posting.i recieved a couple of letters too,some has debated the statement that events in bosnia are unprecedented in the history of the modern world.those who contest this statement present the figures of the world war ii.however we must keep in mind that it was a world war and no country had the power to stop it,today is the matter not of the power but of the will.it
 seems to be that what we lack is the will.
 second point of difference (which makes it different from the holocast(sp?) ) is that at that time international community
 didnot have enough muscle to prevent the unfortunate event,
 today inspite of all the might,the international community is not just standing neutral but has placed an arms embargo which
 is to the obvious disadvantage of the weeker side and therefore to the advantage of the bully.hence indirecltly and possibly
 unintentionally, mankind has sided with the killers.and this,i think is unprecedented in the history of the modern world.
