 so, it's okay to use civilians for cover if you're attacking soldiers
 in your country.  (of course, many of those attacking claim that they
 aren't lebanese, so it's not their country.)
 
 got it.  i think.  hmm.  this is confusing.
 
 could you perhaps repeat your rules explaining exactly when it is
 permissible to use civilians as shields?  also please explain under
 what conditions it is permissible for soldiers to defend themselves.
 also please explain the particular rules that make it okay for
 terrorists to launch missiles from lebanon against israeli civilians,
 but not okay for the israelis to try to defend themselves against
 those missiles.
