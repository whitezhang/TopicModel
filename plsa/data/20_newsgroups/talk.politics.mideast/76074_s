 the winding down of winter puts you in a heavy 'arromdian' mood? i'll 
 see if i can get our dear "mehmetcik" to write you a letter giving
 you and your criminal handlers at the asala/sdpa/arf terrorism and
 revisionism triangle some military pointers, like how to shoot armed
 adult males instead of small muslim children and pregnant women.

 massacre uncovered....
 
 by anatol lieven,
 
 more than sixty bodies, including those of women and children, have 
 been spotted on hillsides in nagorno-karabakh, confirming claims 
 that armenian troops massacred azeri refugees. hundreds are missing.
 
 scattered amid the withered grass and bushes along a small valley 
 and across the hillside beyond are the bodies of last wednesday's 
 massacre by armenian forces of azerbaijani refugees.
 
 from that hill can be seen both the armenian-controlled town of 
 askeran and the outskirts of the azerbaijani military headquarters 
 of agdam. those who died very nearly made it to the safety of their 
 own lines.
 
 we landed at this spot by helicopter yesterday afternoon as the last 
 troops of the commonwealth of independent states began pulling out. 
 they left unhindered by the warring factions as general boris gromov, 
 who oversaw the soviet withdrawal from afghanistan, flew to stepanakert 
 to ease their departure.
 
 a local truce was enforced to allow the azerbaijaines to collect their 
 dead and any refugees still hiding in the hills and forest. all the 
 same, two attack helicopters circled continuously the nearby armenian 
 positions.
 
 in all, 31 bodies could be counted at the scene. at least another 
 31 have been taken into agdam over the past five days. these figures 
 do not include civilians reported killed when the armenians stormed 
 the azerbaijani town of khodjaly on tuesday night. the figures also 
 do not include other as yet undiscovered bodies
 
 zahid jabarov, a survivor of the massacre, said he saw up to 200 
 people shot down at the point we visited, and refugees who came 
 by different routes have also told of being shot at repeatedly and 
 of leaving a trail of bodies along their path. around the bodies 
 we saw were scattered possessions, clothing and personnel documents. 
 the bodies themselves have been preserved by the bitter cold which
 killed others as they hid in the hills and forest after the massacre. 
 all are the bodies of ordinary people, dressed in the poor, ugly 
 clothing of workers.
 
 of the 31 we saw, only one policeman and two apparent national 
 volunteers were wearing uniform. all the rest were civilians, 
 including eight women and three small children. two groups, 
 apparently families, had fallen together, the children cradled 
 in the women's arms.
 
 several of them, including one small girl, had terrible head 
 injuries: only her face was left. survivors have told how they 
 saw armenians shooting them point blank as they lay on the ground.
