 not exactly the same, but reminiscent of the assassination of count
 bernadotte, who was _the_ un negotiator during the 1948 israeli war of
 independence.  he was killed by the israelis.  seems he was being too
 successful in negotiating a cease-fire, which would have worked
 territorially against the nascent israel, compared to continued war.
