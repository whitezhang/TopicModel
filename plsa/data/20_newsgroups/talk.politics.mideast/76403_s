 	   now i have a comment concerning israeli terrorism
    during the 1930's and 1940's.  the hirgun, and other branch -
    off militant groups, did fight the british do get them out of
    palestine.  yet i fail to see how this israeli form of
    terrorism was better than the terrorism practiced now by the
    arabs.  these jewish terrorist groups killed innocent british
    soldiers, but not only thta also killed many jews who were in
    favor of a compromise with the palestinians.
 
 the irgun killed soldiers,  which is a legitimate way to drive an unwanted
 fogriend regime from a country.  they didn't kill blindly their families or
 such (not as a policy,  i agree that brits which were not soldiers also were
 killed sometimes) nor they killed arabs just for being arabs.
 
 in case i have to remind you the difference,  the majority of the attacks of
 the arab terrorist organizations was on civilians.  they even tried to
 justify their attacks by saying that all jews in the israel served in the army
 at one point in time or another and therefore are legitimate targets.
 
    in addition, they
    massacred an entire palestinian village in 1948, contributing
    to the exodus of the frightened palestinians who feared their
    very lives.
 
 yes, these exceptions were tragic mistakes.  i wasn't there and don't have
 reffereces handy but from what i heard your description is a bit carried away,
 most of the vilagers fled with several dozens,  most of them claimed to be
 fighters being killed.
 
 those "massaceres" are far from being the rule considering that dozens if not
 hounders of arab vilages came under israeli rule during the same time period.
 
 	   i mention this not because i'm anti semitic [i'm part
    jewish] but because this self righteousness on the part of the
    israelites pisses me off so.  i'm not as critical of the
    palestinians because they were indeed screwed over by the
    jews.  it 's a damn shame that the palestinians had to pay for
    german and european anti semitism.
 
 what do you mean "screwed over by the jews"?  they began the '47 war and
 didn't accept the arrgenment planned by the u.n.,  what did you expect the
 jews to do??

                              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 
 arabs are also semites.
