 is this group for real? i honestly can't believe that most of you expect you
 or your concerns to be taken remotely seriously if you behave this way in a
 forum for discussion. doesn't it ever occur to those of you who write letters
 like the majority of those in this group that you're being mind-bogglingly
 hypocritical?
