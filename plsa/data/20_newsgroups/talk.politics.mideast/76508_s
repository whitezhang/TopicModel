 it is more appropriate to address netters with their names as they appear in
 their signatures (i failed to do so since you did not bother to sign your
 posting). not only because it is the polite thing to do, but also to avoid
 addressing ladies with "mr.", as you have done.
 
 secondly, the island of which the name is more correctly spelled as cyprus has
 never been greek, but rather, it has been home to a bi-communal society formed
 of greeks and turks. it seems that you know as little about the history and
 the demography of the island, as you know about the essence of turkey's 
 military intervention to it under international agreements.
 
 be that as it may, an analogy between an act of occupation in history and what
 is going on today on azerbaijani land, can only be drawn with the expansionist
 policy that armenia is now pursuing.
 
 but, i could agree that it is not for us to issue diagnoses to the political
 conduct of countries, and promulgate them in such terminology as
 "itchy-bitchy"...
