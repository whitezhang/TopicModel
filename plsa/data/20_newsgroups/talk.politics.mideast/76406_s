 look up the facts first, post second.  bernadotte was assassinated
 in september 1948 by lehi under the orders of its three commanders
 (one of whom was yitzhak shamir).  there is no hard evidence of
 complicity of the israeli government despite some effort by the un
 and other organizations (us intelligence, swedish government) to
 find it.  however a great fuss was made over the apparent lack of
 zeal of the israeli government to track down the killers.  the lehi
 man who actually pulled the trigger later became a personal friend
 of david ben-gurion.  the best published account in english is a. ilan, 
 bernadotte in palestine, 1948 (macmillan, 1989).
