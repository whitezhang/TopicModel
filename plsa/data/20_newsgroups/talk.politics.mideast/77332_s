 never mind the fact that these people were denied the right to a fair trial.  
 and israel was supposed to uphold "western values", eh?

 check your facts before bashing islam again. while there may be muslim  
 anti-semites, this is no way a tenet of the religion. saying anti-semitism is  
 "basic" to islam is implicating the entire muslim world, based on a selective  
 sampling of a few people, and it flies in the face of what islam teaches.
 
 peace.
