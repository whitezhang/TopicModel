 elias' initial statement certain *is* hot air. but it seems to be
 almost standard procedure around here to first throw out an absurb,
 overstated image in order to add extra "meaning" to the posting's
 *real point*. 
 
 however, his second statement *is* quite real. the essential sealing off
 of gaza residents from the possibility of making a living *has happened*.
 certainly, the israeli had a legitimate worry behind the action they took,
 but isn't that action a little draconian?
