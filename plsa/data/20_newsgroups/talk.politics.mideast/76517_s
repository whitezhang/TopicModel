 henrik] let me clearify mr. turkish;
 henrik] armenia is not getting "itchy". she is simply letting the world know 
 henrik] that she will no  longer sit there quiet and let turks get away with 
 henrik] their famous tricks. armenians do remember of the turkish invasion 
 henrik] of the greek island of cypress while the world simply watched. 
 
 onur yalcin] it is more appropriate to address netters with their names as 
 onur yalcin] they appear in their signatures (i failed to do so since you did 
 onur yalcin] not bother to sign your posting). not only because it is the 
 onur yalcin] polite thing to do, but also to avoid addressing ladies with 
 onur yalcin] "mr.", as you have done.
 
 	fine. please, accept my opology !
 
 onur yalcin] secondly, the island of which the name is more correctly spelled 
 onur yalcin] as cyprus has never been greek, but rather, it has been home to 
 onur yalcin] a bi-communal society formed of greeks and turks. it seems that 
                ^^^^^^^^^^^
 onur yalcin] you know as little about the history and the demography of the 
 onur yalcin] island, as you know about the essence of turkey's 
 onur yalcin] military intervention to it under international agreements.
 
 	bi-communal society ? then why did not greece invade cyprus ? 
 	
 onur yalcin] be that as it may, an analogy between an act of occupation in 
 onur yalcin] history and what is going on today on azerbaijani land, can only 
 onur yalcin] be drawn with the expansionist policy that armenia is now pursuing.
 
 	buch of crap and you know it. nagarno-karabagh has always been part 
         of armenia and it was stalin who gave it to the azeris. go back and
         review the history.  
 
 	the armenians in nagarno-karabagh are simply defending their rights
         to keep their homeland and it is the azeris that are invading their 
         teritory.
 
 onur yalcin] but, i could agree that it is not for us to issue diagnoses to 
 onur yalcin] the political conduct of countries, and promulgate them in such 
 onur yalcin] terminology as "itchy-bitchy"... 
 
        i was not the one that stated it. 
 	
        however, i hope that the armenians will force a turkish airplane 
        to land for purposes of searching for arms similar to the one
        that happened last summer. turkey searched an american plane
        (carrying humanitarian aid) bound to armenia.
