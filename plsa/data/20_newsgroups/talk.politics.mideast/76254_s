 	in fact, if a speach was not offensive to some, its
 protection under freedom of speach laws would be useless. it is
 speach that some find questionable that must be protected, be
 it religiously blasphemous or inherently racist. it is only
 through civilized discourse and not scare tactics that one can
 enlighten those that one perceives to be ignorant. that is the
 idea behind freedom of expression.
 	what you find offensive might be perceived as truth by
 some and what they might find offensive might be your belief.
 it is only through free exchange of ideas (and insults as the
 case seems to be with this channel) that one can change
 another's erring ways.that is why jefferson said that here 
 we are not afraid to "tolerate error so long as reason is left to 
 combat it".
