 "assuming"? also: come on, brad. if we are going to get anywhere in 
 this (or any) discussion, it doesn't help to bring up elements i never 
 addressed, *nor commented on in any way*. i made no comment on who is 
 "right" or who is "wrong", only that civilians are being used as cover 
 and that, having been placed "in between" the israelis and the guerillas,
 they *will* be injured as both parties continue their fight.
  
 	[the *purpose* of an army's use of military uniforms 
 	is *to set its members apart* from the civilians so that 
 	civilians will not be thought of by the other side as
 	"combatants". so, what do you think is the "meaning behind", 
 	the intention and the effect when an "army" purposely 
 	*does not were uniforms but goes out of its way to *look 
 	like civilians'? *they are judging that the benefit they will 
 	receive from this "cover" is more important that the harm
 	that will come to civilians.*
 
 this is a comment on the israeli experience and is saying
 that the guerillas *do* have some responsibility in putting civilians
 in "the middle" of this fight. by putting on uniforms and living apart
 from civilians (barracks, etc.), the guerillas would significantly lower
 the risk to civilians.
 
 	but if the guerillas do this aren't *they* putting themselves
 	at greater risk? absolutely, they ask themselves "why set 
 	ourselves apart (by wearing uniforms) when there is a ready-made 
 	cover for us (civilians)? that makes sense from their point of 
 	view, but when this cover is used, the guerillas should accept 
 	some of the responsibility for subsequent harm to civilians.

 i agree with you here. i have always thought that israel's bombing
 sortees and bombing policy is stupid, thoughtless, inhumane and
 ineffective. but, there is no reason that israel should passive wait 
 until attackers chose to act; there is every reason to believe that
 "taking the fight *to* the enemy" will do more to stop attacks. 
 
 as i said previously, israel spent several decades "sitting passively"
 on its side of a border and only acting to stop these attacks *after*
 the attackers had entered israeli territory. it didn't work very well.
 the "host" arab state did little/nothing to try and stop these attacks 
 from its side of the border with israel so the number of attacks
 were considerably higher, as was their physical and psychological impact 
 on the civilians caught in their path.

 this is just another "selectively applied" statement.
  
 the reason for this drawn-out impasse between ababs/palestinians and israelis
 is that neither side is willing to accept the word of the other. by your
 criteria *everyone* should stay away from the negotiations.
 
 that is precisely why the palestinians (in their recent pisga proposal for 
 the "interim" period after negotiations and leading up to full autonomy) are
 demanding conditions that essentially define "autonomy" already. they do
 not trust that israel will "follow through" the entire process and allow
 palestinians to reach full autonomy. 
 
 do you understand and accept this viewpoint by the palestinians? 
 if you do, then why should israel's view of arabs/palestinians 
 be any different? why should they trust the arab/palestinians' words?
 since they don't, they are very reluctant to give up "tangible assets 
 (land, control of areas) in exchange for "words". for this reason,
 they are also concerned about the sorts of "guarantees" they will have 
 that the arabs will follow through on their part of any agreement reached.

 absolutely, so are the arabs/palestinians asking first for the
 israelis "word" in relation to any agreement? no, what is being
 demanded first is land. when the issue is land, and one party
 finally gets hold of this "land", what the "other party" does
 is totally irrelevent. if i now have possession of this land,
 your words have absolutely no power; whether israel chooses to
 keeps its word does not get the land back.

 while the "major armaments" (those allowing people to wage "civil wars")
 have been removed, the weapons needed to cross-border attacks still
 remain to some extent. rocket attacks still continue, and "commando"
 raids only require a few easily concealed weapons and a refined disregard
 for human life (yours of that of others). such attacks also continue.

 bat guano. the situation you call for existed in the 1970s and attacks
 were commonplace.
 
 >furthermore, with hezbollah subsequently disarmed, it would not be possible.
 
 there is no way these groups can be effectively "disarmed" unless the state
 is as authoritarian is syria's. the only other way is for lebanon to take
 it upon itself to constantly patrol the entire border with israel, essentially
 mirroring israel's border secirity on its side. it has to prove to isreal that
 it is this committed to protecting israel from attack from lebanese territory.

 that's what i said, ok? but, doesn't that mean that syria has to "take over"
 lebanon? i don't think israel or lebanon would like that.

 what both "sides" need is to receive something "tangible". the arabs/
 palestinians are looking for "land" and demanding that they receive it
 prior to giving anything to israel. israel has two problems: 1) if it
 gives up real *land* it is exposing itself to a changed geostrategic
 situation (and that change doesn't help israel's position), and 2) when
 it gives up this land it needs to receive something in return to
 compensate for the increased risks
