 actually, this strife in yugoslavia goes back a long way. bosinan muslims,
 in collaboration with the nazis, did to serbians after the first world
 war what serbs are doing to muslims now. this is not a fresh case of
 ethnic cleansing but just another chapter in the continuing saga
 of intense mutual hatred, destruction,... not taking sides in this
 perpetual war does not amount to religious bigotry. it could just
 be helplessness with regards to bringing peace to a region that does
 not even know the meaning of the word.
