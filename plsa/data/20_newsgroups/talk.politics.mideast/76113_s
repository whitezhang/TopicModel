 while one may question the motives of the arabs who sold land to jews,
 often while publicly criticizing the sale of land to jews, it was the
 jews and not the arabs who were taken advantage of, as the prices the
 jews paid for barren land was many times the price fertile land was
 being sold for in the united states at the same time.
