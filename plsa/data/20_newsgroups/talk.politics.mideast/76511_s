 if the attack was justified or not is at least debatable. but this is not the
 issue. the issue is that you were cheering death. read again your original
 article. you find israeli government responsible for those dead soldiers, that's
 a reasonable (debatable) point, but feel satisfaction from dead bodies is 
 not reasonable  by any standards. no matter how you try to justify it.
 i may understand your frustration against israeli occupation in s lebanon.
 but no matter what you say, i can not understand your satisfaction for dead
 bodies.
 
 i have a question for you. let's assume a bosnian village, inhabited by serbs
 untill a few (10-20) years ago, and later taken over by bosnian muslims (the means
 are not very peaceful). now, do you enjoy serbs coming and killing all (armed)
 bosnian muslims ? i would not enjoy, but i would not enjoy any dead bodies - 
 israelis, lebanese or bosnians.
