 	ok, as far as that goes i agree.  the situatio in e. timor does deserve
 the attention that bosnia, angola, etc. get.  but...i also think that the
 "press" can't be forced to print articles, air shows about it, etc.
 	the religious right got tired of the mainstream media and started
 buying their own stations/papers.  the left should do the same thing instead of
 relying on npr and public stations.

 	i wouldn't venture that far (to say the situation in e. timor is
 genocide).  the indonesians seem perfectly willing to not kill anyone who
 doesn't get in their way: which is something the khmer rouge didn't do. 
 virtually everyone not in the khmer rouge suffered the "killing fields".
 	(once again, not to downplay the violence in timor....)

 	i don't agree.  right now australia is the most effective lever against
 indonesia.  they are negotiating for oil drilling rights off timor, and
 stopping that process would go a long way towards making indonesia realize that
 people don't want to see the situation swept under the rug.
