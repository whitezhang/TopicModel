 the american people didn't have any problem with it too (clinton). actually i
 think that it does not make any difference as long as they have the
 qualifications to become leaders. btw in my political view i hope  (and should be 
 the arab hope too) that binyamin netanyahu will not be ellected as prime minister 
 of israel.
