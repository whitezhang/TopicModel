 the borders of the jewish state as drawn by the u.n. included the areas which
 contained mostly jews,  that's what the surveys and the numerous commitees
 where after when they visited here.

 i never touched an arab during my army service and never voted for anyone more
 right than the green party.  will i be spared by these "humanist standards"?
 (or will anyone stop to consider this before sloughtering me?)
 
 i doubt it.  and not only because of the past record of murdering helpless
 women and children since the turn of the century up to these days.
