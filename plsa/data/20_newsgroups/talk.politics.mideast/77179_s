 when i was in jerusalem a couple of years ago, our guide told
 us the story of that mosque - not sure if it was true.
 
 apparently, it was built by a jewish convert to islam.  he had
 had a dispute with his neighbours, and built the mosque "davka" to
 annoy them.  it's a cute story, but not sure if it's true...
