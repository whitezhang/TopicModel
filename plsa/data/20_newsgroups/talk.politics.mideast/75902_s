 making stupid and idiot jokes about soliders will not bring anything (not
 mentioning peace or agreement). i also know several tens of jokes about arabs
 (palestinians) but i do not post them to usenet (anyway,not to this newsgroup),
 since i don't think i will achieve any target but making other parts furious,and
 this is not my target.
 if this is your target...well...that tells a lot about you.

 yeah,well,sometimes,when cowards put their children and wives in the front line,
 so their enemy cannot do anything,well,maybe in those cases,you have no better
 thing to do (to save your life) than shooting. and if parents want their
 children alive,i think it would be better that before they get out to throw
 stones/molotov botlles,or when they come to kill soliders,to keep their children
 in the houses.

 yeah,sure.the truck driver looked in the car with his zionist equipment of
 detecting palestinian children,and then he thought to himself:hey there is a
 5 year  and 2 weeks girls in the car.why won't i make an accident and kill
 the "enemy"? maximum i will die too in the crash...but what do i care?...

 well,it was about 3 years ago ,in the intifada (the fact that  you can't
 remember the time prooves how much do you care about it). i do not think
 that what the soliders did was correct. but i will not agree that they "were
 breaking their arms".i saw that film,and,unlike in the usa,it was broadcasted
 entirely not long ago (in a talk show) and at the end the "arm-broken" guys got
 up and walked and used their arms very good. they guy who did it was interviewed
 and he said he did it because the terrorist or whatever he was refused to take
 his orders,and spitted in his face. what ammount of truth exist in this
 statement i cannot tell you,because i wasn't there. but the guy who did it was
 in prison,if it makes you any good.

 no,it didn't. the israeli army is still the most important army in the midlle
 east.it is still the only human army(as much as an army can be human).to any
 american who will claim the opposite,i can only remember the cnn broadcasting
 of the american solider who beat a somalian boy. it was very cruel to see.but
 i won't say because of this that the american army is cruel.

 some kind of proof! "obvious"? where from? if you say it is behind the scenes,
 how do you know about it?

 i just wanted to show how much garbadge one can say,without knowing anything
 about what he says,and living a life far away from the place he talks about.
