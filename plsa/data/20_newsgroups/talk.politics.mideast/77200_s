 thanks for posting the references. i do not normally read t.p.m.,
 and i posted my request for references because jim's article
 was cross-posted to soc.culture.jewish. allegations of jewish
 disrespect for the objects and buildings of other religions are
 one of antisemitic stereotypes that permeate western culture, and
 rumors of church and host desacration probably caused more pogroms
 than blood libel. the stereotypes that pervade our culture create
 cognitive illusions that reify those stereotypes. therefore any
 claim that appears to reify a stereotype should be treated by
 decent people with utmost suspicion until and unless documented.
 if such a claim is cross-posted to a news group in which it has
 not been documented before, such as s.c.j, a reference should be
 given the first time it appears.  now that the claim has been
 documented, i regard the whole episode as disgusting and
 shameful. especially so because the official who failed to
 provide proper temporary facilities for the evicted jordanians
 was probably jewish, and as a jew i know that he should have
 known better.
