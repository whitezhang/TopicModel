 just to address this one point, what about the two katyusha rocket 
 attacks made within lebanon, for which fatah claimed responsibility.
 i didn't realize that one can use katyushas while onr is disarmed.
 also, page 8 of today's new york times, faisal saleh, a high ranking 
 fatah official, and his 9 month old son were gunned down in beirut 
 by members of abu nidal.  there have been 46 assasination attempts 
 in 1993 alone in the fued between these two factions, resulting in
 11 deaths.
