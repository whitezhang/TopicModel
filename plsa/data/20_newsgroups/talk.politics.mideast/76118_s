 i agree -- he looked and sounded very western.
 i did not quite follow one thing that he said.  he referred to a
 ten mile stretch that would remain of israel if the "occupied"
 territories were given away.  is that really true, i mean are the
 territories that significant in area or did i get lost in the discussion?
 could someone enlighten me on this?

 rasheed.
