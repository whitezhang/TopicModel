 	no one is forced to blow up airplanes.  terrorism is a choice
 made by people because they do not want to work for peace.

 	there are *lots* of military targets in israel.  there are
 lots of legitamate targets in israel.  old ladies, children, and
 civilians in general are not acceptable targets.
 
 	if the only person you can kill is a civilian, you hold your
 fire.  if that means you can't kill anyone, then you can't kill
 anyone.  claiming that civilain targets are acceptable because they
 are easy kills is rediculous.

 	did they make a policy of it?

 	did you mean excuse? :)  killing a soldier and killing a
 civilian are two very different acts.

 	no, they killed soldiers so that the british government would
 leave.  the objective was not to scare civilains, but show that the cost
 of staying was way too high.  
 
 	in contrast, a terrorist kills civilains to scare other
 civilains.  they use random violence against people to make a point
 that no one is safe until their demands are met.  an analogy would be
 the irgun blowing up harrods or 10 downing.
 
 >  sounds like a form of terrorism to me, and not much removed from

 	thats because you missed the essential point of arab
 terrorism, which is to scare civilains away from israel, by killing
 those who have something to do with israel.  it is to kill jews
 because they might be zionists.  it is to kill people who live in
 israel because of where they live.  the targets are rarely soldiers,
 or other people who understand they might be attacked in the line of
 duty, but innocent civilians, to underscore the message that no one
 who deals with israel is safe.

 	oh, you mean you favor the israelis, outnumbered 2 to 1,
 outgunned, surrounded by hostile states only one of which has signed a
 peace treaty in 45 years?  you favor the jews, people like leon
 klofhinger, a cripple who was thrown off a boat because he was jewish?
 you support the right of the jewish people to live in peace?
 
 	why, thank you for your support.
