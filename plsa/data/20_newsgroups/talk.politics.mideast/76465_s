 ofranko. coming from a self-exposed historical revisionist, a 
 self-admitted anti-muslim and a genocide apologist, hamaza should 
 take your drivel as a compliment. furthermore, you even deny the 
 obvious. there was a genocide of the muslims carried out by order of 
 the fascist x-soviet armenian government. massacres of muslims must be 
 studied in detail, because they are the first modern example of the 
 horrible crime of genocide. blame must be apportioned to the armenians
 and their supporters for the murder of muslims. the turkish historic 
 homeland, emptied of its native population until today, remains occupied 
 by the x-soviet armenian government. today, x-soviet armenia covers up 
 the genocide perpetrated by its predecessors and is therefore an accessory 
 to this crime against humanity. x-soviet armenia must pay for its crime 
 of genocide against the muslims by admitting to the crime and making 
 reparations to the turks and kurds.
 
 the following are the jewish and armenian sources on the cold-blooded
 genocide perpetrated by the x-soviet armenian government against 2.5
 million muslim people between 1914 and 1920. still denying the obvious?

 armies in 1914, "history of the ottoman empire and modern turkey (volume

 "in april 1915 dashnaks from russian armenia organized a revolt in the city 
  of van, whose 33,789 armenians comprised 42.3 percent of the population, 
  closest to an armenian majority of any city in the empire...leaving erivan 
  on april 28, 1915, armenian volunteers reached van on may 14 and organized 
  and carried out a general slaughter of the local muslim population during 
  the next two days."
 
 "knowing their numbers would never justify their territorial ambitions,
  armenians looked to russia and europe for the fulfillment of their aims.
  armenian treachery in this regard culminated at the beginning of the first
  world war with the decision of the revolutionary organizations to refuse
  to serve their state, the ottoman empire, and to assist instead other
  invading russian armies. their hope was their participation in the russian
  success would be rewarded with an independent armenian state carved out of
  ottoman territories. armenian political leaders, army officers, and common
  soldiers began deserting in droves."
 
 "with the russian invasion of eastern anatolia in 1914 at the beginning of
  world war i, the degree of armenian collaboration with the ottoman's enemy
  increased drastically. ottoman supply lines were cut by guerilla attacks,
  armenian revolutionaries armed armenian civil populations, who in turn
  massacred the muslim population of the province of van in anticipation of
  expected arrival of the invading russian armies."

 "...meanwhile, czar nicholas ii himself came to the caucasus to make final
  plans for cooperation with the armenians against the ottomans, with the 
  president of the armenian national bureau in tiflis declaring in response:
 
  'from all countries armenians are hurrying to enter the ranks of the 
   glorious russian army, with their blood to serve the victory of russian
   arms...let the russian flag wave freely over the dardanelles and the
   bosporus. let, with your will, great majesty, the peoples remaining
   under the turkish yoke receive freedom. let the armenian people of turkey
   who have suffered for the faith of christ receive resurrection for a new
   free life under the protection of russia.'[155]
 
 armenians again flooded into the czarist armies. preparations were made
 to strike the ottomans from the rear, and the czar returned to st. petersburg
 confident that the day finally had come for him to reach istanbul."

 "an armenian state was organized at van under russian protection, and it 
  appeared that with the muslim natives dead or driven away, it might be
  able to maintain itself at one of the oldest centers of ancient armenian
  civilization. an armenian legion was organized 'to expel the turks from
  the entire southern shore of the lake in preparation for a concerted
  russian drive into the bitlis vilayet.'[162] thousands of armenians from
  mus and other major centers in the east began to flood into the new 
  armenian state...by mid-july there were as many as 250,000 armenians
  crowded into the van area, which before the crisis had housed and fed
  no more than 50,000 people, muslim and non-muslim alike.[163]"

 "the addition of the kars and batum oblasts to the empire increased the
  area of transcaucasia to over 130,000 square miles. the estimated population
  of the entire region in 1886 was 4,700,000, of whom 940,000 (20 percent) were
  armenian, 1,200,000 (25 percent) georgian, and 2,220,000 (45 percent) moslem.
  of the latter group, 1,140,000 were tatars. paradoxically, barely one-third
  of transcaucasia's armenians lived in the erevan guberniia, where the 
  christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. erevan
  uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 armenians
  as compared to 68,000 moslems. by the time of the russian census of 1897,
  however, the armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the
  guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000
  inhabitants. this impressive change in the province's ethnic character 
  notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the armenian 
  republic, a solid block of 370,000 tartars who continued to dominate the 
  southern districts, from the outskirts of ereven to the border of persia." 
  (see also map 1. historic armenia and map 4. administrative subdivisions of 
  transcaucasia).

 "we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as 
  ways of escape for the tartars and then proceeded in the work 
  of extermination. our troops surrounded village after village. 
  little resistance was offered. our artillery knocked the huts 
  into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable 
  and inhabitants fled from them into fields, bullets and bayonets 
  completed the work. some of the tartars escaped of course. they 
  found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border 
  into turkey. the rest were killed. and so it is that the whole 
  length of the borderland of russian armenia from nakhitchevan to 
  akhalkalaki from the hot plains of ararat to the cold mountain 
  plateau of the north were dotted with mute mournful ruins of 
  tartar villages. they are quiet now, those villages, except for 
  howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the 
  scattered bones of the dead."

 "an appropriate analogy with the jewish holocaust might be the
  systematic extermination of the entire muslim population of 
  the independent republic of armenia which consisted of at 
  least 30-40 percent of the population of that republic. the
