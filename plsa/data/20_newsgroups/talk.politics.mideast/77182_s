 why don't you pull your head out of your ass and into reality?  first off, what
 is the deal with your subject lines? do you think that you are being funny?
 ha ha.  what a developed sense of humor you have, i'm surprised they let you 
 out of the cage.  why don't we not talk about the "official" definition of
 foreign aid and talk about where money is really spent.  more money is spent
 stationing troops in germany (ie paying the troops, maintaining bases and equip,
 etc) than in israel.  plus, israel does not ask the us to send troops to fight
 her battles.  if you look at the amount of money spent defending korean 
 shipping lanes, norway, and other trouble spots in the world, you will see that
 aid to israel - from a practical standpoint - is not that much.  and so what -
 so what if israel gets the most (assuming i buy your feeble argument)?  what 
 is your point?  do you not want to subsidize israel?  well, you have two options
 1) start your own campaign, get elected as president, and then force congress
 to cut all aid to israel or 2) get the fuck out!  if  you don't like how this 
 country operates and can't change it then move to iran or something.
