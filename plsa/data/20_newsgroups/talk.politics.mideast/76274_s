 based on the same reasons?  you mean you were opposed to us intervention in
 somalia because since somalia is a european country instead of the third world,
 the desire to help somalia is racist?  i don't think this "same reason" applies
 to somalia at all.
 
 the whole point is that somalia _is_ a third world country, and we were more
 willing to send troops there than to bosnia--exactly the _opposite_ of what
 the "fixation on european countries" theory would predict.  (similarly, the
 desire to help muslims being fought by christians is also exactly the opposite
 of what that theory predicts.)

 i'm referring to people who want to help at all, of course.  you don't see
 people sending out press releases "help bosnian serbs with ethnic cleansing!
 the muslim presence in the balkans should be eliminated now!"  (well, except
 for some serbs, but i admit that the desire of serbs in america to help the
 serbian side probably _is_ because those are people more like them.)
