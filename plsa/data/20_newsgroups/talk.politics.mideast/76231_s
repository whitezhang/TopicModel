 right.  we'll probably end up giving them weapons.

 during wwii, the british managed to supply arms to the yugoslavs despite
 german occupation.  if the europeans had the will to do anything besides
 sponsoring peace conferences, they would have no problem putting any kind of
 weapon they wanted into bosnia.
 
 i guess i would favor ending the embargo if the congress would pass a law
 forbidding export of us military supplies to yugoslavia, including via third
 parties.  until then the risks of the us being drawn into a more active
 role would be too great.  i do not see the arms embargo as a major factor in
 the outcome of the war.

 both sides are certainly not equal in the eyes of the press.  and that's
 about all we have to go on, isn't it?  
 
 and i wish you'd quit hurling words like racist around.  there are many levels
 at which people react to what they see.  at the most fundamental level, you
 do not have to consciously recognize the racial element - you simply tend to
 empathize more with people who are like yourself.  as far preferring
 christian over moslem, i am an atheist myself, and i think you'll agree that
 in the us, the majority of people do not typically discriminate on the basis of
 religion, nor give it a particularly important place in their world view.
