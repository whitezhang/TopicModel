 gulf has changed the third parts's perception of arabs.
 1. before, people tended to think arabs have tough character. after seeing
 iraqis begging for surrender, people do not gave arabs much weight.
 2. people tended to think arabs are a united people in fighting isrealis.
 after gulf war, seeing some arab nations beated up iraqis in order to
 waiver the debt to u.s. and kuwaitis consistly trying to draw west nations
 to hit iraq again, people started to see arab world as a dog cage, echoing
 sound of barking.
