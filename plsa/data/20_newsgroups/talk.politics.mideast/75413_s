 both events took place, but not as you described them. it feels trivial to
 nit-pick about details like this, and insulting to everyone involved.
 but i feel that the truth is more damning than an exaggeration, and
 much more likely to cause people to think when they read it.
 
 in general, when i read an argument that uses inaccurate and inflamatory
 statements (honest mistake or not), i tend to dismiss the entire argument
 because of those errors.
 
 the entire situation in the middle east is too important to reduce to
 back-and-forth propaganda -- it is precisely this reduction that further
 polarizes the situation and makes peace, understanding, and reconcilliation
 impossible.

 agreed. it would have been better if both situations could have been avoided.
 
 [i accidently deleted the line about how it would be better if more of
  you people would do something about disgust and closets]
 
 what's this you people stuff anyway? how does it contribute to a
 rational discussion of the issues?

 frankly, i've received no mail on the subject, hateful or supportive.
