 syria had been bombing israeli settlements from the golan and sending
 terrorist squads into israel for years.  do you need me to provide specifics?
 i can.
 
 why don't you give it up, hasan?  i'm really starting to get tired of your 
 empty lies.  you can defend your position and ideology with documented facts
 and arguments rather than the crap you regularly post.  take an example from
 someone like brendan mckay, with whom i don't agree, but who uses logic and
 documentation to argue his position.  why must you insist on constantly spouting
 baseless lies?  you may piss some people off, but that's about it.  you won't
 prove anything or add anything worthy to a discussion.  your arguments just 
 prove what a poor debater you are and how weak your case really is.
