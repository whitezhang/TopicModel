 peace talks resume today; israel to offer palestinians new
 proposals
  
 israel radio, kol yisrael, reports on today's resumption in
 washington of the bilateral peace talks, following a recess which
 lasted over four months. according to the report, israel is
 expected to offer the palestinians new proposals regarding the
 authority of the palestinian executive council, general elections,
 control over land and human rights issues in the territories.
 israel will express its readiness to give the palestinians control
 of more land than previously offered. according to the radio
 report, one estimate is that israel will give the palestinians
 control over as much as two thirds of the administered lands, as
 well as broad authority on water issues. israel will seek to
 promote its offer to hold elections in the territories in hopes of
 strengthening the position of the palestinian delegation to the
 peace negotiations. according to israel radio, the israeli
 delegation to the bilateral talks with the palestinians will offer
 greater responsibilities to the palestinian executive council
 allowing it certain legislative capabilities, without making it a
 symbol for palestinian sovereignty. u.s. secretary of state warren
 christopher invited all the heads of delegations to a gathering
 tonight. it will be the first such event since the madrid
 conference. head of the american team at the bilateral peace talks,
 edward djerejian, said that tonight's gathering is meant to
 demonstrate the u.s.' active role in the peace process.
