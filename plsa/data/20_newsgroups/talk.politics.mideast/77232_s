   or, for that matter, with the usa.  around here, nobody reroutes
   freeways to avoid churches, synagogues, and so forth.  they just
   get condemned, paid off, and the road goes through.  the same is
   standard policy for any number of other public projects: schools
   and sports arenas being only two examples.
 
   anticipating the objection that the cases aren't comparable: how
   not?  the wall has to count as the #1 tourist attraction in that
   part of the world; making room for the traffic would be a twenty
   second decision for any city council i ever heard of.
