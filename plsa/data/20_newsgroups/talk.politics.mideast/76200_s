 very simple.
 
 "x-soviet armenian government must pay for their crime of genocide 
  against 2.5 million muslims by admitting to the crime and making 
  reparations to the turks and kurds."
 
 after all, your criminal grandparents exterminated 2.5 million muslim
 people between 1914 and 1920.

 you must be a new 'arromdian'. you are counting on asala/sdpa/arf 
 crooks and criminals to prove something for you? no wonder you are in 
 such a mess. that criminal idiot and 'its' forged/non-existent junk has 
 already been trashed out by mutlu, cosar, akgun, uludamar, akman, oflazer 
 and hundreds of people. moreover, asala/sdpa/arf criminals are responsible 
 for the massacre of the turkish people that also prevent them from entering 
 turkiye and trnc. sdpa has yet to renounce its charter which specifically 
 calls for the second genocide of the turkish people. this racist, barbarian 
 and criminal view has been touted by the fascist x-soviet armenian government 
 as merely a step on the road to said genocide. 
 
 now where shall i begin?

 receiving this message, i checked the reference, l.kuper,"genocide..." and
 what i have found was totally consistent with what davidian said.the book
 was like "voice of armenian revolutionists" and although i read the whole book,
 i could not find the original quota.
 but there was one more thing to check:the original posting of mutlu.i found 
 the original article of mutlu.it is as follows:

     ======
 
 quato is the same, reference is different !
 
 davidian lied again, and this time he changed the original posting of mutlu
 just to accuse him to be a liar.
 
 davidian, thank you for writing the page number correctly...
 
 you are the biggest liar i have ever seen.this example showed me that tomorrow
 you can lie again, and you may try to make me a liar this time.so i decided
 not to read your articles and not to write answers to you.i also advise
 all the netters to do the same.we can not prevent your lies, but at least
 we may save time by not dealing with your lies.
 
 and for the following line:
 >vay sarsak, vay yobaz, vay yalanci! vay turk milletinin yuz karasi mutlu vay!
 
 i also return all the insults you wrote about mutlu to you.
 i hope you will be drowned in your lies.

  o boy!   
  
  please, can you tell us why those quotes are "crap"?..because you do not 
  like them!!!...because they really exist...why?
  
  as i said in my previous posting, those quotes exactly exist in the source 
  given by serdar argic .. 
   
  you couldn't reject it...

  here we go again..
  in the book i have, both the front page and the author's preface give 
  the same year: 1923 and 15 january, 1923, respectively!
  (anyone can check it at her/his library,if not, i can send you the copies of
  pages, please ask by sct) 
  
  
 i really don't care what year it was first published(1923 or 1924)
 what i care about is what the book writes about murders, tortures,et..in
 the given quotes by serdar argic, and your denial of these quotes..and your
 groundless accussations, etc.

  i claim i have a book in my hand published in 1923(first publication)
  and it exactly has the same quoted info as the book published
  in 1934(serdar argic's reference) has..you couldn't reject it..but, now you
  are avoiding the real issues by twisting around..
  
  let's see how you lie!..(from 'non-existing' quotes to re-publication)
  
  first you said there was no such a quote in the given reference..you
  called serdar argic a liar!..
  i said to you, no, mr.davidian, there exactly existed such a quote...
  (i even gave the call number, page numbers..you could't reject it.)
  
  and now, you are lying again and talking about "modified,re-published book"
 (without any proof :how, when, where, by whom, etc..)..
  (by the way, how is it possible to re-publish the book in 1923 if it was
   first published in 1924(your claim).i am sure that you have some 'pretty 
   well suited theories', as usual)
  
  and i am ready to send the copies of the necessary pages to anybody who
  wants to compare the fact and mr.davidian's lies...i also give the call number
  and page numbers again for the library use, which are:  
                  949.6 r 198
    
   and the page numbers to verify the quotes:218 and 215
               
      
  
 > 
 >it is not possible that [(*]'s text has 287 pages, mine has 353, and yours has
 >377!
  
  now, are you claiming that there can't be such a reference by saying "it is
  not possible..." ..if not, what is your point?
  
  differences in the number of pages?
  mine was published in 1923..serdar argic's was in 1934..
  no need to use the same book size and the same letter 
  charachter in both publications,etc, etc.. does it give you an idea!!
  
  the issue was not the number of pages the book has..or the year
  first published.. 
  and you tried to hide the whole point..
  the point is that both books have the exactly the same quotes about
  how moslems are killed, tortured,etc by armenians..and those quotes given 
  by serdar argic exist!! 
  it was the issue, wasn't-it?  
  
  you were not able to object it...does it bother you anyway? 
  
  you name all these tortures and murders (by armenians) as a "crap"..
  people who think like you are among the main reasons why the world still
  has so many "craps" in the 1993. 
  
  any question?

 well, apparently we have another son of dro 'the butcher' to contend with. 
 you should indeed be happy to know that you rekindled a huge discussion on
 distortions propagated by several of your contemporaries. if you feel 
 that you can simply act as an armenian governmental crony in this forum 
 you will be sadly mistaken and duly embarrassed. this is not a lecture to 
 another historical revisionist and a genocide apologist, but a fact.
 
 i will dissect article-by-article, paragraph-by-paragraph, line-by-line, 
 lie-by-lie, revision-by-revision, written by those on this net, who plan 
 to 'prove' that the armenian genocide of 2.5 million turks and kurds is 
 nothing less than a classic un-redressed genocide. we are neither in 
 x-soviet union, nor in some similar ultra-nationalist fascist dictatorship, 
 that employs the dictates of hitler to quell domestic unrest. also, feel 
 free to distribute all responses to your nearest asala/sdpa/arf terrorists,
 the armenian pseudo-scholars, or to those affiliated with the armenian
 criminal organizations.
 
 armenian government got away with the genocide of 2.5 million turkish men,
 women and children and is enjoying the fruits of that genocide. you, and 
 those like you, will not get away with the genocide's cover-up.
 
 not a chance.
