 are you one of those people who were born when istanbul was called 
 konstantinopolis? i don't think so! if those people use it because
 they are used to do so, then i understand. but open any map
 today (except a few that try to be political) you will see that the name 
 of the city is printed as istanbul. so, don't try to give
 any arguments to using konstantinopolis except to cause some
 flames, to make some political statement.
