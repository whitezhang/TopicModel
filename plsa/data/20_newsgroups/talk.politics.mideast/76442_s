 i think the answer to mr. mayamsky's question can be found in the
 first amendment to the us constitution.
 
 	amendment i                                           (1791)
 
 	congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of
 	religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or
 	abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the
 	right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition
 	the government for a redress of grievances.
