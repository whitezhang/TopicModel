 april 13, 1993 response by al moore (l629159@lmsc5.is.lmsc.lockheed.com):
 
 basically the problem is that israel may remain, or leave, the occupied 
 territories; it cannot do both, it cannot do neither. so far, israe 
 continues to propose that they remain. the palestinians propose that they 
 leave. why should either change their view? it is worth pointing out that 
 the only area of compromise accomodating both views seems to require a
 reduction in the israeli presence. israel proposes no such reduction....
 and in fact may be said to *not* be negotiating.

 there seem to be two perceptions that **have to be addressed**. the
 first is that of israel, where there is little trust for arab groups, so
 there is little support for israel giving up **tangible** assets in 
 exchange for pieces of paper, "expectations", "hopes", etc. the second
 is that of the arab world/palestinians, where there is the demand that
 these "tangible concessions" be made by israel **without** it receiving
 anything **tangible** back.  given this, the gap between the two stances
 seems to be the need by israel of receiving some ***tangible*** returns
 for its expected concessions. by "tangible" is meant something that
 1) provides israel with "comparable" protection (from the land it is to 
 give up), 2) in some way ensures that the arab states and palestine 
 **will be** accountable and held actively (not just "diplomatically) 
 responsible for the upholding of all actions on its territory (by citizens 
 or "visitors").
 
 in essence i do not believe that israel objections to palestinian
 statehood would be anywhere near as strong as they are now if israel
 was assured that any new palestinian state *would be committed to** 
 co-existing with israel and held responsible for all attacks on israel 
 from its territory.
 	aside from some of the rather slanted proposals above,
 	how *could* such "guarantees" be instilled? for example,
 	how could such "guarantees"/"controls" be added to the
 	palestinian pisga proposals?
 
 israel is hanging on largely because it is scared stiff that the minute
 it lets go (gives lands back to arab states, no more "buffer zone", gives
 full autonomy to palestinians), any and/or all of the arab parties
 could (and *would*, if not "controlled" somehow) easily return to the 
 traditional anti-israel position. the question then is how to *really*
 ensure that that will not happen.
