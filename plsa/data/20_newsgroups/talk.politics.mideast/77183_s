 184 adventures in the near east
 
 disposal for our journey, i foresaw it would have to become
 our headquarters for a considerable time, and therefore went
 to some trouble to make it habitable. we had a most peculiar
 little locomotive, originally built in america for the russian
 government, adapted to burn either wood or oil; one covered
 truck as men's quarters; one similar, which i fitted up for my-
 self and a railway officer; and also a truck to carry wood, three
 cars being the utmost our small engine could pull. with this
 small outfit we started, rumours of all kinds reaching us before
 our departure indicating that the whole situation was rapidly
 coming to a head, it being evident that the turks were becoming~
 more and more restive in the face of the inexplicable delay of
 the allies in reaching any definite decision with regard to the
 future.
 
 travelling on this little "war-time" railway was indeed an
 experience, and it was necessary to carry a "gauge," and to
 test the rails with it frequently, for in many places, owing to
 the sinking of the embankments and the washing away of the
 ballast, the rails required rectification before we were able to
 get our train over, even at a foot pace; each bridge also re-
 quired elaborate examination before adventuring the train upon
 it, and eventually we were obliged to carry large baulks of tim-
 ber to temporarily shore up many of the bridges and culverts
 whilst we passed over them.
 
 under these circumstances it may be imagined that our prog-
 ress was by no means rapid, and as we had frequently to halt
 also to replenish our supply of wood fuel, we considered we
 had achieved wonders when, on the evening of the second day,
 60 hours and 70 miles out from erzeroum, we finally entered the
 gorge of the mountains where we understood our worst troubles
 to lie. this is the same gorge into which the road from
 erzeroum to kars descends from the foot-hills to cross the
 frontier; the railway, however, follows the main aras river val-
 ley till the frontier gorge enters it, whilst the road cuts off the
 corner and joins the rail again at the frontier post of zivin,
 some 15 miles from the main valley.
 
 soon after entering the gorge, we were confronted by the
 first serious fall of rock--about 2,000 tons having fallen from
 the cliff face and entirely obliterated the railway track. here,
 therefore, we halted, and, sending our engine back, prepared to
