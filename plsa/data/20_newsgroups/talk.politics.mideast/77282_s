 any state that the cia does not control is called "state that is linked
 to terrorism/militants/fundamentalists etc.."
 meanwhile even egyptian "experts" who hate the islamic movement admit
 that what is happening in egypt is spontaneous and most of the time a
 reaction to what the government does.

 can anybody see any contradiction between the above and the first
 paragraph? 
 does anybody know what the upi original article's title was?
 
 when it comes to egypt, all human rights, ethics, principles can
 be ignored by the western media. i wonder why?
