 while i applaud investing of money in yehuda, shomron, v'chevel-azza,
 in order to create jobs for their residents, i find it deplorable that
 this has never been an active policy of any israeli administration
 since 1967, *with regard to their jewish residents*. past governments
 found funds to subsidize cheap (read: affordable) housing and the
 requisite infrastructure, but where was the investment for creating
 industry (which would have generated income *and* jobs)? 
 
 after 26 years, yehuda and shomron remain barren, bereft of even 
 middle-sized industries, and the jewish settlements are sterile
 "bedroom communities", havens for (in the main) israelis (both
 secular *and* religious) who work in tel-aviv or jerusalem but
 cannot afford to live in either city or their surrounding suburbs.
 
 there's an old saying: "bli giboosh, ayn kivoosh" -- just living there
 wasn't enough, we had to *really* settle it. but instead, we "settled"
 for potemkin villages, and now we are paying the price (and doing
 for others what we should have done for ourselves).
