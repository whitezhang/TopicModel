 it is the serbs who were divided when croatia and bosnia-hercegovina 
 attempted to secede from yugoslavia, ripping more than 2,000,000 serbs
 and their property out of yugoslavia.  
 
 the croatian and muslim nations had the right to secede, not the republics.
 additionally, the secessions were to be negotiated, which would probably
 have required international mediation; instead the secessions were illegal,
 unilateral, and acts of war against yugoslavia and those who did not
 want to be ripped out of yugoslavia by the secessions.
