 not so unconventional.  eugenic solutions to the jewish problem
 have been suggested by northern europeans in the past.
 
   eugenics: a science that deals with the improvement (as by
   control of human mating) of hereditory qualities of race
   or breed.  -- webster's ninth collegiate dictionary.

 this is nothing more than feisal husseini's statement that the
 zionist entity must be disolved by forcing it to "engage" the
 surrounding "normal" arab society.
 
 "a strong mixed stock", "integration of israeli society into
 the middle east in a graceful manner," these are the phrases
 of nazi racial engineering pure and simple.  as if israeli
 society has no right to exist per se!

 "the continued existance of a specific jewish people overrides
 any other consideration, be it human love, peace of human
 rights."  disolve the jewish people and protect human values
 such as love and peace; yes ve have heard this before her himmler.
 notice how the source of the problem seems to be accruing to
 the jews in this analysis.  ya, der spiegal ist a gut sourcen...

 nice attempt to mix in a slam against u.s. aid to israel.

 critical comment: you can take the nazi flag and holocaust photos
 off of your bedroom wall, elias; you'll never succeed.
