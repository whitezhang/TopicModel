 yea, i think not also. israel's #1 issue is "security" so *any* outcomes
 of "negotiation" certainly need to address isreal's perception of this
 issue.
 
 the problem is is defining (by "outsiders", by israel, and by the arabs
 themselves) what is the #1 issue to the arab side. is it "palestinian
 statehood", is it that israel as a state should not and must not be
 allowed to exist, is it that the existence of a self-governing non-
 muslim "state" in the "islamic world" is intolerable...what? just as
 the dividing line between israel-fighting-for-security and israel-fighting-
 to-expand is often hard to discern by "outsiders" (especially to the arab 
 world), so the rationale behind the arab-struggle-to-undermine-israel-in-
 any-way could either be based on visceral rejectionism or a sense of being
 wronged that still values peace, who knows which. 
 
 anyway, in these talks, what "gestures" would you think would be seen
 by israel as "substantial"?
