 someone else said something similar.  i will not comment on the
 value or lack of value of elias's "proposal".  i just want to say
 that it is very distressing that at least two people here are
 profoundly ignorant of nazi racial doctrine.  they were not
 like elias's idea, they were more like the opposite.  
 
 nazis believed in racial purity, not racial assimilation.  an 
 instructive example is the nazi attitude to gypsies.  according to 
 nazi theoreticians, gypsies were an aryan race.  they were persecuted,
 and in huge numbers murdered, because most european gypies were
 considered not pure gypsies but "mongrels" formed from the pure gypsy 
 race and other undesirable races.  this was the key difference between 
 the theoretical approach to jews and gypsies, by the way.  it is also 
 true that towards the end of wwii even the "purist" gypsies were 
 hunted down as the theory was forgotten.
