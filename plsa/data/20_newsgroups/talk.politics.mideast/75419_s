 source: "world alive, a personal story" by robert dunn. crown publishers,

 p. 363 (first paragraph). 
 
  'how many people lived there?'
  'oh, about eight hundred.' he yawned.
  'did you see any turk officers?'
  'no, sir. i was in at dawn. all were tartar civilians in mufti.'
 
  "the lieutenant dozed off, then i, but in the small hours a voice woke me - 
  dro's. he stood in the starlight bawling out an officer. anyone keelhauled
  so long and furiously i'd never heard. then abruptly dro broke into 
  laughter, quick and simple as child's. both were a cover for his sense
  of guilt, i thought, or hoped. for somehow, despite my boast of irreligion,
  christian massacring 'infidels' was more horrible than the reverse would
  have been."
