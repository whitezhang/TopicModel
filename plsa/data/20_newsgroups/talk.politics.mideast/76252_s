   and why are we in somalia?   when right across the gulf of aden are
   some of the wealthiest arab nations on the planet?  why does the 
   us always become the point man for this stuff?   i don't mind us
   helping out; but what invariably happens is that everybody expects
   us to do most of the work and take most of the risks, even when these
   events are occuring in other people's back yards, and they have the
   resources to deal with them quite well, thank you.  i mean, it's 
   not like either serbia, or somalia represent some overwhelming
   military force that their neighbors can't handle.  nor are the 
   logistics a big deal -- it's a lot bigger logistical challenge 
   to get troops and supplies from new york to somalia, than from 
   saudi arabia; harder to go from texas to serbia, than turkey or 
   austria to serbia.
