 let's not forget that yoni netanyahu died while freeing civilian
 hostages from plo terrorists who had hijacked a passenger airliner to
 uganda.  mrs. dora bloch apparently died in uganda though i don't
 believe that her body has ever been found.  this is the very same plo
 that both rabin and netanyahu refuse to negotiate with.  this should
 not be surprising.
