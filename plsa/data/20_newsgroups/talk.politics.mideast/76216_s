 would it be asking too much for you to document these allegations of
 "israel used to arrest and kill neutral reporters"? i think you confuse
 israel with other nations of that geographical region to which the notion
 of a free, unmonitored by the government, press corps would be a joke.
 
 as for the notion that israel threatens the human rights of palestinians by
 sealing off the gaza strip, get real. when the palestinian-on-palestinian
 civil war stops and all palestinians can behave like mature human beings,
 israel will talk concessions on both sides for peace. not before.
