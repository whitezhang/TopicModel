 oops...small mistake.  thanks for mentioning it.  i just read on
 the.israel.line that a village just got shelled by terrorists last week 
 and some children were killed.  i guess the terrorists must have gotten by
 the security zone.  just think at how much more shelling would be 
 happening if the security zone weren't there.
 l8r...
