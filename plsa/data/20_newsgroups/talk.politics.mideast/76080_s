 no, you have completely misunderstood.  i was opposed to intervention in
 somalia for the same reason i am opposed to intervention in bosnia - there is
 no security interest of the united states there which justifies risking the
 lives of american servicemen, and there are too many crises in the world for us
 to take on all of them.  in the case of bosnia, the risks are obviously much
 greater, and there are other countries in a much better position and with far
 better reasons to take action than the us.

 you continue to misunderstand.  i did not say the reason why people want to
 intervene is because of racist (<- you seem to be overly fond of using this
 word, btw.  i said the phenomenon was race-related, which is not the same as
 racist.  perhaps this distinction is too subtle for you to grasp) motives - i
 said the attention and outrage at the entire yugoslavian situation was a result
 of it being 1) closer to home, 2) happening to people we can identify with, and
 3) relentlessly harped on by the media.  i never said anything about which side
 would be preferred, which has a lot more to do with the presentation of the
 conflict than any psychological factors.  i think there is no doubt that despite
 the fact we intervened in somalia, the level of attention devoted to there was
 considerably less than what is devoted to bosnia, if the newspapers and tv news
 i see are any guide.
