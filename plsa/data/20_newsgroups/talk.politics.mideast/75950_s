 that still doesn't mean we should cheer their deaths.  policemen are also in 
 the line of fire and their job includes the possibility of getting killed.  
 should we be happy when they die?  as i said before, the question is not
 whether or not you agree with the policies of israel.  you may wish for the
 israelis to cease occupation, but don't rejoice in death.
