     actually judea and samaria are proper geographical names, just like 
     asia minor or lake michigan. judea and samaria are even used in 
     an atlas published in (what used to be) ussr circa 1970 that i have at
     home. the government of the ussr was of course quite hostile towards
     israel and would hardly engage in a pro-israel propaganda. i would be
     willing to mail a photocopy of the relevant page to mr. schmidling 
     with relevant words underlined to simplify his search, if he promises
     to report to the net afterwards.

 mr. schmidling is to be congtatualted for being living exception to this
 general rule. for although he is almost without peer in both the number
 of lies posted and in the number of times he repeats them --- he hasn't 
 found many people who believe his lies (yet ?).
