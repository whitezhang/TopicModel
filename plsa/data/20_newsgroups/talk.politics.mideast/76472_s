 i have no idea what this guy means but the syrian jews are not allowed
 to leave syria because assad welshed on his promise and is not letting
 them go. israel has nothing to do with it.
 
 as for the other arab countries there are still small communities left
 in some arab countries. morocco has the largest group i think comprising
 perhaps just over a thousand (but i have lost the exact figure. maybe
 someone will be so kind as to post it). there are communities left in
 yemen (which went to the polls yesterday in what might appear to be a
 free-ish election), algeria (this is a tiny group, a couple of leftist
 intellectuals i think), of course syria and lebannon.
 
 the circumstances of the departure of the jews from various arab countries
 is controversial in some cases - like iraq - and i do not want to get into
 a dispute about it. egypt expelled most of its community outright. most of
 the french north african jews left rather than face independence. i think
 that moroccans might have been encouraged by some antisemitic acts but i
 am not sure. someone else around here will know for sure. there are claims
 that israeli intellegence officers spread rumours around algeria that the
 jews would not be welcome but this is probably just propaganda. it would
 take a very stupid person not to realise the benefits of a move to france
 (as most did) or to israel. yemeni jews were airlifted to israel. those
 left were rumoured to have another airlift last year but i heard nothing
 about it so i guess it was just a rumour. any i left out except iraq?
