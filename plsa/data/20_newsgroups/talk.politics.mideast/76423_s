 jack schmidling (arf@genesis.mcs.com) reveals the true depths
 of his cynicism:
 
 	i do (did) contribute to the arf mortgage fund but
 	when interest rates plumetted, i just paid it off.
 
 	the problem is, i couldn't convince congress to move
 	my home to a nicer location on federal land.
 
 
 in other words, mr. schmidling could care less for the plight
 of the homeless, but is not above using them to score points
 for his agenda.
