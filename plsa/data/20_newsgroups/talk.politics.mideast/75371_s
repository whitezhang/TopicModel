 m. budienny, a subsequent soviet military fame, said about the 
 armenian genocide of 2.5 million defenseless turkish and kurdish 
 women, children and elderly people during his visit to anatolia 
 in june 1919 that
 
 "the armenians had become troublemakers, their hinchakist
  and dashnakist parties were opportunist, serving as lackeys
  of whatever power happened to be ascendent."
 
 in september 16, 1920, major general w. thwaites, director of
 military intelligence, wrote to lord hardinge, under-secretary
 of state for foreign affairs:
 
 "...it is useless to pretend that the armenians are satisfactory
  allies, or deserving of all the sympathy to which they claim."[1]

 in the special collection at stanford hoover library, donated by
 georgia cutler, the letter dated nov. 1, 1943 states that
 
 "prescot hall wrote a large volume to prove that armenians were
  not and never could be desirable citizens, that they would 
  always be unscrupulous merchants."

 "for eight days, armenians have been forcibly obstructing people from
  leaving their homes or going from one village to the other. day and night
  they are rounding up male inhabitants, taking them to unknown destinations,
  after which nothing further is heard of them. (informed from statements
  of those who succeeded in escaping wounded from the massacres around
  taskilise ruins). women and children are being openly murdered or are
  being gathered in the church square and similar places. most inhuman and
  barbarous acts have been committed against moslems for eight days."

 "as almost all russian units opposite our front have been withdrawn, the
  population loyal to us in regions behind the russian positions are
  facing an ever-increasing threat and suppression as well as cruelties
  and abuses by armenians who have decided to systematically annihilate
  the moslem population in regions under their occupation. i have 
  regularly informed the russian command of these atrocities and
  cruelties and i have gained the impression that the above authority
  seems to be failing in restoring order."

                             might serve as ways of escape for the turks 
                             and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'
