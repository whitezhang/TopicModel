 this is nonsense. i lived in the negev for many years and i can say
 for sure that no beduins were "moved" or harmed in any way. on the
 contrary, their standard of living has climbed sharply; many of them
 now live in rather nice, permanent houses, and own cars. there are
 quite a few beduin students in the ben-gurion university. there are
 good, friendly relations between them and the rest of the population.
 
 all the beduins i met would be rather surprised to read mr. davidson's
 poster, i have to say.
