 it is easy for sen. biden to say that when there are no us troops in
 zepa or srebinica or sarejevo...
 
 the existing un policy may certaining be wrong, but the us wants
 to dictate policy, and make europe responsible for the consequences
 of that policy...
 
 ...bosnia is a big enough problem for the us to preach about what
 other countries should be doing with their forces...but its forces
 are safely tucked away at home in the us.
