 i believe that things are getting mixed here.
 critizicing israel and/or being anti-zionist is not seeing "the absolute 
 negatives of that culture". maybe, because a person can see the positives 
 of that culture is that that person opposes zionism and the actions of the
 state of israel.
 i, for one, consider the actions of the state of israel with respect to
 the human rights of the palestinian people as an example of an action thaty
 opposes what jewish culture was suppose to uphold as an example of 
 respect and what the jewish people learned about oppresion, segregation and
 years in the diaspora.

 he might not want to recognize that. it does not make him a self-hating
 jew, as far as i see it. at most, he is a person who is not telling
 the truth.

 but, so far, it seems that the blame is always put on "the other".
 if you read this newsgroup, for example, israel is never guilty by
 herself. she is always responding to the actions of the "other", and
 it goes as if the actions of isreal do not also affect the response
 of the "other' in a cycle that never ends. also, there is blindness to
 try to understand what the other feels and why.
 there is always and excuse. there is always a rationale to explain why
 things happen as they do.
 and, what is the worst part for me, there seems to be all the time an
 intention to try to de-humanize the "other", as if the other did not
 care about their future, children, peace, etc, etc.
