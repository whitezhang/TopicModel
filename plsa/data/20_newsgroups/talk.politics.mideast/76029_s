 [h] 	the armenians in nagarno-karabagh are simply defending their rights

 [he]	homeland? first nagarno-karabagh was armenians homeland today
 [he]	fizuli, lacin and several villages (in azerbadjan)
 [he]	are their homeland. can't you see the
 [he]	the  "great armenia" dream in this?
 
 greater armenia would stretch from karabakh, to the black sea, to the
 mediterranean, so if you use the term "greater armenia" use it with care.
 
 [he]    with facist methods like
 [he]	killing, raping and bombing villages. the last move was the 
 [he]	blast of a truck with 60 kurdish refugees, trying to
 [he]	escape the from lacin, a city that was "given" to the kurds
 [he]	by the armenians. 
 
 it has always been up to the azeris to end their announced winning of karabakh 
 by removing the armenians! when the president of azerbaijan, elchibey, came to 
 power last year, he announced he would be be "swimming in lake sevan [in 
 armeniaxn] by july". well, he was wrong! if elchibey is going to shell the 
 armenians of karabakh from aghdam, his people will pay the price! if elchibey 
 is going to shell karabakh from fizuli his people will pay the price! if 
 elchibey thinks he can get away with bombing armenia from the hills of 
 kelbajar, his people will pay the price. 
 
 it also seems other non-azeri minorities in azerbaijan have understood they
 are next in line in this process of forced azerification or deportation. just 
 look at the situation with the lezgians.
 
 about the kurds...what kurds! according to the azerbaijani government, there 
 are no kurds in azerbaijan. can't they make up their minds? oh i see, there 
 are only kurds when the azeris want them to be kurds! and anyway, this "60 
 kurd refugee" story, as have other stories, are simple fabrications sourced in 
 baku, modified in ankara. other examples of this are armenia has no border 
 with iran, and the ridiculous story of the "intercepting" of armenian military 
 conversations as appeared in the new york times supposedly translated by 
 somebody unknown, from armenian into azeri turkish, submitted by an unnamed 
 "special correspondent" to the ny times from baku. real accurate!
 
 [h]       however, i hope that the armenians will force a turkish airplane 
 [h]       to land for purposes of searching for arms similar to the one
 [h]       that happened last summer. turkey searched an american plane
 [h]       (carrying humanitarian aid) bound to armenia.

 no, henrik, these turkish planes should be shot down with no questions asked.
 
 [he]	don't speak about things you don't know: 8 american cargo planes
 [he]	were heading to armenia. when the turkish authorities
 [he]	announced that they were going to search these cargo 
 [he]	planes 3 of these planes returned to it's base in germany.
 [he]	5 of these planes were searched in turkey. the content of
 [he]	of the other 3 planes? not hard to guess, is it? it was sure not
 [he]	humanitarian aid.....
 
 your "facts" in error. shipments of all kinds that have transversed turkey 
 have been either searched, re-routed or confiscated. some american planes
 were searched, others were re-routed, others were untouched. rail shipments 
 were held up last fall and last winter from entering armenian from turkey
 for the purpose of aiding in the economic collapse of armenia. wheat was
 confiscated, other shipments were exchanged with "crap" and dirt, then
 shipped to armenia. u.s. planes don't have to use turkish air bases. the u.s.
 uses these bases to bomb iraq. anyway, u.s. planes can fly over georgia, which
 they have found is easier than to endure unnecessary expressions of turkish 
 chauvinism through searches of cargo which to this day have not revealed 
 anything other than a paranoid turkish military. 
 
 [he]	search turkish planes? you don't know what you are talking about.
 [he]	since it's content is announced to be weapons? 
 
 well, big mouth ozal said military weapons are being provided to azerbaijan
 from turkey, yet demirel and others say no. no wonder you are so confused!
 
 [he]	turkey's government has announced that it's giving weapons
 [he]	to azerbadjan since armenia started to attack azerbadjan
 [he]	it self, not the karabag province. so why search a plane for weapons
 [he]	since it's content is announced to be weapons? 
 
 you are correct, all turkish planes should be simply shot down! nice, slow
 moving air transports!
