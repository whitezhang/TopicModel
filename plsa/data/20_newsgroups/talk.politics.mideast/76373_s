 first of all i'm still baffled what you possibly could have
 found racist in my argument for freedom of speach. i did not
 mention names, nationalities, countries let alone races. 
 	you are right in that virginia.edu does not have a
 thought police like israel.nysernet.org seems to. i didn't know
 that you guys are getting a privelege by the israelis by
 getting "the means to speak publicly". virginia.edu lets every
 student regardless of their opinion to speak their mind. 
 	virginia.edu is true to its founding father, thomas
 jefferson the author of the bill of rights, in allowing freedom
 of speach. sorry you guys in israel have a hard time with the
 concept.
