    diaspora 'a cancer'
    ------------------- by julian kossoff and lindsay schusman in:
    jewish chronicle, london, 22. dec. 1989
 
    leading israeli author and cultural commentator, a.b. yehoshua,
    launched a ferocious attack on diaspora jewry at a zionist youth
    council meeting in north london, last week.
 
    the diaspora, he claimed, "was the cancer connected to the main
    tissue of the jewish people". he was scathing about its failure to
    act before the holocaust.

    jewish values in israel embraced every aspect of daily life,
    unlike in the diaspora, where jews had no responsibility for the
    country they lived in, he said.
 
    he warned that modern hebrew, a unifying force for the jewish
    people, would have to struggle for its future, especially in
    literary circles. it faced fierce competition from the english
    language.
