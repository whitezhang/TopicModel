 there are many cases, but i do not remeber names.  the isralis shot and killed
 a un observer in gaza in the first half of intifada.
 
 i believe that most of the world has seen pictures of israeli soldiers who
 were breaking the cameras of the reporters, kicking reporters out, confiscating
 cassettes, and showing reporters militery orders preventing them from going
 to hot areas to pick pictures and make reports.
