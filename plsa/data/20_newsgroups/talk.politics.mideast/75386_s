 so i should be very comfortable that 500,000,000 people want to convert me to
 islam. or, to convert me to anything. 
 
 there are many types of violence, physical murder is only one.
 
 'trying' to convert is an insult. it's like trying to tell me that me and/or
 my god/my lack of god are just crap, that i need a new, 'converted' one.
 
 this does not apply for muslims only, of course. same for jews and for some
 friendly, nicely dressed neighbours who show on sunday with empty speaches
 and cheap booklets about some church ....
 
 and when the objective is (i think, however that you are wrong) to convert 
 everybody, it's just a matter of time when violence will occur.
 
 
 aren't we able to learn anything from thouthands of years of 'conversion related
 violence' ? 
 
 why not let 'the other, more inferiour' people live as they wish and take care 
 your business?. you do assume that they are inferiour (or their beliefs are)
 as long as you want to change their thinking.
