 you know ed,...  you're right!  andi shouldn't be comparing
 israel to the nazis.  the israelis are much worse than the
 nazis ever were anyway.  the nazis did a lot of good for
 germany, and they would have succeeded if it weren't for the
 damn jews.  the holocaust never happened anyway.  ample
 evidence given by george schafer at harvard, dept. of history,
 and even by randolph higgins at nyu, have shown that the
 holocaust was just a semitic conspiracy created to obtain
 sympathy to piush for the creation of israel.
