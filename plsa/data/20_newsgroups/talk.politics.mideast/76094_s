   oh....i see...i didn't realize this...
 
   i think that perhaps you should print flyers on this topic, and your
   reasons for thinking the way you do. you should then distribute them
   amongst the world's population. you see, i don't think there are many
   people who are aware of this fact. thank you for telling us the truth.
 
   btw: i would start by sending your flyers to each of the un officials.
 	   also, after you have distributed your flyers you might consider
        hiding. you see, i think that once more people read what you think
        they will have to lock you up in a mental institute; and don't think
        they will ever let you out.
  
   it is a strange strange world you live in. i feel sorry for you.
