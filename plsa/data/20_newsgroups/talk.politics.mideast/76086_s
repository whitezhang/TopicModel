 dear mr. karageorgiou,
 i would like to clarify several misunderstandings in your posting. first the    bus incident which i believe was in canakkale three years ago, was done by a    mentally ill person who killed himself afterwards. the pontus greeks were ex-   changedwith turks in greece in 1923. i have to logout now since my greek friend
 yiorgos here wants to use the computer. well, i'll be back.asta la vista baby.
