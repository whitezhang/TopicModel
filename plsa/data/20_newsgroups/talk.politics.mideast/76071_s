                          by theodore j. o'keefe
 
 
 hard by the washington monument, within clear view of the jefferson
 memorial, an easy stroll down the mall to the majestic lincoln memorial,
 has arisen, on some of the most hallowed territory of the united states of
 america, a costly and dangerous mistake.  on ground where no monument yet
 marks countless sacrifices and unheralded achievements of americans of all
 races and creeds in the building and defense of this nation, sits today a
 massive and costly edifice, devoted above all to a contentious and false
 version of the ordeal in europe during world war ii, of non-american
 members of a minority, sectarian group.  now, in the deceptive guise of
 tolerance, the united states holocaust memorial museum begins a propaganda
 campaign, financed through the unwitting largess of the american taxpayer,
 in the interests of israel and its adherents in america.
 
      how did the federal government allow the creation of such a
 monstrosity?  what is its meaning for american policy and for american
 values?  and what must the american people do to regain control of the land
 their servants in washington handed over to a foreign interest and to
 establish an enterprise thereon, whether a museum or otherwise, informed by
 and conducted according to american principles and interests?

 remembrance."
 
 
 origins
 
      in the late 1970s, during the presidency of james earl "jimmy" carter,
 a propaganda campaign to promote the "holocaust," the alleged systematic
 slaughter of some 6 million jews by the germans during world war ii, was
 organized and carried out from hollywood and new york. as benjamin meed, an
 important functionary of the council which controls the holocaust museum,
 wrote in 1990:
               
 
           almost a dozen years ago, a new phenomena [sic] developed.  the
      holocaust was introduced into schools, colleges, and universities.
      television broadcast programs on the holocaust and millions of
      americans watched them.  soon, americans took great interest in the
      lessons of the holocaust, its uniqueness and its universal message.(1)
 
 
      why the urgency of this campaign? two factors were paramount:  first,
 the beginnings, more than three decades after the end of world war ii, of
 an objective scholarly assessment of the facts of the alleged german policy
 to exterminate european jewry.(2)
 
      second, the need to justify zionist theory and practice in the face of
 unprecedented international resistance to israeli intransigence (including
 the famous un general assembly resolution which equated zionism with
 racism), and to defend israel's aggressive policy under the leadership of
 the former terrorist, prime minister menachem begin.(3)
 
 
 the u.s. holocaust memorial council
 
      in 1978 president carter, his administration beleaguered at home and
 abroad, succumbed to pressure from the new "holocaust" lobby (and thus
 america's influential israel-first minority) by creating, through executive
 order, the president's commission on the holocaust.  two years later, on
 october 7, 1988, congress passed--unanimously--a law establishing the
 united states holocaust memorial council, charged principally with
 constructing and overseeing the operation of "a permanent living memorial
 to the victims of the holocaust" and with providing "for appropriate ways
 for the nation to commemorate the days of remembrance, as an annual,
 national, civic commemoration of the holocaust..."(4)
 
      a priceless tract of public land was turned over to the council, and,
 after years of costly delay (during which the u.s. holocaust memorial
 council's budget swelled from $2.5 million to over $18 million a year), the
 u.s. holocaust memorial museum has been completed and readied for opening
 on april 22, 1993.
 
 
 a sectarian, alien agenda
 
      the holocaust memorial council, besides soliciting tens of millions of
 dollars in tax-deductible donations to finance the holocaust museum, has
 busied itself with promoting an agenda of unalloyed support for minority,
 zionist ends.
 
      the membership of the council, a u.s. federal agency, has been
 overwhelmingly jewish since its founding in 1980.  the council's two
 different chairmen--elie wiesel and harvey meyerhoff--have both been
 committed to the support of the state of israel, and the chairs of the
 council's most important committees have been likewise jewish and zionist.
 
      the chief fundraiser for the holocaust museum, miles lerman, was
 formerly american vice chairman for the state of israel bonds organization,
 promoting tax-free investment in a country which receives by far the
 largest amount of u.s. foreign aid per year.  working the same wealthy
 jewish americans he has long dealt with in his fundraising for israel,
 lerman has helped raise nearly $160 million in tax-deductible
 contributions.  the biggest donors have been rewarded by having various
 components of the museum named for them, e.g. the wexler learning center.
 
      nor is erecting and operating the holocaust memorial museum the only
 function with which the holocaust memorial council has been charged.
 another of its duties is to commemorate the days of remembrance for victims
 of the holocaust, which congress has raised to "an annual, national, civic
 commemoration of the holocaust."  like the israeli yom hashoah (day of the
 holocaust), on which they are based, the days of remembrance are dated
 according to the lunar hebrew calendar, and thus like passover or chanukah,
 fluctuate from year to year. these foreign days of lamentation are
 currently celebrated, under the flag of the republic, to prayers and chants
 in hebrew, in governmental settings from the capital rotunda to city halls,
 across the land.  need it be stated that no group of american victims of
 persecution, let alone another foreign group, enjoys any such federally
 mandated and tax-supported day, or days, of recognition?
 
 
 the holocaust museum's one-sided "history"
 
      although the u.s. holocaust memorial council during its early years
 made noises about recognizing the ordeals of non-jews during world war ii,
 by every indication from advance literature published by the council, the
 u.s. holocaust memorial museum is relentlessly judeocentric.  while,
 according to a preliminary ground plan of the permanent exhibit, here and
 there are nods to non-jewish groups oppressed by the german national
 socialists (never to groups victimized by germany's enemies, above all by
 stalin's ussr), the larger holocaust of world war ii, which claimed an
 estimated 75 to 80 million lives around the world, is ignored in preference
 to the jewish ordeal. thus, to cite just one telling example, the museum's
 "life before the holocaust" exhibit refers strictly to *jewish* life before
 the holocaust.(5)
 
      where, in fact, non-jews figure in the museum, they figure largely as
 villains: the germans and their allies and collaborators; the western
 allies, including america, who refused to accept a large immigration before
 the war; the american political and military leaders who refused to
 authorize costly bombing raids on the auschwitz "gas chambers."
 
         
 red liberators?
 
      the museum's message that support for jews is the sole measure of
 decency during world war ii leads to anomalies which, in an american museum
 raised on ground hallowed to the principles of liberty on which this
 republic is based, can only be called shocking.  that the victims of world
 war ii atrocities by the allies--massacres such as the fire-bombing of
 tokyo and dresden, the atomic bombing of hiroshima and nagasaki, the soviet
 slaughter of their polish prisoners at katyn, the mass rapes carried out by
 the red army at the war's end--receive no mention is deplorable.  but the
 museum's treatment of the armed forces which defended stalin's savage
 soviet tyranny is nothing short of grotesque.
 
      in the u.s. holocaust memorial museum, communists appear only in the
 guise of "resistance fighters" and "liberators."  for example, the
 submachine gun and false papers of samuel weissberg, a communist party
 member who rose to high rank in a communist guerrilla group in north
 france, are on honored display, no less precious a relic than the standard
 heaps of shoes and hair, in the museum's permanent exhibit.(6)
 
      even more unsettling is the honor given to stalin's notorious red
 army, which compiled a bloody and shameful record of atrocities across
 europe during, and after, the war.  as the u.s. holocaust memorial
 council's newsletter fulsomely puts it, "flags will hang in the museum to
 honor the millions of soviet soldiers who drove nazi forces westward and
 who were the first allied forces to liberate and publicize the existence of
 the camps."  in the words of council chairman harvey meyerhoff, these
 martial banners of the red tyranny have a single association: "much more
 than simply wartime memorabilia, these military artifacts are a significant
 contribution to memory, one that will remind future generations of the
 pivotal role soviet forces played in defeating nazism..."(7)
 
      what must the millions of americans originating or descending from the
 european nations--russia, ukraine, belarus, estonia, latvia, lithuania,
 poland, hungary, czechoslovakia, romania, bulgaria, [former] yugoslavia--
 for which the red "military artifacts" symbolized invasion, tyranny,
 oppression and persecution of religion think as they see the fierce armies
 of *their* persecutors hailed as "liberators"?
 
 
 israel in the museum
 
      just as one might guess from the circumstance that the museum's
 director, yeshayahu weinberg, and the head of its "learning center,"
 yechiam halevy, were brought in from israel, the museum's treatment of the
 state of israel is adulatory.  an emotive tribute to the founding of israel
 is an integral part of the exhibition.  that the establishment of israel,
 and its expansion in subsequent wars, has meant colonial occupation and
 oppression for millions of the land's native palestinians, and
 dispossession and exile for millions more, goes unmentioned--another
 grotesquery in an american museum supposed to instruct in the dangers of
 intolerance and disregard of human rights.  as for the momentous
 collaboration between hitler's german state and the jewish agency in the
 1930s, which through the ha'avara agreement enabled the transfer of vital
 capital and the influx of tens of thousands of highly skilled jewish
 immigrants to palestine, that is passed over in utter silence.(8)
 
 
 "historical correctness"
 
      the holocaust museum's skewed history is not simply a matter of one-
 sidedness and omission.  the museum has further committed itself to a fixed
 and final interpretation of the surprisingly scanty and sometimes suspect
 evidence for a german policy of annihilating european jewry, largely in gas
 chambers, in numbers approaching 6 million.  this despite a considerable
 body of research and scholarship that has arisen over the past two decades
 in many lands, and which contests, by academic means, the substance of the
 holocaust "extermination thesis."(9)
 
      that the u.s. holocaust memorial council is aware of the work of the
 revisionists is clear: the council's literature is replete, not with
 substantive refutations of revisionist scholarship, but with slander and
 polemic.  to cite one characteristic example, the _u.s. holocaust memorial
 museum newsletter_ of may, 1992 featured a front-page attack on holocaust
 revisionism by professor deborah lipstadt of occidental college in which
 the author decried the revisionists for producing material that looked
 scholarly, then lauded the u.s. holocaust memorial museum as "among the
 most efficacious ways" of "combating this pernicious trend," *while
 neglecting to specify a single error of revisionist scholarship.*(10)
 
      the u.s. holocaust memorial council recognizes that there is a
 historical debate on the holocaust, but takes official notice of the
 dissenting position only to attack it.  that an american institution,
 supported by the taxes of all americans, should commit itself to inflexible
 historical orthodoxy--in the service of a single american minority--is an
 intolerable imposition on our first amendment rights, as well as a mockery
 of the western, and american, ideal of objective scholarship.
 
 
 a center for education?
 
      u.s. holocaust memorial council chairman harvey meyerhoff has stated:
 "the museum is primarily an educational institution."(11)  from the
 council's own literature, however, it is clear what meyerhoff means by
 education.  the "role-playing" for children as well as adults who visit the
 museum (visitors are to be issued "identity cards" bearing the name and
 alleged fate of various holocaust victims); the high-tech computer and
 video effects and the recordings of speech and music which augment the
 museum's tendentiously described artifacts; and the museum's goal, as
 proclaimed by its zionist fundraising chairman, miles lerman, of ensuring
 that "children in dubuque, families in tucson, and schoolteachers in
 atlanta will learn the history and the lessons of auschwitz as thoroughly
 as they learn the history of their own communities"--all these show that
 the u.s. holocaust memorial museum is a *propaganda* enterprise that seeks
 to indoctrinate all americans in a uniquely and partisanly jewish (and
 zionist) version of not merely the past, but the present and the
 future.(12)
 
 
 the american response
 
      what is the american response to a partisan museum constructed in a
 place solemnly consecrated to the heroes and the values of our republic, to
 be lavishly operated with taxpayer dollars at a time when, even in our
 country's capital, thousands sleep homeless in the shadow of our national
 monuments?  what is the american response to an ambitious propaganda agenda
 that aims to impose a sectarian "holocaust remembrance" in schools where
 our children cannot pray, in town halls and federal buildings from which
 the religious symbols of the majority are banned in the name of freedom of
 worship?
 
      over two centuries ago, thomas jefferson wrote: "to compel a man to
 furnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which he
 disbelieves and abhors is sinful and tyrannical."(13)
 
      nearly 150 years ago, abraham lincoln said: "i insist that if there is
 *anything* which it is the duty of the *whole people* to never entrust to
 any hands but their own, that thing is the preservation and perpetuity of
 their own liberties and institutions."(14)
 
      the u.s. holocaust memorial museum, and the council which runs it, as
 agencies of the government in which the american people is sovereign, must
 be removed from the special interest that now controls it.
 
      the scope and purpose of the museum must be expanded, from its present
 one-sided emphasis on foreign jewish sufferings, real and imagined, in
 europe during the 1930s and 1940s to a compassionate yet realistic concern
 for *all* victims, but above all for *american* victims, of historic
 injustice.
 
      the museum must be made a place where americans of every heritage, and
 scholars of every viewpoint, may gather, educate, and be educated, without
 accusation and in the absence of propaganda.  until it is, the men and
 women who founded and built and suffered and fought and died for america,
 of every race, nationality and creed, will rest uneasy.
