 	there is something almost comical in the fact that yigal arens is 
 important enough to have the adl and g-d knows who else sifting through his 
 garbage (which happens to be legal; you throw it out, it ain't yours any more).
 
 	this brings to mind a few possibilities other than the adl connection:
 
 	- it is all in arens' mind.
 	- bullock may have been working for arens' friend in the plo
 	- arens' father (or is it brother?) moshe arens (former israeli defense 
 minister) was spying on him.
 	- arens hired bullock to spy on him to get attention.
 
 	in any case, who cares?
