 I dunno, Warren.  Just the other day I heard a rumor that "Serdar Argic"
 (aka Hasan Mutlu and Ahmed Cosar and ZUMABOT) is not really a Turk at all,
 but in fact is an Armenian who is attempting to make any discussion of the
 massacres in Armenia of Turks so noise-laden as to make serious discussion
 impossible, thereby cloaking the historical record with a tremendous cloud
 of confusion.
