 is this a figment of your imagination? here is another one:
 
 
  source: "mitteilungsblatt, berlin, december 1939, nr. 2 and 5-6"
 
  yet another historical fact: a fact that for years has been deliberately 
  forgotten, concealed, and wiped from memory - the fact of armenian-nazi 
  collaboration.
 
  a magazine called mitteilungsblatt der deutsch-armenischen gesselschaft
  is the clearest and most definite proof of this collaboration. the 
  magazine was first published in berlin in 1938 during nazi rule of germany
  and continued publication until the end of 1944. even the name of the
  magazine, which implies a declaration of armenian-nazi cooperation,
  is attention-getting.
 
  this magazine, every issue of which proves the collaboration, is historically
  important as documentary evidence. it is a heap of writing that should be
  an admonition to world opinion and to all mankind. 
 
  in nazi germany, armenians were considered to be an aryan race and certain
  political, economic, and social rights were thus granted to them. they 
  occupied positions in public service and were partners in nazi practices.
  the whole world of course knows what awaited those who were not considered 
  "aryan" and what befell them.
