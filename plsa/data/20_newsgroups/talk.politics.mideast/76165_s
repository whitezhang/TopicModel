 what is the point in throwing out one-sided viewpoints (which means:
 ignoring that the "other side's" perspective and experience has any 
 legitimacy) while assuming that "your side" possesses no faults and 
 bears no responbility for any of the negative impacts of a particular 
 event? isn't the former onesided? isn't the latter naive? if you feel 
 that my opinion is wrong then please tell me how. "strategic withdrawal" 
 under the cover of a snide remark seems to be the favored tactic on this
 net but doesn't accomplish anything.
