 my recollection of history/documentary books is slitely different.
 it is my understanding that croats were allies of germany during
 wwii, while serbs had sided with russia.  as a result serbs did
 take a beating from croats (not bosnian moslems) while germany
 had the upper hand.
 
 even today, russians consider/call serbs as their slovac brothers.
 this is one of the issues involved in the u.n.'s lack of active
 intervention against serbs.
 
 as for the bosnian moslems, i have not heard of any alliance with
 germany or russia in recent history.  therefore, i am curious
 if they did or were able to treat other parties in this conflict
 with same brutallity (as they are getting it today) in the past
 history.
