 why retract your accusation that he's a liar?  if omran retracts his "verbal
 diarrohea" doesn't that only prove the liar he *really* is?  a retraction
 would be pointless!  giving this guy the opportunity to "save face" after
 uttering such bullshit would just encourage him to do it again!  i must say
 that your style is very impressive, mark.  keep it up!
