 arab leaders are now following by islamic rules?  (or is it only applicable
 in cases like this?)  :-
 
 i remember an article of about a year ago which stated that besides his wife,
 saddam also has a mistress.  assad's brother has a wife and *several*
 mistresses, and those 'emirs' in the gulf have, within their lifetimes,
 wives in the double digitas (only they manage to keep four at a time).
  
 this is all irrelevant.  it takes a *lot* more than infidelity to make these
 leaders ruthless and corrupt.  maybe netanyahu thought he could 'cleanse'
 himself by making such a public confession.  does the average secular israeli
 care, though?  the mossad probably applauded him.  :-)
