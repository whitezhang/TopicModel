 	hong kong, and cairo both have higher population densities.

 	there is no fundamental right to work in another country.  and
 the closing of the strip is not a punishment, it is a security measure
 to stop people from stabbing israelis.

 	dozens minus one, since one of them was stabbed to death a few
