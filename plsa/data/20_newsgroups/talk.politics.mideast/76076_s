 c'mon, you still haven't corrected yourself, 'wieneramus'. in april 
 1942, hitler was preparing for the invasion of the caucasus. a 
 number of nazi armenian leaders began submitting plans to german
 officials in spring and summer 1942. one of them was souren begzadian
 paikhar, son of a former ambassador of the armenian republic in baku.
 paikhar wrote a letter to hitler, asking for german support to his
 armenian national socialist movement hossank and suggesting the
 creation of an armenian ss formation in order 
 
 "to educate the youth of liberated armenia according to the 
  spirit of the nazi ideas."
 
 he wanted to unite the armenians of the already occupied territories
 of the ussr in his movement and with them conquer historic turkish
 homeland. paikhar was confined to serving the nazis in goebbels
 propaganda ministry as a speaker for armenian- and french-language
 radio broadcastings.[1] the armenian-language broadcastings were
 produced by yet another nazi armenian viguen chanth.[2]

 the establishment of armenian units in the german army was favored
 by general dro (the butcher). he played an important role in the
 establishment of the armenian 'legions' without assuming any 
 official position. his views were represented by his men in the
 respective organs. an interesting meeting took place between dro
 and reichsfuehrer-ss heinrich himmler toward the end of 1942.
 dro discussed matters of collaboration with himmler and after
 a long conversation, asked if he could visit pow camp close to
 berlin. himmler provided dro with his private car.[1] 
 
 a minor problem was that some of the soviet nationals were not
 'aryans' but 'subhumans' according to the official nazi philosophy.
 as such, they were subject to german racism. however, armenians
 were the least threatened and indeed most privileged. in august 
 1933, armenians had been recognized as aryans by the bureau of
 racial investigation in the ministry for domestic affairs.
