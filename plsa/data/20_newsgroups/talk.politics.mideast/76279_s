 what gives the us the right to keep new york?  it is the home of the
 united nations as well as being home to a myriad of ethnic groups.
 
 (actually, nyc is more comparable to the gaza strip; the controlling
 authority would probably be pleased as punch to unload it on someone
 else -- but no-one seems to want it!  :-)

 a-historical bullshit.  shamir fought the british (who, incidentally,
 shipped whole shiploads of jews back to the nazis for extermination
 and hung those jewish fighters that they captured and didn't want to
 deal with anymore).  shamir did not attack civilians on airliners,
 cruise ships, in airports, sports events, movie theaters, markets,
 on buses and children in schoolyards.  your comparison to a master
 murderer like abu nidal is blind!
