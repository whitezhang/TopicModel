 henrik (?),
 
 your ignorance manifests itself in an awkward form of intransigence. i'm not
 going to spend time to review with you the recent history of cyprus. if you are

 relax! you're swinging fists into open air... i was *agreeing* with you,
 assuming that would be one of your points that you did not state! you may 
 not be very much used to it, to be agreed with - that is, but take it more
