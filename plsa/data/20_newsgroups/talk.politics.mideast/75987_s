 "i was soon asleep. in the night i was awakened by the persistent crying of
  a child. i arose and went to investigate. a full moon enabled me to make
  my way about and revealed to me all the wreck and litter of the tragedy
  that had been enacted. guided by the child's crying, i entered the yard of
  a house, which i judged from its appearance must have been the home of a
  turkish family. there in a corner of the yard i found a women dead. her
  throat had been cut. lying on her breast was a small child, a girl about a
  year old."
