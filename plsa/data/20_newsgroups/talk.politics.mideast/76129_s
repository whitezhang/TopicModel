 actually, islam postulates that the jews have deliberately falsified the
 written bible for nefarious purposes, and thus the jewish claim to the
 land of israel is nullified.  that does not leave much room for jews
 to manuever, whether they live as dhimmis in dar al-islam, or as enemies
 in dar al-har.
