 
 dear pete,
 
 for one who is so zionist as you, you should at least know your
 hebrew, young man.
 
 the last sentence in your posting should read:
 
 medina achat leshnai amim (not echad medionnot leshtai amim).
 
 i don't want to address your comments. they speak for themselves.
 
 best regards from a palestinian of jewish origin who talks, reads and writes
 hebrew and does not hate jews nor anybody else.
