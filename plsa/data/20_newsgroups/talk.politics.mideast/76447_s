    i think the answer to mr. mayamsky's question can be found in the
 	 		 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^(mr. mamaysky's)
    first amendment to the us constitution.
 
 	   amendment i                                           (1791)
 
 	   congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of
 	   religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or
 	   abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the
 	   right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition
 	   the government for a redress of grievances.

 i do not say that freedom of speech should be banned. far from it.
 i am merely suggesting that there are certain things which can be
 universally agreed to be morally incorrect. there are not many such
 things. but there are some. as an example:
 
 (1) murder is morally incorrect
 
 (2) the idea that one group of people is somehow racially inferior to
 another is morally incorrect
 
 etc.
 
 the point is that any action which serves to promote a morally
 incorrect action should be forbidden. this implies that no one has the
 right to say that an innocent person should be murdered. regardless of
 freedom of speech, i may not stand on a street corner and advocate the
 murder of innocent people. the reason for this is that murder is a
 morally incorrect action.
 
 in the same way, since bigotry is morally incorrect in the narrow
 definition which we have given it, (2), i, nor any one else, has the
 right to stand on a street corner and promote bigotry. such an
 enforcement does in no way deny any one their rights as guaranteed by
 the first amendment. it merely ensures that no person may be the
 target of an attempt to deny him a fundamental moral right, such as
 the right to not be murdered, and the right not to be discriminated
 against.
 
 i believe, mr. berson, that to blindly accept the constitution is a
 terrific mistake. we must cinstantly question the constitution and
 interpret it in a way befitting the society in which we live. anything
 short of such an effort would render us little more than trained
 monkeys, who are able to merely repeat what they have heard without
 paying the slightest bit of attention to the intent of the document in
 question.
 
 would you disagree, mr.berson?
