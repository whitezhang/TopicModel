 	quite a few people couldn't have cared less about what
 happened to the jews of europe.  if they had cared, they would have
 done something.

 	maybe its because many of us, who have been on usenet for
 several years remember tripe like this being posted:

 	this was posted fairly recently.  there has been much more
 racist stuff in the past.  why are we expected to listen to it and
 remain "calm?"  i don't think that listening to racist or anti-semetic
 slurs is an incitement to calm debate.
 
 	perhaps you don't mean to be coming off as highly offensive.
 however, the way you have posted seems to be typical of those who have
 an irrational dislike for israel and jews.  perhaps if you took a
 close look at what you've posted thought a bit about the combatative
 tone you've used, you would see why people are reacting the way they
 are.
