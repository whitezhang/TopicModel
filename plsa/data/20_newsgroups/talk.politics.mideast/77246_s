 please cite specific examples where an arab party member was rejected
 while a jewish party member was accepted.  if you examine these i am
 sure you will discover that the arab party member did not have the power
 base that his jewish counterpart had.  the party structure in israel
 has changed quite a bit insofar as knesset member elections go.  knesset
 members for most parties are now elected via primaries.  the top standing
 members end up with cabinet posts.  this is purely a political power
 issue.  check the ranking of arab labor party members, as opposed
 to jewsih members and let me know which posts are held by jews that
 ranked lower in the party than their arab fellow electees.
 
 once again, if for arguments sake, all the arab israelis were to vote
 for labor at the next election, you can rest assured that the number of
 arab mks and cabinet members would increase proportionately to the
 power shift.

 you are overlooking the fact that they wield political power
 as individuals based upon a wider collective power base.

 the reasoning i see at work is purely political.  as far as security
 goes i think that some serious gaffs were made by right wing jews
 as well - e.g. sharon.
