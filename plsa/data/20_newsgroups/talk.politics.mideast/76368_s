 nobody ever produced the meagerest evidence for this.  it does not
 appear in several long published accounts by irgun participants.
 even some irgun propagandists do not make this claim.

 several members of the irgun attacking party, including the leader,
 deposited personal declarations in the irgun archives (jabotinsky
 institute, tel-aviv) which state that the lehi proposed to "liquidate
 the village after the conquest".  it seems the begin overruled
 this plan, however the willingness of many of the attackers to
 seriously consider this possibility serves as instructive
 character evidence.

 the haganah tried to get the irgun to attack a village with
 real military significance, but it was considered too hard.  
 the soft target of deir yassin was chosen instead.

 there was intention (probably originating with begin) to give such
 a warning but the loudspeaker truck got stuck in a ditch before
 reaching the village.  everyone knows that.

 by all rational standards, you should be posting from b-cpu.

 a lie repeated is still a lie.
