 	not necessarily.  as shai points out, political appointments are
 based on power.  they are also based on favors owed, coalition
 building, and deal making.  while this may have a racist element to
 it, i think that its much more fair to attribute it to the "old boy"
 nature of politics.  now, i'll freely admit that the old boy system
 has racist and sexist effects, but i don't think that those are its
 purpose, whether in the us, israel, or elsewhere.

 	here again, you miss out on the old boy nature of politics,
 and the existance of back-room deals.  as individuals, these arabs may
 not be as well connected as the jew who gets the job.  i don't like
 this aspect of politics, but i understand it exists.
