 	100% israeli citizens.  the ethnic composition depends on what
 you mean by formed.  what the un deeded to israel?  what it won in war?

 	were there anti-trust laws in place in mandatory palestine?
 since the answer is no, you're argument, while interestingly
 constructed, is irrelevant.  i will however, respond to a few points
 you assert in the course of talking about anti-trust laws.

 	jews often paid far more than fair market value for the land
 they bought.
 
 >they did not know they were victims of an international conspiracy.
 
 	you know, sam, when people start talking about an
 international jewish conspiracy, its really begins to sound like
 anti-semitic bull.
 
 	the reason there is no conspiracy here is quite simple.
 zionists made no bones about what was going on.  there were
 conferences, publications, etc, all talking about creating a national
 home for the jews.

 	because you've never heard of it, its dead?  the fact is, you
 claimed israel had to give arabs rights because of (non-existant)
 international aid.  then you see that that argument has a hole you
 could drive a truck through, and again assert that israel is only
 democratic within the (unexplained) constraints of one ethnic group.
 the problem with that argument is that arabs are allowed to vote for
 whoever they please.  so, please tell me, sam, what constraints are
 there on israeli democracy that don't exist in other democratic
 states?
 
 	i've never heard anything about the khazakistani arab
 population.  does that mean that they have no history or roots?  when
 i was at ben gurion university in israel, one of my neighbors was an
 israeli arab.  he wasn't really all that different from my other
 neighbors.  does that make him dead or oppressed?

 	how recent is recent?  i can probably build a case for a
 jewish gaza city.  it would be pretty silly, but i could do it.  i'm
 arguing not that jerusalem is jewish, but that land has no ethnicity.
