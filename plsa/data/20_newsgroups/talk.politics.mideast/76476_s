 in the following report: _turkey eyes regional role_ ankara, turkey (ap)
 april 27, 1993, we find in the last paragraph:
 
 [turanist] although premier suleyman demirel criticized ozal's often
 [turanist] brash calls for more turkish influence, he also has spoken
 [turanist] of a swath of turkic peoples "stretching from the adriatic
 [turanist] sea to the great wall of china."
 
 who does demirel think he is fooling? it seems at both ends of his envisioned 
 pan-turkic empire -- the balkans and the caucasus -- turkey's fascist boasts
 are being pre-empted.
 
 i would suggest turkey let the world feel some of their "grey wolf teeth", and
 attempt to stretch from the adriatic to china! turkey will have cried "wolf"
 just once too much!
