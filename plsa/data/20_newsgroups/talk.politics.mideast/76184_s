    final solution for the gaza ghetto ?
    ------------------------------------
 
    while israeli jews fete the uprising of the warsaw ghetto, they
    repress by violent means the uprising of the gaza ghetto and
    attempt to starve the gazans.
 
    [...]
 
 elias should the families of the children who were stabbed in their
 high school by a palestinian "freedom fighter" be the ones who offer
 their help to the gazans. perhaps it should be the families of the 18
 israelis who were murdered last month by palestinian "freedom
 fighters".
 
 the jews in the warsaw ghetto were fighting to keep themselves and
 their families from being sent to nazi gas chambers. groups like hamas
 and the islamic jihad fight with the expressed purpose of driving all
 jews into the sea. perhaps, we should persuade jewish people to help
 these wnderful "freedom fighters" attain this ultimate goal.
 
 maybe the "freedom fighters" will choose to spare the co-operative jews.
 is that what you are counting on, elias - the pity of murderers.
 
 you say your mother was jewish. how ashamed she must be of her son. i
 am sorry, mrs. davidsson.
