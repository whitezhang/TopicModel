 please list the names of some of those neutral reporters that were killed
 in the "o.t.".  it is also interesting to note that at the outbreak of
 the intifada, palestinian parties quickly began orchestrating their
 demonstrations for the benefit of the media.  having spoken to a danish
 reporter who covered the initfada, i know of at least one case where
 he found out that a "mass demonstration" on the outskirts of gaza was
 setup for himself and his colleagues.  when i asked whether the footage
 shot was sent he replied affirmatively, "after all, it did happen."
 when this became the case, the idf began closing sensitive trouble
 spots to reporters.
