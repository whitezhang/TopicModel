 gimme a break.  capital letters, or not, the above is pure nonsense.  it
 seems to me that short sighted armenians are escalating the hostilities
 while hoping that turkey will stay out.  stop and think for a moment,
 will you?  armenia doesn't need anyone to drag her into the conflict, it
 is a part of it.

 huh?  you didn't expect azeri's to be friendly to forces fighting with them
 within their borders?

 you're not playing with a full deck, are you?  where would turkey invade?
 are you throwing the cyprus buzzword around with s.c.g. in the header
 in hopes that the greek netters will jump the gun?  yes indeed turkey
 has the military prowess to intervene, what she wishes she had, however, is 
 the diplomatic power to stop the hostilities and bring the parties to the
 negotiating table.  that's hard to do when armenians are attacking azeri 
 towns.  armenian leaders are lacking the statesmanship to recognize the 
 futility of armed conflict and convince their nation that a compromise that 
 leads to stability is much better than a military faits accomplis that's 
 going to cause incessant skirmishes.  think of 10 or 20 years down the 
 line -- both of the newly independent countries need to develop economically
 and neither one is going to wipe the other out.  these people will be
 neighbors, would it not be better to keep the bad blood between them minimal?
 
 if you belong to the armenian diaspora, keep in mind that what strikes
 your fancy on the map is costing the local armenians dearly in terms of their
 blood and future.  it's easy to be comfortable abroad and propagandize 
 craziness to have your feelings about turks tickled.  the armenians
 in armenia and n-k will be there, with the same people you seem to hate 
 as their neighbors, for maybe 3000 years more.  the sooner there's peace in
 the region the better it is for them and everyone else.  i'd push for
 compromise if i were you instead of hitting the caps-lock and spreading
 inflammatory half-truths.
 
 cheers,
