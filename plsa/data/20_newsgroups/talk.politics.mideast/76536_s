 mentioning that turkic people are wide-spread means desiring a turkish empire?
 is that the logical thing to conclude from a statement like that? 
 to me it just says that turkey may have economical benefits from that
 if she can be competitive enough. no more than that. but of course
 you have the freedom of extrapolating as you wish from any statement.
 
 one question: in what context did ozal use the words you are quoting?
 can you give the whole speech.
