 [(*] well, does it change the fact that during the period of 1914 to 1920, 
 [(*] the armenian government ordered, incited, assisted and participated

 muslim race? muslim national origin? you fool!

 no. the azeri population of armenia in 1988, after anti-armenian pogroms in
 azerbaijan, was kicked out and sent to azerbaijan. the remaining muslims 
 stayed in armenia!

 [(*]                   university press, new york, 1983, pp. 133-144.
 
 let's check it out! on page 121 of this turkish suggested reference we read:
 
  "the 1927 turkish census registered not one person of the gregorian armenian
   faith in van, only one in bayazit, and twelve in erzurum. a people who had
   lived in eastern anatolia since before recorded history were simply gone."

 [(*]                  1985.
 
 let's check it out, but first of all the complete title of this reference
 includes the words "1830-1914". thus such a reference cannot support the 
 above claimed garbage! however, since this is a turkish suggested reference,
 on pages 51 and on table i2-b it states there were 2.4 million armenians in
 turkey from 1844-1856. i guess they "were simply gone" after wwi!

 [(*]                         los angeles), 1967, pp. 13, 37.
 
 let's check it out! on page 48 of this turkish-suggested reference, under
 sub-title, "deportation and massacre of turkish armenians" it states:
 
  "several authors assert that armenian resistance at van constituted a key
   factor in the turkish evacuation of persia and motivated the ittihadist
   [young turk] leaders to annihilate the turkish armenians. the question of
   responsibility for the massacres or deportation of nearly all ottoman
   armenians has evolved into a polemic. hundreds of books, articles, and
   documents have been published to describe the horrifying scenes of violence
   and death. many writers, such as the british bryce and toynbee, french pinon,
   german lepsius, american morganthau and gibbons, have insisted that the
   massacres were predetermined and ruthlessly executed. the have refuted the
   ottoman government's official publications and justifications by
   substantiating that anti-armenian measures were deliberated by the 
   ittihadists even before the outbreak of war. the fact remains than an 
   estimated eight hundred thousand to over a million armenians perished within
   a few months, and several hundred thousand more succumbed in the following
   years to the ravages of disease, famine, and refugee life. unknown numbers
   of women and children were converted forcibly to islam, possessed by
   turkish men, or adopted by moslem families."

 stanford shaw is a paid liar/revisionist for the turkish government, and has
 been exposed as a plagiarizer! for example:
 
 experts from an interview (in greek) with professor spyros vryonis (from nyc's
 national herald, 3/12/93) [thanks, mr. g.b.]
 
  "few people know of the problem i faced at ucla when professor stanford
   shaw was due for promotion. i knew him to be turkey's man; due to my
   reading knowledge of turkish and my seniority over him, i was a member
   of the promotion committee. for that case, i sat down and read his entire
   treatise "history of the ottoman empire and modern turkey". it took me
   three months and i found out, from volume i, that he had plagiarized 
   uzun jarsoglu, an eminent turkish specialist on ottoman history. shaw
   himself claimed in his introduction that his treatise was the outcome 
   of a 20-year search through the ottoman archives. well, i went on leave  
   and managed to show 40% of volume i, containing around 5000 sentences, 
   to be the result of plagiarism, matching each sentence with passages    
   from the original work. he had even reproduced the errors. so i produced a
   500-pages manuscript and submitted a 60-pages report on shaw's plagiarism. 
 
   the university, however, rejected my report and, after a closed meeting,
   promoted stanford shaw to distinguished professor. i paid a price for 
   all this: upset by the whole process, i confronted the entire university
   structure and was considered to be a chauvinist and madman. i asked for
   permission to run a seminar on shaw's book that was denied by the president
   of the university. while the center for near eastern studies granted me
   permission, the president was depriving me of my academic freedom. luckily,
   the dean refused to give in and i did run the seminar, attended by more 
   than 150 academic people, in which i uncovered stanford shaw, who refused
   to attend. as a punishment, the university froze all my raises."
 
 [5] "gochnak" (armenian newspaper published in the united states), may 24, 
               1915.
 
 no chance! there was no may 24th, 1915 issue of gochnak!
