 all muslims knew that the whole thing was set up to destroy iraq, not
 to "liberate kuwait", the people who were killed by the invasion are
 more (many many more), than the ones that were killed by the iraqis
 in their smaller invasion. i lived in the west, and i have seen how 
 your media prepared you (helpless naive americans) for a war against
 iraq even before the artificial conflict between iraq and kuwait that
 led to the invasion, as the cia correctly predicted (and pretended to
 be surprised not to know).
 it just happened that saddam was so predictible and so arrogant and stupid.
 
 what would i have done: most muslims would choose 300 dead kuwaitis over
 200,000 dead iraqis and 1000 dead kuwaitis. the first case would happen
 if no western intervention happened, and the second case was a direct
 or indirect result of western envolvement.
 
 human rights in kuwait? what about human rights in iraq? why the west
 gave saddam a green light to slaughter his own people? i will give my
 reason: because the rich kuwaitis do not mind to be your salves, so
 they deserve some democracy, but iraqis might not, so they don't.
 
 as simple as that, whether or not you want to admit it.

 not necessarily the best solution, my view of an islamic state (and
 that of turabi that your media made you hate) includes all the benefits
 of a secular state minus the injustices. did you ever read a book by
 rashid al-ghannoushi (tunisia), hassan turabi (sudan)? you only know
 about them from your self-censured, self-controlled media.
 
 if they make this kind of campaign against such a moderate thinker as
 turabi is, and keep quite about such an extremist muslim scholar as bin
 bez of saudi arabia is, it just does not encourage any moderation in
 our arab world.

 no it was not that, it was just some irrelevent stuff that i took out
 to go around the copyright (;-))
 
 i ceased to take the newyork times seriously. in issues concerning islam
 it has become one of the biggest enemies (although less than the other
 newyork daily since mortimer took it over). it lies, selects facts that
 fits its agenda and even prints racist and open anti-muslim editorials.
 
 what they claimed in that articles is a bunch of lies because while 
 the selected facts are true about some of those persons, the other members
 are actually defence lawyers and university science professors who wanted
 to fight corruption, uncover atrocities against opposition activists and
 shia minority, and generally increase awareness about the rights of all 
 citizens. the only thing that is common between those people is their concern
 for the deterioration of human rights since the saudi clan took a green
 light from america (after the gulf) to do whatever is necessary to stay
 in power. 
 
 
 do you know that all of the saudi ulema have been taught the same things?
 the ones in the official iftaa are as conservative as the ones that are
 opposing it. some of the members of the human rights committe are more
 pro-women and wanted to defend them, and that is precisely one reason that
 bin bez's fatwah  implied for the "illegality " of this committee
 and  for his claim that it represents "outside interests"
 
 there is a human rights issue in saudi arabia, and you and ny times chose
 to ignore the main issue and select some of the members of that committee
 and actually defend the actions done against them (including banning them
 from their jobs.
 
 what a hypocricy. i am not surprised really, this is not the first time.
 
 the official ulema are the most extremist anti-women meat-heads in saudi
 arabia, the west continues on its campaign to discredit itself in the
 muslim community, by supporting them. well after bosnia, i guess it has
 zero credibility to begin with, so what the heck.
 
 "idha lam tastahi faf'aal ma shi'it" (if you feel no shame, then do whatever 
 you want, hadith).  
 (actually a better translation of the meaning would be: "if you do not
 feel ashamed (from god), you will do whatever you want)
