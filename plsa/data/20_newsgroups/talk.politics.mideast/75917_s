     considering all the murders of innocent israelis at the hands 
     of arab death merchants, i see nothing wrong with the advice.

     as usual, the bias of the 'center for policy research' echoes
     through this newsgroup.  here we have an enraged likudnik who
     is venting his spleen, and you portray it as if this is going
     to become policy.  you don't say what the response to matza's
     suggestion was.  do do not mention whether he was refering to
     terrorists caught in the act, which could be a clear cut case
     of self-defence.  would you care to elaborate on this, or was
     this all you wanted to say on the matter.  why don't you give
     up this 'center for policy research' crap, and just post your  
     biases without trying to legitimize them with a pompous name?

     a laudable precaution.  
     
     every single thing you post about israel is posted to portray
     israel as negatively as you can.  deliberate omissions are an
     integral part of the shtick.  and it's not only the incidents
     that you do not mention, but even the stories you do post are
     fraught with omissions, which change the entire meaning.  the
     absurdity of your respectable name cannot hide your bias.
 
     in your effort to portray israel in an unfavorable light, you 
     have accomplished nothing, except to prove that a respectable 
     sounding label like the center for policy research is nothing 
     but a smoke screen for someone with a heavily biased attitude 
     against israel and the need to vent it.  
     
     this 'center for policy research' stuff is nonsense.
