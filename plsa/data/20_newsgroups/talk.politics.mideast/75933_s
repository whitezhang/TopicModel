 	you mean he talks about those jews, who, because of their self
 hatred, spend all their time attacking judaism, jews, and israel,
 using the most despicable of anti-semetic stereotypes?
 
 	i don't think we need to coin a term like "jedeo-nazism" to
 refer to those jews who, in their endless desire to be accepted by the
 nazis, do their dirty work for them.  we can just call them house
 jews, fools, or anti-semites from jewish families.
 
 	i think "house jews," a reference to a person of jewish
 ancestry who issues statements for a company or organization that
 condemn judaism is perfectly sufficeint.  i think a few years free of
 their anti-semetic role models would do wonders for most of them.
