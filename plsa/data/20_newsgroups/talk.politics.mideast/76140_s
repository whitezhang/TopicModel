 i understand how israel captured the teritory and feels that it
 is its right to annex it. i can't fully understand why it has
 to deal with palestinians much the same way jews were treated
 before the holocaust (the final solution) by hitler. what i
 totally don't get is why the u.s. has to subsidize the
 existance of such a thorough abuser of human rights.
 				just wondering
