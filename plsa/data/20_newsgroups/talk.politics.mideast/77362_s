 don't be so vague. let us reexamine it - shall we?

 here you descend into total inanity. your inability to distinguish
 between 'the cold-blooded genocide of muslim people by the armenians' 
 and 'the armenian war' is incredible. now, please provide us with your 
 corrections.
 
 source: stanford j. shaw, on armenian collaboration with invading russian
 armies in 1914, "history of the ottoman empire and modern turkey (volume
 ii: reform, revolution & republic: the rise of modern turkey, 1808-1975)."
 (london, cambridge university press 1977). pp. 315-316.
 
 "in april 1915 dashnaks from russian armenia organized a revolt in the city 
  of van, whose 33,789 armenians comprised 42.3 percent of the population, 
  closest to an armenian majority of any city in the empire...leaving erivan 
  on april 28, 1915, armenian volunteers reached van on may 14 and organized 
  and carried out a general slaughter of the local muslim population during 
  the next two days."
 
 "knowing their numbers would never justify their territorial ambitions,
  armenians looked to russia and europe for the fulfillment of their aims.
  armenian treachery in this regard culminated at the beginning of the first
  world war with the decision of the revolutionary organizations to refuse
  to serve their state, the ottoman empire, and to assist instead other
  invading russian armies. their hope was their participation in the russian
  success would be rewarded with an independent armenian state carved out of
  ottoman territories. armenian political leaders, army officers, and common
  soldiers began deserting in droves."
 
 "with the russian invasion of eastern anatolia in 1914 at the beginning of
  world war i, the degree of armenian collaboration with the ottoman's enemy
  increased drastically. ottoman supply lines were cut by guerilla attacks,
  armenian revolutionaries armed armenian civil populations, who in turn
  massacred the muslim population of the province of van in anticipation of
  expected arrival of the invading russian armies."
 
 "...meanwhile, czar nicholas ii himself came to the caucasus to make final
  plans for cooperation with the armenians against the ottomans, with the 
  president of the armenian national bureau in tiflis declaring in response:
 
  'from all countries armenians are hurrying to enter the ranks of the 
   glorious russian army, with their blood to serve the victory of russian
   arms...let the russian flag wave freely over the dardanelles and the
   bosporus. let, with your will, great majesty, the peoples remaining
   under the turkish yoke receive freedom. let the armenian people of turkey
   who have suffered for the faith of christ receive resurrection for a new
   free life under the protection of russia.'[155]
 
 armenians again flooded into the czarist armies. preparations were made
 to strike the ottomans from the rear, and the czar returned to st. petersburg
 confident that the day finally had come for him to reach istanbul."

 "an armenian state was organized at van under russian protection, and it 
  appeared that with the muslim natives dead or driven away, it might be
  able to maintain itself at one of the oldest centers of ancient armenian
  civilization. an armenian legion was organized 'to expel the turks from
  the entire southern shore of the lake in preparation for a concerted
  russian drive into the bitlis vilayet.'[162] thousands of armenians from
  mus and other major centers in the east began to flood into the new 
  armenian state...by mid-july there were as many as 250,000 armenians
  crowded into the van area, which before the crisis had housed and fed
  no more than 50,000 people, muslim and non-muslim alike.[163]"

 i went through this just a few weeks ago; here it comes again. the 
 entire turkish population of armenia (which armenians called tartars) 
 constituted at least about 40% of the total population of armenia 
 was deliberately exterminated. (for the population statistics, please 
 look to the book of richard hovannessian, "armenia on the road to 
 independence.") i listed three books earlier of such a monstrous crime 
 by the writings of one armenian, one american, and one british. they 
 are: "men are like that" by leonard r. hartill; "adventures in the near 
 east" by a. rawlinson; "world alive, a personal story" by robert dunn. 
 also, i personally have copies of documents of this crime by the writings 
 of two armenians and also one american. the official british report about 
 this massacre mentioned in one of these documents (lord curzon-aharonin 
 interview) is the report of the british high commissioner to caucasia, 
 sir oliver wardrop.
 
 
 "an appropriate analogy with the jewish holocaust might be the
  systematic extermination of the entire muslim population of 
  the independent republic of armenia which consisted of at 
  least 30-40 percent of the population of that republic. the 
  memoirs of an armenian army officer who participated in and 
  eye-witnessed these atrocities was published in the u.s. in
  1926 with the title 'men are like that.' other references abound."
