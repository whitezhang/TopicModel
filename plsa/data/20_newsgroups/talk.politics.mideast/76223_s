 first of all i never said the holocaust. i said before the
 holocaust. i'm not ignorant of the holocaust and know more
 about nazi germany than most people (maybe including you). 
 	what i resent is ignorant statements that call people
 names when they disagree with your position. opposing the
 atrocities commited by the israeli governement hardly qualifies
 as anti-semitism. if you think name calling is a valid form of
 argument in intellectual circles, you need to get out more
 often.
 	i don't think the suffering of some jews during wwii
 justifies the crimes commited by the israeli government. any
 attempt to call civil liberterians like myself anti-semetic is
 not appreciated.
