 well, does it change the fact that during the period of 1914 to 1920, 
 the armenian government ordered, incited, assisted and participated 
 in the genocide of 2.5 million muslim people because of race, religion
 and national origin?
 
 1) armenians did slaughter the entire muslim population of van.[1,2,3,4,5]
 2) armenians did slaughter 42% of muslim population of bitlis.[1,2,3,4]
 3) armenians did slaughter 31% of muslim population of erzurum.[1,2,3,4]
 4) armenians did slaughter 26% of muslim population of diyarbakir.[1,2,3,4]
 5) armenians did slaughter 16% of muslim population of mamuretulaziz.[1,2,3,4]
 6) armenians did slaughter 15% of muslim population of sivas.[1,2,3,4]
 7) armenians did slaughter the entire muslim population of the x-soviet
    armenia.[1,2,3,4]
