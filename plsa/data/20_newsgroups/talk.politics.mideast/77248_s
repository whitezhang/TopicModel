 biden spoke well.  then there was john major, the architect of the
 betrayal of bosnian muslims to genocide.  
 
 he basically has given yet another green light to hvo ustashe and
 mladic-chetnik serial killers, rapists, and plunderers to continue their
 genocide against bosnian muslims.
 
 but major met with mr. rushdie and said it was "unacceptable" that iran
 should have a death decree on him.  while i disagree personally with
 fetwas against hack writers like rushdie (it only helps them sell more
 books), i find it interesting that mr. major finds the genocide of two
 million muslims in bosnia acceptable, but a threat against one single
 popular british writer "unacceptable."
