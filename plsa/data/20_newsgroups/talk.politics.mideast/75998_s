 thessaloniki is called thessaloniki by its inhabitants for the last 2300 years.
 the city was never called solun by its inhabitants.
 instabul was called konstantinoupolis from 320 ad until about the 1920s.
 that's about 1600 years. there many people alive today who were born in a city
 called konstantinoupolis. how many people do you know that were born in a city 
 called solun.
