   please clarify your standards for rules of engagement.  as i
   understand it, israelis are at all times and under all
   circumstances fair targets.  their opponents are legitimate
   targets only when mirandized, or some such?
 
   i'm sure that this makes perfect sense if you grant *a*priori*
   that israelis are the black hats, and that therefore killing
   them is automatically a good thing (go hezbollah!).  the
   corollary is that the hezbollah are the white hats, and that
   whatever they do is a good thing, and the israelis only prove
   themselves to be bad guys by attacking them.
 
   this sounds suspiciously like a hockey fan i know, who cheers
   when one of the players on his team uses his stick to permanently
   rearrange an opponent's face, and curses the ref for penalizing
   his side.  of course, when it's different when the roles are
   reversed.
