 on religion, race and ethnicity is at the door! stand back all. let 
 him through. he's going to single-handedly rescue islam from all these
 dastardly mistakes, misquotes, misconceptions.

      did it occur to you that there is such a thing as bosnian serbs
 who aren't necessarily outsiders? and while you're at it, could you

 and, in essence, doing the same thing? how come we don't hear your 
 wonderful treatises on what's happening
 out there?
