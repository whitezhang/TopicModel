 bring me one case where israeli soldiers deliberately killed a "neutral 
 reporter".  this is another one of your wet dreams.
 
 unlike many countries, israel does allow reporters in and out of the o.t. 
 that is what the problem is. if israel were a country like china, then 
 nothing would transpire from what is happening in the o.t. but there
 seems to be a proliferation of journalists in israel always trying to show
 how evil the israeli monster is. arab countries don't allow journalists 
 anywhere, we have yet to hear about the massacres of kurds, the destruction
 and annihilation of hama, the killings of moslem fundamentalists in mosques
 in egypt and algeria etc... why is it we only get state reports? how accurate
 are they?
 anas, go give a lesson of freedom of speech to your arab bretheren before
 telling us what to do.
