 although the hebrew expression le'um is used, the id card specifically states on
 the 2nd page: ezrachut yisrealit: israeli citizen. this is true for all
 israeli citizens no matter what their ethnicity. in the united states most
 official forms have race (caucasian, black, amerindian, etc.).

 funny, i have a number of maps and all of them have fixed borders.

 apart from mordechai vanunu who had a trial behind closed doors, there was one
 other espionage case (the nutty professor at the nes ziona biological
 institute who was a k.g.b. mole) who was tried "in camera". i wouldn't exactly
 call it a state secret. the trial was simply tried behind closed doors. i hate
 to disappoint you but the united states has tried a number of espionage cases
 in camera.

 not jews. israeli citizens. jordanian law is in effect in the west bank but the
 knesset passed a law that israeli law would be binding on israeli citizens
 residing in the west bank. these citizens could be jews, israeli muslims, druze,
 or israeli christians. it has nothing to do with religion.

 anyone who was registered (jew, muslim, christian) could return. you might be
 confusing this with the census taken in june 1967 on the west bank after the
 six day war. in *this* instance, if the arab was not physically present he
 couldn't reside on the west bank (e.g. if he had been visting jordan).

 no. not even if you drowned him in bourbon, scotch or brandy :-)

 not true. although a minority, there *are* some israeli arabs living on
 kibbutzim. on the other hand, at my age (42) i wouldn't be admitted to a
 kibbutz nor could the family join me. not that i would be so thrilled to do so
 in the first place. the kibbbutz movement places candidates under rigorous
 membership criteria. many israeli jews are not admitted.

 the religious status quo in israel has marriage and divorce  handled by the
 religious courts. the rabbanut handles marriage and divorce for jews, the
 muslim shaaria  courts are for muslims, the christian denominations have their
 religious courts, and the druze have their own courts. the entire religious
 establishment (jewish, muslim, druze, christian) wants to keep it that way.

 i believe it's adjacent to a former muslim cemetary. from what i heard (and i'd
 like to get feedback from muslins  on the net) sanctity of cemetaries is not
 held that sancrosanct as it is held by jews. the current israeli ministry of
 trade and industry on agron road in jerusalem is housed in a former hotel that
 was built by arabs in the 1920's on the site of an arab cemetary.
