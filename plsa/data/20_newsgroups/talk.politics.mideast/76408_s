    you know ed,...  you're right!  andi shouldn't be comparing
    israel to the nazis.  the israelis are much worse than the
    nazis ever were anyway.  the nazis did a lot of good for
    germany, and they would have succeeded if it weren't for the
    damn jews.  the holocaust never happened anyway.  ample
    evidence given by george schafer at harvard, dept. of history,
    and even by randolph higgins at nyu, have shown that the
    holocaust was just a semitic conspiracy created to obtain
    sympathy to piush for the creation of israel.

    just kidding.
 
 be careful rj3s. when people start finding humour in the holocaust
 they often run the danger of exposing themselves for the hateful
 refuse that they really are.
