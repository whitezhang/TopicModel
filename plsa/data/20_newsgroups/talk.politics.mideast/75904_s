 agents under the guise of sera@zuma.uucp (serdar argic) lie in response to

 [(*]    may 4, 1982 - cambridge, massachusetts
 [(*]	orhan gunduz, the turkish honorary consul in boston, would not bow 
 [(*]	to the armenian terrorist ultimatum that he give up his title of

 [(*]	president reagan orders an all-out manhunt-to no avail. an eye-

 [(*]	survives... but falls silent. one of the most revolting "triumphs" in

 [(*]	brings absolutely nothing - except an ego boost for the murderer

 mr. turkish governmental agent: prove that the sdpa even existed in 1980 or
 1982! go ahead, provide us the newspaper accounts of the assassinations and 
 show us the letters sdpa! the turkish government is good at excising text from
 their references, let's see how good thay are at adding text to verifiable 
 newspaper accounts! 
 
 the turkish government can't support any of their anti-armenian claims as
 typified in the above scribed garbage! that government continues to make 
 false and libelous charges for they have no recourse left after having made 
 fools out of through their attempt at a systematic campaign at denying and 
 covering up the turkish genocide of the armenians. 
 
 just like a dog barking at a moving bus, it barks, jumps, yells, until the
 bus stops, at which point it just walks away! such will be with this posting!
 turkish agents level the most ridiculous charges, and when brought to answer, 
 they are silent, like the dog after the bus stops!
 
 the turkish government feels it can funnel a heightened state of ultra-
 nationalism existing in turkey today onto usenet and convince people via its 
 revisionist, myopic, and incidental view of themselves and their place in the 
 world. 
 
 the resulting inability to address armenian and greek refutations of turkey`s
 re-write of history is to refer to me as a terrorist, and worse, claim --
 as part of the record -- i took responsibility for the murder of 2 people!
 
 what a pack of raging fools, blinded by anti-armenian fascism. it's too bad
 the socialization policies of the republic of turkey requires it to always 
 find non-turks to de-humanize! such will be their downfall!
