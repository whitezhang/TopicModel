 let me clearify mr. turkish;
 
 armenia is not getting "itchy". she is simply letting the world know that she
 will no  longer sit there quiet and let turks get away with their famous 
 tricks. armenians do remember of the turkish invasion of the greek island of
 cypress while the world simply watched.
