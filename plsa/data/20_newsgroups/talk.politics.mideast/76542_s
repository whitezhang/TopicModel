 i asked some simple questions at different occations. i don't understand why
 some people insulted me for those simple questions!
 anyway, i didn't reply to them with the same language and i won't, because
 
 1. there is no need
 2. there is no benefit 
 3. i don't have time  to reply to those garbages
 
 by the way, do you want to know who am i? i am not a nationalist arab of 1967.
  i am not a comonist arab of 70's. are you sure that you want to hear
  my name? i am a muslim fighter. i am the same child who 
 fight with your armed soldier with stone! i am the same guy who wants to 
 bring justice to palestine, i am the same fighter who wants to kicked israel
 out of south lebonon in the same way of the  1982. i am the son of khomeini.
 i am honored to be a hezbullah.... don't you know me!!!? just ask rabin
 he knows me!
