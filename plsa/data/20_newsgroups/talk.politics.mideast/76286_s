 
    andy beyer has claimed that the israeli press is a bit biased.
 but the fact is that there are events shaping the politics of the
 mideast that people who do not read the israeli press simply know
 nothing about.  many of these events are not even mentioned here.
 i read the israeli press to learn of important events about which
 you know nothing, because of your total reliance on western media
 for your information on israel.  since i read both american media
 and israeli media, i can say with absolute certainty that anybody
 who reliesx exclusively on the american press for knowledge about
 israel does not have a true picture of what is going on.
 
    as to the claim that israeli papers are biased, of course they
 are.  some may lean to the right or the left, just like the media
 here in america.  but they still report events about which people
 here know nothing.  i choose to form my opinions about israel and
 the mideast based on more knowledge than does an average american
 who relies exclusively on an american media which does not report
 on events in the mideast with any consistency or accuracy.
