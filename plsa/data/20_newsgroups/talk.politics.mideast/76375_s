 	none of you guys noticed my "gross mistake" 'cause you
 don't have a clue. i noticed the misspeaking myself and
 corrected it. i doubt you would have ever noticed.

 subject. ah yes and like you lived in the greater deutschland.

 you guys are funny. it's funny to see people lose control and
 start the name calling when they realize they have no point.

 	i understand how individual liberties (freedom of
 speach, religion etc.) could be a thing you "never heard
 about". actually, civil libertarians believe in the fundamental
 freedoms that belong to human beings. they would support the
 jews against the nazis or anyone else who tries to oppress them
 and they would support the arabs against the israelis and any
 other such oppressive regimes (iraq etc.)
