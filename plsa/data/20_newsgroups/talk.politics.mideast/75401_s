 this is very funny.
 anyway, suppose that in fact israel didnot attack jordan till jordan attacked
 israel. now, how do you explain the attack on syria in 1967, syria didnot
 enter the war with israel till the 4th day .
 
 by the way it is funny that you are implying that the reason behind 1967
 by israel was only to capture sinai, egypt !
