 
 there are basically three alternatives for gaza:
 
 1.  to throw the jews to the sea. that is basically to make them leave
    the middle-east and go back to where they came from (russia, europe, usa, etc)
 2.  to throw the gazans into the sea, in accordance with yitzhak rabin's
      wish and that of many zionists.
 3.  for israelis and palestinians to come to an honorable and fair (i
    don't attempt to say just) settlement, which would allow each person
    to live in dignity in his country in freedom and equality.
 
 i personnaly opt for the third alternative. how about you folks ?
