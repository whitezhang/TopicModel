 the whole "saddam is going to invade saudi arabia" was nothing but us state
 department propeganda.  saddam (and iraq in general) never recognised the 
 british created kuwait.  they were trying to recover land they believed
 was theirs, much like the argentines in the faulklands.  the kuwaitis pushed
 just a little too far by taking iraqi oil and saddam thought he'd settle
 the dispute the old fashioned way...
 everybody would have been much better off had they left the reunited iraq
 together and concentrated on taking out saddam.  a strong, united iraq with
 an elected government would have gone a long way to ridding the world of
 the feudal dictatorships in the gulf.
 but of course a weak divided arab people better suits us foriegn policy...
 
 the us had no problem killing tens of thousands of ill-equipted iraqi soldiers,
 including burying several thousand alive and slaughtering retreating batallions
 from the air in defense of kuwaiti oil, but it has yet to lift a finger against
 bosnian serbs while they slaughter bosnian muslims....
