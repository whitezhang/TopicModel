 they certainly never called themselves "palestinians"

 coming from a soldier that can't surprise you.  eitan is now in
 charge of tsomet, and there's a reason why he only gets a few votes

 you don't understand metaphor, naziman.
 and your quotes lead nowhere.  not only do i doubt there actuality,
 but i guarantee they were compiled by some neo-nazi group.
 
 but i love your pseudo-intellectual approach.  it makes you
 sound even dumber than your conclusions.
