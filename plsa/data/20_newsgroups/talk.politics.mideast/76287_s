 sometime to kill some of these neutral reporters."  the assertion
 by anas omran is, of course, a total fabrication.  if there is an
 once of truth iin it, i'm sure anas omran can document such a sad
 and despicable event.  otherwise we may assume that it is another
 piece of anti-israel bullshit posted by someone whose family does
 not know how to teach their children to tell the truth.  if omran
 would care to retract this 'error' i would be glad to retract the
 accusation that he is a liar.  if he can document such a claim, i
 would again be glad to apologize for calling him a liar.  failing
 to do either of these would certainly show what a liar he is.
