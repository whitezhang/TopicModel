 
    i have read numerous posts over a period of several months, by
 this anti-israel fanatic, hiding in the shadow of the respectable
 sounding name of the 'center for policy research.'  obviously, it
 is no research center of any kind, unless 'researching' published
 documents to find material to use against israel makes it so.  
 
    labeling a propaganda mill a research center is not surprising
 in itself.  that is simply part of the propaganda process.  i was
 curious if anyone knew who this anti-israel fanatic hiding behind
 his phoney 'research center' name is.  is he an arab?  is he some
 typical anti-semite hiding behind a veneer of 'anti-zionism?'  is
 he some jew who perhaps lived in israel and just couldn't make it
 there, and is now taking his failure out on israel?  
 
    let's shed some light on this clown once and for all.  it will
 help put his nonsense in the proper perspective.  and the readers
 of this group who are more interested in fact than in anti-israel
 hyperbola can ignore this junk.
