 let me remind all of those muslim-haters out there who like to
 mention the mufti's cooperation with germany as a reason to let muslims
 be slaughtered everywhere in the world of the following facts:
 
 1)why blame the muslims for what the nazis did and forgive italy, the croats,
 and many other europeans for being real allies to hitler?
 
 2)why blame muslims for supporting germany the enemy of their enemy
 at the time (britain who colonized most of the middle east and was responsible
 for most atrocities against muslims in the region) and forgive germany itself
 eventhough it is the one who created nazism?
 
 3)as far as muslims are concerned : there was no difference between
 nazi germany, and antimuslim colonialist britain/france in 1940. they were
 all racist, anti-arab, and full of arrogance and hate. wwii and the wars 
 in algeria, sudan, and other places proved that very clearly. even anti-
 semitism was not more spread in germany than in france or britain, it just
 happened to be official policy in germany.
 
 and we will forgive you, just set our countries free.
 
 so any arguments about wwii behaviour coming from the people who
 killed millions in that war (from either side) is just plain laughable.
 enough said.
