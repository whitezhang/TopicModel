 i will again *repeat* my statement: 1) i *do not* condone these 
 *indiscriminate* israeli acts (nor have i *ever*, 2) if the villagers do not know who these "guerillas" are (which you stated earlier), how do you expect the
 israelis to know? it is **very** difficult to "identify" who they are (this
 *is why* the "guerillas" prefer to lose themselves in the general population 
 by dressing the same, acting the same, etc.).

 i agree; but, because lebanon was either unwilling or unable to stop these
 attacks from its territory should israel simply sit quietly and accept its
 situation? israel asked the lebanese government over and over to control
 this "third party state" within lebanese territory and the attacks kept
 occuring. at **what point** does israel (or any state) have the right to do
 something itself to stop such attacks? never?

 it is also the responsibility of *any* state to not allow *any* outside
 party to use its territory for attacks on a neighboring state. if 1) angola
 had the power, and 2) south africa refused (or couldn't) stop anti-angolan
 guerillas based on sa soil from attacking angola, and 3) south africa
 refused to have un troops stationed on its territory between it and angola,
 would angola be justified in entering sa? if not, are you saying that
 angola had to accept the situation, do nothing and absorb the attacks?

 i refered above *at all times* to the palestinian attacks on israel from
 lebanese soil, not to lebanese attacks on israel. 
 
 one hopes that a lebanese government will be strong enough to patrol its 
 border but there is no reason to believe it will be any stronger. what has 
 changed is that the plo was largely *driven out* of lebanon (not by the 
 lebanese, not by syria) and that is by far the most important making it 
 easier to control future palestinian attacks from lebanese soil. that
 **change** was brought about by israeli action; the plo would *never*
 have been ejected by lebanese, arab state or un actions.

 i fully recognize that the lebanese do not want to be "used" by either side,
 and have been (and continue to be). but the most fundamental issue is that
 if a state cannot control its borders and make real efforts to do so, it
 should expect others to do it for them. hopefully that "other" will be
 the un but it is (as we see in its cowardice regarding bosnia) weak.
