 there is nothing you need to defend yourself against. as i said:
 i just exchange ideas over the usenet with other people. i never 
 attacked you as to put you in the need to defend yourself against me.
 i am not a violent person, and i do not see how can anyone be threatened
 by the opinions and ideas of others as expressed on usenet.
 i asked you to continue on email because i am not interested on a
 flamefest, where you change my words or just make up some of your own
 and present them as mine.
 so, do not worry. you do not need to defend yourself because i am not
 attacking you.
