 	the libertarians believe in getting the government off the
 backs of the people, so that the free market can solve problems.
 
 	libertarians believe in an end to the welfare state, an end to
 government subsidies of all sorts.  the basic idea is that the
 government is way too big and way too expensive, and should be shrunk
 down to a reasonable size.
 
 	they also believe in a complete end to foreign aid, including
 the stationing of american troops overseas.  we can not and should not
 be policing the world.
 
 
 	i agree that the people who come into this group and describe
 themselves as libertarians seem to posses the charictaristics you
 describe, but heck, we're not all like this.  i'm a libertarian, and
 i've got a great sense of humor! :)
