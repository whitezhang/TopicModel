 i agree with you harry, however you must also concede then that
 arab terrorism is also a tragedy of war.  remember that the
 palestinians have no other effective target but civilians in
 order to further their cause.  if irgun had to attack civilian
 targets to terrorize in order that they might obtain some
 objective, i'm sure they would have done so.  i also don't
 exclude irgun's action against british soldiers as terrorism.
 the british were showing signs of favoring a compromise with
 regards to palestine, and the irgun and branch off groups made
 a point to kill young british recruits so that mothers and
 fathers back in britain would get angry at britains continued
 presence in palestine.  sounds like a form of terrorism to me,
 and not much removed from arab terrorism.  we must not also
 forget that irgun, or irgun branch off groups [more likely]
 killed many jews who were not as hardline zionist as they, or
 who cooperated with the british.  
 	i'll reiterate again.... both sides are screwy, but
 i'll favor the underdog in this case because i do think they
 were a bit screwed.
