 mr. emmanuel huna,
 
 give logic a break will you.  gosh, what kind of intelligence do
 you have, if any?
 
 
 tesiel says :  be a man not an arab for once.
 i say       :  fuck of tsiel (for saying the above).
 
 i get tagged as a racist, and he gets praised?
 well mr. logicless, tsiel has apologized for his racist remark.
 i praise him for that courage, but i tell take a hike to whoever calls me
 a racist without a proof because i am not.
 
 you have proven to us that your brain has been malfunctioning
 and you are just a moron that's loose on the net.
 
 about being fanatic:  i am proud to be a fanatic about my rights and
 freedom, you idiot.
