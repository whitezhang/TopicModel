  	washington (upi) -- secretary of state warren christopher said tuesday
  there are better ideas to stop the human slaughter in the balkans than
  ordering american fighters to bomb the serbs, but a frustrated senator
  told him to do just that.
  	``we've not done a damn thing,'' sen. joseph biden, d-del., told
  christopher at a hearing of the senate foreign relations committee. 
  ``preventive diplomacy is not in your capability right now in bosnia-
  herzegovina.
  	biden chastised the administration and its republican predecessor for
  what he characterized as a limp response to the serbian policy of 
  ``ethnic cleansing'' of muslims, including rape and shelling of
  civilians.
  	``the time has come for us and the world to stop bemoaning the fact
  that all the options are bad ones,'' biden said. ``they are all bad ones
  and we ought to pick a couple.''
  	biden also endorsed lifting an international arms embargo against the
  former yugoslavia so the muslim-dominated bosnian government might have
  a chance to at least defend itself against the serbs.
  	christopher said this could give an opening role in the conflict to

    biden endorsed bombing serbian heavy weapons around the besieged
   eastern town of srebrenica.
   	``there's not a military person...who will not tell you that they
   could today, if you gave them the order, take out the heavy weaponry
   around srebrenica,'' biden said.
   	``if you did nothing else, nothing else but that, you would have
   saved hundreds of women and children who are being absolutely massacred
   right now.''
   	military action ``is the only thing that's going to change the
   equation,'' biden said.

   	despite the frustrations and pressure, christopher had no enthusiasm
   for american combat aircraft to strike serb positions in bosnia-
   herzegovina.

 now that they made sure the bosnian (who were the only real subject of the
 embargo last year, as everybody knows that the serbs had an unlimited supply
 of arms) wre massacred without having a chance to defend themselves, now this
 evil coldhearted snake is saying "it is too late to save them, so let them die.
