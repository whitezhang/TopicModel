 	it was for the purpose of establishing a state, not an
 exclusive state.  if the state was to be exclusive, it would not have
 400 000 arab citizens.
 
 	and no, i do not consider the purchase of land a hostile
 action.  when someone wants to buy land, and someone else is willing
 to sell it, at a mutually agreeable price, then that is commerce.  it
 is not a hostile action leading to war.

 	oh, you mean like both jews and arabs being citizens?  the
 arabs who stayed are now citizens, with as much right to choose who
 they vote for as the jews.

 	huh?  the people who left, did so voluntarily.  there is no
 reason for israel to let them in.

 	israel got no western aid in 1948, nor in 1949 or 50...it
 still granted citizenship to those arabs who remained.  and how
 is granting citizenship a facade?

 	try again, you tell me what its isn't, but you fail to
 establish what it is.
 
 	also, jews did have history in israel for over a thousand
 years.  there were lots of jews slaughtered by crusaders in israel.
 there was a thriving community in gaza city from roughly 1200-1500.
 jews were a majority in jerusalem from 1870 or so onwards.  does that
 make the land jewish?
