 hi brad,
 
 i have two comments:  regarding your hope that the "occupation will end... 
 belive that stiff resistance..etc. - how about an untried approach, i.e.,
 peace and cooperation.  i can't help but wonder what would happen if all
 violence against israelis stopped.  hopefully, violence against arabs
 would stop at the same time.  if a state of non-violence could be 
 maintained, perhaps a state of cooperation could be achieved, i.e.,
 greater economic opportunities for both peoples living in the
 "territories".  
 
 of course, given the current leadership of israel, your way may work
 also - but if that leadership changes, e.g., to someone with ariel
 sharon's mentality, then i would predict a considerable loss of life,
 i.e., no winners.
 
 secondly, regarding your comment about the u.s. troops responding
 to "stiff resistance" - the analogy is not quite valid.  the u.s.
 troops could get out of the neighborhood altogether.  the israelis
 could not.
 
 just my $.02 worth, no offense intended.
 
 respectfully,     
 
 ben.
