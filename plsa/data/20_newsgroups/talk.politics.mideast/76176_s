 
    as someone who reads israeli newpapaers every day, i can state
 with absolute certainty, that anybody who relies on western media
 to get a picture of what is happening in israel is not getting an
 accurate picture.  there is tremendous bias in those stories that
 do get reported.  and the stories that never get mentioned create
 a completely false picture of the mideast.
