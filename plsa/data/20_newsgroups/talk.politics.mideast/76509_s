 probably not--he's just singing someone else's opera. he's good, too; perhaps he should get "the best supporting singer..."
 
 i can give you a q/a account that is well documented (just go back and reread some of the articles that appeared after this "joke"):
 
 q: how many antisemites does it take to come up with another anti-israeli
    provocation on the net?
 
 a: just one. he'll fabricate a lie, and many more will applaud
 
 i would much prefer if mr. steel would refrain from this kind of jokes in the 
 future. they're not just offensive. they also have a very negative effect on 
 the state of things between jews and arabs. so thanks for nothing, clown!
