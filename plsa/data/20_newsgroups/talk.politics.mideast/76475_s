 	i have to say i think this is the first time there has
 been something posted that opposed me without making personal
 insults. congradulations tim. i think the other people answered
 you on most of the factual parts(esp. about the internal
 conflicts policy). 
 	israel very often gets away with more
 than most other nations (due to u.s. vetos). while i am not
 familiar with every instance i know that the reason saudi
 arabia was not condemned for killig the pilgrims was that the
 pilgrims were iranian. yes, the un is biased but mostly in
 favor of the us and its allies (including israel, saudi arabia
 and pakistan) and against "outlaw" countries like iran and more
 recently iraq. far be it from me to support the repressive
 governments there but i think they get more slack than israel
 for things they do "wrong". again the reason some condemnations
 don't occur lies in the race or country of the victims. the
 gassed iraqi kurds got associated with iran in the war and
 since iran was perceived as worse than iraq no condemnation
 resulted. the palestinians killed by arab countries involved
 another case of who cares. it seems that until very recently no
 one cared about how many palestinians died anywhere (including
 in israel and the occupied territories).
 	again i appreciate the lack of personal insults.
