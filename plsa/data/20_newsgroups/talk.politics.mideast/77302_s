 if croats are now divided, it is because croatia seceded from yugoslavia.
 croats in croatia, b-h, and serbia were in *one* country--yugoslavia--
 until they divided themselves. 
 
 if muslims are now divided, it is because b-h seceded from yugoslavia.
 muslims in croatia, b-h, and serbia were in *one* country--yugoslavia--
 until they divided themselves.
 
 that croats and muslims in yugoslavia decided to divide themselves does
 *not* give them the right to divide serbs in yugoslavia.
 
 croatia and b-h shoulder the burden for dividing their own nations among
 various unstable countries.
