 you somehow missed nabil's comments, even though you included it in
 your followup:

 i am not aware of "killings between jewish tribes" in the desert.
 
 the point of "typical thinking" here is that while arabs still today
 act in the manner you describe, like "any nomadic people occupying a 
 land", killing and plundering each other with regularity, others have
 somehow progressed over time.  it is not surprising then that arabs
 often accuse others (infidels) of things that they are quite familiar
 with: civil rights violations, religious discrimination, ethnic
 cleansing, land theft, torture and murder.  it is precisely this 
 mechanism at work that leads people to say that jewish tribes were
 killing each other in the desert, even without support for such a
 ludicrous suggestion.
