 well i'm not sure about the story nad it did seem biased. what
 i disagree with is your statement that the u.s. media is out to
 ruin israels reputation. that is rediculous. the u.s. media is
 the most pro-israeli media in the world. having lived in europe
 i realize that incidences such as the one described in the
 letter have occured. the u.s. media as a whole seem to try to
 ignore them. the u.s. is subsidizing israels existance and the
 europeans are not (at least not to the same degree). so i think
 that might be a reason they report more clearly on the
 atrocities.
 	what is a shame is that in austria, daily reports of
 the inhuman acts commited by israeli soldiers and the blessing
 received from the government makes some of the holocaust guilt
 go away. after all, look how the jews are treating other races
 when they got power. it is unfortunate.
