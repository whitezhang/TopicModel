 
 in september 1990, our medical reserve unit was sent to the ketziot
 prison camp to take care of arab prisoner who were housed in 5
 sections of 1500 prisoners each, with each section subdivided in
 5 units housing 300 prisoners. the prisoners would "communicate"
 with other distant sections (sometimes 50-100 yards away) by
 taking stones, tying written notes to the stones, and throwing
 them with incredible precision to other sections. i should have
 been a recruiter for the red sox :-) there were at least three
 prisoners who could have been outstanding pitchers.
