 	ok, you don't like what i have to say.  would you care to
 demonstrate how the above list, or any expanded version of it you
 chose to post, demonstrates fairness in the actions of the un wrt
 israel?

 	you make the odd assumption that i read israeli papers, not
 european ones.  my main source of news is the economist, a london
 based magazine.
 
 	also, i do on rare occaisons, read arab papers, but its hard
 to find english language papers from arab countries here.

 	have i ever claimed to be objective?  i pointed out, with a 27
 item list, that israel is condemned for actions that other nations are
 not condemned for.  you go off and attack me for reading only israeli
 newspapers.
 
 	if you'd like to debate this, please do.  if you'd like to
 make ad hominum attacks, feel free to do that too.  but try not to
 mask one as another.
