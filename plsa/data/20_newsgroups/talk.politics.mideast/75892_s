 dorin,
 let's not forget that the soldiers were killed not murdered. the
 distinction is not trivial. murder happens to innocent people, not people
 whose line of work is to kill or be killed. it just so happened that these
 soldiers, in the line of duty, were killed by the opposition. and
 resistance is different from terrorism. certainly the athletes in munich
 were victims of terrorists (though some might call them freedom fighters).
 their deaths cannot be compared to those of soldiers who are killed by
 resistance fighters. don't forget that it was the french resistance to the
 nazi occupying forces which eventually succeeded in driving out the
 hostile occupiers in wwii. diplomacy has not worked with israel and the
 lebanese people are tired of being occupied! they are now turning to the
 only option they see as viable. (don't forget that it worked in driving
 out the us)
