 trumpets, please.

 "forced to go to palestine."  how dreadful.  unlike other
 undesirables/jews, she wasn't forced to go into a gas chamber, forced
 under a bulldozer, thrown into a river, forced into a "medical
 experiment" like a rat, forced to march until she dropped dead, burned
 to nothingness in a crematorium.  your mother was "forced to go to
 palestine."  you have our deepest sympathies.

 we are pleased to hear of your escape.  at least you won't have to
 suffer the same fate that your mother did.

 your homeland, palestine?

 should we assume that you are refering here to jews who were kicked
 out of their homes in jerusalem during the jordanian occupation of
 east jerusalem?  these are the same people who are now being called
 thieves for re-claiming houses that they once owned and lived in and
 never sold to anyone?

 i have never heard of not being a jew as a crime.  certainly in
 israel, there is no such crime.  in some times and places being a jew
 is a crime, but not being a jew??!!
 
 >my conscience does not accept such injustice, period. 
 
 our brains do not accept your logic, yet, either.

 the way you've written this, you seem to accept criticism in the arab
 world unless it deflects criticism from israel, in which case, we have
 to presume, you no longer support criticism of the arab world.
 
 >the struggle against discrimination and racism is universal.
 
 look who's taling about discrimination now!

 be careful.  you are starting to sound like barfling.

 good.  don't call yourself "arf" or "the center for policy research",
 either.
