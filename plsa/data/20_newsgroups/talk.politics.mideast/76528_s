 oy] henrik (?),
 oy] your ignorance manifests itself in an awkward form of intransigence. i'm not
 oy] going to spend time to review with you the recent history of cyprus. 
 
 	good !! go back to your references and read it over and over ...
 
 oy] if you are really interested, i can provide you with a number of references
 oy] on the issue.  just send me email for that.  
 
 	you think i am that stupid to ask you for references !  not !
 	i have many greek friends that i could ask for the info if i
 	needed. i have already read many articles and do not need
 	your help. boy, how generous !!
 
 oy] relax! you're swinging fists into open air... i was *agreeing* with you,
 oy] assuming that would be one of your points that you did not state! you may 
 oy] not be very much used to it, to be agreed with - that is, but take it more
 oy] easily.  !:-)
 
 	believe me, i am so relaxed ...
 
 henrik]     however, i hope that the armenians will force a turkish airplane 
 henrik]     to land for purposes of searching for arms similar to the one
 
 [oy] 	no, henrik, believe me: you don't hope that.
 
 	  if armenia is goint to do that, then so be it.
   
 henrik]         that happened last summer. turkey searched an american plane
 henrik]         (carrying humanitarian aid) bound to armenia.
 
 oy] was that after or before one french plane changed its route to avoid
 oy] inspection??? 
 
 	all i am saying is that the plane that was searched was an
 	american and why turkey did not trust the u.s. that it was
         mainly humanitarian aid cargo.
