 tsiel,
 
 i would contend that there was shelling from both sides of the border,
 starting from the early 70's.  certainly the plo did shell northern
 israel from the arqoub region, but israel did much more shelling
 destroying several south lebanese villages.  at the very least
 we can say that both sides exchanged shelling, with occasional
 aerial raids by israel on lebanese villages.
 in any case steve's characterization that the 1982 invasion was only in 
 response to years of shelling from lebanon is false.  israel had
 many reasons for invading but mainly it did so to install a government
 in lebanon favorable to israel, and it nearly achieved this aim
 with the election of basheer el gemayel, and his brother, amin
 el gemayel, but the internal situation in lebanon was too hard
 to control and predict so israel had to withdraw, and amin el gemayel
 had to abrogate the 17 th of may agreement.
