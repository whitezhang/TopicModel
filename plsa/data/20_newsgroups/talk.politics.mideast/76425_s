 actually, they are free to leave and seek work in egypt, except that
 the egyptians don't want them, either.  and who are you going to blame
 if/when gazans establish their own state of gaza/palestine?

 actually, one such jew who did risk his life to help gazan arabs was
 hacked to death by palestinean murderers just last week.  it seems
 that the risk has been primarily from the arabs "in need of help". 
 
 this is also true for telephone repairmen, traders who seek to buy
 agricultural products from gazans, israeli soldiers who get involved
 in fighting between feuding palestinean groups that are as determined
 to destroy each other as they are to destroy outsiders...

 i just wanna see you try this here in the usa.  you know what's going
 to happen.

 okay.  that's enough.  i'm not going to read this posting of yours any
 further.
