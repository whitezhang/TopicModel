 alberto, you've repeatedly misunderstood my postings.  you are now making the exact point
 that i've made several times but with a different definition of religion.  you don't not
 have to believe in the "religious" aspects of judaism to be a jew (this would confine
 judaism to be just a religion in the sense of a christianity.).  so, by converting out of
 judaism, i don't mean just not believing in the god of judaism.  i mean voluntarily
 removing yourself from the jewish nation.  i am an agnostic but still consider myself
 jewish because of my cultural heritage.  (i admit that many religious jews would argue
 that i am not completely jewish because of my lack of faith, but judaism is a religion of
 dissent and debate isn't it?).  the fact that one can opt to become jewish simply by
 converting to judaism makes the nation of the jewish people the *least* racist and most
 open nation.  we have no quotas!
 
 so i will once again make my point.  defining a member of the jewish nation by religion
 (not, as you say, religious belief) is not racism.  you come to your incorrect conclusion
 because you use a different definition for religion when you define the law of return and
 when you define judaism.
