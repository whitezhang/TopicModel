   just trying to get this clear, so please bear with me.  as far as
   i can tell, you're proposing the following rules of engagement
   between israel and the palestinean resistance.  please feel
   revise this preliminary draft as necessary:
 
   1) israeli military personnel are fair game at any time, in uniform
      or out, on duty or off.  in practice, since any male or female
      israeli of military age (18-?) may be off-duty military, all but
      young children are acceptable targets.  since the existence of
      israel constitutes indication of hostile intent, no further
      provocation is required.
 
   2) to avoid inpermissable violations of the rights of non-combatant
      palestineans, israeli forces must not engage palestineans
      without positive identification as military personnel, clear
      indication of aggressive intent, and a clear field of fire.
 
     a) positive identification may be assured by either checking for
        palestinean military uniform, by posession of exclusively
        military armament (ie, t78 mbts or mig-29 aircraft), or
        self-identification (either verbal or documentary).  note
        that dual-use military/civilian weaponry such as hand grenades,
        ak-47 rifles, and rpg launchers do not constitute positive
        military identification and require closer inspection such
        as document checks.
 
     b) aggressive intent (as distinct from merely 'hostile' intent,
        which is the normal condition) may be assured by not less
        than three rounds of incoming fire separated by intervals
        of not less than ten seconds between rounds.  note that a
        single burst of automatic-weapon fire counds as one round,
        as does a volley of rocket fire from more than one source.
        as noted above, dual-use weaponry may not be assumed to
        originate from military personnel, and thus do not justify
        armed response.
 
     c) a clear field of fire can be guaranteed by making a positive
        military identification of all personnel in the target area of
        the weapons to be used.  note that aggressive intent need not
        be proven for all possible targets.  thus, if iaf aircraft
        are attacked by a sam crew it is not necessary to check the
        papers of each crew member so long as none are obviously
        civilians (as indicated, for instance, by the posession of
        uniquely civilian weaponry such as stones, axes, and molotov
        coctails.)  since it is often difficult for iaf elements to
        land and make the necessary checks, ground forces should
        first screen prospective strike areas before agm fire.
        for acm purposes, a cockpit-to-cockpit pass within 5 meters
        is usually sufficient for this purpose, but may be repeated
        if necessary.
