 [anas] a high rank israeli officer was killed during a clash whith a hamas
 [anas] mujahid.  the terrorist israelis chased and killed a young mujahid
 [anas] using anti-tank missiles.  the terrorist zionists cut the mujahid's
 [anas] body into small pieces to the extend that his body was not recognized.
 [anas] at leat ten houses were destroyed by these atni-tank missiles.
 
 if indeed israeli soldiers killed a "hamas mujahid" with an anti-tank missile
 then i'm almost sure that the "terrorist zionists" would not have been able
 to cut up a body which was probably desintegrated by the missile.
 
 stop polluting the net with you fantasies.
