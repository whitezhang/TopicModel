 tell me tim, what are these guerillas doing wrong? assuming that they are using
 civilians for cover, are they not killing soldiers in their country? if the
 buffer zone is to prevent attacks on israel, is it not working? why is it 
 further neccessary for israeli guns to pound lebanese villages? why not just
 kill those who try to infiltrate the buffer zone? you see, there is more to
 the shelling of the villages.... it is called retaliation... "getting back"
 ..."getting even". it doesn't make sense to shell the villages. the least
 it shows is a reckless disregard by the israeli government for the lives of
 civilians.

 if israel is not willing to accept the "word" of others then, imho, it has
 no business wasting others' time coming to the peace talks.

 no, i am not basil. i think basil is a very intelligent person and i
 respect what he writes. basil is a person that i would gladly call
 a friend. he is, however, not me. nor am i lebanese, as some seem to
 suspect.

 tim, you are ignoring the fact that the palestinians in lebanon have been
 disarmed. hezbollah remains the only independent militia. hezbollah does
 not attack israel except at a few times such as when the idf burned up
 sheikh mosavi, his wife, and young son. of course, if israel would withdraw
 from lebanon and stop assassinating people and shelling villages they wouldn't
 make the lebanese so mad as to do that. furthermore, with hezbollah 
 subsequently disarmed, it would not be possible.

 tim, when is the last time that you recall any trouble on the syrian border?
 not lately, eh?
 
 israel knows very well that the syrians are able to restrain all who would use
 territory under their control to attack israel. while lebanon would be better
 off with syria and israel out of its borders, the presence of syrian troops
 in lebanon has meant a sharp decrease in attacks on israeli territory (not on
 israeli troops in lebanon, however. please note the distinction) in the
 past two years.

 i disagree, basil has always seemed to me to be a cool-headed person, slow
 to anger (certainly more so than i). what is most important is that he is an 
 actual witness to things from the other end of the israeli guns. if only the 
 israeli government would remember what it was like when the roles were 
 reversed perhaps they would moderate their "retaliation".
