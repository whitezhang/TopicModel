 this is such bullshit.  deir yassin was an unprovoked attack on
 the part of the jews, and a massacre defines it best in my
 opinion.  the village of deir yassin had had a pact with the
 jews, a peace pact, but the irgun purposely broke this
 agreement in order to scare off the palestinians.  i might
 grant that this village housed armed arabs [i doubt it] but
 nothing in the archives and available literature indicates that
 this was a motivating force amongst the irgun.  the deir yassin
 massacre was part of an over all strategy to intimidate the
 palestinians to flee the jewish homeland.,...and contrary to
 your belief, many civilians were killed.  deir yassin was later
 advertized by the very jews who perpetrated it because it was
 useful in getting many palestinians to leave.  the palestinians
 were rightfully scared off, because they did not want another
 deir yassin.  
 	i'm not necessarily condemning the israelites here;
 atrocities were aslo committed on the part of the arabs.
 israelophiles should just be careful in thinking that they are
 and were the good guys in the middle east.  both arab and jew
 suck equally.
