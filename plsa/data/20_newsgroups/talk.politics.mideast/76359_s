 typical 'arromdian' of the asala/sdpa/arf terrorism and revisionism 
 triangle. well, does it change the fact that during the period of 1914 
 to 1920, the armenian government ordered, incited, assisted and participated 
 in the genocide of 2.5 million muslim people because of race, religion
 and national origin?

 "in those moslem villages in the plain below which had been searched for
  arms by the armenians everything had been taken under the cloak of such
  search, and not only had many moslems been killed, but horrible tortures 
  had been inflicted in the endeavour to obtain information as to where
  valuables had been hidden, of which the armenians were aware of the 
  existence, although they had been unable to find them."
 
 p. 175 (first paragraph)
 
 "the arrival of this british brigade was followed by the announcement
  that kars province had been allotted by the supreme council of the
  allies to the armenians, and that announcement having been made, the
  british troops were then completely withdrawn, and armenian occupation
  commenced. hence all the trouble; for the armenians at once commenced
  the wholesale robbery and persecution of the muslem population on the
  pretext that it was necessary forcibly to deprive them of their arms.
  in the portion of the province which lies in the plains they were able
  to carry out their purpose, and the manner in which this was done will
  be referred to in due course."
