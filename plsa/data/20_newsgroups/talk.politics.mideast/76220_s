 after reading the first paragraph, a quick scan confirmed my first
 impression: this is a bunch of revisionist and anti-semitic hogwash.
 
 the ny times reported on april 18, 1993 that the museum "was built
 through private contributions on federal land".  your hate-mongering
 article is devoid of current and historical fact, intellectual content
 and social value.  down the toilet it goes.....
