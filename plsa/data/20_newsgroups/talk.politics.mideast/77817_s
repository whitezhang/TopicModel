 serdar, i have been told that you are not real, your account is fake (which i  
 confirmed by trying to e-mail you) and advised not to waste my time writing to  
 "you".  but, i get pleasure from watching you make a fool of yourself.

 so you stand by the statement that all armenians are barbarians.  ok, i see.   
 lets not even act as if there is a chance they are human.  see serdar, when you  
 judge people because of their race this is called racism.  i tend to frown on  
 this sort of thing.  obviously you don't.  when you label an entire race the  
 way you do, it is easy to stop thinking of them as human beings, and this can  
 make genocide possible.  but i guess (and this is where serdar will fill the  
 page with quotes taken out of context) you know that, huh?

 public knowlege?  i was not aware of that.  now i see, the armenians decide to  
 kill the israeli athletes in 1972 as practice.  i was confused, but thanks for  
 clearing that up.

 wow, you are on a roll with the accusations today serdar, so how did the  
 armenians steal from the turkish children?  was it their lunch money?  this is  
 very cute how you inserted children in this fill in the blank accusation sheet  
 you fill out every day.  it really touches my heart.  oh and thank you for  
 letting me know that kurds and armenians hate each other.  i was not aware of  
 this.  the only time i have ever talked about kurds it was about the wonderful  
 treatment they were recieving in turkey.  they must have a high incedence of  
 insanity because there sure are a lot of them fighting against the  
 non-oppresive turkish government that has let their culture flower over the  
 past 70 years.

 thanks for the unbiased turkish media source.  i am sure the milliyet is rated  
 number one for accuracy and truth.

 innocent?  is that what terrorists call their victims?  i have never heard of  
 terrorists calling their victims innocent.  "yes, folks in other news the ira  
 public relations department reported that it had killed 20 innocent victims in  
 a car bombing...  "  nope serdar, i don't think so.

 oops you almost forgot to fill in the "say something about turks being killed

 yeah sure you are really serdar argic, and i am really bob hope!!!!  so you may  
 have already won 10 million dollars!!!  unfortunately for you the armenian  
 foundation in istambul is sure to steal it from you on the subway and then give  
 it to terrorists to kill innocent kurds and innocent israeli athletes.  ahhh,  
 when are you going to take me to this fantasy world of yours??
