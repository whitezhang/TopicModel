 it is also so easy to blame the west for their indiffernce to
 real bosnian suffering.  how about the moslem world, about 1 billion?
 how about them ha?  what they are doing to stop this
 massacre?  why the oil rich arab states make the bosnian crises 
 a national interest of the west, especially for europeans?  we all 
 know they can do it over night, don't we? blaming west and asking 
 why they don't put their life into danger seems to be the choice of 
 muslims too.  i think who is sleeping is not the west.  they are wide 
 awake.  they are trying to save the face.
