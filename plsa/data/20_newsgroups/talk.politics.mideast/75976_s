 	the american press routinely uses the word fundamentalist to
 refer to both christians and jews.  christian fundementalists are
 often refered to in the context of anti-abortion protests.  the
 american media also uses fundamentalist to refer to jews who live in
 judea, samaria or gaza, and to any jew who follows the torah.
