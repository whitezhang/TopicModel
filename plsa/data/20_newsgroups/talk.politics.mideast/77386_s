 can anyone figure out what kind of deranged parent was stupid enough to
 bring their infant on a rock throwing crusade (or jihad, sorry)?  18-month
 old infants certainly don't walk around the streets on their own.  that would
 lead me to believe that some nimrod of a "parent" brought them along for a 
 little terrorism.

 uhm, last i heard, the territories were disputed.  israel's occupation is not
 illegal.  they are legally allowed to remain there until a settlement is reached
 with the arabs which, from the behavior of the palestinian negotitating team,
 will probably be never.
