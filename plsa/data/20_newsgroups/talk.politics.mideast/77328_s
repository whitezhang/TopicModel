 this does not change the *fact* that "muslim" is a legal and political
 term defined constitutionally in former yugoslavia, and therefore has
 meaning and consequences entirely *independent* and *immaterial* of
 any religious considerations.

 you only wish it were so.
 
 more than 2,000,000 residents of croatia and b-h have *not* accepted the
 terms of secession which tudjman and izetbegovic unilaterally forced upon
 them.  croats and muslims may have a right to negotiated secession but
 they do not have a right to grab the *entire* territories of the former
 yugoslav republics of croatia and b-h.
 
 oh, btw, *yugoslavia* was *internationally recognized* when it was 
 destroyed by tudjman, izetbegovic, milosevic, and the international
 community led by germany.  if yugoslavia's borders could be changed
 against its will, then certainly croatia's borders and b-h's borders
 can be changed as well.  
 
 as i have stated many times: the civil war in ex-yugoslavia will end
 when the terms of secession (borders, etc.) for croatia and b-h are
 finally agreed upon.  serbs, croats, and muslims will *all* have to
 make territorial concessions to reach such an agreement.
