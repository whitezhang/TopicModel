 	i have just started reading the articles in this news
 group. there seems to be an attempt by some members to quiet
 other members with scare tactics. i believe one posting said
 that all postings by one person are being forwarded to his
 server who keeps a file on him in hope that "appropriate action
 might be taken". 
 	i don't know where you guys are from but in america
 such attempts to curtail someones first amendment rights are
 not appreciated. here, we let everyone speak their mind
 regardless of how we feel about it. take your fascistic
 repressive ideals back to where you came from.
