 thanks to those who joined millions of turkish and kurdish people 
 on april 23, 1993 when they remembered, mourned and prayed for 2.5 
 million muslim people who were ruthlessly exterminated by the fascist 
 x-soviet armenian government between 1914 and 1920.
 
 
 the justice is long overdue and the victims of the turkish genocide 
 demand:
 
 1. that the x-soviet armenian government, as the heirs of the armenian 
 dictatorship, recognize the turkish genocide;
 
 2. that x-soviet armenia return the historic homeland to the turkish and
 kurdish people;
 
 3. that the x-soviet armenian government make material reparations for 
 their heinous and unspeakable crime to the victims of the turkish genocide;
 
 4. that all world governments, and especially the united states, officially
 recognize the turkish genocide and turkish territorial rights and refuse
 to succumb to all armenian political pressure;
 
 5. that the u.s. government free itself from the friendly position it 
 has adopted towards its unreliable ally, x-soviet armenia, and officially 
 recognize the historical fact of the turkish genocide as well as be 
 supportive of the pursuit of turkish territorial demands;
 
 6. that the x-soviet republics officially recognize the historical fact 
 of the turkish genocide and include the cold-blooded extermination of 
 2.5 million muslim people in their history books.
