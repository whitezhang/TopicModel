 actually, the record of the allies activities, in the face of
 incontrovertible evidence as to what the nazis (may they rot in hell)
 were doing, clearly points to the conclusion that they would have done
 nothing.  the railways to the camps were not bombed, despite the ease
 of doing so.  the us, the "place of refuge" allowed in a bare pittance
 of jews from europe, primarily for public relations, so that the
 government could say it was "doing something".  many ships with
 refugees were turned away from us shores; some found refuge in cuba or
 south america, many others sunk or had to return to europe (with
 predictable consequences).  the hope today is that we have
 collectively learned a lesson, and are less complacent to ignore other
 countries' "internal affairs".  the sad reality is that this does not
 seem to be the case.
