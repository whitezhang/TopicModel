 an open letter to marc afifi
 
 
 dear marc,
 	i believe that you are wrong about mr. freeman.  he has written in
 a style that raises the level of posts on this board.  if you just don't seem
 to get it, i believe that it is more of a reflection of you and your abilities
 than of him.  his posts contain substance and and he defends his positions 
 well.
 	having said this, i would like to ask in general for people on this 
 board to realize that if they don't agree with the substance of posts, then they should respond to the substance (or lack of) of the posts rather than attack
 the author of the posts.  when one has to resort to attacking a poster rather than what he/she has written, one can see that that person does not have the
 ability to make a coherent argument concerning the post.
 
 peace,
 
 
 danny
