 
    first this man promotes the dissolution of the jews through an
 intermarriage process, and then says that it will be just a bunch
 of 'fundamentalist' jews who will object.  this clown even called
 for 'buying' the dissolution of the jewish people.
 
    does this idiot mean to suggest that any jew who objects to an
 imibicilic notion like this is fundamentalist?  or does he simply
 mean to insult the orthodox by using the word 'fundamentalist?'
 
    i am not orthodox.  i am not fundamentalist.  i would desire a
 genuine peace in the region more than this pinhead  davidsson can
 ever understand.  but when he shows his willingness to dismiss an
 entire culture, he proves that the only thing more brain-boggling
 than his stupidity is his willingness to display his stupidity in 
 this newsgroup.
 
   please take your hatred for the essence of judaism and shove it
 up your ass.  remember to pull your head out first.
