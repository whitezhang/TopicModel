 [dd]  problem 1
 [dd]
 [dd] my father told me the following story. during the famous wars between the 
 [dd] armenians and the persians, prince zaurak kamsarakan performed 
 [dd] extraordinary heroic deeds. three times in a single month he attacked the 
 [dd] persian troops. the first time, he struck down half of the persian army. 
 [dd] the second time, pursuing the persians, he slaughtered one fourth of the 
 [dd] soldiers. the third time, he destroyed one eleventh of the persian army. 
 [dd] the persians who were still alive, numbering two hundred eighty, fled to 
 [dd] nakhichevan. and so, from this remainder, find how many persian soldiers 
 [dd] there were before the massacre.
 
 [koc] answer: a(1-1/2-1/4-1/11)=280 -> a = 1760
 
 good for you! you win the prize -- a free trip to karabakh as an azeri 
 soldier! now, calculate the odds of you coming back after trying to de-populate
 the area of armenians!
 
 [koc] corollary: armenians strike, slaughter, destroy, and massacre. after
 [koc] all, they are not as innocent as the asala network claims.
 
 fact: i didn't notice any mention of turks in shirak, van, or trebizon in
       this seventh century story!
 
 fact: these places were filled with armenians as of 1915.
 
 fact: by the end of 1916, after the turkish genocide of the armenians, there
       were no armenians left in shirak, van, or trebizon -- only turks and
       kurds! in fact, there were no pontus greeks left alive in trebizon 
       either!
 
 conclusion: numbers don't lie in either case!
