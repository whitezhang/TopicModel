 muslims helping the nazis???  where on earth do you come up with such
 accuusation??  do you have proofs??  if not, you should publically apologize
 for such a statement.  last time i heard, the nazis prided themselves in
 needing no body to carry their politics and ideologies.  and if your statment
 were true, don't you think israel would of used it to point to what a muslim
 neighbor (palestine) could do to them if they allowed it to be?  the jewish
 lobby and power is very strong, and if what you said is true, we would of
 heard it from them before you could come up with it.
 and you dare say that you are taking no sides!!
