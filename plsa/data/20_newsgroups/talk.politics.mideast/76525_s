 i lived there until july 1992 so i think that on the whole,
 my input is relevant.

 those are two separate questions.  obviously, israeli authorities do
 recognize israeli nationality for some purposes, e.g. passports,
 consular services, etc...  id cards have a field of nationality
 which is a subdivision of the above.  ostensibly, this field
 is provided for sevices provided by the religious departments
 of the gov't, though this is not the general case.

 from its onset, israel's borders have been shaped and reshaped by both
 war and peace.  as such, the israeli gov't has always felt that defining
 its borders is a step that is meaningful only after peace treaties have
 been conluded with its neighbors.  there is no plan for "ultimate borders"
 (is this a game like "ultimate frisbee"?) extending into  other countries.

 aside from what vaanunu provided, no.

 if that is true, then by virtue of the question's subject, it is
 unanswerable.  anyone who claims its validity. is claiming an oxymoron.
 that having been said, i deny the above.
 
 you go on to ask quite a number of questions that show an obvious
 bias.  questions of the sort "is it true that you entered your
 mother's vagina?" which are based upon some kernel of truth, though
 phrased in a way as to render them repugnant and cast aspersions
 upon israel.  incidentally, the answer to the above is usually yes,
 unless you were born via a c-section.
