 well, let's delve one level deeper. why is democracy better than tribalism or
 other means of govt.? the president of georgia was elected with a thumping
 majority and booted out later, w/ no objections from the un. similarly, the
 people of algeria elected an islamic fundemantalist party into power but the
 junta declared it illegal. in both cases, i personally have _no_ problems with
 the outcome, but if the voice of the people is that hallowed thing that the 
 world community claims to revere so, why isn't it interfering there?

 .
 exactly. my point is that it will inevitably turn out that way, and we can save
 ourselves a lot of pain and trouble by simply letting people sort out their
 problems on their own. colonial interventions, even in haiti, haven't worked 
 in the past. they had a 102 coups from 1845-1915. the us invaded in 1915. and left
 in 1933, almost 17 years after they had intended to. was it a success? well,
 look at haiti today and of the past 40 years and decide for yourself. it _was_
 a success so long as the us was in, from what i remember. but it didn't last
 long, obviously.

 nobody did. people should have a right to self-defense. if the un wants to arm
 the bosnians or haitian revolutionaries or whoever, i have no problems with
 that. i do when they cross that line and attempt to re-arrange boundaries, govts.
 etc., the vance-owen plan being one such piece of insanity.

 we finally have a clearly-stated point of difference. colonialism can
 have its good side, which is as you stated above - removing thugs from being
 able to lord it over powerless people. i am worried that the bad side is what 
 will assert itself, and i am prepared to let natural forces take their course 
 if that will mean we can avoid the bad side of colonialism.

 if the university of illinois shares these views, i'd be surprised.
 they aren't that smart generally -:).
