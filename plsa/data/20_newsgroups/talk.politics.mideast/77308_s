 [dd] license to lie, cover-up, or revise events under question as we have read 
 [dd] on usenet in postings by agents of the turkish government. i understand 
 [dd] both sides of the issue, but this does not mean i will advocate both sides
 [dd] when it suits me. such a position would make me a hypocrite. i am also not
 [dd] being paid by agents of turkey nor azerbaijan as are many proponents of 
 [dd] the azeri side. i refer to agents such as captioline international group,
 [dd] ltd., being paid in excess of $30,000/month by azerbaijan. i state my case
 [dd] unencumbered by such advocacy or prostitution. 
 
 thanks to mr. cg.
