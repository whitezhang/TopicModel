 
 providing safety and security for one's own people is the most
 fundamental responsibility of any political entity. for the palestinian
 leadership to refuse to accept this responsibility, i.e. take the
 responsibility to protect their people from radical palestinian elements
 who are opposed to the peace process, is reprehensible. to argue that a
 palestinian police force would be established in order to control peaceful
 political groups only reinforces the reality that the palestinian
 leadership, so far, can not exercise control over radical palestinian
 elements nor effectively deal with the killing of palestinians by
 palestinians. this is a problem that can only be solved by the
 palestinian people.
