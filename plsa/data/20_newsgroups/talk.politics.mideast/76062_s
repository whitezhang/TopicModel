 i know this paper well, and see it for the exercise in selective morality 
 and judgement it is. until such time as it recognizes that *any* religiously
 based government is racist, exclusionary and simply built on a philosophy
 of "separate but equal" second-class treatment of minorities, it will 
 continue to be known for its bias. if jewish nationalism is racism, so is 
 islam; anywhere where people are allotted "different rights" according to 
 race, religion or culture is "racist".
