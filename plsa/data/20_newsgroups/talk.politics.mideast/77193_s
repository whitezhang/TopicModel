 please be advised that the person(s) sending to you the inflammatory
 remarks you have been receiving have been doing so by illegally accessing
 my account.
 
 our campus information technology security group has cut off my account's
 access to this hacker, and every effort is being made to track down this
 person.
 
 i apologize profusely that you have been subjected to the derogatory
 comments made by this person and i detest that my name was attached to
 them.
 
 thank you to those of you who alerted our campus security about the nature
 of this problem.
 
 sincerely,
 p. ljubi
