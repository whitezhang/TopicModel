 smart indeed.  if what you're saying is true, greeks who visit are happy,
 the turkish merchants are happy; who is harmed?  no one.  so not only was
 it a smart move, it was also a good move for it adds to the happiness of
 200.000 greeks per week and however many turkish merchants they interact with.
 one simple move in the paperwork arena -> lotsa happy people of both 
 nationalities.  just and observation.
