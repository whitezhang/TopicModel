 sorry, arf - you dog,
 
 that news was suppressed because the israeli national volleyball team
 repeatedly spiked it.
 
 let this be a lesson to others not to invoke the wrath of sports nuts.
 (brits lead the way in this regard, with ~220 casualties in the last 2
 years.)
 
 anyway, yigal would never sue.  his life is (presumably) so pristine
 that its most intimate details could be revealed without harm to
 anyone.  might even be good instruction for some people i can think of.
 
 me, i _would_ sue!  i hate the way sports dominates the media.
 anyway, the last 3 adl agents watching me die of boredom before filing
 their reports.  i've damaged their atlanta operation something fierce.
