 can someone elaborate a little on what this "libertarian" movement is? i
 am not going to draw conclusions from a small sample, but so far i
 recall two self-described "libertarians" posting here. both seems to be:
 
 1) incredibly ignorant.
 2) incredibly arrogant.
 3) all they want is to get people angry.
 4) posses a lousy sense of humor.
 5) write incoherently and jump from topic to topic without any logical
    connection between topics.
 6) describe themselves as intelligent and knowledgeable, although everything
    in their posters points to the opposite.
 7) very childish.
 
 is this some campaign to smear this libertarian party or what?
