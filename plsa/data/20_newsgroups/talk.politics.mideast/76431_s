 	   well canada is wrong. if it was in the us the aclu would have
    made sure that such repressive laws are found unconstitutional.
    do you think the church didn't find galileo's perception of the
    universe offensive.
 
 
 bull shit. there is no reason in the world why we can't say that
 taking views analogous to the kkk's or some such organization is
 wrong. there is no reason why some morality may not be legislated. as
 it is we do not allow theft, or murder, or rape. why should we allow
 hateful sppech whose only purpose is to stir anger and violence.
