   does this mean that you are volunteering to wade through the
   mutlu/argic deluge that comes in every day?  some of us are
   tired of being dragged into content-free pissing contests
   with reflexive bigots.  we intensely dislike being stuck between
   letting this crap pass without comment as though it were
   unremarkable and replying to it and getting sucked in again.
 
   let's keep some perspective here.
 
   imho, the josh's policy of forwarding the garbage in question,
   without comment, to the relevant sysadmin strikes a good
   balance.  the stuff was, after all, published on a public
   forum -- from that very site, yet.  hardly a matter of
   confidentiality or copyright.  if the local administration
   wants to do something about it, they have that right.  if
   not, nobody's twisting their arms.
