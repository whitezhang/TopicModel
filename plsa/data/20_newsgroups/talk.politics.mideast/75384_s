    well , ok. let's see what master of wisdom, mr. jonas flygare,
    wrote that can be wisdomely responded to :
 
 are you calling names, or giving me a title? if the first, read your 
 paragraph above, if not i accept the title, in order to let you get into the
 um, well, debate again.

    so what do you expect me to tell you to tell you, master of wsidom, 
 							       ^^^
 ------------------------------------------------------------------
 if you insist on giving me names/titles i did not ask for you could at
 least spell them correctly. /sigh.
 
    when you are intentionally neglecting the most important fact that 
    the whole israeli presence in the occupied territories is illegitimate, 
    and hence all their actions, their courts, their laws are illegitimate on 
    the ground of occupied territories.
 
 no, i am _not_ neglecting that, i'm merely asking you whether the existance
 of israeli citicens in the wb or in gaza invalidates those individuals right
 to live, a (as you so eloquently put it) human right. we can get back to the 
 question of which law should be used in the territories later. also, you have 
 not adressed my question if the israelis also have human rights.
 
    what do you expect me to tell you, master of wisdom, when i did explain my
    point in the post, that you "responded to". the point is that since israel 
    is occupying then it is automatically depriving itself from some of its rights 
    to the occupied palestineans, which is exactly similar the automatic 
    deprivation of a killer from his right of life to the society.
 
 if a state can deprive all it's citizens of human rights by its actions, then 
 tell me why _any_ human living today should have any rights at all?

    do you consider yourself that you have posed a worthy question here ?
 
 worthy or not, i was just applying your logic to a related problem.
 am i to assume you admit it wouldn't hold?

    ok, master of wisdom is throwing up. 
    you people stay away from the screen while he is doing it !
 
 oh did you too watch that comedy where they pipe water through the telephone?
 i'll let you in on a secret... it's not for real.. take my word for it.

    |> and which system do you propose we use to solve the me problem?
 
    the question is not which system would solve the me problem. why ? because
    any system can solve it. 
    the laws of minister sharon says kick palestineans out of here (all palestine). 
 
 i asked for which system should be used, that will preserve human rights for 
 all people involved. i assumed that was obvious, but i won't repeat that 
 mistake. now that i have straightened that out, i'm eagerly awaiting your 
 reply.
 
    joseph weitz (administrator responsible for jewish colonization) 
    said it best when writing in his diary in 1940:
 	   "between ourselves it must be clear that there is no room for both
 	   peoples together in this country.... we shall not achieve our goal
 						^^^                  ^^^
 	   of being an independent people with the arabs in this small country.
 	   the only solution is a palestine, at least western palestine (west of
 	   the jordan river) without arabs.... and there is no other way than
 	   to transfer the arabs from here to the neighbouring countries, to
 	   transfer all of them; not one village, not one tribe, should be 
 	   left.... only after this transfer will the country be able to
 	   absorb the millions of our own brethren. there is no other way out."

 just a question: if we are to disregard the rather obvious references to 
 getting israel out of me one way or the other in both plo covenant and hamas
 charter (that's the english translations, if you have other information i'd
 be interested to have you translate it) why should we give any credence to 
 a _private_ paper even older? i'm not going to get into the question if he
 wrote the above, but it's fairly obvious all parties in the conflict have
 their share of fanatics. guess what..? those are not the people that will
 make any lasting peace in the region. ever. it's those who are willing to 
 make a tabula rasa and start over, and willing to give in order to get 
 something back.
 
 
    "we" and "our" either refers to zionists or jews (i donot know which). 
 
    well, i can give you an answer, you master of wisdom, i will not suggest the 
    imperialist israeli system for solving the me problem !
 
    i think that is fair enough .
 
 no, that is _not_ an answer, since i asked for a system that could solve 
 the problem. you said any could be used, then you provided a contradiction.
 guess where that takes your logic? to never-never land. 
 
 
    "the greatest problem of zionism is arab children".

 oh, and by the way, let me add that these cute quotes you put at the end are
 a real bummer, when i try giving your posts any credit.
