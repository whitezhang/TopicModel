    this is such bullshit.  deir yassin was an unprovoked attack on
    the part of the jews, and a massacre defines it best in my
    opinion.  the village of deir yassin had had a pact with the
    jews, a peace pact, but the irgun purposely broke this
    agreement in order to scare off the palestinians.  i might
    grant that this village housed armed arabs [i doubt it] but
    nothing in the archives and available literature indicates that
    this was a motivating force amongst the irgun.  the deir yassin
    massacre was part of an over all strategy to intimidate the
    palestinians to flee the jewish homeland.,...and contrary to
    your belief, many civilians were killed.  deir yassin was later
    advertized by the very jews who perpetrated it because it was
    useful in getting many palestinians to leave.  the palestinians
    were rightfully scared off, because they did not want another
    deir yassin.  
 	   i'm not necessarily condemning the israelites here;
    atrocities were aslo committed on the part of the arabs.
    israelophiles should just be careful in thinking that they are
    and were the good guys in the middle east.  both arab and jew
    suck equally.
 
 rj3s, you say that there is no evidence that what motivated the irgun
 to attack dir yassin was its strategic importance. in fact, begin,
 who was in charge of the irgun, wrote that dir yassin was attacked for
 its military significance.
 
 dir yassin was merely a battle in the war of liberation. people died.
 but the thing was never intended to be a masacre. that this hapenned
 is a tragedy of war - not a crime of the irgun.
