 rabin: we must concentrate on qualitative changes in israeli
 society
  
 today's al hamishmar quotes prime minister yitzhak rabin's
 independence day interview yesterday on israel television. rabin
 said that enforcing jewish sovereignty over the entire land of
 israel would lead to the establishment of a bi-national state. "i
 would view it as if the historical destiny of my generation, dor
 tashach, the generation that had the great privilege of determining
 the fate of the people and founding the jewish state, had been
 lost."  rabin added, "we must stop dreaming of settlements [i.e. in
 the territories] and focus on qualitative and substantive changes
 in israeli society to make it a productive society dependent on its
 own labor." the prime minister concluded saying that he would like
 to achieve a significant breakthrough in the peace process during
 his government's term.
