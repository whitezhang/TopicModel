 please, read my post carefully, i am saying that lift the arms emargo
 and let the muslims defend themselves. the point is these europians 
 "civilized countries" neither want to get intervene militarily themselves
 and nor they like to see the muslims of the world to help the oppressed.
 (remember what happened almost one year ago when the so called un discovered
 some riffles in an iranian jet in bosnia!). the west is not indifferent
 in this matter they are siding with serbs by keeping this embargo on only
 muslim side (okay on-paper on both sides).
