 if you want info claiming that blacks were brought to earth 60 trillion
 years ago by aliens from the plante shabazz, i can send you literature from
 the nation of islam (farrakhan's group) who believe this.
 
 if you want info claiming that the holocaust never happened, i can send you
 info from ihr (institute for historical review - david irving's group), or
 just read dan gannon's posts on alt.revisionism.
 
 i just wanted to put steve's post in with the company that it deserves.
