 those who forward offensive posts to the sysadmin aren't curtailing
 anyones' freedom of speech.  the neo-nazi movement has a right to
 make speeches, say anything they want.  they do not have a right
 to have these speeches published by the n.y. times.  that depends
 on the times analysis of the economic and to somewhat extent
 newsworthy value of those speeches.  likewise to the sysadmin
 of this fellows system.  if he feels his resources are being
 used in a manner that is not in his best interests, or are
 perhaps embarassing to his organization, he will act just as
 the new york times does, not to be a conduit for these ideas.
 the poster is after all free-loading off of someone else's
 pocket book when he posts.  he who controls the purse strings
 has the right to make the decision how he wants those funds
 spent or not spent.
 
 noone is going to put the poster in jail, unless he bombs a local
 building as a symbol of his hatred.  freedom of speech in no
 way equates to accessibility to conduits of information.  the
 market of ideas has its own "natural selection" process that
 weeds out the ga-ga from the credible ideas that are of
 importance.
