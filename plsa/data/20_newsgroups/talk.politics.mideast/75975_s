 no, he does not.  arafat explicitly *denies* this claim.
 
 
 from a libyan televison interview with yasser arafat 7-19-1991
 q: some people say that the palestinian revolution has many times changed
    its strategies and tactics, something which has left its imprint on the
    palestinian problem and on the palestinian liberation front.  the
    [strategies and tactics] have not been clear.  the question is, is the
    direction of the palestinian problem clear?  the palestinian leadership
    has stopped, or at least this is what has been said in the media, this
    happened on the way to the dialogue with the united states, the plo
    recognized something called "israel"...
 
 a: no, no, no!  we do not recognize the state of israel.  we said
    "recognition" -- when a palestinian state is established.  it will then
    decide if to recognize israel or not.  when it is established, its
    parliament will convene and decide.

 	and replace them with what?  if israel is to withdraw its
 control of any territory, there must be two prerequsites.  one is that
 it leads to a reduction in deaths.  the second is that it should not
 weaken israels bargianing position with respect to peace talks.
 
 	leaving gaza unilateraly is a bad idea because it encourages
 arabs to think they can get what they want by killing jews.  the only
 way israel should pull out of gaza is at the end of negotiations.
 these negotiations should lead to a mutually agreeable solution with
 security guarantees for both sides.
 
 	until arabs are ready to sit down at the table and talk again,
 they should not expect, or recieve more concessions.
