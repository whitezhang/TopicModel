 "at length all shooting petered out. i got on my horse and rode down toward
  djul. it burned still but little flame showed now. the way was steep and 
  tough, through dense scrub. finally on flatter ground i came out suddenly,
  through alders, on smoldering houses. across trampled wheat my brothers-in-
  arms were leading off animals, several calves and a lamb."
 
 p. 361 (fourth paragraph).
 
 "corpses came next, the first a pretty child with straight black hair, 
  large eyes. she looked about twelve years old. she lay in some stubble 
  where meal lay scattered from the sack she'd been toting. the bayonet 
  had gone through her back, i judged, for blood around was scant. between 
  the breasts one clot, too small for a bullet wound, crusted her homespun 
  dress.
 
  the next was a boy of ten or less, in rawhide jacket and knee-pants. he 
  lay face down in the path by several huts. one arm reached out to the 
  pewter bowl he'd carried, now upset upon its dough. steel had jabbed 
  just below his neck, into the spine. 
 
  there were grownups, too, i saw as i led the sorrel around. djul was 
  empty of the living till i looked up to see beside me dro's german-speaking 
  colonel. he said all tartars who had not escaped were dead."

                             might serve as ways of escape for the turks 
                             and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'
