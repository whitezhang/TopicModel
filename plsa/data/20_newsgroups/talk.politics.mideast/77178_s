 there is no doubt that israeli authorities ordered the destruction of
 mosques in the vicinity of the wailing wall. that does not mean,
 however, that once can generalize from this to any other points.  the
 entire plaza, mosques and all, was cleared to make it possible for jews
 to have a place to worship in the place that was holiest to many of
 them, and which had been denied to them for millenia.
 
 on the other hand, throughout the rest of jerusalem and israel, to the
 best of my knowledge, israeli authorities have scrupulously avoided
 damage to any islamic religious sites. this contrasts with the policies
 of previous regimes which destroyed jewish synagogues out of hate and
 bigotry.
