 well, you should have noted that i was cheering an attack on an israeli 
 patrol inside lebanese territory while i was condemning the "retaliatory"
 shelling of lebanese villages by israeli and israeli-backed forces. my "team",
 you see, was "playing fair" while the opposing team was rearranging the
 faces of the spectators in my team's viewing stands, so to speak. 
 
 i think that you should try to find more sources of news about what goes on
 in lebanon and try to see through the propaganda. there are no a priori
 black and white hats but one sure wonders how the idf can bombard villages in 
 retaliation to pin-point attacks on its soldiers in lebanon and then call the
 lebanese terrorists.
