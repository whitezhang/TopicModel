 	shall the azeri women and children going to pay the price with
 						    **************
 	being raped, killed and tortured by the armenians??????????

         search turkish planes? you don't know what you are talking about.	i
         turkey's government has announced that it's giving weapons  <-----------i
         to azerbadjan since armenia started to attack azerbadjan		
         it self, not the karabag province. so why search a plane for weapons	
         since it's content is announced to be weapons?   
 
 	if there is one that's confused then that's you! we have the right (and we do)
 	to give weapons to the azeris, since armenians started the fight in azerbadjan!
  
 
 |>you are correct, all turkish planes should be simply shot down! nice, slow
 |>moving air transports!
 
 	shoot down with what? armenian bread and butter? or the arms and personel 
 	of the russian army?
