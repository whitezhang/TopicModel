 there certainly are muslims who *do not* believe that their dream of 
 a global islamic community should be achieved through force. there are, 
 however, others (and, they are often far more visible/vocal than the 
 former) who *do* accept the establishment of global islam through force. 
 i  would *not* feel threatened by those only accepting or pursuing 
 "islamicization" through peaceful means, nor by jews advocating the same
 approach. those advocating force as a means of expanding their side's
 power are certainly a threat.
 
 to palestinians, israel is doing just that; maintaining its dominance
 of those *outside* its own "group". if i am told that "i am not one of
 you" but you then impose your control on me, damn right you are a threat.
 if i am a member of a non-muslim minority *inside* the islamic
 world and *actively did not* accept my "minority" status, i *would also 
 certainly* see islam's domination as having been acheived, and maintained, 
 through the powerful coercive force all majorities wield over minorities
 within their ranks.

 for the same reason that some muslims believe it is proper and righteous
 for islam to be spread by force upon those who do not want that.

 [i refer to the "most" you also refer to] 
 because they are scared, and feel very threatened, as well feeling that 
 this area *is* to some degree part of their belief/religion/heritage/
 identity/etc.
 
 i too strongly object to those that justify israeli "rule" 
 of those who do not want that. the "occupied territories" are not
 israel's to control, to keep, or to dominate.
