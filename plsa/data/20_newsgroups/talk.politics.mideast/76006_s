 provide
  accurate answers to the following specific questions. these are
 indeed provocative questions but they are asked time and again by
 people around me.
 
 1.      is it true that the israeli authorities don't recognize
 israeli nationality ? and that id cards, which israeli citizens
 must carry at all times, identify people as jews or arabs, not as
