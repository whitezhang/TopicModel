 
 with regards to my condemnation of marc's ridiculous attacks on the
 american department of justice, and further attacks on jews, to
 anyone who took offense to my calling marc stupid, i
 apologize for pointing out the obvious.  it was a waste of the
 net's time.  i hope, though, that most american citizens have
 the basic knowlege of the structure of american government to
 understand the relationship between the justice department
 as a part of the executive branch, and the courts, which
 are of the judicial branch.  
 marc's ignorance of basic civic knowlege underscores his
 inability to comprehend and interpret foreign affairs.  
 
 
 peace,
 pete
