 kaufman,
 i think we have a problem in this newsgroup: every time somebody puts
 down serious questions on israel, the first response would be "what about
 the arab countries?" ...
 
 most of the arab countries governments are ruling their people with iron
 fist policy and dark ages democracy (if exists). ironically, these are 
 the countries that the "west" would like to deal with and would wage 
 massive wars to protect them and their resources.
 
 for israel the situation is different, israel claims it is a
 democracy -- i would call it selective democracy, that abides by western
 democratic standards. if israel is saying that then
 it has to be compared to western standards. if this comparison is the
 advertized propaganda from israel, then we have to look at seriously at
 question that can and should be asked regarding any country advertizing
 this standard.

 please, speak for yourself. do not imagine that "everyone" subscribes to
 your beliefs, you would be lucky if you believe them yourself.

 what is this, you trying to destroy the credibility of the author, why?
 all of this because he asked some serious question. these tactics of
 destroying the credibility of a person beacuse you do not agree with
 her/him is old and does not work anymore, go tell your superiors
 (aipac?) to change their guide books.
