    washington, may 14  -- following is a letter
 president clinton wrote to congress on iranian assets:
 
   to the congress of the united states:
 
        i hereby report to the congress on developments since the
   last presidential report on november 10, 1992, concerning the
   national emergency with respect to iran that was declared in
   executive order no. 12170 of november 14, 1979, and matters
   relating to executive order no. 12613 of october 29, 1987.
   this report is submitted pursuant to section 204(c) of the
   international emergency economic powers act, 50 u.s.c. 1703(c),
   and section 505(c) of the international security and development
   cooperation act of 1985, 22 u.s.c. 2349aa-9(c).  this report
   covers events through march 31, 1993.  the last report, dated
   november 10, 1992, covered events through october 15, 1992.
 
        1.  there have been no amendments to the iranian
   transactions regulations ("itrs"), 31 cfr part 560, or to the
   iranian assets control regulations ("iacrs"), 31 cfr part 535,
   since the last report.
 
        2.  the office of foreign assets control ("fac") of the
   department of the treasury continues to process applications
   for import licenses under the itrs.  however, as previously
   reported, recent amendments to the itrs have resulted in a
   substantial decrease in the number of applications received
   relating to the importation of nonfungible iranian-origin goods.
 
        during the reporting period, the customs service has
   continued to effect numerous seizures of iranian-origin
   merchandise, primarily carpets, for violation of the import
   prohibitions of the itrs.  fac and customs service investi-
   gations of these violations have resulted in forfeiture actions
   and the imposition of civil monetary penalties.  additional
   forfeiture and civil penalty actions are under review.
 
        3.  the iran-united states claims tribunal (the
   "tribunal"), established at the hague pursuant to the algiers
   accords, continues to make progress in arbitrating the claims
   before it.  since the last report, the tribunal has rendered
   12 awards, for a total of 545 awards.  of that total, 367 have
   been awards in favor of american claimants:  222 of these were
   awards on agreed terms, authorizing and approving payment of
   settlements negotiated by the parties, and 145 were decisions
   adjudicated on the merits.  the tribunal has issued 36 decisions
   dismissing claims on the merits and 83 decisions dismissing
   claims for jurisdictional reasons.  of the 59 remaining awards,
   3 approved the withdrawal of cases, and 56 were in favor of
   iranian claimants.  as of march 31, 1993, awards to successful
   american claimants from the security account held by the
   nv settlement bank stood at $2,340,072,357.77.
 
        as of march 31, 1993, the security account has fallen
   below the required balance of $500 million 36 times.  iran has
   periodically replenished the account, as required by the algiers
   accords, by transferring funds from the separate account held by
   the nv settlement bank in which interest on the security account
   is deposited.  iran has also replenished the account with the
   proceeds from the sale of iranian-origin oil imported into the
   united states, pursuant to transactions licensed on a case-by-
   case basis by fac.  iran has not, however, replenished the
   account since the last oil sale deposit on october 8, 1992.
   the aggregate amount that has been transferred from the interest
   account to the security account is $874,472,986.47.  as of
   march 31, 1993, the total amount in the security account was
   $216,244,986.03, and the total amount in the interest account
   was $8,638,133.15.
 
        4.  the tribunal continues to make progress in the
   arbitration of claims of u.s. nationals for $250,000.00 or more.
   since the last report, nine large claims have been decided.
   more than 85 percent of the nonbank claims have now been
   disposed of through adjudication, settlement, or voluntary
   withdrawal, leaving 76 such claims on the docket.  the larger
   claims, the resolution of which has been slowed by their
   complexity, are finally being resolved, sometimes with sizable
   awards to the u.s. claimants.  for example, two claimants were
   awarded more than $130 million each by the tribunal in october
   1992.
 
        5.  as anticipated by the may 13, 1990, agreement settling
   the claims of u.s. nationals for less than $250,000.00, the
   foreign claims settlement commission ("fcsc") has continued its
   review of 3,112 claims.  the fcsc has issued decisions in
   1,201 claims, for total awards of more than $22 million.  the
   fcsc expects to complete its adjudication of the remaining
   claims in early 1994.
 
        6.  in coordination with concerned government agencies,
   the department of state continues to present united states
   government claims against iran, as well as responses by the
   united states government to claims brought against it by iran.
   in november 1992, the united states filed 25 volumes of
   supporting information in case b/1 (claims 2 & 3), iran's claim
   against the united states for damages relating to its foreign
   military sales program.  in february of this year, the united
   states participated in a daylong prehearing conference in
  several other cases involving military equipment.  iran also
   filed a new interpretative dispute alleging that the failure
   of u.s. courts to enforce an award against a u.s. corporation
   violated the algiers accords.
 
        7.  as reported in november, jose maria ruda, president of
   the tribunal, tendered his resignation on october 2, 1992.  no
   successor has yet been named.  judge ruda's resignation will
   take effect as soon as a successor becomes available to take up
   his duties.
 
        8.  the situation reviewed above continues to involve
   important diplomatic, financial, and legal interests of the
   united states and its nationals.  iran's policy behavior
   presents challenges to the national security and foreign
   policy of the united states.  the iacrs issued pursuant to
   executive order no. 12170 continue to play an important role
   in structuring our relationship with iran and in enabling
   the united states to implement properly the algiers accords.
   similarly, the itrs issued pursuant to executive order no. 12613
   continue to advance important objectives in combatting inter-
   national terrorism.  i shall exercise the powers at my disposal
   to deal with these problems and will report periodically to the
   congress on significant developments.
