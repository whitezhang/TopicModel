 well over 100,000 in lebanon alone.
 1,000,000 - 2,000,000 in the iran/iraq conflict, even if iranians
 aren't arabs, strictly speaking.  (they seem to hate the zionists at
 least as much as anyone else in the neighborhood.  is there some
 correlation perhaps between hating israel and killing off your own
 people?)
