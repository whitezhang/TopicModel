 hamza answers one of my articles:
 
 [to] if indeed israeli soldiers killed a "hamas mujahid" with an anti-tank
 [to] missile then i'm almost sure that the "terrorist zionists" would not
 [to] have been able to cut up a body which was probably desintegrated by the
 [to] missile.
 
 [hamza] maybe the missile didn't hit directly such that his body
 [hamza] gets "desintegrated."  of course, destroying 10 houses to
 [hamza] kill someone is not a surgical operation, or is it?
 
 well done hamza. you edited my answer to anas omran, took everything out
 of context and then replied to it the way you wanted.
 now i really understand why the peace process is not making any progress.
 
 you guys ain't listening, just babbling away to your same old rhetoric.
