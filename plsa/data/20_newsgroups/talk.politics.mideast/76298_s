 as opposed to israel's many ways of death. using bombers and artillery
 against lebanese towns and villages. using fire arms and lethal
 variants of tear gas and *rubber coated* bullets against stone
 throwers. using tanks and anti-tank missiles against homes after a 5
 minute evacuation warning.  using shin bit's "reasonable" physical
 pressure in interrogation. and more. not counting of course past 
 practices such as the bombardment of beirut in 1982, the bombing of the 
 egyptian school of bahr-el-bakar and the abu-za'bal factory in 1978,
 the downing of the libyan airliner full of egyptian passengers near
 the same time. overseeing the maronite massacre in sabra and shatilla.
 that is of course besides numerous massacres by irgun and other gangs
 during the british mandate period.
 
 ironically the same op-ed page in the nyt times from which the naftaly
 copied this article was running another article next to it by a.m.
 rosenthall blaming bosnian muslims for their own genocide by effectively
 saying that it is stupid to seek independence if independence will bring
 your people slaughter. but what else would one expect from mr. rosenthall
 who never wasted a chance to bash arabs or muslims.
