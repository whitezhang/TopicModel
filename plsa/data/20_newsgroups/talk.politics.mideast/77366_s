 armenian soldiers massacre hundreds of fleeing families:
 
 "the attackers killed most of the soldiers and volunteers defending the 
  women and children.  they then turned their guns on the terrified refugees.  
  the few survivors later described what happened: 'that's when the real 
  slaughter began,' said azer hajiev, one of the three soldiers to survive.  
  'the armenians just shot and shot. and they came in and started carving 
  up people with their bayonets and knives.'  a 45-year-old man who had been 
  shot in the back  said:' we were walking through the brush. then they opened 
  up on us and people were falling all around.  my wife fell, then my child."

 bodies mark site of karabagh massacre:
 
 "a local truce was enforced to allow the azerbaijanis to collect their dead 
  and any refugees still hiding in the hills and forest.  all are the bodies 
  of ordinary people, dressed in the poor, ugly clorhing of workers. of the 31 
  we saw only one policeman and two apparent national volunteers were wearing 
  uniform.  all the rest were civilians, including eight women and three small
  children. two groups, apparently families, had fallen together, the children 
  cradled in the women's arms.  several of them, including one small girl, had 
  terrible head injuries: only her face was left. survivors have told how they 
  saw armenians shooting them point blank as they lay on the ground."

 karabagh survivors flee to mountains:
 
 "geyush gassanov, the deputy mayor of khocaly, said that armenian troops 
  surrounded the town after 7 pm on tuesday. they were accompanied by six 
  or seven light tanks and armoured carriers.  'we thought they would just 
  bombard the village, as they had in the past, and then retreat.  but they 
  attacked, and our defence force couldn't do anything against their tanks.'  
  other survivors described how they had been fired on repeatedly on their 
  way through the mountains to safety. 'for two days we crawled most of the 
  way to avoid gunfire,' sukru aslanov said.  his daughter was killed in the 
  battle for khodjaly, and his brother and son died on the road."
