 	huh?  mohamed salimeh was perhaps a korean?  how do you claim
 arab-americans had no involvement in the wtc bombing?
 
 	ok, his involvement is alleged by the fbi, which doesn't seem
 to reliable these days.  but honestly, there is a pile of evidence
 pointing to them, and it seems those 5 were involved.
 
 	this does not mean that all arab-americans were involved, nor
 should they be blamed for it, but denying that there were some
 arab-americans involved sounds sorta silly to me.
