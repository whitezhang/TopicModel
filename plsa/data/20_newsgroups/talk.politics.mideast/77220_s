 it is not a question of an individuals standing. when a party puts up an
 arab for a cabinet post and that arab is rejected but the position is given
 to a jew from the same party we are not talking about power but racism.
 would you care to deny this has happened on several occasions with labour
 coalitions?

 not their party - them as *individuals*. even when they belong to nice
 peaceful zionist mainstream parties they are not welcome. arabs are
 excluded on ficitious security grounds which are just an excuse. it
 sure looks like racism to me.
 
 arabs are excluded from cabinet, even when they do the things you
 suggest, because they are arabs. unless of course you have a better
 reason? i am happy to listen to any good reason why a leftist jew
 is less of a security risk than a leftist arab from the same party.
 look at the present cabinet.
