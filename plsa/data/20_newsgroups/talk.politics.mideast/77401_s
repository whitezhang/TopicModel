   the whole "saddam is going to invade saudi arabia" was nothing but us state 
   department propeganda.  saddam (and iraq in general) never recognised the 
   british created kuwait.  
 
 this is complete garbage.   it is kuwait faq number 1 (maintained, but
 not compiled, by me to rebut the leftist drivel frequently posted wrt
 kuwait): 
 
 ------------------------------------------------------------ 
 
 first is a note on the bogus arguments that the british 
 drew the maps to deprive iraq of oil. then follows a 
 chronology of events in kuwait's history.   following 
 the chronology is a speech by the kuwaiti ambassador 
 to the u.n.. following this is an article on the origins 
 of kuwait. following this is a series of articles 
 which attest to the fact that kuwait was independent of both 
 (non-existent) iraq and the ottoman empire.

 the iraqi regime claims that kuwait was cut from iraq by the british 
 in order to deprive iraq of its oil. the 1913 and 1932 border treaties 
 between kuwait and iraq represent clear testimonies against such an 
 allegation since oil was discovered in kuwait in 1938!

 shedding some light 
 
 on september 29 1990, the national council on us-arab relations 
 invited the kuwaiti ambassador to the united states, saud nasser 
 al-sabah. the following are quotes of his speech: 
 
 ``kuwait itself was an entity identified as kuwait even before 
 iraq was identified as iraq in the ottoman empire. kuwait was in 
 existence since 1752. we continued to be in existence until the 
 conflict between the ottoman empire and the british and others in the 
 area. thereafter, we signed with the british in 1899 a protective 
 agreement whereby the british guaranteed the sovereignty and security 
 of kuwait.'' 
 
 ``in 1913, the british and the ottoman signed an agreement defining 
 without any doubt the borders of kuwait as they stand today. such an 
 agreement was reconfirmed in 1932 between the kuwaiti government 
 and the iraqi government at that time. that is when iraq became a state, 
 after kuwait itself.'' 
 
 ``in 1961, when we declared our independence iraq seized the 
 opportunity to claim kuwait as part of iraq. there were threats. the 
 british came in, and arab forces came in to guarantee the sovereignty 
 and territorial integrity of kuwait. in 1963, kuwait and iraq again 
 signed border agreement, thereby defining our territory and iraq's 
 recognition to the sovereignty and territory of kuwait.''

 origins of kuwait 
 
 the establishment of kuwait is attributed to barrak b. ghurair of the 
 bani khalid who used kuwait as a summer residence. the beginning of 
 kuwait goes back to the late 17th century and some historians go 
 further up to 1611. kuwait's name is derived from al-kut which means 
 fortress. kuwait is also called qurain, which is the diminutive of qarn, a 
 horn or hill. kuwait town flourished and grew since its 
 establishment. 
 
 the 'utub, al-sabah family is a branch of 'utub, settled in kuwait 
 during the early 18th century. they lived under the protection 
 of bani khalid until 1752. after that, they became independent and 
 sabah bin jabir was chosen as the first ruler for 'utub. 
 
 carsten niebuhr (1733-1815) a dutch explorer was among the first who 
 wrote about the arabia. he was the mathematician in the scientific 
 expedition sent in 1760 by the king of denmark to arabia. he 
 documented details of arab tribes inhabiting both coasts of the gulf 
 and in the case of kuwait, he was the first writer to give the two 
 names by which the town was known, kuwait and qurain. niebuhr's chart 
 of the persian gulf was the best one drawn before the end of that 
 century, see the map from abu hakima, history of eastern arabia 
 1750-1800. pub.1965. 
 
 al-sabah ('utub) kept good relations with other powers in the eastern 
 arabia. according to ahmed abu hakima's conclusions in his well 
 documented study about the history of eastern arabia between 1750-1800, 
 there was no ottoman rule on the region. ``in the second half of 
 the 18th century, there was no ottoman ruler in eastern arabia. 
 in fact, ottoman rule was not even nominally acknowledged. their 
 attempts to restore their lost position in al-hasa through the 
 campaign of thuwayni in 1786, and ali pasha's expedition against the 
 wahhabis in 1798, were unsuccessful. at kuwait, the nearest point of 
 the utbi domains to the ottoman mutasallimiyya of basra, the shaikh 
 was under no form of ottoman control. the aim of 'utbi external policy 
 was to keep on friendly relations with all the forces working in the 
 gulf.'' (p. 182-183) abu hakima continued in his conclusions that ``kuwait 
 was not a dependency of basra, the persian occupation of basra 
 (1775-79) did not affect kuwait.'' (p.183) 
 
 kuwait had its own identity through the ottoman domination on the arab 
 world. this identity was clear to the british and the french who 
 tried to win the support of kuwait's sheikh between 1793-95 when the 
 british wanted his support in their conflict with the french in the 
 gulf area.

 independent kuwait 
 
 this is the first of a series of articles that testify to the 
 independence of kuwait throughout its history from both iraq and the 
 ottomans. 
 
 the following text is related to an expedition carried out by the 
 ottomans in 1871 against the wahhabis in eastern arabia (where the oil fields 
 in saudi arabia now). kuwait and its ruler at that time, sheikh 
 abdulla ibn sabah ibn jabir, allied themselves with the turks:} 
 
 abdullah' role in the fighting was not a minor one. he joined the 
 expedition as a commander of the large kuwaiti fleet and was the first 
 to use its guns against the besieged town of al-qatif. had it not been 
 for this bombardment by the kuwaiti fleet, al-qatif obviously would 
 not have surrendered in a mere three hours. 
 
 in relation to this, a question arises as to why the ottoman warships 
 refrained from participating in the bombardment. the answer lies in 
 reports relating to the political movements that preceded accounts of 
 the progress of the expedition. because the ottomans were unwilling to 
 jeopardize the maritime peace imposed by britain in the area,  the 
 sultan and the pasha promised their warships would not be used in the 
 war against su'ud or any sheikh in the war zone. kuwait, which was not 
 a party  to the above-mentioned treaty of 1861, was under no such 
 obligation especially since the expedition was not directed against 
 those who had signed it. 
 
 
 [ from the above text, we can see that kuwait was not part of the 
 ottomans or the british colonies. for more details about the mentioned 
 expedition, please check out the source of the above text:

 independent kuwait--2 
 
 this is another article of a series of articles that testify to the 
 independence of kuwait throughout its history from both iraq and the 
 ottomans. 
 
 the following text discusses a dispute on an estate called sufiyya in zubair, 
 iraq, between the sheikh of kuwait and al-zuhair tribe in zubair. 
 
 in 1866, trouble developed over the possession by sheikh sabah of the 
 estate which was [purchased] by his father, sheikh jabir, in 1836. this 
 property was sequestered by a turkish qa'immaqam [representative] on 
 the basis of a claim by the al-zuhair that the vendor had been the 
 owner of a share and not of the n 100e sufiyya. at the same time, 
 sheikh sabah was required to expel from other lands owned by him at 
 the island of fao some cultivators who had immigrated from persian 
 territory. 
 
 it should be recalled that  the turkish officials from the start 
 showed strong prejudice in favor of the zuhair claimants. abdulla ibn 
 sabah,  the eldest son of the ruler of kuwait who went to basra as his 
 father's agent in the case,  narrowly escaped being thrown  into jail 
 upon his refusal to make a payment amounting to the value of seven 
 years produce which the ottoman authorities deemed the plaintiffs were 
 entitled to receive. 
 
 eventually, the dispute was settled by the wali [governor] of baghdad 
 in favor of the sheikh of kuwait. the decision of the governor of 
 basra in favor of the sheikh was apparently made for various reasons. 
 some writers think that the governor wanted to win abdulla over to the 
 turkish side, and suggest that the governor, namiq pasha, even offered 
 him the title of qa'immaqam, which he declined. nevertheless,  the 
 proceedings of the turks in this case were regarded by the inhabitants 
 of kuwait as attempts to cause a confrontation with zubair. it seems 
 that they had anticipated a conflict and according to reports by the 
 british agent at basra, the people of kuwait were prepared to a man to 
 abandon their town rather than submit to turkish rule. lorimer suggests 
 that the final order of namiq pasha, upholding the kuwait sheikh's 
 title to sufiyya, was perhaps due to a report that sheikh sabah, 
 ``with the object of attacking zubair if the decision should go 
 against him, had obtained a promise of countenance and armed support 
 from the wahhabi amir.'' 
 
 in addition to this legal matter with zubair, kuwait had had other 
 problems with basra whose courts tried to jail abdulla ibn sabah, as 
 explained above. however, kuwait's relations with the ottoman 
 mutasallims of basra had at times been amicable and in several 
 instances, those mutasallims even sought refuge at kuwait when 
 pressured by the pashas of baghdad who exercised control over them.

 independent kuwait--3 
 
 this is another article that testifies to the 
 independence of kuwait throughout its history from both iraq and the 
 ottomans. 
 
 
 when pelly [colonel pelly, the british resident in the gulf] visited kuwait 
 for the first time on march 3, 1863, he was 
 met at jahra by sheikh mubarak, the second son of the ruler, sheikh 
 sabah. just before he reached kuwait town on march 4, he was met by 
 sheikh abdulla, the eldest son and heir apparent, who accompanied him 
 to the town gate on their way to ``a very good home,'' which had been 
 prepared for pelly and his companions. ``scarcely had we entered it,'' 
 says pelly, ``when sheikh sabah himself came.'' 
 this description of pelly's reception indicates that to a certain 
 degree it was run according to protocol. 
 
 the government system of kuwait and administration of justice were the 
 subject of comments made by pelly. ``the government is patriarchal,'' 
 says pelly, ``the sheikh managing the political, and the cazee [qadi] 
 the judicial departments. the sheikh himself would submit to the 
 cazee's decision.'' punishment was rarely inflicted. ``indeed, there 
 seems little government interference anywhere, and little need of an 
 army.'' pelly in admiration of how the sheikh ran the affairs of the 
 country, retold the following remark which the sheikh had made to him: 
 
 when my father was nearly 120 years old, he called me and said, ``i 
 shall soon die. i have made no fortune, and can leave you no money, 
 but i have made many and true friends, grapple them. while other 
 states around the gulf have fallen off from injustice or 
 ill-government, mine has gone on [flourishing]. hold to my policy, and 
 though you are surrounded by  desert, and pressed by a once hostile 
 and still wandering set of tribes, you will prosper.''

 independent kuwait--4 
 
 this is another article that testifies to the 
 independence of kuwait throughout its history from both iraq and the 
 ottomans. 
 
 
 the british had always regarded sheikh jabir as a ``good friend,'' but 
 in october 1839, an event took place at kuwait which could have 
 weakened those good relations. on october 30, lieutenant edmunds, the 
 assistant resident at abu shahr [in iran], arrived in kuwait on  a 
 special mission from the resident, captain hennell. his mission was to 
 find out if kuwait was willing to welcome the establishment of a 
 british line of post across the desert from kuwait to the 
 mediterranean. the british war vessel fired the usual salute in honor 
 of the sheikh after it had anchored in the waters of kuwait bay. the 
 salute was not acknowledged and edmunds waited in the vessel for three 
 days before he was able to communicate with the sheikh. 
 
 after edmunds' return to abu shahr, both he and captain hennell 
 explained this unusual behavior of the sheikh, to have been due not 
 to ill-will, but principally to a desire to mislead the egyptian agent 
 at kuwait as to the nature of his relations with the british. 
 therefore, they considered that jabir's conduct did not indicate any 
 change in his friendly policies towards the british. 
 
 if the british tolerated the attitude of jabir towards edmunds, so 
 also did the egyptians. earlier in the same year, some of the most 
 wanted men in the wahhabi camp, such as 'umar ibn 'ufaisan, the 
 wahhabi general  in al-hasa, and wahhabi tribes like al-duwaish, 
 sought refuge in kuwait. 
 
 protection of refugees seeking political 
 asylum in his country was a policy that had been adopted earlier by 
 sheikh abdulla ibn sabah. this can, therefore, be looked upon as an 
 indication of self-confidence; an outcome of kuwait's independence 
 from foreign powers. it corroborates the fact that kuwait, if 
 necessary, was prepared to defend itself against more powerful 
 neighbors. 
 
 this defense depended not only on the walls of the city, but also on 
 bedouin tribes in its neighborhood and a merchant fleet equipped with 
 the necessary guns comparable to other arab fleets of the time. 
 
 as to kuwait's position between 1815 and 1839, one can safely state 
 that it managed to maintain a neutral policy with regard to the 
 struggling wahhabis and egyptians. relations with the british  and 
 even with the pasha of baghdad continued on good terms.

   they were trying to recover land they believed 
   was theirs, much like the argentines in the faulklands.  the kuwaitis pushed 
   just a little too far by taking iraqi oil and saddam thought he'd settle 
   the dispute the old fashioned way... 
 
 are you really this cartoonish?  or do you seriously believe this?  if
 so, please post  your proof. 
 
   everybody would have been much better off had they left the reunited iraq 
   together and concentrated on taking out saddam.  a strong, united iraq with 
   an elected government would have gone a long way to ridding the world of 
   the feudal dictatorships in the gulf. 
 
 are standards at uwisc dropping?  since when has iraq *ever* had an
 "elected" government?
