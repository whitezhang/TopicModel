 it is all so changed by now. but in case any of you is
 interested in what i actually said, i never compared the
 israeli treatment of the palestinians with the holocaust.
 anyway that is the truth if it matters. i was about to forget
 about it myself since everyone started calling me anti-semitic
 for making the comparison that i never made. what i did say was
 that the nazis didn't start with the holocaust and their
 initial actions were similar to what the israelis are doing now.
 	the jews that were stranded on the polish border since
 no country accepted them are like the arabs stranded on the
 lebenese border. no trials, no hearing, just expulsion based on
 guilt due to race.
