 never. i don't know whether anybody formulated and proposed such an 
 index or criteria to determine the magnitude of a genocide as mentioned 
 and advised by toynbee. if one ever does you will easily see the magnitude 
 of the crime of genocide committed by the armenians, by massacring an alien
 population under their rule which constituted about 40% of their total
 population and they did it only within a time period of a little over
 two years in which they enjoyed having full control over this population.
 
 now i would like to ask you:
 
   is there any other genocide in the history of mankind similar to 
   this one?
 
 and again i would like to ask you:
 
   whether the silent and unmourned martyrdom of these hundreds of thousands
   of turks of the republic of armenia who were exterminated as a "final
   solution" to turco-tartar problems in armenia is similar or not
   to the martyrdom of six million jews in europe as a final solution to
   jewish problems?
