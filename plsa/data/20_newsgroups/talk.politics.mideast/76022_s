 armenia is involved in fighting with azarbaijan.  it is armenian
 soldiers from mainland armenia that are shelling towns in azarbaijan.
 you might wish to read more about whether or not it is azeri aggression
 only in that region.  it seems to me that the armenians are better
 organized, have more success militarily and shell azeri towns
 repeatedly.  
 
 i don't wish to get into the cyprus discussion.  turkey had the right to
 intervene, and it did.  perhaps the intervention was not supposed to
 last for so long, but the constant refusal of the greek governments both
 on the island and in greece to deal with reality is also to be blamed
 for the ongoing standoff in the region.  
 
 lastly, why is there not a soc.culture.armenia?  i vote yes for it.
 after all, it is now free.
