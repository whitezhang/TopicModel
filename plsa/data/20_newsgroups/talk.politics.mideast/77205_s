 if he gives you the same story explaining the presence of several
 synagogues in the "moslem quarter", then the story becomes suspect...
 
 in reality, the old city was not as neighborhooded in the past as it
 became after 1948.  in pre-israel jerusalem, there were many jews in
 what is now called the moslem quarter.  there are postal and telephone
 directories from that time to prove it.  it's really rather
 interesting to hear arabs there claim that a house or store has been
 in the family for centuries even when there are clear photos and
 documents that show a jewish-owned business at the same location just
 a few decades ago.
