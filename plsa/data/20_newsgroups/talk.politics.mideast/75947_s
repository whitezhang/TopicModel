 israel has made it quite clear that it has absolutely no desire to
 keep any lebanese territory, and will leave completely after a peace
 treaty is signed and lebanon gains control of its own country from
 syria and controls the terrorists launching strikes against israel
 from lebanon.
 
 considering this, it obviously would be pointless for israel to be
 working on diverting water away from lebanese territory.

 who gets to keep what parts of judea and samaria will be determined in
 a peace settlement.  obviously, israel will keep some, and the arabs
 will get some.
 
 israel has tried to get out of gaza almost from the time it got stuck
 with it.  it has been refused by the arabs several times.  although
 there are some israelis who are extremely reluctant to give it up, i
 seriously doubt israel will keep more than a tiny portion of it in any
 settlement.
 
 the golan heights is a serious security problem, and israel obviously
 will have to keep part of it and give up part of it.  (one should
 remember that the golan heights had been part of the area that was to
 be in britain's palestine mandate, slated to become part of the jewish
 state, until britain traded it to france for other considerations.  in
 other words, it is an historical accident that it was ever part of
 syria.)
