 proven?  maybe not.  but it can certainly be verified beyond a reasonable doubt.  this
 statement and statements like it are a matter of public record.  before the six day war (1967)
 i think nasser and some other arab leaders were broadcasting these statements on
 arab radio.  you might want to check out some old newspapers ahmed.

 i think if you take a look at the hamas covenant (written in 1988) you might get a 
 different impression.  i have the convenant in the original arabic with a translation
 that i've verified with arabic speakers.  the document is rife with calls to kill jews
 and spread islam and so forth.
