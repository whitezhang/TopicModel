 
 only brendan mckay, or maybe arf, would come to the rescue of nazi
 racial theory.  is it distressing brendan?  the point is that any
 eugenic solution to the jewish problem as elias has proposed smacks
 of pure nazism.  the fact that elias' proposal cast the entire "problem"
 as one of the abnormal presence of israeli society in the middle east,
 and that he buried a slam against u.s. aid to israel in the midst of
 his "even-handed" solution of the jewish question, made it obvious what 
 he had in mind: disolving the jewish polity.  that *is* a nazi doctrine:
 rectification of the "abnormal presence" of the jewish people within a 
 larger body politic.  whether your "solution" involves gas, monetary 
 incentives to the poor jews to marry out, or as feisal husseini has 
 said, "disolve the zionist entity by forcing it to engage the normal 
 surrounding arab culture," you are engaged in a nazi project.
 
 just as obvious is your statement: "i will not comment on the value
 or lack of value of elias's proposal."  still striking the glancing
 blow, right brendan?  you could easily see where he was going, but you
 "will not comment."  so, you are complicitous.
 
 what is your fascination with nazi racial theory, anyway?
