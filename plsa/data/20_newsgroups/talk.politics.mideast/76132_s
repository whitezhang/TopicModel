 subject: hebrew labor: racist connotations
 
 
 avoda ivrit - hebrew labor
 ---------------------------------
 
 "hebrew labor" is a concept which has served the zionist movement
 for a long time.  it has a double-barreled message: 1) the new jew
 must learn to do physical labor, i.e. working the land; 2) the
 land in this country must pass into jewish hands, i.e. to the same
 new jew who has "learned" to work it. both aspects of the
 two-pronged concept of "hebrew labor" have racist connotations. on
 the one hand, the diaspora jew's lack of training in physical
 labor is a myth shared by zionists and antisemites.  on the other
 hand, its meaning in practice has been the displacement of the
 arab farmer from the source of his livelihood.
 
 the occupation and the cheap palestinian labor which streamed from
 the occupied territories to the factories, orchards, and
 hot-houses of israel relegated the myth of "hebrew labor" to the
 history books and nostalgic memories of the zionist movement. it
 has blossomed forth anew, however, as the government's answer to
 problems caused by the closure of the territories. today too this
 concept has two functions: 1) to give a progressive look to the
 closing of the palestinian population.  or in the words of
 environment minister yossi sarid, "i have no tears for those who
 get rich off of cheap labor". 2) to furnish an answer to the
 unemployed israeli who complains of being obliged to work for
 wages that are lower than the unemployment insurance he receives.
 
 the israeli government is considering plans to import labor from
 the far- east to replace native people, palestinians, who work in
 their own country, thus creating conflicting interests between two
 ethnical communities and ruling over them.
