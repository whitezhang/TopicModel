 of the contributors (and may be even readers) of this newsgroup seem
 to be muslims, christians and jews, my question could be of some 
 interest to any of them.
         it's my impression that both islam and christianity pay great
 respect to an obscure 1st century jewish lad from judea/galilee. why 
 they chose this particular jew among all possible jews is a mystery
 to me (personally, i prefer woody allen - his stories are much juicier)
 - but perhaps it's an accident of history.
         anyway, it seems that they may be talking about two different
 jews. according to the new testament his father's name was joseph,
 while in qur'an he appears as zachariah.  
         who's right and why the name difference? i'm really curious.
                 david.
