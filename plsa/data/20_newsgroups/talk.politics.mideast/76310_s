 celebrating in joy the cold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million muslim 
 people by your criminal grandparents between 1914 and 1920? did you 
 think that you could cover up the genocide perpetrated by your fascist
 grandparents against my grandparents in 1914? you've never heard of 
 'april 23rd'? 
 
 
  "in soviet armenia today there no longer exists a single turkish soul.
   it is in our power to tear away the veil of illusion that some of us
   create for ourselves. it certainly is possible to severe the artificial
   life-support system of an imagined 'ethnic purity' that some of us
   falsely trust as the only structure that can support their heart beats 
   in this alien land."
             (sahak melkonian - 1920 - "preserving the armenian purity") 
 
 
 during the first world war and the ensuing years - 1914-1920, 
 the armenian dictatorship through a premeditated and systematic 
 genocide, tried to complete its centuries-old policy of 
 annihilation against the turks and kurds by savagely murdering 
 2.5 million muslims and deporting the rest from their 1,000 year 
 homeland.
 
 the attempt at genocide is justly regarded as the first instance
 of genocide in the 20th century acted upon an entire people.
 this event is incontrovertibly proven by historians, government
 and international political leaders, such as u.s. ambassador mark 
 bristol, william langer, ambassador layard, james barton, stanford
