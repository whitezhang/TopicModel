      what a lie..!!??
 
      ask the victims of the nazis.
      don't take the bosnian muslims' word for it.
      ask the holoucost survivors who helped them, you will hear that
      the bosnian muslims (among others) helped them.
 
      i also do object to the term ethnic cleansing, since what is happening
      in bosnia is not ethnic cleansing, they all have the same ethnicity,
      what is different is religion. they are orthodox christians, catholic 
      christians, and muslims.
 
      it's religious cleansing.
 
      also watching people being rounded up and slaughtered by the slitting of 
      the throat, raped collectively and systematically, driven out of their
      homes by the millions (!!!!), tortured in concentration camps, maimed
      and ..... does indeed amount to moral rape.
 
      nothing in the history justifies what's happening.
