 so nice of you all to answer some questions.  and it so nice that most
 of you feel that it would be in your hearts to give the palestinians
 some land - most of you focus on the fact that israel annexed all
 this land and it is a kind gesture to give some of it back.  well,
 i hope that after after a state run by palestinians is established,
 the first decision should be to make jerusalem part of this state -
 by annexing it of course.
