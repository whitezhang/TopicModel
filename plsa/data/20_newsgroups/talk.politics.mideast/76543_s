 this is historically incorrect.  early zionist 'fighters' did indeed
 target civilians.  they made random attacks in arab marketplaces,
 killing innocent passers-by.  your assertion of the opposite is an
 attempt to whitewash history.  anyone can read about the history of
 the zionist terrorists.  a good book to start is the one by j. bowyer
 bell, an expert in international terrorism.  (his main interest is
 irish terrorism.)

 for completeness, arab thuggery of the same period was also rampant,
 and targeted chiefly jewish civilians.  can anyone tell me what the
 opposite of live and let live is?
