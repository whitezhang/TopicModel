 macedonia said yesterday it had neither requested or needs such
 forces.  
 
 this is sort of like sending the national guard to bel air when
 the riot is in south central!
 
 obviously, clinton is again trying to make policy for image purposes
 in america rather than to try to deal with the real problem and
 assume a share of responsibility for the problem.  he obviously
 didn't even consult with the macedonians...he was just looking at
 the map of the former yugoslavia for the safest place to put 
 american troops so he could say to the europeans...hey, look, we
 have troops on the ground in the former yugoslavia too...now let
 me bomb so i can make it look like i am doing something in the
 american media. 
 
 the problem is that the blue berets in bosnia are dead meat if
 clinton starts bombing, but clinton doesn't have the courage to
 ask that the blue berets leave, because then he becomes primarily
 responsible to the bosnian policy of the un and the allies.
 clinton wants to have his cake and eat it too...he wants to feel
 free to use american military power for the sake of domestic
 us politics and his domestic image, but he doesn't want to assume
 the primary international leadership role in the un and among
 the allies, like bush, for all his faults, did in the gulf war...
 because with leadership comes responsibility, and clinton seems
 to want to retain the europeans as scapegoats.
 
 clinton wants to leave the europeans in charge and responsible,
 but wants to freelance on the side...and if his freelancing gets
 too hot, he wants to be able to cut and run...the american public may
 be easily fooled...european leaders aren't.
