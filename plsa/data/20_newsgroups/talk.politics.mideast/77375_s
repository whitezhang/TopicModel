 there are doubts about it. why don't you define what self-hating jew means?
 i found the idea itself of being a self-hating jew to be one of those
 rediculous things that people repeat and repeat because it seems to have a
 meaning when in fact it has none.
 i hope you can come up with a definition in itself and not something like:
 look at this person, that is a self-hating jew.

 the occupied territories as much as i get moved when i see a plestinian
 stabing people in israel.
