 	israel has a right to keep jerusalem for many reasons.  they
 include the fact that the majority of the citizens are israeli, the
 fact that israel maintains religious freedom for all people, and the
 historical connection of judaism to jerusalem.
 
 	when jerusalem was devided by a jordanian invasion in 1948,
 the cease fire agreement included the right of individuals to visit
 religious shrines.  this cease fire agreement was violated by jordan,
 who did not allow jews to visit holy sites under their control.  the
 jordanians also bulldozed every synagoge in the city.  they turned a
 jewish cemetary into a hotel, and used the gravestones in their
 latrines.
 
 	israel has allowed individuals of all religions into
 jerusalem, protected holy sites, and demonstrated its fitness to
 control the city.
 
 	also, i should point out that islam is not centered in
 jerusalem, but has holy sites there.  the home of islam is mecca,
 where all muslims should make a pilgramage (the hajj).  unlike israeli
 jerusalem, jews and christians are not allowed in saudi mecca.
