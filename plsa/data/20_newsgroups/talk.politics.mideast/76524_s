 steve,
 
 if the israelis are stupid enough to "allow" a second "palestinian"
 state (the first one is jordon), then you will probably get your
 wish - and the israelis would get what's coming to them.
 
 however, if the "palestinians" were to somehow demonstrate that 
 they could govern themselves and live in peace with their 
 jewish neighbors, then they would have to give up the idea of
 jerusalem as a part of their state - and you would be disappointed.
