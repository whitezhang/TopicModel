 what a dope!  there is no value for mohammed elabdellaoui to be here
 at a western university.  third-worldist and islamic brain-rot has
 made it impossible for him to acquire and analyze facts appropriately.
 
 the history of the efforts of the mufti of jerusalem to serve the
 nazis in the south balkans and set up muslim ss divisions is
 well-documented.  in general, nazism and the leader-principle
 resonated well among muslim peoples.  khomeini's concept of the faqih
 is a recent example of such resonance.  in fact, totalitarianism is
 etymologically a reasonable translation islam.
 
 to be fair, the mufti did not succeed in getting large numbers of
 muslims to join the ss.  but the rather small muslim ss unit did
 manage to commit attrocities disproportionate to it size.  there were
 also muslim people who were less than enthusiastic about the attempt
 of muslim leaders to entice muslim people to serve the nazi cause
 actively.  and the turkish government ignored practically all nazi
 overtures even though an alliance with the nazis against the soviet
 government would have made a great deal of tactical sense.

 yes, the typical primitive muslim psychopathological psychotic
 behavior upon hearing or reading a disagreeable fact -- start whining
 about the jews.  what a jerk.

 you should go back to your mindlessly stupid 3rd world country.  your
 brain has no business in a civilized first world country.
