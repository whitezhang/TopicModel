 
    the comparison of the palestinian situation with the holocaust
 is insulting and completely false.  any person making such a rude
 and false comparison is either ignorant of the holocaust, or also
 ignorant of the situation in the mideast, or is an anti-semite.
 
    to compare a complicated political situation with the genocide
 of 6,000,000 jews is racist in and of itself.
