 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 i've heard many turks say this and it surpises me that they don't read about
 it.remember the treaty of sevres-as a consequence of being in the axis powers
 in wwi.the turks under international law were supposed to look after their
 minorities ie. greeks,armenians,kurds(i must say turk-kurd relations are 
 improving slightly with time) and not pose a threat to turkey's neighbours.
 the turks blatantly rejected this treaty(the germans grudgingly accepted 
 versailles which was a million times worse for the health and pride of the 
 german people).the greeks who had an army there,were there with british
 and french backing to enforce sevres.
     in possibly the first example of appeasement the young turk government
 managed screwed the treaty of laussane out of the weak allies,this was after 
 the greek forces were were destroyed at smyrna.when this occurred incidently,
 french warships were in the harbour and many greeks trying escape swam to the 
 french warships and climbed aboard only to get their arms cut off by the french
 as they clawed they're way up the sides of the ships.
 libertae,egalitae,fraternatae.
