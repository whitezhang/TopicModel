 that would be nice, but considering professional diplomats between israel and
 athe arabs have been unable to do so for 45 years, i can't see us starting.
 but hey - as soon as anyone wants to discuss things reasonably and in a 
 scholarly manner, count me in.
 
 anyway the responses were mostly negative and i've been

 people have very strong opinions and you need to be careful regarding what 
 you say - if you say, make it factual and be able to back it up.

 thanks for teaching us about the civilized world, andi.  i guess we all just 
 came out either the desert or the ghetto, right?  and no, we are not paid
 israeli lobbyists nor are we conspirators of the zog - we are just people who
 believe in our cause and find offense when people imply some sort dirty dealing
 or disloyalty due to our love of israel (disguised as "paid israeli lobbyists" -
 what kind of image is that?)

 oh!  thank you!  i needed your approval of my heritage.  i guess i can go home
 and feel good now and sleep comfartably knowing that jews _really_ aren't
 worse people than anyone else, contrary to what we all _know_ is true.
