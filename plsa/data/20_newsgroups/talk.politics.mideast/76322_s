 	hate to be simple minded about this tim, but i think its
 really very simple.  he was a dirty jew.  and the only good jew, in
 some peoples mind, is a dead jew.  thats what 40 years of propaganda
 that fails to discriminate between jew and zionist will do.  thats
 what 20 years of statements like the ones i've appended will do to
 someones mind.  they make people sick.  they drag down political
 discourse to the point where killing your opponent is an honorable way
 to resolve a dispute.
 
 	what else can come of such demagogery?  peace?

 arafat on political pluralism:
 
 	``any palestinian leader who suggests ending the intifada
 	exposes himself to the bullets of his own people and
 	endangers his life.  the plo will know how to deal with
 	him.''
 	--- arafat, kuwaiti news agency, 1/2/89
 
 arafat on the massacre at tienamin square:
 
 	``...  on behalf of the arab palestinian people, their
         leadership, and myself...  [i] take this opportunity to express
         extreme gratification that you were able to restore normal order
         after the recent incidents in people's china.''
 	--- arafat in telegram sent to the head of the chinese communist party
 
 yassir arafat, humanitarian:
 
        ``open fire on the new jewish immigrants ...  be they from the
        soviet union, ethiopia, or anywhere else.  it would be a disgrace if
        we did not lift a finger while herds of immigrants settle our
        territory.  i want you to shoot...  it makes no difference if they
        live in jaffa or jericho.  i give you explicit orders to open fire.
        do everything to stop the flow of immigration.''
 	--- yassir arafat, al muharar (lebanese weekly), april 10, 1990
 
 yassir arafat on genocide:
 
 	``when the arabs set off their volcano, there will only be arabs in
 	this part of the world.  our people will continue to fuel the torch
 	of the revolution with rivers of blood until the whole of the
 	occupied homeland is liberated...''
 	--- yasser arafat, ap, 3/12/79
