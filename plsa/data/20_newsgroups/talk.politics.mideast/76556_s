    this is historically incorrect.  early zionist 'fighters' did indeed
    target civilians.  they made random attacks in arab marketplaces,
    killing innocent passers-by.  your assertion of the opposite is an
    attempt to whitewash history.  anyone can read about the history of
    the zionist terrorists.  a good book to start is the one by j. bowyer
    bell, an expert in international terrorism.  (his main interest is
    irish terrorism.)
 
 i am not denying that this type of incident occurred, however, you are
 overlooking the fact that:
 	1. lehi/etzel were proportionally smaller, as was their support.
 	2. the mainstream organization, and the majority of the population
 	   at the time, abhored their methods.
 this was not the case for the palestinian movements that targetted
 civilians.  there was no "mainstream" palestinian movement advocating
 negotiation and diplomatic approaches, or condemning these actions.
