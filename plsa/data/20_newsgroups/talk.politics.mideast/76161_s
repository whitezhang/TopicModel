  "when the russian armies invaded turkey after the sarikamish disaster 
   of 1914, their columns were preceded by battalions of irregular 
   armenian volunteers, both from the caucasus and from turkey. one of 
   these was commanded by a certain andranik, a blood-thirsty adventurer.
   these armenian volunteers committed all kinds of excesses, more
   than six hundred thousand kurds being killed between 1915 and 1916 in 
   the eastern vilayets of turkey."

                             might serve as ways of escape for the turks 
                             and then proceeded in the work of extermination.'
