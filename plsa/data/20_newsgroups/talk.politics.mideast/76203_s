 well, these are armenian and jewish scholars, not me. denying the obvious?

 "the addition of the kars and batum oblasts to the empire increased the
  area of transcaucasia to over 130,000 square miles. the estimated population
  of the entire region in 1886 was 4,700,000, of whom 940,000 (20 percent) were
  armenian, 1,200,000 (25 percent) georgian, and 2,220,000 (45 percent) moslem.
  of the latter group, 1,140,000 were tatars. paradoxically, barely one-third
  of transcaucasia's armenians lived in the erevan guberniia, where the 
  christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. erevan
  uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 armenians
  as compared to 68,000 moslems. by the time of the russian census of 1897,
  however, the armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the
  guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000
  inhabitants. this impressive change in the province's ethnic character 
  notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the armenian 
  republic, a solid block of 370,000 tartars who continued to dominate the 
  southern districts, from the outskirts of ereven to the border of persia." 
  (see also map 1. historic armenia and map 4. administrative subdivisions of 
  transcaucasia).
 
 in 1920, '0' percent turk. 
 
 "we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as 
  ways of escape for the tartars and then proceeded in the work 
  of extermination. our troops surrounded village after village. 
  little resistance was offered. our artillery knocked the huts 
  into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable 
  and inhabitants fled from them into fields, bullets and bayonets 
  completed the work. some of the tartars escaped of course. they 
  found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border 
  into turkey. the rest were killed. and so it is that the whole 
  length of the borderland of russian armenia from nakhitchevan to 
  akhalkalaki from the hot plains of ararat to the cold mountain 
  plateau of the north were dotted with mute mournful ruins of 
  tartar villages. they are quiet now, those villages, except for 
  howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the 
  scattered bones of the dead."

   it is in our power to tear away the veil of illusion that some of us

   life-support system of an imagined 'ethnic purity' that some of us
   falsely trust as the only structure that can support their heart beats 
   in this alien land."

 no kidding. the armenians tore apart the ottoman empire's eastern provinces,
 massacred 2.5 million defenseless turkish women, children and elderly 
 people, burned thousands of turkish and kurdish villages and exterminated 
 the entire turkish population of the armenian dictatorship between 
 1914-1920. such outrageous sleight of hand that is still employed today 
 in armenia brings a depth and verification to the turkish genocide 
 that is hard to match. a hundred years ago armenians again thought 
 they could get whatever they wanted through sheer terror like the 
 russian anarchists that they accepted as role models. several armenian 
 terror groups like asala/sdpa/arf terrorism and revisionism triangle 
 resorted to the same tactics in the 1980s, butchering scores of innocent
 turks and their families in the united states and europe. it seems that 
 they are doing it again, at a different scale, in fascist x-soviet armenia 
 today.
 
 a merciless massacre of the civilian population of the small azeri 
 town of khojali (pop. 6000) in karabagh, azerbaijan, is reported to 
 have taken place on the night of feb. 28 under a coordinated military 
 operation of the 366th mechanized division of the cis army and the 
 armenian insurgents. close to 1000 people are reported to have been 
 massacred. elderly and children were not spared. many were badly beaten 
 and shot at close range. a sense of rage and helplessness has overwhelmed 
 the azeri population in face of the well armed and equipped armenian 
 insurgency. the neighboring azeri city of aghdam outside of the
 karabagh region has come under heavy armenian artillery shelling. city 
 hospital was hit and two pregnant women as well as a new born infant 
 were killed. azerbaijan is appealing to the international community to 
 condemn such barbaric and ruthless attacks on its population and its 
 sovereignty.
