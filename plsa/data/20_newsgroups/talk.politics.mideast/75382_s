   this is the latest from upi 
 
      foreign ministry spokesman ferhat ataman told journalists turkey was
      closing its air space to all flights to and from armenia and would
      prevent humanitarian aid from reaching the republic overland across
      turkish territory.
 
   
    historically even the most uncivilized of peoples have exhibited 
    signs of compassion by allowing humanitarian aid to reach civilian
    populations. even the nazis did this much.
 
    it seems as though from now on turkey will publicly pronounce 
    themselves 'hypocrites' should they choose to continue their
    condemnation of the serbians.
