 like it or not, edward, anwar has a very good, valid point.  obviously,
 in presenting it, he (quite legitimately and deliberately) takes a point
 of view to an extreme which might not have been what you intended, but
 that is one of the best ways to demonstrate a "slippery slope" type of
 argument, which i believe was his aim.
 
 i very frankly believe that the adl will be proved innocent in this
 case.  i doubt there's enough evidence to weigh against them even in a
 civil court, where preponderance of the evidence, not evidence beyond
 any reasonable doubt, is the standard for "winning" such a case.  that,
 however, does not prevent me from seeing the merit in anwar's point. 
 
 rest deleted.
