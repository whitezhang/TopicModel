 israeli nationalism (also known as zionism) is the nationalism of the
 jewish people.  the jewish people are not a new phenomenon at all.
 
 palestinean nationalism is the nationalism of arab people.  arabs have
 been around for a long time.  they already  have some 2 dozen states,
 large and small, covering 98% of the middle east.
 
 more specifically, palestinean nationalism is the nationalism of arabs
 from the region of palestine, just as egyptian nationalism is the
 nationalism of arabs from the region of egypt.  one palestinean state
 already exists in what was once known as palestine: - it is called
 jordan. 
 
 there is no justification in carving out a second and tiny palestinean
 state out of the only jewish state, itself very, very small, just as
 there is no justification in carving out another american state out of
 mexico.
