   you really belong to the 25-30% of ignorants in usa who don't know what
   the holocaust ("shoa" should be the real word) was. first you write in

    instead of joseph goebbels. and you dare to say that you
    "know more about nazi germany than most people (maybe including "us")" ? 
    i'm sure you learned the history of nazi germany and austria from
    your family.

   trying to make comparisons between israels politics and nazi german-
   austrian politics shows only your degree of ignorance (high), intellect
   (low), humanity (none) and antisemitism (average). i respect anybody
   who dissagrees with me as long as he respects me and discusses in a
   civilized manner. i would never say that anybody that critizises israel
   and/or its politics is an antisemite, except he uses antisemitic
   vocabulary/terminology/demagogy. israel is not a perfect country and
   its politicians also commits errors, even some of them are corrupt
   (like politicians in any other country), but they carry a huge burden:
   to care for the safety of all its citizens, and that is really not an
   easy task in a country that is surrounded by enemies who only expect
   that israel commits the one big error and wipe the country (and its
   jewish citizens plus the so-called collaborators, arabs that wanted to
   live in peace with their jewish neighbours) of the map. as i said,
   israel is not a perfect country, but it is the only democracy in the
   whole middle-east and the only country in the world where jews from
   everywhere can have a refuge in case of persecutions in the countries
   they are living.
   our long history has taught us that we cannot rely on non-jewish
   nations and its governments: as soon as there are more or les big
   social-economical-political problems in any country, the first ones
   that pay for the broken glasses are the jews, and later the other
   minorities of the country.

   this is really outrageous: 6.000.000 murdered jews, besides the
   thousands  who survived the shoa in some way or another, and the rest
   of the living ones mourning for all of them ! i don't know what you
   call a "civil libertarian" (never heard about them) but i know only
   one thing: if all of them think like you do it, then "civil libertarians"
   is a new denomination for antisemites. may other civil libertarians come
   to word to this group so that we can learn if a.beyer and me are right
   (that civil libertarians are antisemites), or that i'm wrong and he is
   missusing that word.
   btw, i couldn't care less for what andi beyer appreciates.
