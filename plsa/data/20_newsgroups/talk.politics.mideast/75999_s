 come on!  most if not all arabs are sympathetic to the palestinian war 
 against israel.  that is why the adl monitors arab organizations.  that is
 the same reason the us monitored communist organizations and soviet nationals
 only a few years ago.

 all of these groups have, in the past, associated with or been a part of anti-
 israel activity or propoganda.  the adl is simply monitoring them so that if
 anything comes up, they won't be caught by surprise.
 
 >>2. why does the adl have an interest in that person ?
 
 >paranoia?
 
 no, that is why world trade center bombings don't happen in israel (aside from
 the fact that there is no world trade center) and why people like zein isa (
 palestinian whose american group planned to bow up the israeli embassy and 
 "kill many jews.") are caught.  as mordechai levy of the jdl said, paranoid
 jews live longer.

 they probably do.
