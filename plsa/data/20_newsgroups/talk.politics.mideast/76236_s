 i have read -just today- two articles dripping of hate and offence to
 a great deal of people. i could  find as much matching hatred in your
 articles as i have found in some of the self-righteous "kill-in-the-name
 of god" people.
 
 i don't know why you are so attcaking to everyone, is it a reaction to
 the hatred calls on this newsgroup, or is it a reaction to hardships
 you have seen and experienced from before...
 i have learnt not to judge people by only what they say, but rather
 try to put myself in their place and aspire to understand their
 feelings.
 
 i hope you would be able to do the same with everyone, starting by your
 ownself, because only through that you could be able to understand your
 feelings and act in a the manner you would aspire everyone to adopt.
 
 thanks for your time
