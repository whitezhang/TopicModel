 indeed yaqouv, just like the ugly hatred spread by kahane and
 kahanists, right?   or they are exempt from condemnation, and allowed
 to hate?
 
 no, fool, not at all like hatred of one's sworn enemies, enemies who
 have said time and again that they mean to kill you, and have, by mur-
 dering innocent men, women and children, shown that they really mean it.
 
 the late rabbi never hated anyone merely for having been born into a par-
 ticular group, but he (and i) hate and would/will kill anyone who comes
 to kill jews. i recall very well rabbi kahane's words to the iraqis at a
 demonstration: "you want peace? here is our hand (holding out an open
 hand)! you don't want peace? here is our hand (holding out a fist)!"
 
 i know you'll answer me indirectly, it doesn't bother me a bit.
 keep it up.
 
 indirectly? the wonder of it is that i bother answering the likes of you
 at all!
 
 steel (who's never pissed off).
