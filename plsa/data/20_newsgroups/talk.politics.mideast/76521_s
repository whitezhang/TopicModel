 i would hope that if you intend to have a reasonable discussion you might
 wait until i express an opinion before deciding i should be flamed for it.
 as for 'war' i am not sure how i would define it. if you just look at attacks
 on villages then there is no way of deciding when it started. would you
 count the riots in the 20's and 30's? violence but not war. i personally
 think that 'war', as opposed to civil disturbance or whatever, requires
 organisation, planning and some measure of regualr or semi-regular forces.
 perhaps the arab liberation army counts. i could easily be convinced it was
 so. from what i know they did not have a great deal of planning let alone
 organisation. the haganah and palmach certainly did. that is not a cause
 for criticism, it merely reflects the great organisation generally in the
 'zionist' camp.
 
 >of course, this isn't war, since it's only the arabs attacking.
 
 now you are being silly aren't you? in any case the war did not start
 with the invasion of the arab armies. you see we both agree on something.
 and the previous posters were wrong, no?
 
 >just like last week when the fatah launched katyusha rockets
 >against northern israel.  where does uprising end and war begin?
 
 again i am not sure, i doubt you want my opinion anyway, but i think
 war requires organisation as i said before. it needs a group to command
 and plan. if fatah lauches rockets from southern lebanon (and are you
 sure you have the right group - not the moslems again?) then that sounds
 like war to me. stone throwing does not.
