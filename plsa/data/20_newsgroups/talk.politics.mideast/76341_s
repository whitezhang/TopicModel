 pl: 1.  so, did the turks kill the armenians?
 
 ac: so, did the jews kill the germans? 
 ac: you even make armenians laugh.
 
 ac: "an appropriate analogy with the jewish holocaust might be the
 ac: systematic extermination of the entire muslim population of 
 ac: the independent republic of armenia which consisted of at 
 ac: least 30-40 percent of the population of that republic. the 
 ac: memoirs of an armenian army officer who participated in and 
 ac: eye-witnessed these atrocities was published in the u.s. in
 ac: 1926 with the title 'men are like that.' other references abound."
 
 typical mutlu.  pvdl asks if x happened, the response is that y
 happened.  even if we grant that the armenians *did* do what cosar
 accuses them of doing, this has no bearing on whether the turks did
 what they are accused of.
 
 while i can understand how an ai could be this stupid, i
 can't understand how a human could be such a moron as to either let
 such an ai run amok or to compose such pointless messages himself.
 
 i do not expect any followup to this article from argic to do anything
 to alleviate my puzzlement.  but maybe i'll see a new line from his
 list of insults.
