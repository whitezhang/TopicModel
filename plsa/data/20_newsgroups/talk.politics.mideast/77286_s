    it is indeed different usage of the word muslim . in bosnia , it is more or
 less used as an ethnic term not as religious one . there are people in bosnia
 who refer to themselves as "christian bosnian muslims" if you can make sense
 of that . bosnian serbs and bosnian muslims have the same language. 
 bosnian muslims are mainly beleivers of islam. i got this from bosnian muslim
 friend of mine who goes to university of texas in austin.
