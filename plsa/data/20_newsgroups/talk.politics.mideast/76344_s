 you are conveniently ommitting the fact that the arab governments told the
 arab citizens of israel to leave israel, join with the arab armies so that
 after what they felt like an assured victory occured, these arabs could
 return to their former homes, reclaim them as well as anything else they
 wanted that belonged to jews.  when the arabs lost, israel was left with
 a bunch of people who has just tried to kill them who now wanted back
 into the country as citizens.  what would you have done?  let them in so
 they could kill jews?  israel sees those arabs who stayed as citizens 
 because they were loyal to israel during the war and didn't leave.  of
 course some arabs could have left to avoid the fighting but distinguishing
 between the two is impossible.  therefore a decision was made based on
 secuturity of the country.

 no kibbutz that i have ever visited has any "employees" unless they had to
 hire some people for the restaurants, hotels etc if there weren't enough 
 people on the kibbutz to do them.  in such cases, they are paid properly.
 if a kibbutz turns away an arab, 9i have never seen or heard of this) but it
 reflects only on the membership comittee of that kibbutz, not the whole
 kibbutz movement.

 this just shows how ignorant you are of israeli politics.  although the 
 major parties in israel aren't religious (however not totally secular),
 due to the format of the government (coalition) the religious parties have
 always had a lot of pull since they were needed to form a majority coalition.
 in fact, from what i heard the present government is the least influenced
 by the religious parties in the existance of israel.  israel cannot be
 called a secular state.  for instace, haifa is the only city in the country
 (except for maybe some arab cities) where buses run on the jewish sabbath.  
 there are many other examples of religion in israel.  marriages in israel
 are not contolled by the state, but by rabbis and priests.  obviously your 
 disbelief of this fact sheds some light of your ignorance of the country
 you claim to know so much about.
