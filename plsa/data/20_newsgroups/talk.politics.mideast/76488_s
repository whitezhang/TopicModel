 Oh, why do you expose your ignorance?  The US has been running on debt for 
 the past four generations and has still financed what it pleases.
 
 And after the Gulf War, Israel could do whatever it wanted after
 not decimating Iraq after the Scud attacks.  It was encouraged, but
 by no means forced, to negotiate.
 
 Mr. Baker, to address all of your points would be impossible, but in a 
 nutshell, it is hypocritical for you to attack Israel's presence in
 Lebanon without attacking Syria.  Syrian occupation has been hostile,
 and amounts to annexation.  Israel's is clearly defensive.  If it 
 were not defensive, you would see all of Lebanon occupied, and governed by
 Israel.  But that is not what Israel wants.
