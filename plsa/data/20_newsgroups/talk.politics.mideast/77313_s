 and the best evidence you can find is second hand hearsay from
 an unnamed source? you may indeed be confusing *some* muslims 
 with nazi armenians. altogether 30,000 nazi armenians served in 
 various units in the german wehrmacht, according to ara j. berkian. 
 14,000 in predominantly armenian army units, 6,000 in german army 
 units, 8,000 in various working units and 2,000 in the waffen-ss.[1]
 
 a number of these nazi armenians were volunteers from france,
 greece, rumania and bulgaria who had chosen to commit
 themselves to the german war effort. derounian says that
 
 "dashnag armenians from france bore the mark 'legion 
 armenienne.'"[2]
 
 that nazi armenians like dro 'the butcher' and nezhdeh sided
 with the germans probably had an impact on the decision of
 armenians who overwhelmingly opted for armed service.

 in fall 1942, the armenian infantry battalions 808 and 809 were formed,
 to be followed by battalions 810, 812 and 813 in spring 1943. in the 
 second half of 1943 infantry battalions 814, 815 and 816 were created.
 these battalions together with other indigenous caucasian units were
 attached to the infantry division 162. also attached to id 162 were
 the field battalions ii/9, i/125 and i/198 which were formed between
 may 1942 and may 1943. altogether twelve armenian battalions served the
 nazi army, if battalion ii/73, which was not employed at any time, is to be
 included.[1] most battalions were commanded by nazi armenian officers.
 armenians wore german uniforms with an armband in the dashnag colours 
 red-blue-orange and the inscription 'armenien.'

 while having collaborated with the nazis against stalin during the
 second world war, nazi armenians changed their policy after hitler's
 defeat. they now backed stalin's claims on eastern turkish provinces,
 hoping that these would be annexed to soviet armenia and their muslim 
 population would be exterminated. stalin played on armenian national
 sentiments to enlist the support of armenians in the ussr and america
 for his imperial ambitions.[1] stalin's ultimatum to the turkish
 government led truman to formulate his famous doctrine.
