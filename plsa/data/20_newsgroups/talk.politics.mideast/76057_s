 so, did the jews kill the germans? 
 you even make armenians laugh.
 
 "an appropriate analogy with the jewish holocaust might be the
  systematic extermination of the entire muslim population of 
  the independent republic of armenia which consisted of at 
  least 30-40 percent of the population of that republic. the 
  memoirs of an armenian army officer who participated in and 
  eye-witnessed these atrocities was published in the u.s. in
  1926 with the title 'men are like that.' other references abound."

 >2.  or was it the armenians who massacred the turks?
 
 yes. to be exact, armenians slaughtered 2.5 million muslim people between 
 1914 and 1920.

 "the addition of the kars and batum oblasts to the empire increased the
  area of transcaucasia to over 130,000 square miles. the estimated population
  of the entire region in 1886 was 4,700,000, of whom 940,000 (20 percent) were
  armenian, 1,200,000 (25 percent) georgian, and 2,220,000 (45 percent) moslem.
  of the latter group, 1,140,000 were tatars. paradoxically, barely one-third
  of transcaucasia's armenians lived in the erevan guberniia, where the 
  christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. erevan
  uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 armenians
  as compared to 68,000 moslems. by the time of the russian census of 1897,
  however, the armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the
  guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000
  inhabitants. this impressive change in the province's ethnic character 
  notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the armenian 
  republic, a solid block of 370,000 tartars who continued to dominate the 
  southern districts, from the outskirts of ereven to the border of persia." 
  (see also map 1. historic armenia and map 4. administrative subdivisions of 
  transcaucasia).
 
 in 1920, '0' percent turk. 
 
 "we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as 
  ways of escape for the tartars and then proceeded in the work 
  of extermination. our troops surrounded village after village. 
  little resistance was offered. our artillery knocked the huts 
  into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable 
  and inhabitants fled from them into fields, bullets and bayonets 
  completed the work. some of the tartars escaped of course. they 
  found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border 
  into turkey. the rest were killed. and so it is that the whole 
  length of the borderland of russian armenia from nakhitchevan to 
  akhalkalaki from the hot plains of ararat to the cold mountain 
  plateau of the north were dotted with mute mournful ruins of 
  tartar villages. they are quiet now, those villages, except for 
  howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the 
  scattered bones of the dead."
