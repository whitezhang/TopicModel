 oh yeah, israel was really ready to "expand its borders" on the holiest day
 of the year (yom kippur) when the arabs attacked in 1973.  oh wait, you
 chose to omit that war...perhaps because it 100% supports the exact 
 opposite to the point you are trying to make?  i don't think that it's
 because it was the war that hit israel the hardest.  also, in 1967 it was
 egypt, not israel who kicked out the un force.  in 1948 it was the arabs
 who refused to accept the existance of israel based on the borders set
 by the united nations.  in 1956, egypt closed off the red sea to israeli
 shipping, a clear antagonistic act.  and in 1982 the attack was a response
 to years of constant shelling by terrorist organizations from the golan
 heights.  children were being murdered all the time by terrorists and israel
 finally retaliated.  nowhere do i see a war that israel started so that 
 the borders could be expanded.
