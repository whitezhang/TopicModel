 [hamid] anybody has any information about the number of the people have been 
 [hamid] killed by israel  during these 44 happy year?
 
 does anybody know how many jews, arabs, christians and others have died 
 in terrorist attacks and wars over these 45 years due to arab rhetoric and 
 rejectionism? the number is probably close to 100,000 at least.
 
 all these lives wasted because the arabs did not accept the partition plan 
 in 1947.
