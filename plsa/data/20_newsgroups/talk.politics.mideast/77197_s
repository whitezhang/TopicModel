 precisely, why not cuba??  why not???  the hatians are being ruled by thugs 
 and their elected leader has asked support to reestablish the peoples will.  if 
 the u.s. or any other democracy wishes to, they are in the perfect right to 
 help them without any whining from thir parties.  after all if it turns out to 
 be colonialism and the poeple don't like it, they' find a way to throw them out.

 who ever said people who commit genocide have the right to commit genocide??  
 i want a world where criminals agains humanity have no place to hide, while you 
 want special sovereignties designed to protect them.  nobody has the right to 
 commit crimes against humanity, and if they do they loose all right to self 
 determination.  if this is classical colonialism, then so be it.
