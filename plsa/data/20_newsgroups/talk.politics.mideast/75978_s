 	one of these days you'll learn that the way to stop israel
 from fighting back is to stop attacking.  if there were no attacks in
 the security zone for a year because the lebanese army could maintain
 the peace, then lebanon would be in much better shape.
 
 	tell me something, though.  why do syrian troops not get
 attacked?  aren't they occupying lebanon?
 
 	israel has repeatedly stated that it will leave on two
 conditions.  one is a demonstration that the lebanese army can keep
 the peace.  the second is that the syrians pull out as well.
