 pardon me tim, but i do not see how it can be possible for the idf to fail
 to detect the presence of those responsible for planting the bomb which
 killed the three idf troops and then later know the exact number and 
 whereabouts of all of them. several villages were shelled. how could the idf
 possibly have known that there were guerrillas in each of the targetted
 villages? you see, it was an arbitrary act of "retaliation".

 the problem, tim, is that the original reason for the invasion was palestinian
 attacks on israel, not lebanese attacks.

 first, i believe that my statement applies to both sides.
 
 having said that, i think it is neccessary to separate what is legitimately
 negotiable and what is not. for example, no country has the right to abuse
 one's human rights. deciding whether there will be one or two states in
 palestine is a legitimate question. while de facto one state exists, israel 
 must treat all within its domain equitably.

 yes, i am afraid that what you say is true but that still does not justify
 occupying your neighbor's land. israel must resolve its disputes with the
 native palestinians if it wants peace from such attacks.

 not true. lebanese were not attacking israel in the 1970s. with a strong
 lebanese government (free from syrian and israeli interference) i believe
 that the border could be adequately patrolled. the palestinian heavy
 weapons have been siezed in past years and i do not see as significant a
 threat as once existed.
 
 please, tim, don't fall into the trap of treating lebanese and palestinians
 as all part of the same group. there are too many who think all arabs or all
 muslims are the same. too many times i have seen people support the bombing
 of palestinian camps in "retaliation" for an idf death at the hands of the
 lebanese resistance or the shelling of lebanese villages in "retaliation" for
 a palestinian attack.
