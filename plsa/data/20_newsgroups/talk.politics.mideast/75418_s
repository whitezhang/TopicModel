 "we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as 
  ways of escape for the tartars and then proceeded in the work 
  of extermination. our troops surrounded village after village. 
  little resistance was offered. our artillery knocked the huts 
  into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable 
  and inhabitants fled from them into fields, bullets and bayonets 
  completed the work."
