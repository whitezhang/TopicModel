 anyone who can repeate this choice piece of tripe without checking
 his/her sources does not deserve to be believed.  the gaza strip does
 not possess the highest population density in the world.  in fact, it
 isn't even close.  just one example will serve to illustrate the folly
 of this statement:  the city of hong kong has nearly ten times the
 population of the gaza strip in a roughly comparable land area.  the
 centers of numerous cities also possess comparable, if not far higher,
 population densities.  examples include manhattan island (ny city), sao
 paolo, ciudad de mexico, bombay,... 
 
 need i go on?  the rest of mr. davidsson's message is no closer to the
 truth than this oft-repeated statement is.
