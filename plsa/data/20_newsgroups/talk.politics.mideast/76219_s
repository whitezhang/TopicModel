 what gives isreal the right to keep jeruseleum?  it is the home of the muslim a
 s well as jewish religion, among others.  heck, nobody ever mentions what yitza
 k shamir did forty or fifty years ago which is terrorize westerners much in the
  way abdul nidal does today.  seems isrealis are nowhere above arabs, so theref
 ore they have a right to jerusaleum as much as isreal does.
