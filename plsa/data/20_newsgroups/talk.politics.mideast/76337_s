 	ok, i'll admit it.  i can't find a quote with my meager online
 resources.  but i did find this little gem:
 
 	``when the arabs set off their volcano, there will only be arabs in
 	this part of the world.  our people will continue to fuel the torch
 	of the revolution with rivers of blood until the whole of the
 	occupied homeland is liberated...''
 	--- yasser arafat, ap, 3/12/79
 
 	so, ahmed is right.  there was nothing about driving jews into
 the sea, just a bit of "ethnic cleansing," and a river of blood.
 
 	is this an improvement?
