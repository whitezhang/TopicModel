 i wouldn't bet on it.
 
 arab governments generally don't care much about the palestineans and
 their struggle but find it useful for political purposes back home.
 they are happy to leave the palestineans largely under israeli control
 because that leaves the job of controlling them to the israelis.  the
 israelis don't like this job any more than king hussein of jordan
 liked it -- and he managed to kill them off at the rate of thousands
 per month when they started an intifada in jordan.  the governments of
 syria, lebanon and egypt all feel similarly.  however, proclaiming
 public support for the palestinean war against israel deflects
 criticism from deep problems at home and lends an air of legitimacy to
 even the most brutal arab tyrants.
 
 arab *people* probably aren't much more sympathetic.  palestineans
 have shown a willingness to destabilize and plunder in jordan,
 lebanon and kuwait and are viewed with suspicion elsewhere.
 
 you might still be right in sympathy to the war against israel, but i
 suspect that many arabs, far removed from the immediate border with
 israel (e.g. in kuwait or morroco), couldn't care less.
