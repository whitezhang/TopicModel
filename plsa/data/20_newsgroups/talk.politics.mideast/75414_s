 i donot know about you, but it makes full sense to me.
 israelis are being killed because israel is occupying , let israel withdraw
 and israeli blood will be saved. it isnot the palestineans who undermined
 the right of life of israelis, but it is israel which occupied and exposed 
 the life of its citizens to the the unconcluded war of 1967 !
 
 more generally, the violence in the occupied terretories is part of the intifada,
 and i had previously posted a "long" article about this issue, whom i finished
 by an open question:
 suppose the intifada stops, what is the motive for israel to withdraw ?
 donot tell hope for peace and this bullshit. everybody in the world looks
 and hopes for peace, so why isnot there any. hope of peace is necessary
 but not sufficient motive.

 as for the arabian countries, their problems are an arabian concern. 
 the arabian people can deal with it themselves, if the west doesnot intervene.
 as for serbs, i donot think that those fucked up rapists (excuse my language
 but it really hurts as much if i was in bosnia itself) arenot humans. those
 surely came from outer space or something. no human can allow himself
 to see such attrocities than to participate in.

 ok.

 my definition is the same as yours, but one has to look into the world politics.
 in politics, a "solution" doesnot imply "just solution".

 it seems that it was problem in the definition of "solution".
 i think a solution must be just, because otherwise it would never be lasting.
 however, when politicians say a solution, they donot mean a just solution but 
 just a solution.
