 the litani river flows in a west-southwestern direction and indeed does
 not run through the buffer zone.  the hasbani does flow into the jordan
 but contrary to what our imaginative poster might write, there has been
 no increase in the inflow from this river that is not proportional to
 climatic changes in rainfall.
