 what a fool! for the above to be true, [which it is not] the wwi russian
 general dro must have worked from his grave to assist x-soviet armenia.
 soviet armenia became ex-soviet armenia in 1991 and dro died in 1958! then
 dro would have to travel back in time, while dead, from 1991 to wwii to help
 nazi germany!
