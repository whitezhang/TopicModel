 if you recall, a subject was raised some weeks ago that touched upon
 this.  when someone claimed that guerillas were manifestations of
 popular sentiment, the topic arose:"when does a civilian stop
 becoming a civilian?".  if he houses and shelters guerillas of
 his own free will, aiding them, has he violated his "civilian" status?

 but don't you see that the same statement can be made both ways?
 if lebanon was interested in peace then it should accept the word
 of israel that the attacks were the cause for war and disarming the
 hizbollah will remove the cause for its continued occupancy.  afterall,
 israel has already staged two parts of the withdrawal from areas
 it occupied in lebanon during slg.

 that is not exactly true.  the hizbollah and their affiliated groups
 have made several attempts to infiltrate the border of israel.

 true, but the syrians did allow (until at least 1984) guerillas to operate
 in the areas that were under their control, provided that those guerillas
 were attacking israeli lines.
 
 the problem is that syria is also not as stable a partner for long term
 peace as others in the area might be.
