 henrik]  the armenians in nagarno-karabagh are simply defending their 
 henrik]  rights to keep their homeland and it is the azeris that are 
 henrik]  invading their homeland.
 
 
 he]     homeland? first nagarno-karabagh was armenians homeland today
 he]     fizuli, lacin and several villages (in azerbadjan)
 he]     are their homeland. can't you see the
 he]     the  "great armenia" dream in this? with facist methods like
 he]     killing, raping and bombing villages. the last move was the
 he]     blast of a truck with 60 kurdish refugees, trying to
 he]     escape the from lacin, a city that was "given" to the kurds
 he]     by the armenians.
 
 nagorno-karabakh is in azerbaijan not armenia. armenians have lived in nagorno-
 karabakh ever since there were armenians. armenians used to live in the areas
 between armenia and nagorno-karabakh and this area is being used to invade 
 nagorno- karabakh. armenians are defending themselves. if azeris are dying
 because of a policy of attacking armenians, then something is wrong with this 
 policy.
 
 if i recall correctly, it was stalin who caused all this problem with land
 in the first place, not the armenians.
 
 henrik]  however, i hope that the armenians will force a turkish airplane
 henrik]  to land for purposes of searching for arms similar to the one
 henrik]  that happened last summer. turkey searched an american plane
 henrik]  (carrying humanitarian aid) bound to armenia.
 
 he]     don't speak about things you don't know: 8 u.s. cargo planes
 he]     were heading to armenia. when the turkish authorities
 he]     announced that they were going to search these cargo
 he]     planes 3 of these planes returned to it's base in germany.
 he]     5 of these planes were searched in turkey. the content of
 he]     of the other 3 planes? not hard to guess, is it? it was sure not
 he]     humanitarian aid.....
 
 what story are you talking about? planes from the u.s. have been sending
 aid into armenian for two years. i would not like to guess about what were in
 the 3 planes in your story, i would like to find out.
 
 
 he]     search turkish planes? you don't know what you are talking about.
 he]     turkey's government has announced that it's giving weapons
 he]     to azerbadjan since armenia started to attack azerbadjan
 he]     it self, not the karabag province. so why search a plane for weapons
 he]     since it's content is announced to be weapons?
 
 it's too bad you would want turkey to start a war with armenia.
