 first, the following two quite normal phrases:    
 
 >  why did not anyone venture to answer andi's question in an intelligent
 >  and unoffending manner?                                    ^^^^^^^^^^^   
        ^^^^^^^^^^^
 >  now will we please start having some intelligent conversation?
                                         ^^^^^^^^^^^   
 
 and then he shows us what he means by "intelligent and unoffending manner" 
 and "intelligent conversation":   
 
 >  i have never seen such immaturity among semitophiles.
                                            ^^^^^^^^^^^^

    later he reveals the truth:
 
 >  ... i mention this not because i'm anti semitic [i'm part jewish] .....
                                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    shurely he is an anti-semite (call it anti-jew), maybe because he
    is "part jewish"  (e.g. his mother might have *dated*  a jew who
    didn't marry her, and so she got a little bastard whom she taught
    hatred).  
    
    he is also a coward since he doesn't dare to sign with his name.  
    at the end he signs with a highly intelligent and intellectual 
    phrase:   
  
 >                            pissed off at immature,
 >                          closeminded, self righteous
 >	                            semites

    the  nazis  might also have sent this bastard to the gas chambers
    because of his "part jewish"ness (only that he is not aware of it).   
 
 ps: i wonder what kind of educational institution is @virginia.edu.
     could it be the "free kkk-university of virginia" ? ;-)
