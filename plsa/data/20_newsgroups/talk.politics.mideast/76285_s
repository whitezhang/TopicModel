 i cannot deny that actions of fanatics from both sides were reported.
 a minority of greek idiots indeed attack religious places, which

 oh no. please do give as a brake !
 minorities in turkish treated like that ? your own countrymen die
 in the prisons every day bacause of their political beliefs, an this
 is reported by turks, and you want us to believe tha turkey is the paradise
 of human rights ?  business of greeks i turkey? yes 80 years ago !
 you seem to be intelligent, so before presenting turkey as the paradise of
 human rights just invastigate this matter a bit more.
