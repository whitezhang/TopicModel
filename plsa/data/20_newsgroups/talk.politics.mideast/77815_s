 
    i  must  finally  admit the total truth that is central to the
 core of my being.
 
    i  am  a  homosexual.   not  just  a  normal,  run-of-the-mill
 homosexual,  but  a  rabid homosexual zionist.  i hide behind the
 facade  of  pro-israel  rhetoric so as to deflect suspicion of my
 true  motive:  the exchange of romantic dialogue with nick steel,
 and  our  frequent  fudge-packing   adventures,  which   we  have
 endeavored  to maintain at a discreet level.  of course, the need
 for discretion has been obviated by my own admission here.
 
    the  truth  is  that  i  could  no longer hold this saccharine
 secret  any  longer.   i love  you,  nick,  and  my  love for you
 surpasses  that  which  i  hold  for eretz yisrael, may she stand
 forever, as our love has, and as your erection insinuating itself
 into my kosher rectum always will.
