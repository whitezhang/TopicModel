 "in this movement we took with us three thousand turkish soldiers who
  had been captured by the russians and left on our hands when the russians
  abandoned the struggle. during our retreat to karaklis two thousand of
  these poor devils were cruelly put to death. i was sickened by the
  brutality displayed, but could not make any effective protest. some,
  mercifully, were shot. many of them were burned to death. the method
  employed was to put a quantity of straw into a hut, and then after
  crowding the hut with turks, set fire to the straw."
