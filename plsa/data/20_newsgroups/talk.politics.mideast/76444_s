 	a few things about the university. it is more fun than some may
 admit. partying does go on and it has consistently been ranked
 one of playboy's top party schools. but we do study and more
 importantly learn a lot. the overall uva drug use is actually
 lower than the average college in the u.s. 
 	there is no hate law on the books even though they (the
 forces of pc) tried to have one last year( by the way a similar
 law at the university of wisconsin ? was found unconstitutional
 last year). there is a law
 against relationship of professors with their students or
 advisees that just passed. 
 	thomas jefferson was the sole author of the virginia
 statute for religious freedom(the basis for the first ten
 amendments), though he is not given full credit for righting
 the bill of rights. so someone who picked on me for that is
 right. 
 	by the way, we're the man in everything. sports
 academics and partying. i'm sure a lot of other schools are
 good at what they do as well, so don't start mailing me junk.
 i'm happy where i am and maybe i'll go to one of y'alls medical
 schools in a couple of years.
