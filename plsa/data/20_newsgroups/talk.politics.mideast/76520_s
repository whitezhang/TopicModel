 i don't like this comment about "typical" thinking. you could state
 your interpretation of exodus without it. as i read exodus i can see 
 a lot of killing there, which is painted by the author of the bible
 in ideological/religious colors. the history in the desert can be seen
 as an ethos of any nomadic people occupying a land. that's why i think
 it is a great book with which descendants arabs, turks and mongols can 
 unify as well.
