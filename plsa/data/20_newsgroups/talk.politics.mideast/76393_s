 
 dear folks,
 
 i am still awaiting for some sensible answer and comment.
 
 it is a fact that the inhabitants of gaza are not entitled to a normal
 civlized life. they habe been kept under occupation by israel since 1967
 without civil and political rights. 
 
 it is a fact that gazans live in their own country, palestine. gaza is
 not a foriegn country. nor is telaviv, jaffa, askalon, beersheba foreign
 country for gazans. all these places are occupied as far as palestinians
 are concerned and as far as common sense has it. 
 
 it is a fact that zionists deny gazans equal rights as israeli citizens
 and the right to determine by themsevles their government. when zionists
 will begin to consider gazans as human beings who deserve the same
 rights as themselves, there will be hope for peace. not before.
 
 somebody mentioned that gaza is 'foreign country' and therefore israel
 is entitled to close its borders to gaza. in this case, gaza should be
 entitled to reciprocate, and deny israeli civilians and military personnel
 to enter the area. as the relation is not symmetrical, but that of a master
 and slave, the label 'foreign country' is inaccurate and misleading.
 
 to close off 700,000 people in the strip, deny them means of subsistence
 and means of defending themselves, is a collective punishment and a
 crime. it is neither justifiable nor legal. it just reflects the abyss 
 to which israeli society has degraded. 
 
 i would like to ask any of those who heap foul langauge on me to explain
 why israel denies gazans who were born and brought up in jaffa to return
 and live there ? would they be allowed to, if they converted to judaism ?
 is their right to live in their former town depdendent upon their
 religion or ethnic origin ? please give an honest answer.
 
 elias
