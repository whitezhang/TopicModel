 
 hi,
 
 in canada, any gun that enters a national park must be sealed (i think it's a
 small metal tag that's placed over the trigger).  the net result of this is
 that you _can't_ use a gun to protect yourself from bears (or psychos) in the
 national parks.  instead, one has to be sensitive to the dangers and annoyances
 of hiking in bear country, and take the appropriate precautions.
 
 i think this policy makes the users of the national parks feel a little closer
 to nature, that they are a part of nature and, as such, have to deal with
 nature on it's own terms.
