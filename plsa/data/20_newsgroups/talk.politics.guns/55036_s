 the fbi, cia, batf, etc. are federal agencies, you are correct.  but to
 think there is a visible and clear chain of command up to the prez, and
 that these agencies inform reno who informs clinton, etc. is naive.  these
 agencies operate as distinct and seperate entities and while they have
 ultimate accountability to the prez, they make their own moves, and then
 tell the prez, who says, "i knew all along".  while this may not seem right,
 or it may not fit our idealistic need to see a structured chain of command
 leading to the white house, thats the way it is.  bureaucracys are not, after
 all, composed of 3 or 4 people who talk on a regular basis, have lunch, and
 maybe golf together.  i do agree, the fbi, batf messed up. i'm not sure if
 they should have stormed the compound or not.  by the way, jehova witnesses
 are a religious minority in this country.  protestantism is a minority
 religion in the world.  bds were a cult by all definitions and history of
 cults.  to say this is not to persecute a religious or ethnic enclave.
 koresh said he was the messiah.  i was raised a baptist, although i do
 not practice the religion and do not think that the big guy upstairs is
 digging the divisiveness, closemindedness, and right-wing morons that are
 associated with the religion.  anyway, the messiah that i was taught about
 would not be carrying a gun, let alone stockpiling weapons.  you can doubt
 batf reports all you want, david koresh was not a poor soul who was
 unjustly persecuted.  while some of the information coming from the u.s
 government is being exagerated so as keep public opinion on their side, i
 do believe that some of the things that former cult members have said
 are true.  anyway, this is just another excuse to try and blame president
 clinton for something.  people who attempt to do this for political motives
 should be ashamed.  they are the ones who are keeping this country from
 reaching its full potential.
