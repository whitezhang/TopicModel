        i'll point out that the whole point of the difficult amendment
 process was to require a super-majority to change the supreme law,
 making it impossible for a "majority" of the people to simply change
 the law on a whim.  simply changing the meaning based on "the
 representatives" of the people effectively destroys the amendment
 process.  the state's, you know, are also entitled to a say under
 that process.

        i'll note that that right could be considered protected under
 the first amendment's protection of peaceful assembly.  unless
 you would consider a militia inherently non-peaceful, then they've
 stated the same thing twice.
