 i doubt if koresh had let the batf have a look inside his place as they 
 intended to do, "orchestrated character assassination, noise torture, and
 a holocaust" would never have come to pass.
 
 the bd's killed members of the batf on the first day. "orchestrated character
 assassination and noise torture" seem like a small retribution.  the use
 of tanks is quesionable however.
