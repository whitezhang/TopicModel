 
 i called the texas bill tracking people (800/253-9693) again today 
 regarding hb 1776 -- concealed carry.  well, it was supposed to come
 up for a vote this past wednesday, but the bill got sent back to
 the public safety committee.  the psc gave it a favorable rating
 again, and the bill must now be scheduled for debate by
 the calendars committee again.
