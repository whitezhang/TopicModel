 i believe that this is not quite correct. my understanding is that lds is
 engaged on a project to "convert" the souls of deceased persons of other
 religions, in order to spare them from damnation and gain them entrance into
 heaven. to this end, the church has compiled extensive genaeological records, so
 that they will know the names of people to convert. a long article in the new
 yorker a few years ago described the lds research methods in some detail (for
 example, some researchers pay visits to local native storytellers to learn the
 names of people long dead). this sounds like just the sort of lie that would be
 made up about any unusual religion, but the new yorker story convinced me that
 there is some truth to it (the new yorker used to do extensive fact-checking, and
 the story was quite detailed).
