 the documentary interviewed koresh and current and ex-members.  
 the documentary disucussed koresh's "christ" status inside the cult, 
 cult brain-washing techniques, and unusual sex practices (the leader 
 gets any he wants, and tells others when they can or can't).  i will let 
 others decide if using religious authority to have sex with a minor is 
 technically child abuse or not.

 well, if a fire was deliberately set by members of the cult, then the 
 history and background of the cult is very relevant.  the history 
 and backgournd of the jones cult was very important in understanding 
 what happened at jonestown.
 
 not taking into account the history and background of koresh's cult may 
 also help explain why the fbi and batf so badly predicted the reponses 
 they would get from inside the compund nearly every step of the way in 
 this badly handled affair.

 it is likely that there will be at least two investigations (jd and congress) 
 at this point.

 interesting and conflicting details are starting to come out.  i have 
 reverted back to wait mode to find out whether the fire was intentional 
 or accidental and how it started and why it spread so fast.
