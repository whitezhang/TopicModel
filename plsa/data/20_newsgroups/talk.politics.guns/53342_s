 	the problem is this: when people in this newsgroup post misogynist, 
 	homophobic nonsense they only reinforce the stereotype of guns as some
 	sort of phallic extender. this kind of "humor" very seldom occurs
 	in other freedom oriented news groups.  that leads me to suspect
 	(and it hurts alot) that there is a higher percentage of misogynists
 	and homophobes among gun supporters. this is a source of extreme
 	embarassment. it makes me crazy that a few individuals
 	who can't restrain their misogynist and homophobic "humor" make 
 	anyone who supports the 2nd amendment look as if their reasons for
 	favoring gun ownership are psychosexual.  if speaking out forcefully
 	against this nonsense  means that i should switch to decaf, so be it
 	there is no excuse for that kind of "humor".  it's wrong and it 
 	gives aid and comfort to those that would disarm the citizens of
 	this country.  all so some chuckle-head misogynist homophobe can 
 	exhibit his "humor" on line.  sorry, but i think some of you need 
 	some caffeine if that joke about janet reno is funny to some of you.
