 so out of the numerous baptists that you hang around with you haven't
 seen any of the above behavior? which trait (stocking food for more
 than a week, or owning a firearm) is the definition of a cult? what
 proof ( aside from david's aquittal ) leads you to believe that any
 "banging/marrying" of thirteen year olds was going on? does your
 wife know that you equate 'marriage' with 'banging'?

 since this guy doesn't like the concept of freedom of religion, he's
 going to insult you and your mom!

 sociopath - person with asocial or antisocial beahavior.
 sociopaths - 200 persons, all who can't stand other people, sharing
              the same ranch-house.
