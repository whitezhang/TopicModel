 much of the dispute about the origin of the fire that destroyed the
 bd compound could be settled by examining the propane tank supposedly
 crushed by one of the army tanks when they breached the walls of the
 compound. if the the propane tank is flattened and has tread marks on it,
 then the bd's version of the cause of the fire would seem to be
 verified.

 the u.s. government has become a garrotte around the necks of its
 citizens.  just as with a garrotte, the more people struggle to breathe
 the air of freedom, the more the government tightens its stranglehold. the
 only possible outcomes at this point are the death of government or the
 elimination of personal freedom.
