 two questions:
 
 1)  you asserted that both the ar-15 and ak-47 are not suitable for
    "real hunting".  if you have no problem with hunting, or using
    self loading rifles for hunting, why did you say this?  if not
    for deer, then what about other, smaller game?
 
 2)  when did i get the nickname "nra man"?  notice i have never referred
    to you as "janette" which you don't seem to like.  do i get any
    super-powers, like spider man or powdered toast man?
