 >>that's the bd side of the story.  the other is that d. koresh met

 >>now we know that the 'bunker' adjacent to the house is thigh deep with

 	* the news statement was that there was $200,000 worth of "firearms
 	  and ammunition (no mention of "assault weapons")" on the premises,
 	  not that koresh had purchased them (what would his crime be if he
 	  had?).  this averages to about $2000 per person, not an astronomical
 	  number.
 
 	* we don't know that there is a thigh-deep pile of a million rounds...
 	  we know that the fbi says there is a pile of a million rounds. 
 
 	* this is the first i've heard that koresh was identified as being
 	  at the door with a weapon.
