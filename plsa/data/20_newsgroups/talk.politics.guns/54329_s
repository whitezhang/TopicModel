 	waco is a city of about 100,000 people.  the population temporarily
    raised to about 102,000 people when all the feds, and state police officers
    arrived.
 
 	i tell you what, i stayed in a hotel room about 4 miles from the bd
    compound around 3 weeks ago.  i have never felt more paranoid in my whole
    life.  there were at least 100 state police in the hotel.
