 i guess what i am really asking, like i did above, how does my government
 who is my servent, tell me the soveriegn what i can or cannot possess?
 
 it would seem to me that the act of possessing a machine gun is no less
 "criminal", by definition, than the act of possessing a television set. i also would seem
 to me that it would be better to pass laws that say, that if i harm
 or kill someone with the machine gun or the television set that there 
 would be specific penalties for doing such.
