        money orders operate pretty much like checks, with both parties being
 supposed to sign them.  i assume you'd have to show the buy-back people
 an id, and you'd then have a money order made out to that id.  
 
        as far as traceable as a practical matter, i don't know, it would
 depend on whether they bother to computerize who the recipient's name is
 on the money order and bother keying that sort of thing in.  i'd say
 certainly the police and the buyback people would keep a record of who
 they gave money orders out to.
 
 >is that even an issue if the weapons aren't checked for being stolen?
 
        there might be some questions asked, i suppose, if somebody 
 brought in a number of weapons each time over a series of "buy back"
 programs.
