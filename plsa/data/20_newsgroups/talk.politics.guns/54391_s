 in some south american countries, after political undesirables disappeared,
 the family would get a notice of death and a bill for the disposal
 of the body.  you apparently think that would be a good idea.
 
 the federal government initiated this action against koresh and his
 followers, surrounded them for 51 days, engaged in psychological
 warfare, used heavy military equipment against us citizens on
 us soil; and now that the compound caught fire while they were
 pumping in cs gas after knocking holes in the building; disavows
 all responsibility.  big brother is not always right.
