 
 two urgent requests:
 
 1. i need the latest update and description of ma bill s-897.  from
    what i gather this bill takes the hunter safety courses from
    law enforcement and places them under fish & game control.
 
 2. has someone out there compiled a list of all ma senate & house
    bills under consideration?  if they have, please e-mail me
    the list.  if not, is there a database i can access?
 
 	thanx,
 		yours in the fight,
 		mike p.
 
 p.s. my wife and i thought nancy b. was great on street stories.
