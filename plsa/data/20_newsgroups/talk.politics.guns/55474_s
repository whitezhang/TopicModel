 things change, huh?

 no, if your little fantasy comes to pass, the country will have gone
 toward the kkk.  you're of course being a little disengenuous.  violent
 solutions are never passe for the government and criminals (who frequently)
 cannot be distinguished).
 
 "avoid situations which encourage criminals"?  you mean don't be a woman?
 don't be black?  don't be gay?  i'm quite certain that having a surfeit of
 unarmed victims will discourage your beloved kkk from engaging in "violent
 solutions"....
