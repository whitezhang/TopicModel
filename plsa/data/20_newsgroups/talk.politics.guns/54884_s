 after seeing william sessions on television, explaining the great lengths
 to which the fbi went to determine the suicidal tendancies of david koresh, 
 i got the very unpleasent feeling that koresh had manipulated the fbi's 
 perceptions much the way he manipulated his own followers.
 
 maybe i was manipulated by the news story.
