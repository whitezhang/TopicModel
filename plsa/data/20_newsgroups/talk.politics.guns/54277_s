 this, at least, has already been determined: the blue cross medical
 coverage for all federal employees is a good model for a future
 national system. to get emergency medical care, anyone so insured
 must always carry their blue cross card. before entering a hospital,
 you must notify blue cross, or they will refuse to pay your bills. 
 in an emergency, where you must be treated before notifying them, 
 you must inform them within 24 hours or (if you are unable to do
 so for medical reasons) the hospital must. failing to do so within
 24 hours means they will not cover the hospitalization. in you need
 your card to notify them (and without the card, the hospital certainly
 wouldn't know they had to.) therefore, you are required to carry
 the card at all times, or do without emergency medical coverage.
