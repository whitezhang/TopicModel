 	and our argument is that you cannot remove them from the people
 who need restricting and not remove them from the people who don't.  a
 fairly simple problem, given our size and numbers.  do you agree?  we
 all believe criminals, particularly violent criminals, should not have
 firearms.  the problem is making a law that does this without trodding
 upon the rights of the vast majority.  nobody here seems to be able to
 do it, and i doubt anybody in norway can either.  thus, we are left with
 a philosophical difference: does the safety of a few justify restricting
 the many?  we say "no," while others say "yes."

 	can you provide a method that cannot be abused?  i doubt it.
 
 >i do believe in a persons freedom.
 >what i don't believe is that you can have it all and don't pay for it.
 
 	of course.  this is not in contention.  what is in contention
 is how much one has to pay.

 	it is this "giving a little" that makes americans wary...
 we have seen this argument before.  you might remember how a
 chamberlain "gave a little" to a particular fascist/short asshole,
 and how such "appeasement" worked.  while it might work in some
 instances, it doesn't work in others, and since we cannot predict
 the future we must be cautious in using actions that have a
 history of failure.

 	cars are not essential in norway any more than they are in
 the usa.  i'm willing to bet that you have neighbors that would be
 willing to drive you anywhere you wanted to go for a price.  thus,
 cars are not essential for your transportation.  however, the
 arguments presented show that, since cars are used to kill far more
 people than guns in the usa, it makes much more sense to restrict
 cars than it does guns.  how one defines "essential" often depends
 upon what one is willing to go through for that service.  when we
 look at the raw data, such comparisons are not individually weighed.
 
 >everyone who believe that hitler and ww2 could be avoided if there were
 >more guns in germany in the 30's: please read some history!
 
 	this depends upon what the populace was willing to do.  as
 desert storm proved, even an armed populace won't just revolt even
 when given a chance.  still, would hitler have done all that he did
 with an armed populace?  we have to wonder, as some of his first
 acts were to confiscate firearms.  other points in history show
 that dictators were overthrown by arms in the hands of the populace.
 thus, we're left wondering if hitler would have been overthrown
 or if king george was just unlucky in keeping the usa as a colony.
 one can argue both sides; one also has to live with each action.
 
 >is this discussion about
 >1. banning weapons for all americans
 >            or
 >2. making it harder for criminals to get one ??
 
 	it is about #2, but so far all proposals to curtail #2 have
 wound up enforcing #1 as well.  i only wish that "or" was so logical.
 
 >change of name.......
 
 	that was, on my part, purely in jest.  i merely pointed out
 how we were from similar backgrounds racially, but of wholly different
 backgrounds politically.  i thought this would underscore my point on
 how our cultures were so different despite similar heritage.
 
 >did the batf get the warrant for a gun search only or was there other reasons.
 >(child abuse for instance)
 
 	batf can *only* enforce gun/tobaccco/alcohol violations.  child
 abuse is a matter for the individual states and local authorities.
 
 >doesn't the people reading this newsgroup have access to the clari.news.* 
 >hierarcy ??  (some seems rather mis/uninformed)
 
 	that hierarchy is a paid-for feed at many sites.  most people do
 not get it for this reason, and i suspect money, not censorship, is the
 main reason.  do you get alt.sex* at your site?  i can't read it here
 because of censorship and legal fears, so again our differences show.
 you have topless sunbathing, and in the usa we can watch a murder every
 fifteen seconds and yet breasts are forbidden on television.
