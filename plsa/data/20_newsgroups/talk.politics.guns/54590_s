 two notes of interest from texas:
 
 the tarrant couonty me (who is doing the autopsies) is well known for rendering
 judgements that are contrary to the police view.  he presented evidence a few
 years ago that a man who police said was pointing a gun at them actually had
 his hands in the air.  this does not bode well for the boys in black.
 
 the texas dept. of public saftey and the texas rangers have no great love for
 the atf.  i have heard them referred to as "those fucking cowboys".  the dps
 was totally squeezed out of the bd operation and resented being left as
 "traffic cops".  atf now has two strikes against them.
 
 finally (i guess that makes three notes), rumour from waco is that four atf
 agents were stopped by four waco police cars and a dps trooper after one of the
 flashed "an automatic weapon" at a cop.  lots of pissed of cops.  and you
 wonder why there were so few cops really cheering on the atf.
