 i just got through listening to the 10 o'clock news on channel 4 here in
 dallas. they trotted out a list of justifications produced by the atf after
 "months of investigation" for their raid. 
 
 i couldn't believe the junk on this list! for example, the bds were accused
 of stockpiling a bunch of "9mm and .223 ammunition that can be used in m15
 and m16 assault rifles". imagine that--they had ammunition!  they also had
 aluminum dust! (yeah, it's a component of thermite, but so far i haven't
 heard that it's illegal to take a grinder to the aluminum lawn
 furniture...) the only thing on the list that could conceivably have been
 illegal was an m-79 grenade launcher. (anybody know about this?)
 
 months of investigation! for this 80+ people died!
