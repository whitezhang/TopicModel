 funny, brent, but so far we have heard two versions of the "facts:"
 
 1) what the government says.  this includes what the government says that
    two survivors have said.
 
 2) what koresh's lawyer (who was actually inside the compound) says,
    including what he says that most of the survivors have said.
 
 strange, but they seem to disagree in most important particulars.
 
 if anyone has actually seen news reports of any of the survivors
 speaking first-hand, feel free ot pitch in.  i may have missed it.
 but my money is that their story will sound a hell of a lot like
 case 2, and not at all like case 1.
