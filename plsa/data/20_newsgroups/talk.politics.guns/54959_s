 i suppose it's too late now, but the repeated use of the word
 "release" is peculiar.  let's say you and your family are besieged
 in your home by some people with tanks, helicopters, and automatic
 weapons.  they give you a break from the amplified sounds of dying
 rabbits to blare, "you in there!  release the children, and they'll
 be perfectly all right."  stipulate on top of that that you may not
 have your epistemology entirely in order.  is it entirely surprising
 that the branch davidians were reluctant to "release" their children
 into fbi custody?
