  i'm writting letters to my congresscritters and was wondering if
  there is any reason(s) why i should not support the following
  bills, other than the previous comments about s.458.  just checking
  before i mail the letter to make sure i don't support something
  that i really shouldn't.
 
  -----------------
  i strongly support the following laws currently being considered in congress
  as they would either have a positive effect towards reducing crime, or re-
  enforce our constitutional right under the 2nd amendment.
 
  * s. 441 (campbell)	to amend title 18, united states code, to provide a
 			mandatory minimum sentence for the unlawful possession
 			of a firearm by a convicted felon, a fugitive from
 			justice, a person who is addicted to, or an unlawful
 			user of, a controlled substance, or a transferor or
 			receiver of a stolen firearm, to increase the general
 			penalty for violation of federal firearms laws,
 			and to increase the enhanced penalties provided for the 
 			possession of a firearm in connection with a crime of 
 			violence or drug trafficking crime, and for other
 			purposes.
 
  * s.458  (smith) 	to restore the second amendment rights of all americans.
 
  * s.488  (specter)	to provide federal penalties for drive-by shootings.
 
  * s.504  (kohl)	to amend section 924 of title 18, united states code to
 			make it a federal crime to steal a firearm or explosives
 			in interstate or foreign commerce.

  here's a story, bout a man named brady, who took a .22 bullet
  in his head.  even though he can act perfectly normal, he
  prefers to pretend he's brain dead.
 
  here's a story, bout a woman named brady, who had nothing to
  do but sit around all day.  then her husband became a media
  martyr, now she wants to take all your guns away.
 
  the brady bunch, the brady bunch, this is how we got stuck
  with the brady bunch. . . . .
