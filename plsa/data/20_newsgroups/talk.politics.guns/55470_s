 what laws did they circumvent?  being "frightening" isn't a crime.  some people
 are afraid of young black males.  that doesn't make the mere status of being a
 young black male a crime.
 
 the batf itself admitted leading off by throwing handgrenades.  there is no
 evidence that they properly identified themselves as law enforcement 
 personnel.  under those circumstances, other persons have been found to be
 acting within their legal rights to exercise self defense against unidentified
 armed intruders.

 the charges are irrlevant anyway, since the batf has absolutely no jurisdiction
 in such matters anyway.  of course that hasn't stopped them from making other
 such spurious charges, such as the existence of mythical "meth labs".  of
 course they whole "cult" thing indicates the level of contempt that they have
 for the 1st amendment.

 that armed resistance, at least initially, may well have been legal.
