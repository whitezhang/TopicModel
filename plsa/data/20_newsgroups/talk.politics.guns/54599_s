 in massachusetts, you will likely be arrested for murder, but
 if you convince the cops/da that you used lethal force because
 of threat of death or serious bodily harm, then the charges
 would probably be dropped.  if you run away and are later caught,
 then you will have a much harder time convincing cops/judge/jury
 of your innocence.  going "on the lam" is seen as an indication
 of guilt by a lot of people.
