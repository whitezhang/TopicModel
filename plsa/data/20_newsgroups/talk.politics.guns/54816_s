 # and the concern by list members is that hci will claim everyone that calls

 # our local state assemblyman has called for a complete ban on all non-bolt
 # action military rifles and all assault weapons, a 7 day wait for purchase
 # permits { it currently takes 10 to 14 working days here in nc } and one
 # permit/year. the flood of calls he got was 7 for and 3 against. guess who
 # called supporting his move? guess what ila is doing? right?
