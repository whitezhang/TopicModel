 this is, apparently, what passes for intelligent discourse at trinity.
 joe "fbi cultist" kusmierczak gets angry when its pointed out that
 the fbi has told him is a lie, the mounting evidence is that 
 they've lied about almost every detail of 4/19 except that they
 were there. what can you expect of cultists like him, somebody
 oughtta burn him out, and if he's trapped, well, good riddance!
 right joe?
