 this is about the third person who's parroted the fbi's line about the
 fires being set "six hours after the tear gas was injected."  suppose you
 want to explain to us the videotape footage shown on national tv last night
 in which a tank with the gas-injecting tubes is pulling its injection tubes
 out of the second story of a building as the building begins to belch smoke
 and then fire?
 
 do tell.
