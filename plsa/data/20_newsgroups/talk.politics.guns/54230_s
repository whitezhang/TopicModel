 medical info without a name/body attached is completely useless for
 treatment.

 thus making it as secure as cash, for some purposes, but far less
 secure for others.

 sure they do.  the prospective sitter may have a nasty habit of molesting
 kids three or four months into the job.  the references may not have
 known him long enough or may not have picked up on this yet.
 
 remember, criminal conviction info is public, so if you're going to
 argue for an id card, other people are going to have a strong argument
 that it disclose public info.

 yeah right.  how are you going to keep doctors from spilling the
 beans?  (we already know that you can't keep cops from disclosing
 info, but at least that info is typically supposed to be public
 anyway.)

 the article discusses technology, not appropriate policy.  it also
 fails to deal with "what happens if the folks with the secrets blab".
