 because there are about 40 homicides total (i.e. using guns, knives,
 tire-irons, baseball bats, bare hands, etc...) in switzerland
 each year and 850 homicides, total, in england. that's three
 times worse per capita in england than in switzerland. since
 dead is dead, it really doesn't matter that 60% of the switz
 murders involved a gun or that only 0.9% of the english murderers
 do.
