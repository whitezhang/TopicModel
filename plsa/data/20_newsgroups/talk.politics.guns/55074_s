 if we are indeed talking about cs, then this is not quite accurate. cs is
 "just" tear gas--albeit the worst kind. it isn't a nausea gas, and doesn't
 have direct cns effects. however, it's quite bad--much worse than cn gas. i
 was briefly exposed to it once (during an engagement in berkeley circa 1968
 8^) and it's not the kind of thing you forget. it seems to be
 moisture-activated--it not only made my eyes sting and water, but attacked
 my breathing passages and lungs. breathing was painful, and my entire face
 felt as if it was on fire. these effects persisted for hours after
 exposure, and i was coughing for days afterwards.  if i was exposed to a
 dense concentration of this stuff in a closed space for several hours, i
 doubt whether i could find the exit. indeed, i can't imagine living through
 it.
