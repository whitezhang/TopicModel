 hey, guys.  you're absolutely correct, and well on the way to winning
 this battle ... and losing the war.  yes, there are serious philosophical
 flaws in hr 1276.  technical ones, too -- how'd you like to sue the feds,
 lose, and have to pay _their_ "reasonable attorney's fee" ... ?    :-)
 
 still, i have one basic question:  compared to what we've _got_ is hr 1276
 (a) better, or (b) worse?  this one shouldn't even take you three guesses.
 
 if there's a good enough show of support for hr 1276, maybe for a change
 _we_ could be the ones saying "it's a reasonable first step" ...
