 well the attorneys of the davidians reported on larry king that
 the tanks had actually damaged the structure to the extent that
 effectuating egress from the building was difficult at best.
 with a rapidly spreading fire and large amounts of smoke and
 tear gas, finding the right exits, or acceptible holes in the walls
 were nearly impossible.  i find this explanation to be completely 
 plausible.  doesn't mean that it's true, but i don't find it
 intrinsically less believable than the government stories.

 i concur.

 indeed.  according to the lawyers, the davidian survivors say that
 lanterns were knocked over during the "probing" and that's how
 the fire started.  a tragic accident, if true.

 see above.  this one is going to be thoroughly investigated.  maybe
 we'll eventually get some idea of what happened.  my view is that,
 from beginning to end, this operation was a botch and that it is
 completely possible that nut cases who were otherwise law-abiding
 citizens were victims of a bureaucratic execution.
