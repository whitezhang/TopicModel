 look, i don't want to bore everybody here with the physics of woodstoves,
 but they're not anything like your caloric gas range.  it takes about
 three hours for a woodstove to get hot enough to cook on, and afterwards 
 you can't just "shut it off" -- it will contain hot embers for over 24 
 hours even after you choke it completely.
 
 so it ain't exactly "light up the stove and cook me a batch of them 
 pancakes, aunt j..."  if you use a woodstove for cooking, or even for
 heating your house at night, you will have it lit to some extent all 
 the time.  trust me on this one, i speak from experience.
