 others dispute that, like richard hofstadter, <america as a gun culture>,
 and newton and zimring's <firearms and violence in american life>.  but,
 again, statistics between too dissimilar cultures are difficult to
 quantify.
 
 i don't know how anyone can state that gun control could have no
 effect on homicide rates.  there were over 250 >accidental< handgun
 homicides in america in 1990, most with licensed weapons.  more
 american children accidentally shot other children last year (15)
 than all the handgun homicides in great britain.  (source: national
 safety council.  please... no dictionary arguments about rates vs
 total numbers, okay?  they're offered for emphasis, not comparison).
 
 if mr. greenwood believes that brits are much too sober and
 coordinated to make such mistakes i'd like to introduce him to my
 friend, amanda from brighton.  i used to have some pretty nice
 crystal in my place until she moved in.  i've gotten used to the
 snide comments from guests about the clown motif on my rubber
 wine glasses.
