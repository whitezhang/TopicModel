 well, i don't normally like to quote myself, but i just got some
 additional information.  i called my state rep (to express my support),
 and the person there informed me that it's actually just a second
 reading of the bill (three are required) for further consideration.
 i'm not 100% sure what *that* means, and i'm also not sure why
 there's a discrepancy between what the two offices are telling me.
 
 still researching....
