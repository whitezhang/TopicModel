 ain't got a pair of fatigues... and i don't blast people wandering aimlessly,
 i ask them what they're doing there... i only blast people who display
 obvious violent intent... like black-clad men with weapons climbing thru
 second-story windows, or people who break down the door instead of knocking.
 or people who knock my house down with tanks and set it afire.  sound 
 familiar yet?
 
 riddle me this: why the hell are the convicted criminals in ohio getting
 the kid glove treatment, and the bd's are burned alive without a trial?
 put aside who started the blaze, i still think any decent shyster can 
 make a case for cruel and unusual punishment, playing the sounds of
 tortured rabbits over the loudspeakers (where's the spca in all this?)...
 
 oh, and that's mister gun-toter sir to you, bucko.  just because you choose
 to abandon your rights, leave mine the hell alone, thankyouverymuch.
