 i think its an attempt to show lives_saved v lives_lost; all other
  gun related crimes don't result in lives_lost.  on the other hand,
  its impossible to know how many of the successful self defenses 
  prevented lives from being lost.  in other words, the lives_lost
  is pretty clear [its the homicide and non negligent manslaughter
  number], while the lives saved is some percentage of the successful 
  self defenses.  clearly that percentage doesn't have to be real 
  high to show that lives_saved > lives_lost.
 
 as a semi-related point, check out kleck's "point blank".  i believe
  it goes into some related areas; it also is well written and informative.
