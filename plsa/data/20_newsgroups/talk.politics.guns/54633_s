    if you haven't heard yet, us senator patty murrey, a mom in
 tennis shoes, is planning to introduce legislation to tax
 all handgun transactions and increase dealer licnese costs in
 order to raise money to cover the costs of un-insured shooting
 victums.  she plans to start with $2500.00 per year dealer fees
 and $40.00 or so, depending on the type of firearm, per gun
 transaction.  she plans to make it federal.

 just a mom in tennis shoes.  she can be written to via the
 united states senate, washinton dc.  she is looking for your
 tennis shoes.  so if you have a pair please send them to her
 with your feelings regarding this tax.  
    she claims she has heard little from the opposition.
