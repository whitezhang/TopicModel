   but...  suppose they had waited.  the worst outcome would have been the
 one that actually did.  but with the fbi/atf just standing there watching
 instead of being a part of the problem.  it then would have been very clear
 exactly who was at fault then, rather than the way it turned out.
 
   and, that would have been the worst case.  the best would have been, they
 finally get hungry and come out.  possible/likely?  well, the alternative was
 worse...

   but what does it matter?  why say "i don't remember...." when it doesn't
 make any difference?  altho the clintonettes have been pretty good at lying
 when it wasn't necessary, they didn't do it this time.  but it wasn't 
 necessary - claiming full responsibility is a totall meaningless gesture.
 symbolism over substance - again!  
 
   i've offered to take full responsibility.  when do they pay me the big
 bucks the ag is making...????   ;^)
