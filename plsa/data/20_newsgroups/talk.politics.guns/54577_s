 perhaps you've been under a rock since, say, the turn of the century. how
 in the #$^& is one man supposed to review every single freaking
 governmental action, every day? that's why we have an executive branch. he
 reviewed the plan and said "go," but he wasn't the architect and he wasn't
 there, bullhorn in hand, implementing it. yes, he was responsible in the
 sense that he was briefed. so what! shit happens. that sounds like a
 callous way to dismiss the deaths of 90+ people, but i can't understand why
 people get so bent about the accidental death/suicide (which is it? could
 take months...) of some total fucking sociopath/child molester and his
 crazed followers while opposing u.s. intervention in bosnia. just like
 billy boy said. i think some of you people have too much time on your
 hands, and screwed up priorities.
 
 just my ho...
