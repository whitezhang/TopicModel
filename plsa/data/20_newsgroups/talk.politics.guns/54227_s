 no, but i have several other breakdowns of accidental shootings.
 i've never seen one that specifically provides the info that davis insists
 that he has, so i'd love to have a cite.

 wrong.  there's one gun design where that can happen, and it is
 supposed to be carried with the hammer over an unloaded chamber.
 (cocking the gun turns the cylinder so that a loaded cylinder is under
 the hammer.  in other words, it can be usefully carried in a safe
 manner.)  other handgun designs don't have that property; if their
 trigger isn't pulled, the hammer can't hit the firing pin.

 the breakdowns that i do have include the above category.  from them i
 can safely say that if davis is right in all of his claims, a large
 negative number of people are killed by animals, because we know that
 the number of killings by wackos is reasonably large and that the
 number of accidents due to gun failures (which is a superset of the
 described circumstance) is near zero.

 please do.  include a cite for those of us who like looking at
 context.  make sure that your source excludes other types of
 accidents and suicides that are misreported.  ("gun cleaning
 accident" is police-speak for "the family needs the insurance
 money.")
