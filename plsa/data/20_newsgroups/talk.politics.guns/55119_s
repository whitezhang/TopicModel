 i don't know about the paranoia and irrationality, but the rest is
 pretty close, all though you left out the inability to breath.  of
 course you can make a claim that people will do some fairly deranged
 things to get away from it.  i've seen teenagers flatten 200lb. drill
 sergeants to get out of tents full of it.  which raises another
 issue....

 what they didn't mention is that in the open, it probably wouldn't do
 too much harm to children, although i wouldn't use it in close proximity
 to infants.  on the other hand, in confined spaces, the effects are
 greatly intensified, to the point of lethality, since a sufficient
 quantity of cs will displace oxygen.  when running a cs chamber careful
 attention is paid to ventilation.  i wonder if they checked to see if
 any of the bds were asthmatics or suffered from other respiratory
 diseases.  i doubt it.
