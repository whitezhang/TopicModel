 i just heard on cnn that the texas rangers found an m60 machine gun
 in the bd compound rubble.  the newscaster called this a new hi-tech
 military weapon!  ha ha!!  i would bet that it is that rock armory
 m60 semi-auto, or that it was leagally owned and the tax was paid.
 
 what year was the m60 patented?
 
 just showing you how the media is twisting the facts,
 josh
