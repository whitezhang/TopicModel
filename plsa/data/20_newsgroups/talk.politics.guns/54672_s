   minor quibble:  the assualt (and it was one) began near dawn.  the fire did
 not break out for several hours.  i find it highly unlikely that the bd would
 be cooking lunch while armored vehicles punch holes in their house and are
 pumping in tear gas.  the lantern story makes more sense, except the fire 
 seemed to spread too quickly, even given the nature of the buildings and the
 very high winds.  and it was daylight, but i guess in the innner recesses it
 could be dark--shutters probably closed as well.
 
   which puts us back to the fbi did it, or the bd did it, or some other screw-
 up occured, which is quite possible.
 
   the problem with the fbi as a monolithic entity doing it is that it requires
 *everybody* involved to keep their mouths shut.  while they tended to behave 
 like total idiots, that does not make them homocidal maniacs, either.  and if
 it was one nutcase agent, then it serves no purpose to blame the whole agency.
 
   i can believe that a real nut-case like a koresh would start such a fire,
 but i'm far from convinced he actually did so.
 
   then again, i rarely go off making blanket condemnations and pronouncments
 within 2 hours of a very confusing incident over 175 miles away...
