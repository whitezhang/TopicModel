 a great deal of documentation exists on exactly that phenomenon. especially
 regarding vietnam and the mai lai (sp?) massacre
 
 not that i'm suggesting that they started it on purpose but even if they
 now know that they accidentally started (or contributed to it) you can
 be sure the initial reaction is to lie. remember the iranian airliner
 which the us navy mistook for a fighter and shot down?
