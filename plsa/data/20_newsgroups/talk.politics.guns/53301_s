 how can you say that?  i presume that you mean that talking about
 restricting rights is not the same as restricting those rights.  well,
 arguing for those restrictions may lead to implementation, much
 the same way as assault can lead to battery (legal definitions).

 well, i can't speak for the homosexuals, but i've seen alot
 of polite discussion on t.p.g.  please, everyone, don't take
 this guy's word, or mine for that matter, on it.  read t.p.g.
 for a while, and try to determine from which direction most of
 the flameage originates.  if you post without flamebait, you
 will generally receive reasoned responses.  true, there are
 those who tend to lose their tempers quickly, as there are on
 all newsgroups, but they really do feel their rights are in jeopardy.
 
 oh, and neat trick talking derisively about another newsgroup while
 not crossposting to allow them to defend themselves.
