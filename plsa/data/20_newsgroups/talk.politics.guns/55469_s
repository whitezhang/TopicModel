 this is rather simple, actually ...
 
 having just been through a revolution, our founding fathers  well
 understood  the  relationship between we the people and a govern-
 ment of, by and for the people. they  also  understood  that  any
 government  of  the people can sometimes grow to become a govern-
 ment not "by" the people or not "for" the  people.  this  is  how
 they chose to handle all of the possibilities:
 
    2nd amendment
    a well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a
    free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall
    not be infringed.
 
 this is the only part of the  constitution  which  gives  us  the
 right  of  revolution  if  things  seem to be going cockeyed. all
 that's really necessary is an organized march on washington, just
 have everyone bring their arms. obviously the 2nd is an important
 right, a right which many americans do not fully appreciate.
 
 hope this helps,
 
 ray.
