 no, it is not.  it is possible the fbi planned for this to happen, and the  
 gunfire heard was the fbi keeping the folks inside.  i'm not proposing this as  
 the way it went down, but just to point out that it's not "undeniable" that if  
 they walked out yesterday, they would be alive today.

 my heart "bleeds" for no one.  you are the "bleeding heart".  and i'm sure  
 beyond any possible doubt that you do not feel for those people as i do.  you  
 can not say the heartless things you have said if you did.

 "they got what they wanted".  what kind of creature are you that you can  
 believe this?
