 not exactly:
 
 "an unconstitutional act is not law; it confers no rights; it imposes
  no duties; affords no protection; it creates no office; it is in legal
  contemplation, as inoperative as though it had never been passed."
  norton vs. shelby county, 118 us 425 p.442
 
 "the general rule is that an unconstitutional statute, though having the
  form and name of law, is in reality no law, but is wholly void, and
  ineffective for any purpose; since unconstitutionality dates from the
  time of it's enactment, and not merely from the date of the decision so
  branding it."
 
 "no on is bound to obey an uncontitutional law, and no courts are
  bound to enforce it."
