 	first, unless that round is chambered there is little threat of
 penetration by the bullet, or the brass for that matter.  unless that
 expanding gas is held in an enclosed space you get a nice "pop" and not
 enough threat for even firefighters to worry about.  finally, it's
 rather simple to tell if a person was shot prior to being burned to
 a crisp.  see, by the time the ammunition went up those people were
 quite dead.  look for blood around the wound, particularly bruising.
 
 	however, it's my contention that it makes little difference
 whether they died from exploding ammunition or fire; the feds seem
 to have shared responsibility for both.
