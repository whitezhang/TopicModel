 let's go to the videotape.  here's exactly what you posted:

 so if you weren't saying that the deaths of "bastard children of a sacreligious
 zealot" was no big thing (and i know i am not the only one who read it that
 way), just what the hell were you saying?

 so who brainwashed you into believing that whatever the government says it
 the truth?  or that koresh was any actual threat to you and the rest of the 
 us?  haven't you ever stopped to wonder why the government raided this farm?
 this raid was not about religion, sex, or child abuse.  to the best available
 evidence at the moment, this raid, psychological torture, and group death was 
 about koresh's failure to pay a $200 tax on one grenade launcher that he may 
 or may not even have had!  that's why it was the batf doing the raiding in the
 first place.
 
 do you think a $200 tax evasion justifies an armed assault by the government
 with 100 armed men in trailers, orchestrated character assassination, noise
 torture, and a holocaust?

 then think before you post.
