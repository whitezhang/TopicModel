 does anyone really believe the swiss have had no war within their borders
 because every adult male owns a rifle? i'm a great admirer of the swiss, but
 500 years of peace on their turf has zilch to do with gun ownership. can you
 picture hitler, with panzers and focke-wulfs poised on the border, losing
 sleep over a few thousand expert rifleman? sure. 
 hitler stayed out of switzerland because the swiss run the money in this
 world. we'd do well to emulate them on that and forget about getting more
 rifles on the street. let's disband the nra and start a national investment
 banking association, replete with red and black sticker for the back window
 of bubba's mercedes 600! we could fire charlton heston and get paul volcker
 for a spokesman.
