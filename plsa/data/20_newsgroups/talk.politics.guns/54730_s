        the "used to kill" is the heart of the misinformation.  it's one
 of those technically accurate phrasings that conveys the wrong impression.
 what mr. quiqley is more than aware of, i'm sure, is that when people
 read this they think violent arguments where one member of the family
 grabs a gun and shoots another, thereby creating a tragic situation
 which could easily have been avoided had the gun not been there, or
 a tragic accident, especially involving a child.
 
        unfortunately, that's not the way things stack up.  the majority
 of that 43 "times" (37 i believe) are suicides.  that is, someone 
 intentionally took a firearm and shot themselves intending to kill 
 themselves.  and why it's popular to try and blame suicides on guns,
 the evidence doesn't support this.  internal studies, as well as
 comparative studies with other countries, indicate that cultural
 factors far outweigh whether a person will kill themselves or not.
 (japan, for instance, has a slightly higher rate than the u.s.  there
 people jump off buildings.)
 
        according to the national crime survey, 40% of violent crime
 is commited by "non-strangers," which mistakenly has been generalized
 regarding the king county study to mean, "friends and family."  that
 is, mr. quigley, and others who quote this statistic, are banking on
 the mental image that a "friend, family member, or child," equates
 to a loving relationship, and that it was cut short in a moment of
 anger.  unfortunately, all too often husbands beat and kill wives,
 children assault parents, or vice-versa.  most rapes are commited by 
 someone known to the victim, for instance.  essentially, that a gun
 was used against a "friend" or family member doesn't mean they
 weren't trying to hurt the other person.  crime is highest among
 poor urban families, and those are also the areas most "at risk"
 for family problems, especially violent ones.  a son in a gang may
 not be as loving toward his parents if they disapprove than a suburban
 kid might.
 
        finally, it hinges on the fallacy that a dead intruder is the
 only value of a self-defense firearm.  using the minimum figures i
 worked out using the ncs i got about an 80:1 ratio between deadly
 self-defenses (justifiable homicides) and with-gun self-defenses.
 between the fbi uniform crime report and the ncs there's an enormous
 amount of data and anybody with the calculator can crunch the numbers.
 as such it is incorrect to assume that a dead body is the only valid
 means of determining the success of such a defense, since according
 to the ncs (which has been considered by many to seriously under-report
 defenses) there were far more successful with-gun defenses than intruders
 killed.
 
        not it also confines itself to the home, where attack by a "friend
 or family member" is far, far more likely, and excludes any defense
 which occurs outside the home.  (i believe a large number occur in
 businesses.)

        i have not seen the exact data for this, so i can't comment.  i
 will point out canada's and japan's suicide rate as indications that
 culture far more than firearm availability affect suicide rates.
 
        there was also a comparative study between canada (for what
 it's worth, considering the difficulty of comparing across cultural
 lines) published in the new england journal of medicine (i can get the
 exact cite if you need it) that concluded that restrictive firearm laws 
 would not significantly impact the over-all suicide rate.
