 having lived, played, and worked on and near the navajo reservation
 for a number of years, i can confirm this is an ancient pattern,
 found in petroglyphs dated 800 to 1200 years old.
 
 also, the indians never stopped making rugs with this pattern - they
 just stopped selling them after the nazi's pre-empted the swastika.
 
 note also that the indian versions use both clockwise and
 counter-clockwise swastikas.
 
 ob guns:  it's the rare navaho family that doesn't own a rifle. 
 they remember being "relocated" by the us army, and don't intend to
 do it again.  the hopi, on the other hand, have a dislike for
 weapons, from my experience.  perhaps they just hide them better
 from strangers.
