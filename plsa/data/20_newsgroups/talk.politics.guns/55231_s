 ah, here freeman is being prejudiced (look it up and see what i mean freeman).
 here freeman is pre-judging someone before he knows all of the facts.  guess

 freeman thinks i am behind when actually i am quite on top of things.  the
 point he seems to be missing now is that after a certain point accuracy can be
 very tedious and ridiculous.  see freeman's next post for an explanation.
