 title 18, 241 and/or 242 seem to apply.  241 is conspiracy (two or
 more persons) against rights of citizens.  242 is deprivation of
 rights under color of law.  both call for up to life in prison if
 death occurs.  reno, bentsen, and clinton are probably all principals
 to the crime (as they are responsible for authorized actions on the
 part of their subordinates).

 you forgot one detail, they should be turned over to the texas
 authorities for trial, as the crime was committed there (article 4,
 section 2).
