 drop three billiard balls on a ramp, and they all roll in the same
 direction.  pour some blood into the sea, and sharks will converge
 from miles around.  throw a pebble at one starling, and all 200 will
 depart.
 
 natural processes can mimic the outward results of conspiracy when no
 actual conspiracy is required.
 
 put a government functionary in an embarrassing situation, and he
 quickly covers his ass.
 
 this, too, is completely natural.

 it looks that way to me, too.  but you have to understand that it's not 
 the first time they have instigated raids like these.  the most recent
 one also ended up in a long standoff, but it wasn't quite as public
 as this one, and they didn't kill quite as many people.  maybe this 
 screwup will make them think long and hard about raiding any more 
 residences in this manner.  but probably not.

 i assume you're talking about philadelphia.

 if you're a fan of conspiracies, the time to make that batch of
 popcorn is after the screwup, when it's time for the coverup.
