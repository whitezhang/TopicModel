 
 folks,
 
 it's time to start building some precise questions to send to our
 federal elected officials and to investigative reporters in our
 local tv, radio and newprint media.  ideally, these questions could be
 asked at any investigation into the batf's and fbi's participation
 at the waco fiasco in hopes of being resolved and, hopefully, wake
 up the local news media that they are not getting the entire truth
 from the batf and fbi.  my list is up to 13 that are really nagging 
 at my gut.  the list will probably grow. 
 
 1.   what were the contents of the original warrant, now sealed, that
      the batf obtained?
 
 2.   it is reasonable to believe that illegal firearms and/or ammunition
      could not be flushed down the toilet.  therefore, a "no-knock"
      raid could be ruled out.  prior to the initial assault on the 
      complex, did a single batf agent and accompanying witness (without 
      a contingent of assault and news media personnel) attempt to knock 
      on the door of the branch davidian's complex and serve the warrant 
      in a manner prescribed by law?
 
 3.   on the day of the initial assault on the complex, batf agents
      were aware that several small children were inside the buildings.
      in the ensueing gun battle, batf agents fired into a building
      known to contain children, killing at least one two-year old child.
      knowing children were present, why didn't the batf have an
      alternate plan and immediately retreat from the area close to
      the complex and implement the alternate plan rather than opening
      fire and jeopardizing the lives of the children in the building? 
 
 4.   the fbi spokesman states that paper evidence indicates that
      david koresh and members of the branch davidians possessed over
      $200,000 in firearms and ammunition.  did david koresh and the
      members of the branch davidians have a valid federal firearms
      license, were they actively participating in the legal business
      of selling/buying firearms and ammunition, and were any of the
      weapons they had illegally possessed?  does this paper evidence
      consist only of weapons purchased or does it include legally
      dispossessed weapons.
 
 5.   after the original assault on the compound tragically failed,
      a batf spokeswoman stated "we were outgunned!".  yet, tv newscasts
      of video tape filmed at the time of the incident show batf agents
      armed with mp-5 and ar-15/m16 rifles.  although unclear on the
      video tape because of obstruction from full view by agent's
      bodies, they also may have had ak-47 and sks rifles.  what type(s)
      of firearms did the batf agents have immediate access to at the 
      scene of the original assault on the complex?
 
 6.   since there is no evidence to confirm anyone was inside the
      complex involuntarily, why did the fbi treat it as a "hostage"
      situation? 
 
 7.   along the same lines, why did the fbi use "psychological warfare"
      techniques, including sensory overload, sleep deprivation, and
      other disruptive techniques that would test the sanity of any 
      normal person rather than using techniques aimed at placing the 
      complex occupants into a calmer frame of mind?
 
 8.   reports indicate several of the children inside the complex
      were accompanied by their mothers.  since it is reasonable
      to expect these mothers would have their children taken away
      from them if they came out, why did the fbi expect the mothers
      to just walk out and surrender themselves to the authorities?
 
 9.   agents at the scene claim to have seen members of the branch
      davidians setting fire to the complex.  branch davidian members
      who survived the inferno claim the fire was started when an 
      armored vehicle punched through the wall and knocked over a 
      lantern which was setting on a table.  video tape of the incident 
      does show an armored vehicle punching a hole in the wall and the 
      fire erupted almost immediately from the same general location.  
      was the source of the fire the same room where the armored vehicle 
      penetrated?
 
 10.  fbi spokesmen are voicing the opinion that the david koresh and
      the members of the branch davidians committed mass suicide.  yet,
      bodies are being discovered throughout the house and other areas
      within the building complex.  this seems to be counter to any
      known mass suicides through history.  what evidence does the fbi
      have that a mass suicide pact existed?
 
 11.  fbi director sessions stated that the massive fireball shown on
      the video tape was caused by the branch davidian's ammunition
      and/or powder cache exploding.  yet, the fireball seems to be
      more characteristic of the type created when compressed gas
      or other highly volatile fuel source explodes.  was any evidence 
      found which would indicate the branch davidians had an ammunition 
      and/or powder cache which exploded to create this fireball?  if so,
      and if david koresh and members of the branch davidians were 
      engaged in the legal business of selling/buying firearms, was the
      amount determined to be excessively greater than one would expect
      for someone engaged in such a legal business?
 
 12.  it is rumored that one fbi agent was extremely upset about critical
      news media coverage and intentionally used an armored vehicle to
      crush a reporter's car which had been left at the compound.  is 
      there any factual basis to this rumor and, if so, what charges will 
      be brought against the fbi agent who performed the act?
 
 13.  fbi director sessions states that, during the final assault on the
      complex, "over 80 shots were fired at the vehicles."  on the video
      tape of the incident, you can hear the drone of the armored vehicles
      engines.  yet, there is no sound of the sharp reports that one
      would expect to hear if shots were fired.  also, there are no 
      indications of smoke and/or muzzle flashes appearing from the windows,
      buildings or other structures in the video.  surely, these should be 
      evident if the branch davidians had fired on the armored vehicles.  
      finally, the video tape does not show any indication of paint splatter, 
      sparks or other characteristic spray of material which should be 
      apparent if the branch davidians had fired upon the vehicles.  do 
      any of the armored vehicles which were brought in to pump tear gas 
      into the compound show evidence of fresh damage due to being hit by 
      shots from high-power rifles?
 
 14.  cs gas is considered to be a chemical warfare agent.  the united
      states has signed international treaties which prevent the use
      of cs gas in warfare.  if the united states could not morally use
      cs gas against saddam hussein and his troops, why is it morally
      acceptable to use the same agent against citizens of our own land?
 
 15.  on april 21, fbi spokesmen state that at least 3 bodies discovered
      in the complex had bullet wounds to the head indicating they had
      been murdered or had committed suicide.  on april 22, the county
      coroner claims he knows nothing about any bodies found with bullet
      wounds to the head.  were any of the victims bodies found within
      the burned out complex have bullet wounds to the head?
