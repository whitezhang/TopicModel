 a really sad op-ed appeared in my school's newpaper today.  it
 claimed that full-auto weapons are illegal in the u.s.
 i understand that full-auto weapons made and registered before
 may 19, 1986 are still legal in 40 of the 50 states.  is
 texas one of those states?
 
 can anyone point me to a source for info on how many people have been 
 killed by legal full-auto weapons in the u.s.?
 
 and finally, i think it would be great if anyone was keeping a digest
 of facts on the waco incident.  in particular, i would like a source
 for the fbi/batf mentioning the supposed methamphetamine lab, and
 information on the beginning of the raid, specifically batf
 lies.
 
 i am also interested in past batf no-knock warrents which have lead
 to personal and property damage against innocent citizens.
 
 i intend to put together a reply to this op-ed very soon.  the author
 of the piece states he wants to work for the batf.  gack!
