 james, it could be that they were determined to stay together in the compound
 no matter what happened. perhaps the fire was accidental, and the db simply
 refused to leave the compod. perhap they died fighting the fire? who knows.
 we will have to wait and see. i persaonlly find it hard to believe that they 
 would all agree to burn themselves up! what a horrible way to go.
