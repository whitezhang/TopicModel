      it's not the nra's fault; but it is something to consider if you are
 considering contributing to the nra. if candidate b is a complete asshole
 whose only saving grace is that he opposes unnecessary restrictions on
 firearms, i wouldn't want my membership dues funding efforts to get him
 re-elected.
 
      i have other problems with the nra (as an organization; the individual
 members i've met have been loyal, trustworthy, honest, brave, etc.,
 especially my boss who probably reads this newsgroup b->); they are
 definitely pro-hunting, and i recall seeing a pro-desert storm nra bumper
 sticker. sometimes they come on too strong in the political arena, which
 contributes to their reputation as "bad guys" amoung many people.
