 it certainly is provable.  around a million americans every year defend
 themselves with firearms.  in many of these cases the defender doesn't even
 have to fire a shot!  the mere presence of a gun is oftentimes all the
 deterrent that is needed.
 
 i don't like violence anymore than anyone else does.  but, taking away the
 right of americans to keep and bear arms is not the solution to the violent
 crime problem in this country.  if honest, law-abiding citizens are unable
 to get firearms then they will be preyed on even more by criminals who will
 be able to acquire guns through illegal channels.  expect to start seeing
 the crime syndicates who smuggle drugs into this country start smuggling
 guns.  believe me this will happen.  there is *plenty* of economic
 incentive for gangsters to illegaly import guns into this country if guns
 should be banned by the klintonistas.

 see my previous post.  that ought to set you straight.

 people have the right to keep and bear arms no matter what the
 constitution says.  that means that even if the 2nd amendment is
 repealed the *people* (that's all american citizens fyi) will *still*
 have the right to keep and bear arms.
