       tennessee, at least, does not require any sort of safety class to
 get a driver's license.  all that is required is one twenty question
 quiz and to drive a car around the block without crashing.
 
 >i have to be licensed to drive.  
 
       in all probability, no you don't.  you are required to be licensed
 to drive on public roads.  a license is not necessary on private property.
 
 >my car
 >must be registered.  
 
        most states do not require the registration of cars that are
 not used on public roads.  those that do (california i know of) do
 so for tax purposes more than anything else.

        many states do not currently require this, and most, again,
 only make this requirement for public roads.  a car sitting unused 
 is not required to have insurance.

        the two are not the same, as i pointed out above.  there are
 significant difference between making rules for *use on public property*
 and *making rules for ownership*.
 
        the other half of the objection is trust.  similar things to this
 have been tried in many local jurisdications across the country, and
 have been abused in far too many cases.   safety classes which are
 never sheduled, never funded, or only one or two is held a year for
 a limited number of participants.  registration lists in new york,
 chicago, and california have been used for confiscation.  *many* gun
 owners would, in theory, support these planes.  (although the
 numbers overwhelmingly show that competence is not the problem, that
 intentional misuse is).  they've simply seen it abused and are leery of
 the next person who comes down the pike with a "reasonable" suggestion
 they've already seen abused.
