 oooooohhhh!  he admits it!  the infamous "first step".  let's look at
 it this way.  i have never harmed anyone with my firearms.  i have
 successfully defended myself with them.  i have successfully procurred
 food with them.  i have successfully had much enjoyment in target
 practicing with them.  
 
 in that order firearms are important to me.  friend, i was raped as a
 child by an older child who had a knife.  that ain't never gonna
 happen again.  there is no one, including yourself, who will *ever*
 make me a victim again.  as long as you don't try to make me a victim,
 i will leave you alone.  but if you *ever* try to make me a victim,
 i'll fight you all the way, such as i'm doing now.  and i'll fight you
 with a response appropriate to the situation.  now, you aren't
 advocating making me a victim are you?  exactly what are you doing?
