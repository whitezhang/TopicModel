 last remaining colonies:
 
 >are you for real?
 
 >people dumb enough to give their money and possessions to a guy who says he's
 >jesus deserve all they get
 
 people who were dumb enough to believe klinton was a moderate deserve what
 they get too.  it's a real laugh to hear them try to justify this massacre
 with bullsh*t about how concerned they were about how our tax money was
 was being spent.  (wasting money keeping texans alive?  hell no. let's
 spend it to import haitians with aids so we can treat them at taxpayer
 expense.  %^p  )
 
 >anyway, he killed a few feds
 
 so what?  the feds killed 90+ civilians when they "ran out of patience", to use
 their own phrase.  if the feds hadn't attacked them, they'd all be home eating 
 dinner with their families tonight.  too bad, but they started it.  maybe
 next time they'll think twice.  that's worth 4 stormtroopers.
 
 >he's not the goddam hero here
 
 nobody says he is.  what he was was a victim of a left-wing government,
 that violated its pledge to protect and uphold the constitution, run amok.  
 don't worry, though dweeb, we're gonna take it back.  (hey, i'm a white guy,
 but would it be ok if i quoted malcolm x here, and said "by any means 
 necessary"?  nah, never mind.  we can do this legally...
 
 >he's dead an' i'm happy!!!!!
 
 no, you're just a brainless f*cking trogladyte.  go beat up some soccer
 fans.  ignorance is bliss, so drool on with that stupid smile on your 
 face when people die needlessly. i hope a badger climbs up your kilt.
 
 (don't expect these ukies to care about this, folks...  these bastards
 never did like the idea that we americans had the means to defend ourselves 
 and wouldn't stand for tyranical governments, which is why we sent them packing 
 back to their dreary little island with their tails between their legs twice.)
