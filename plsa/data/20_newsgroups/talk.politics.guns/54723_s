 according to wnci 97.9 fm radio this morning, dayton, ohio is operating a
 gun "buy back".  they are giving $50 for every functional gun turned in.
 they ran out of money in one day, and are now passing out $50 vouchers of
 some sort.  they are looking for more funds to keep operating.  another
 media-event brought to you by hci.
 
 is there something similar pro-gun people can do ?  for example, pay $100
 to anyone who lawfully protects their life with a firearm ?  sounds a bit
 tacky, but hey, whatever works.
