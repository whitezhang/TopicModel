 it's also what you say when you're waiting for the end to come in a 
 "fiery apocalypse"...just a thought.
 
 personally, if the fire was set (by either side), i wonder about the
 timing.  if koresh & co. set the fires, why wait through six hours of
 wall-bashing and tear-gassing before starting; was there anything "new"
 that happened just around that point?  similarly, if the fbi were going
 to torch the place (and fake it, of course), why wait so long, wouldn't
 it be more "reasonable" to believe the bd's would set the fire early
 after the assault began?  
 
 the most plausible (to me) explaination is that of an accidental starting
 of the fire by the tanks.  among other things, i say that because i
 was listening to the radio when the fire started and the reporter
 (watching from a distance, of course) said that it looked like at least
 one of the tanks had penetrated farther into the building than previously.
 specifically, he said that one tank apparently was halfway (half of
 the tank's lenght) into the building where it previously had only been 
 penetrating a few feet.
 
 reserving judgement,
