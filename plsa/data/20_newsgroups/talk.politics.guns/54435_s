 i suspect that you think that this is less lethal than the typical
 "assault weapon".  you are wrong.  compared to what most criminals use, a
 9mm with military ammo (fmjs), or a military rifle (use is extremely
 rare), .223 or 7.62mm with military ammo (fmjs), the .32 h&r magnum with
 "civie" bullets is more lethal.  most of the arms which criminals (and
 the military) use are among the least lethal arms in existance.
 
 what if we just punish the criminal and leave the law abiding citizen
 alone?  it hasn't been tried in recient times, but it might work.
