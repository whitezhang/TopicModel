 	i keep hearing people say this.  it assumes that we, at some point,
 	had a choice at the ballot box: "vote yes or no i want the fbi
 	and batf to become latter-day gestapos".  that just isn't so.
 	the process is far more complex.  we do not have direct control over
 	the bureaucracy.  when we evaluate our representatives we don't often
 	know what their contribution is to the wayward direction of the
 	federal law enforcement bureacracy.  to assert that we got what
 	we wanted is absurd.

 	by the way do you have a plan for getting us out of this mess we
 	are in?
