    washington, april 19 -- the following is a statement by 
 fbi director william s. sessions regarding the branch davidian 
 incident in waco, texas:
 
    "i had hoped to be making a very different statement this evening.
 after very careful planning and extensive preparation we all thought
 that today's efforts by the fbi to bring the branch davidians out of
 their compound would result in the peaceful resolution of the
 stand-off or at least meaningful negotiation.
    "instead, we are faced with devastation and death.  however, i
 have no question that our plan was correct and was conducted with
 extreme professionalism and care.  i applaud the restraint shown by
 agents in the face of life-threatening gunfire, and i thank them for
 risking their lives to try to end this peacefully.  i have only the
 greatest admiration for the courage and professionalism of all
 involved."
