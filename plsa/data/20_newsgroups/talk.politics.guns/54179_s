 what i find so hard to understand is how come some people, apparantly
 not connected with government or otherwise privileged, will
 go to great lengths, redefinitions, re-interpretations, in a full-bore
 attempt to throw away the protection of their own rights under the
 constitution!!!
 
 almost makes me think of lemmings running into the sea during a lemming
 year...
 
 i really wonder that jefferson and madison would say to these folks?
