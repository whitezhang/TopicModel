 did anybody notice it is the treasury dept (the fbi and batf, in other words)
 that clinton wants to do the investigation?  in other words, investigating

 he sure didn't seem very enthusiastic about congress doing the investigation,

 dept investigation will, at most say "possible poor judjement.  too bad..."
 
 grrr.
