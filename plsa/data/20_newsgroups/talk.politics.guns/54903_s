 okay.  i have my copies of all relevant gun-control bills.  i'm mad as hell.
 i want to get involved.  i want to join the battle to protect our second
 amendment rights.
 
 who do i write?
 
 who should i concentrate on writing my comments to?  the actual author of the
 bill?  the supporters of the bill?  my congressman?  my senator?  newspapers?
 magazines?  all of the above?
 
 i don't believe that i will change the world, but at least i am going to throw
 a few punches.  can any of you offer any advice or suggestions to me as i now
 begin to get involved here?
 
 thanks for replying directly to me via e-mail.
