 "well regulated", at the time of its writing and in the context of the second amendment,
 means "properly trained and equipped."
 
 it modern language it would read:
 
 	a properly trained and equipped militia, being necessary to the security of
 	a free state <note the word "free", it doesn't say "police"), the right of
 	the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.
