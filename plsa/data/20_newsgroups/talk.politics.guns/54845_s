 wait a minute.  the story being pushed here is that the fire started
 in one place.  this is not consistent with the story that they were
 trapped by the fire (particularly in a building that all of a sudden
 had many more exits).
 
 choose one, please.

 well, for everyone besides koresh and his blood children, we can 
 assume independent choice: ah, they chose to stay in the face of
 an assault which clearly endangered their lives.  or, alternatively,
 they were not permitted to leave.  choose one.
