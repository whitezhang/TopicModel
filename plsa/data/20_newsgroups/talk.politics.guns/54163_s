 yes, i agree the first half of the amendment does modify the noun 
 militia.  but the difinition of modify that applies to how "well regulated" 
 modifies "militia" is:
 	to qualify or limit the meaning of.  for example, "wet"
 	modifes "day" in the phrase "a wet day."
 
 the amendment is similiar to the statement:
 	a wet day, being annoying, the right of the people to keep
 	and wear boots, shall not be infringed.
 so how does a dry day pertain the right to use boots?  similiar,
 what does the "unorganized militia" have to due with the right to
 own guns?

 no not, unconditional, but "shall not be infringed".  infringed
 is defined as:
 	to break or ignore the terms of or obligations (an oath, 
 	an agreement, law, or the like); to disreguard; violate.
 	to go beyond the boundaries or limits; tresspass; encroach.
 this definition implies the following of some form of existing 
 agreement.  laws and agreements are made in advance.  boundaries 
 or limits of behavior are set by society as a whole.  the word 
 "unconditional" implies no agreements or all previous agreements 
 are off, which is the opposite.
 
 the words used in the first amendment are much stronger, i.e.,
 "congress shall make no law," are much stronger.  they clearly 
 	         ^^^^^^^^^^^
 imply "unconditional."  if the writers of the amendment, wanted 
 unconditional whay didn't they says, "congress shall make no 
 laws pertaining the the right of the people to keep and bear arms"?
 the second amendment implies a sort contract between the people
 the people and the state.  the bigger part of the contract is
 the people have the right to overthrew the government and its laws
 at any time.  to guarantee this right, the laws cannot stopped
 the people from forming a "well regutaled militia."  the duties
 of a "well regulated militia" to the government are descussed in 
 federalist no. 29.  and the limits of of the governmental control
 of the militia are descussed in article i section 8, article ii 
 section 2, and the second amendment of the constitution.
