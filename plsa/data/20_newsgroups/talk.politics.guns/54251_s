    i agree very much.  i have read almost every article written about
    the glock, and imo, it is probably the safest auto-loader made.  it
    has the best safty of all, jeff cooper's first rule, "keep your finger
    off the trigger until you want to shoot."  if everyone just observed
    this, there would be fewer "accidents".
