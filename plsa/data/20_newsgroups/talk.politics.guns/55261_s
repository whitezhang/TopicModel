 a friend recorded cnn news during the gassing and incineration of
 the bd's.  i went through it carefully today, and found something
 very interesting.  a tank is pulling out of the house, and there
 is a fireball, maybe 24" across that lasts for about 1 second.
 exactly ten minutes and thirty nine seconds later, the smoke starts
 billowing out of that area of the building.
 now, i'm no govt. spokestwinkie, so it might really have been a
 weather balloon or something.  perhaps someone would check it out
 and comment.
