 as david veal points out, this sort of "promotion" would be used
 against gun owners by the mass media.
 
 however, here is my proposal: offer gun safety classes in your area,
 free, as a community service.  such a class would normally cost $40
 or $50, so offering it free is a good promotion.
 
 our gun club has organized several of these (we just finished
 teaching another one last night, in fact) and they have been
 very well received.  we get a lot of people who are novices
 interested in guns.  we even get a few who are anti-gun, but
 feel they should know something about "gun safety" since members
 of their family keep guns at home.
 
 teaching such a course gives us many desirable benefits:
 
 (1) we have the chance to teach gun safety rules; this increases
     firearm awareness and may help to reduce gun accident stats.
 
 (2) a "gun safety" class is politically correct, and likely to
     be viewed positively by the public and the media.
 
 (3) most of the students are 'normal people' (not gun enthusiasts)
     and this kind of class gives us the chance to give them a
     gentle introduction to firearms.
 
 (4) some of the students are enthusiastic, and will purchase a gun
     and become more involved in shooting or personal defense.
 
 (5) it improves the public perception of our club and gun owners
     in general.  our students see that we are all reasonable,
     non-aggressive, soft-spoken people, which helps to mitigate
     the standard image of a hardcore gun owner.  even anti-gun
     students sometimes tell us they have "something new to think
     about" with regards to personal gun ownership.
 
 (6) sharing our experience with others is a lot of fun.
 
 our course is the standard nra-certified "home firearm safety"
 class, and our students pay only $5 for materials.  we also
 teach the nra's "personal protection" class, although the cost
 is higher for that one since we have to purchase range time.
 
 i think firearms safety classes are an excellent response to
 gun buy-backs.
