 perhaps i wasn't sufficiently clear.  i was not accusing you of being
 a quisling.  the quislings are in our own u.s. government, throwing
 away the people's right to keep and bear arms -- at least, that's
 where the ones that i intended to refer to are.  i figured that people
 on this newsgroup would interpret that as intended, but obviously
 something of my intent got lost.
