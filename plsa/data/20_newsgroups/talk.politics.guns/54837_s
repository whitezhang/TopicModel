 Perhaps I wasn't sufficiently clear.  I was NOT accusing YOU of being
 a quisling.  The quislings are in our own U.S. government, throwing
 away the people's right to keep and bear arms -- at least, that's
 where the ones that I INTENDED to refer to are.  I figured that people
 on this newsgroup would interpret that as intended, but obviously
 something of my intent got lost.
