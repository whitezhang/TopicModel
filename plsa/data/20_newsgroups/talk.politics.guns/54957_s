 um, i sortof hesitate to bring this up, but owning even a single share
 entitles you to attend the annual shareholders meeting, and under most
 corporate charters to introduce topics to be discussed.  while i *don't*
 suggest the tactic used by some in japan (go to the shareholders meeting,
 and disrupt the bejeezus out of everything), what about a well-worded
 resolution complaining about "advocacy journalism"?
