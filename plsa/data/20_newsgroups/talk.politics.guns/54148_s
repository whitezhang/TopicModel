 	why?  either the numerator or the denominator could fluctuate.
 	the dollar value of a gun would (of course)
 	go up if supply were restricted.  the weight of a gun might
 	go down significantly as technology improved.   i don't

 	the skill is easily taught to anyone with a modicum of
 	mechanical aptitude and the only motivator needed is 
 	money.  if guns were banned then this motivator would kick
 	in big time.  now, of course, it is not a moneymaking
 	proposition for every machine shop to make guns on the
 	side when it ain't rebuilding engines.  ban guns and 
 	watch what happens.  you'll have to schedule a year in advance
 	to get your brakes resurfaced. ;-)
