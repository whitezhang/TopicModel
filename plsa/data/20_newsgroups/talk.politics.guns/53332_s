 as i recall, in the 60's the kennedy administration had sub-kiloton
 nuclear weapons withdrawn from europe and destroyed.  they were man-
 portable and made for use in shoulder-mount rocket launchers.  the
 smallest nuclear test i've seen data for was a .1 (yes, one-tenth)
 kiloton weapon tested either in the late 40's or early 50's.
