 that depends only on the profit of doing so.  the differences
 in cost of production will determine local vs smuggle.

 those of us who have actually made semi-autos (full-autos are easier)
 are getting quite a giggle out of this.  i'd estimate that 5% of
 the people at my high school couldn't do it.  (i was one of the
 few who failed shop.)  people who have actually seen me do mechanical
 work would probably say that 1% is more like it.
 
 starting with even 90% of the population, you can be sure that
 "enough" people will be motivated.

 how much is "through the nose"?  after all, we know quite a bit
 about how much a gun is worth to a criminal, so if that is dwarfed
 by the price demanded by the "bad" part of that 90%....
 
 the relevant economic analysis has been made.  the "profit" of
 gun crime is high enough that the price required to push criminals
 out of the market is high enough that everyone will be motivated.
 that analysis ignored some "improvements" in the criminal gun
 market that could make them even cheaper.  (they're not efficiently
 used now, but a "loaner" set up would drive the value still higher
 without affecting criminal use.)
