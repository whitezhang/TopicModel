 nice sound-bite, david, but not relevant.  at the moment
 i reason that that tornado is coming right at me, i begin
 to feel fear.  at the moment i realize that that car coming 
 toward me is in *my* lane, i begin to feel fear. 
 
 i was responding to a post which suggested that the fbi 
 attacked the compound because they were afraid koresh would
 unlock the power of the seven seals.  if the fbi actually
 believed tjhat koresh could do that, fear is a reasonable
 reaction.
 
 why call koresh a prophet?  why not?  my dictionary has at
 least two definitions for the word that fit this situation.
 
 "one who prophesies future events"  seems like koresh fits
                                     this one nicely, as he
                                     correctly predicted death
                                     by conflagration.
 
 "an effective spokesman for a       seem like he wins on this one, too.       
 group, a cause, or the like"        at least, he certainly got the
                                     public's attention.
 
 
 imho, being a "prophet" and a nut-case are not mutually
 exclusive.
