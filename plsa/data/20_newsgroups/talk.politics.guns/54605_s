 the president is not competent to plan or judge the planning of such a
 raid, nor does he need to be.  his job is to set basic policies and
 manage the people under him.  if clinton instructed reno to preserve
 lives, and if she confirmed that the plan for the raid was a safe as
 could be, then he did his job.  the president should not involve
 himself in the minor details of these kinds of operations.  this sort
 of micromanagement only leads to disaster, as was demonstrated so well
 in vietnam.
 
 but the raid went bad:  over 80 civilians have been killed in a
 controntation with u.s. authorities.
 
 now clinton enters the picture in a big way.  will clinton start an
 investigation?  or will he try to squash any attempt to investigate?
 is he a responsible leader?  or is he only interested in protecting
 the image of his administration?
 
 we'll all find out as this unfolds.
