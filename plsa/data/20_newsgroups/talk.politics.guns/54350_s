 not to mention last year's weaver affair.
 
 anyway, here's how i see the waco affair; i'd be interested in other peoples'
 interpretations...
 
 1. koresh and his people were basically minding their own business.
 2. some weapons violations may have been committed and i wouldn't have
    disapproved of prosecuting him for those violations.  however, i think
    the batf was criminal for starting negotiations with a military style
    assault and for firing into a house where there were children and other
    noncombatants.
 3. i don't see they couldn't just leave a token guard on the place and wait
    the bds out; i don't approve of the tear gas approach and, if it caused
    the fire to be started, i think the fbi agent responsible should spend
    10-20 years in jail.
 4. however, if koresh's response to the tear gas was to kill everyone there,
    i hold him largely responsible for their deaths.
