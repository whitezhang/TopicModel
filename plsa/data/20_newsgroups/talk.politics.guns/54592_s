 yeah, and at least one person ran back in. sounds like a personal choice to me.
 religious fanaticsm, and a beleive that dying in the 'defense' of your beliefs,
 is probably at the core of what happened in waco. we in the west tend to
 disregard fanaticsm of the type displayed by many moslem fundamentalist groups

 this same type of fanaticsm was displayed by the bds. but we'll probably never
 know...
