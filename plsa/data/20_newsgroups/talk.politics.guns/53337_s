 i do not think it is at all unlikely that clinton ro his policy
 wonk facilitators arranged the waco raid as a display piece for  the
 gun war on the constitution.  look at what the bush administration did to
 get material for the drug war on the constitution--remember that baggie of
 crack george waved at the cameras?  they took a dealer from the ghetto
 and brought him to the white house so they could say drugs had been
 dealt onb the white house lawn.
 and i don't think anybody could honestly think clinton would have any
 moral qualms about the raid...
 the only really worrisome thing is that the bd's heroic defense of
 their ranch will make clinton's gun war on the constitution _more_
 successfull--exactly as he wanted.  the media and politicians will
 filter this so that the general public will think the bd's
 are bad guys!  don't help them.  stand up for the bd's with your
 friends and family adnd in public anytime you can--their supposed
 moral qualms are not important to the issue.  they are heroes in the
 fight against oppressive government;  it could just as well have been
 you.
