 and i suppose i should just take your word for it. did you ever
 think that many people who use firearms to protect themselves
 might not admit to it because of the ridiculous laws which exist
 forbidding concealed carry?

 i already own a cool jacket. i ride a bicycle to work and park
 it behind my desk. and if my woman decides to go with someone
 else, i'd be disappointed but killing her new suitor will probably
 not endear her to me any more than before. frankly, i've never
 met a woman worth killing for anyway. (now, an ar-15 with a chrome
 barrel, that's worth killing for ...!-))

 does this pinhead know something the rest of us don't?
 i'm not too worried about federal martials coming to get my guns.
 the government can't seem to keep violent criminals in jail since
 they don't have enough prison space, and the legal system is over-
 burdened anyway. where are they going to put all the millions of
 gun-owners who won't fork over their weapons? maybe you'd like to
 volunteer the services of your humble abode, since you obviously
 feel sooooo strongly about this.

 your argument has been rendered useless. accept this. find another
 newsgroup.
