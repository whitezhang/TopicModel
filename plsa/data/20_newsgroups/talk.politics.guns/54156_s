 if this were not true in practice, then certain unethical politicians would
 not be passing gun control laws.  politicians are generally whores to public
 opinion.  this does not mean the the public is either well informed or correct.
 as for the stats,  anyone can support anything with the right stats.  the 
 "right" stats, from what i've seen, are sometimes even used to support
 conflicting sides of the same issue.

 used to own firearms? while armed insurrection, as the ff's of the const. 
 may have envisioned seems to me a somewhat fanatical approach to avoiding this,
 political protest is still an option at this point.  i agree that it's 
 argueably not enough and/or too late.  if all else fails, there's always
 pvc pipe and cosmoline.
