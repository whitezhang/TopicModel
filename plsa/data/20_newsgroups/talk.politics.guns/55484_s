 sorry charles...according to the national safety council, accident facts,1991
 "in 1990, gun accidents were the fifth-leading cause of accidental death
 for children ages 14 and under."

  that thinking is so screwed up, i don't even know how to respond to it.
 a rational person would concentrate on motor vehicle deaths, and not attempt
 to affect childhood falls, drownings, gunshot injuries, etc.????????????????
 so this so called rational person, (using your definition), if he or she
 were attempting to affect the leading causes of deaths for adults aged 25
 through 64 would only worry about cancer, and would not try to decrease
 lesser causes such as heart disease, injuries, stroke, suicide, liver disease,
 chronic lung disease, homicide, hiv infection, or diabetes.  oh, okay charles,
 that makes a lot of sense.  i tell you what charles, i'll call the heart
 foundation and suicide hotlines and tell them that they are not acting rational
 and that they can all go home because they are addressing the lesser causes
 of death.  and you call your local police homicide department, liver foundation
 and diabetes foundation and tell them to stop addressing these lesser causes.
 please, quit wasting my time with this silly shit charles.
  
 i've got an idea charles, why don't you start a talk.politics.caraccidents
 group or talk.politics.fall group?  this is talk.politics.guns.  don't
 confuse the issue.  just because a social problem may not claim as many
 victims as another, we should not try to address it?  i don't agree.
 i'm not posting to t.p.g to debate the supposed severity of causes of
 childhood deaths. i am really getting frigging sick of having to respond
 to the irrational statements of people who assume that someone who
 wants to discuss youth gun violence or unintentional youth gun deaths
 is trying to make a political issue out of it.

  again charles, you tend to confuse the issue and take things out of context
 for your own purposes.  the statement that you responded to above is actually
 in reference to a previous post by another person who, like you, expressed
 concern over making youth gun violence a priority.  i guess, maybe humane
 person and rational person could be interchangeable huh? both would be defined
 as "a person who only addresses the social problem that causes the greatest
 number of childhood deaths."  if that is the case, i'm extremely glad that i
 am inhumane and irrational.

 sorry charles, the fbi uniform crime report is well known for misrepresenting
 the facts.  but if you insist, according to the 1990 ucr, "firearm murders
 of youngsters 19 and under increased 125 percent between 1984 and 1990"
  
 is the national center for health statistics good enough for you?  they state
 that "every day, 12 american children ages 19 and under are killed in gun
 accidents, suicides, and homicides.  many more are wounded".
  
 or how about the national pediatric trauma registry?  they say "gunshot
 wounds to children ages 16 and under nearly doubled in major urban areas
 between 1987 and 1990."
  
 do you also doubt the american academy of pediatrics charles???  they state
 that "gunshot wounds among children in urban areas increased 300% from
 1986 to 1988."
  
 charles, i hope you don't need to be convinced that youth are increasingly
 victims of gun injuries and that they have easy access to guns.  if you don't
 realize this fact, (i don't care if you go by cdc or fbi data, or if you go
 into the homes, schools, and streets where these kids are and take a poll
 by yourself), i'm not going to bother to try to convince you.  its obvious
 that you have ruled out any idea of discussing this issue in a sane fashion
 and that you are so focused on trying to make this a gun control and political
 discussion.  i really don't want to do that.
  
 >> or the centers for disease control.
 >         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  charles, it's obvious that you know nothing about the cdc.
 they don't just study cancer and heart disease.  i've got news for you,
 interpersonal gun violence is an epidemic.  in 1984, surgeon general
 c. everett koop declared that gun violence is as much a public health
 problem as cancer, heart disease, or auto accidents.

 who the f**k said anything about teaching children to safely handle
 firearm charles??? in the future, if you are going to post to t.p.g and jump
 into a previous discussion, please read the entire posting, not just 1
 sentence that you decide to respond to. what the hell are you saying here???
 you're wasting time and space trying to make a political and gun control
 issue out of a discussion that isn't.

 charles buddy, i'm getting really tired of this.  do you live on the planet
 mars???  as a physicist, i realize that you probably don't come into contact
 with many youth, but i really think you need to make a trip to your local
 urban high school and discover the joy of guns in schools.  in addition
 spend a few minutes talking to these kids.  ask them if they have ever heard
 gunshots in their neighborhoods, whether they know anyone who has been shot,
 whether they know anyone who has a gun, whether they have ever held a gun, and
 whether they themselves have ever been shot.
  
 believe me charles, that will be your *independent* verification.
