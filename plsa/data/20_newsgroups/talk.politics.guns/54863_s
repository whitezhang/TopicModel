 i heard over npr yesterday morning that arlan specter, senator from
 pennsylvania, has already called for a congressional investigation.
 the problem is that specter was one of the key government attorneys several
 years ago who did what he could to coverup facts in the assassinations
 of jfk and others.  that is to say, the chief fox wants to check out
 the hen house.  writing your representatives is a great idea.  when
 you do ask that they keep specter and his cronies far away from 
 any investigation.
