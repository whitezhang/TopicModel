 ccw's are issued at the discretion of the police chief, so it varies
 town by town.
 
 in my town, forget about anything more than "target and sport" (carry to
 and from the gun club / hunting area only) unless you're mr. moneybags
 with large daily deposits.  ("your life isn't worth shit, but your money --
 now, that's important.")  in other towns, they treat law abiding citizens
 like adults.  
 
 secret game hint: you never know when the rules will be changed -- a change 
 in police chief can throw a town from either side of the board to the other
 -- fun for the whole family!
 
 some chiefs will grant you a "personal protection" permit if you have been
 attacked or threatened.  some other blue-suited assholes have been known to 
 count this as a negative against applicants.
 
 it's a crap shoot, and your rights are the stakes.
