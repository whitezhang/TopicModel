 what sources did sauter and hines use?  in congressional hearings
 later, the newspaper folk admitted that their reports were completely
 wrong.  (some of their excuses are understandable, while others amount
 to gross negligence.  then there's their "we lied".)  as far as i
 know, they never did the followup.

 i don't have any relevant knowledge about the counter-sniper tactics
 or what the govt did with the big war toys.  that's why i've only
 commented on what they couldn't have accomplished, no matter what
 they did.

 not in detroit, not during the 60s.  that's newspaper copy and they
 admitted later that they were wrong.
