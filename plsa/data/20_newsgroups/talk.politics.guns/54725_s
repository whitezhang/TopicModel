 not to mention that the g-men believed the children didn't have gas masks.
 
 but that was not, with respect to the children, the point of the gassing.
 the feds *knew* that the children's health would be in danger and proceeded
 under the assumption that the "motherly instinct" of the davidian women
 would remove them from harm's way. i busted a gut on that one.
 
 someone else on the net observed that the administration's appeal to a
 woman's "motherly instinct" would never wash with feminists and liberals
 if a republican were in the white house. i say that such an justification
 could *only* come from a feminist mindset. 
 
 btw - i'd read in the paper yesterday that the type of gas used was cs2.
 the paper didn't provide any specifics about it.
