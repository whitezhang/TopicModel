 in the interest of accuracy (seems a liitle late to start
 that, i know) the medical examiner has *not* contradicted
 the fbi.
 
 the fbi said they found some folks who had been shot in
 the head, and the medical examiner said "we have not seen
 evidence of this".
 
 at the time the medical examiner said that, they were dealing
 with charred bodies in the compound - this sounds like
 typical medical examiner not releasing details until
 a thorough investigation.  the medical examiner saying
 he hasn't seen something is *not* the same thing as saying
 that it isn't there.
 
 while it might end up being true that the fbi had spoken
 falsely, it isn't clear yet that they have.
