 
 
 a couple of questions for you firearms law experts out there:  
 
 question #1
 
 according to the nra/ila state firearms lawbook, in wisconsin it is
 'unlawful for any person except a peace officer to go armed* with a 
 "concealed and dangerous weapon."  there is no statutory provision for
 obtaining a lixense or permit to carry a concealed weapon.'
 
 *  jury instructions indicate that 'to go armed' one must have a firearm
 on one's person or within his immediate control and available for use.
 
 
 
 does this mean that open carry is allowed?  if so, just how 'open' does it
 have to be?  would an in the pants holster be considered concealing?  what
 if one had their jacket on and it partially covered the weapon?  also,
 is there any way to be allowed to carry concealed, or is it just not allowed,
 period? 
 
 question #2
 
 as i understand it, in evanston, il, they have a ordinance banning handguns.
 is there any way to get around this provision?  what would the penalty if
 you were found out be?  what if you used said handgun in a defensive shooting
 in your apartment there?  how would the city law apply to your impending 
 trial for the shooting?
 also, what is il state law concerning short barreled weapons?  short barreled
 shotgun is what i would be interested in if a handgun were not available, 
 either that or a shortened 9mm carbine (ie colt, marlin).  
 one more thing, what is the chance of getting a ccw permit in il without being
 rich or famous or related to the mayor?
 
 please send replies via e-mail, as things seem to be piling up around t.p.g
 a little faster than i can handle.  thanks again
