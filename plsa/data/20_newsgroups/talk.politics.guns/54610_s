 what is "doing it right the first time"?  murdered them all?  used tanks? 
 maybe they should have had enough evidence to indict.  from the list presented
 to date, i haven't seen anything illegal.  they claim that the bd's bought
 components to convert their weapons to class iii devices, but no evidence that
 they had done so.  in fact, with a class iii ffl living with them, this may
 have been legal (given recent court rulings).
 
 what you really meant to say was that the atf should have done the right and
 lwaful thing.  or did you just want the bd's dead?
