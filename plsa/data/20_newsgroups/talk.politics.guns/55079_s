 i seem to recall graphic news file of buddhist monks setting themselves on fire
 in the streets of saigon. yes, its a horrible way to go, but apparently not
 so horrible that someone with enough religious conviction might not be able to 
 carry it through. and, since they've discovered bullet wounds in a couple of 
 the bodies from the compound, there is the possiblity that those with the will power to self immolate also had the will power to take out the ones who had
 less constitutional fortitude. then again, maybe the fbi ran in while the fire
 was raging, executed those two, and ran out again.
