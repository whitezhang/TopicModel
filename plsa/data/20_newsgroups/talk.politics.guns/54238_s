      there is no such thing as "completely secure," especially when dealing
 with high technology. it's all a question of cost: what cost are you
 willing to bear to protect your information vs. what rewards the "bad guys"
 are going to get if they break it. the rewards of breaking such a single id
 system would be high indeed.
