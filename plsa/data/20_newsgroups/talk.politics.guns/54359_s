 if amnesty was their concern, they should pay in cash rather than moneyorder
 and they should check to see if the gun turned in was stolen or not.
 this way if a gun turns out to be stolen, then even if they wanted to 
 prosecute, they don't know who to prosecute.
 since the only concern of these(hci and the like) people seems to be the total
 eradication of guns( legal or illegal ), why should they bother to check for
 stolen property.  if they knew who the rightful owner is, then they would have
 to return the gun and hence contrary to their intent to ban all guns.
