 so far, the medical examiner (according to the news) has found no evidence
 of gunshot wounds in bodies so far examined.  if this continues to be
 the case, it will sort of shoot holes (pun intended) in the fbi story,
 wouldn't it?  and cartridges going off outside a firearm do not launch
 a bullet like they do when fired from a gun.  the bullet hardly moves,
 it is the brass casing that goes flying, and then with less than lethal
 force.  it will hurt, yes, but not kill you - i doubt if it wil penetrate
 a coat, for example.
 
 how about an independent investigation, with full subpoena powers, and
 powers to prosecute on felony charges, to investigate for any possible
 illegal/criminal activity on the part of both the batf and fbi?  i
 cannot see any reason why not - to use the phrase they like to use
 so often, "if they have nothing to hide..." they should welcome it,
 and vigorously support it.  note that an internal investigation by the
 dept of justice is not an independent investigation...
