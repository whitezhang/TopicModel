 |what will californians do with all those guns after the reginald
 |denny trial?
 
 the wall street journal had an article on how the police were whining
 about all the new guns; excuse me, but police are employees of the
 government. rather like having your janitor complain about job
 conditions.
 
 i say californians should form armed block clubs that would engage
 in coordinated strategies should batf attempt to disarm them based
 on the "nefarious tipster" theory of law enforcement. unlike waco, 
 californians should be able to destroy armored vehicles in city
 streets with incendiary weapons, acetylene after slowing them down
 with abandoned car blockades. m-1 garands should easily outclass
 batf shock troops with their h&k mp-5 smgs, and there should be
 enough sony walkmans and boom boxes to overwhelm any fbi psy-war
 operation... yes, a good time would be had by all. billary clinton
 would get what he wanted, a war on gunowners, the batf would attempt
 to show the anti-gun press they they really, really were in charge
 with a 500-man "charge of the light brigade," and the fbi would attempt 
 to show how _they_ really were in charge by asking the californian 
 national guard to level the area with artillary!
