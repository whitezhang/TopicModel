      so could the defenders in the alamo.  you're clearly missing the
      point here.  typically, i might add.
 
      if it were me, i doubt that *i* would have come out.
 
      batf show up, start shooting at me, etc.  then they paint me
      a child-molesting murdering fanatic, call up tanks, hundreds
      of automatic-armed goons.  restrict press access to two miles
      away.  
 
      come on.  if i can watch pictures of burned women and children
      in bosnia on cnn, why am i being limited to a two-mile-away
      replay of a fire in waco?  huh?  answer me that.
