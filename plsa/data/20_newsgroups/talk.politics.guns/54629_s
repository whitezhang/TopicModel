 sigh.
 
 the use of the term zog (which, i understand, stands for zionist
 occupation government, or some such bullshit) was used for satiric
 purpose.  since the posting i was responding to was on alt.conspiracy,
 among other crossposted groups, i composed a satiric message
 using jargon sometimes found on that group.  i figured that the
 content (and context) of the message was so absurd that no one would
 take any part of it completely seriously.
 
 if anyone believes that i am an anti-semite, it will be news to my
 jewish boss and his israeli wife, both of whom i am on cordial terms
 with as well as as the many jews that i have been friends, companions,
 and co-workers with over the years.  not to mention, news to me.
 
 as far as guns go... i support the bill of rights -- all of it -- and
 if you wish to arm yourself to the teeth, by all means, do so.
 however, the concept of a .50 calibre machine gun as a sporting weapon
 (for target practice or otherwise) struck, and continues to strike me
 as moderately absurd, even if constitutionally protected.
 
 to each their own.
