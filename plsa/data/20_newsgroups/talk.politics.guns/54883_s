 
 the denver post (supposed voice of the supposed rocky mountain empire)
 ran the following in the 'firearms, supplies' classified heading on 
 friday, 23 april 1993.  if you have an opinion about their new found
 wisdom, i am told that the person to speak with is one mr. walters,
 (303)820-1267.
 
 	notice
 
 	the denver post will no longer 
 	knowingly accept any advertise-
 	ment to buy or sell assault weap-
 	ons.  the denver post finds that 
 	the use of assault weapons poses
 	a threat to the health, safety, and
 	security of its readers.
 
 let 'em know what you think...
