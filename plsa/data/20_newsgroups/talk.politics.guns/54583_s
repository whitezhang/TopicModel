 you don't have to pay attention to any one source, neither do you
 have to abandon your critical thinking, but to disregard all sources
 of information as 'lies' and 'distortions' and substitute your own
 pet theories is more likely to get you wild untruths than by basing
 your theories on the 'facts' as they are reported by the media and
 the government.

 actually there was evidence of the fire being set deliberately -
 both testamony by the survivors and ir tape showing the fire
 being set in 3 places and the petrochemical soot that the fire 
 was giving off (indications of kerosine or gasoline feeding the
 fire).  
 
 you might not believe 1 or 2 if you are totally paranoid or very
 skeptical, but my 3rd point is visible to anyone who watches the
 tapes of the fire and has started a bbq grill.
