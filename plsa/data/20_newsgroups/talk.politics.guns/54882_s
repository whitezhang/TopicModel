 i'm getting tired of these wimpy liberals whining about gun control,
 too!  ya know, the second amendment says
 
 	a well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a
 	free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms,
 	shall not be infringed.
 
 now, notice, it says *arms*.  not guns.  arms.
 
 the comsymp zog wants you to think that it is the only legitimate
 possessor of nuclear weapons.  unconstitutional!  you and i have just
 as much right to a kilogram or two of nice weapons grade plutonium as
 any cruddy little pointy headed liberal los alamos pinkos.
 
 support your right to keep and bear short range nuclear weapons.  it's
 a legitimate and challenging sport.
 
 and screw the limit.
