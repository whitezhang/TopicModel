       well, i dropped by the library yesterday, and picked up back copies
 of the national crime survey (1986-1990) in an effort to examine what
 it said about self-defense with a firearm.
 
       i haven't ground through much in the way of numbers yet, but a couple
 of things jumped out at me.  first only 1986 and 1987 specify the type of
 weapon used in self defense.  1988, 1989, and 1990 refer only to "weapon."
 the second is that while assaults rose about 3% from 1986 to 1987, w/gun
 defenses reported *fell* by almost 25%.  unless there's an explanation for
 this, i'm tempted to mark it as a reporting problem, and as such going 
 ahead with any examination of the numbers would be a waste of time.
 
       anybody have an idea what might have cause a real difference, and
 not just a reporting difference?  the survey doesn't appear to have
 changed significantly between 1986 and 1987.
