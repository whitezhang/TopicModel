    "a handful of anti-gun zealots are telling the public that their
 right to self-defense is of less importance than the interests of
 handgun control, inc.  this action comes as local, state and federal law
 enforcement officials continue their assault on the branch davidian
 compound--an assault which has already resulted in the death of one
 two year old child at the hands of federal agents.  this has highlighted
 the need for citizens to be able to defend themselves and their children
 against the excesses of their own government."

 >crime is a distortion of the facts, at best.  this so-called
 >crime-fighting law has resulted in a 16 percent increase in violent
 >crime in the state of florida, and i have never heard law enforcement
 >officials bragging that more guns on the streets is the way to reduce
 >crime.
 
   "any suggestion by opponents that this bill will increase crime is a 
 distortion of the facts, at best.  the aggressive outreach by officials
 in central florida to train and arm women has led to a dramatic drop in
 the level of assault and rape in that area.  of course, this program is
 a rare gem, as many law enforcement officials apparently believe that an
 unarmed citizenry will be easier to control, and thus favor tighter 
 restrictions."
 
 >   "the vote today is an insult to the law enforcement officials who
 >are putting their lives on the line every day to end the standoff in
 >waco.  the entire country now knows just how easy it is for an
 >individual bent on destruction to amass an arsenal of weapons.  texas
 >lawmakers who voted for this concealed handgun bill have shown total
 >disregard for those law officials on the front lines, and the
 >families of those who have fallen.
 
    "the vote today is a tribute to the good sense of the public at large
 who are putting their lives on the line every day as they go about their
 lawful affairs.  the entire country knows how vulnerable the average 
 citizen is, both to attacks from criminals and from armed assault by our
 own police.  texas lawmakers who voted for this concealed handgun bill have
 shown total understanding for those innocent, law-abiding citizens on the
 front lines, and the families of those who have fallen."
 
 >   "i urge the house of representatives to listen to the 70 percent
 >of texans that oppose this measure, and reject this ill-conceived
 >legislation."
 
    "i urge the house of representatives to pay attention to the needs
 of their constituents, and not be stampeded by ill-conceived arguments
 from ideological fanatics."
