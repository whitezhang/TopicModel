 i did read the law before i commented on it.  judging from replies i received
 about my "semantics on t.p.g" post many (if not most) people here on t.p.g
 assume that when ccw laws are asked about the person is asking about the
 possibility of an ordinary citizen getting one.  it would also follow that said
 person would get the ccw to carry on his/her person away from their home and/or
 business.

 maybe freeman did prove his point but his point is not relevant.  the thing
 that most people seem to care about when they ask questions about carrying
 a concealed weapon is whether or not they can carry it concealed on their
 person when they are out on the street somewhere.  i'm sure that not many
 people are concerned with whether or not they can carry concealed at home.
 speaking as someone who lives in illinois (the only place where the above
 quoted law is relevant :-)) i know that it is legal to own a handgun here (i
 am not taking into account city ordinances).  i could care less about whether
 or not i can carry concealed at home.         i only care about the fact that
 i can't carry concealed in the place where it really counts- out on the street.
 freeman loves to be accurate and i can understand that (especially not) but he
 seems to be forgetting that accurate facts don't always replace common sense.
 i am not going to followup to this thread anymore because i believe that it is
 useless to argue these points anymore.  the only thing that is happening now
 is that freeman and i are "running around in circles" trying to prove each
 other wrong and i do not have the time to be playing games anymore.  of course
 now freeman will attack me about my use of common sense in some of my earlier
 posts but what can i do.  my only advice for freeman - quit being so picky
 about accuracy sometimes and use your common sense; it really does work some-
 times.
