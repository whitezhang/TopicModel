 i can testify to this. my cousin spent a few weeks in the hospital, and his
 friend was killed, because of a drunk driver.  the son-of-a-b**** is back on 
 the streets... officers from the scene are still p***ed about that one.
 
 :> to take a drivers safety class.  
 :
 :because you wanted one while you were underage.
 :
 :> i have to be licensed to drive.  
 :
 :only on public roads.
 :

 :> must be registered.  
 :
 :only if it is to be driven on public roads, other than between segments of my  
 :property.
 :
 :> i must (at least where i live) have liability

 :> accident with it).  
 :
 :only on public roads.
 and this obviously doesn't always work, else why would they offer uninsured 
 motorist coverage?
 :

 i object to mandatory registration because i don't trust my government not to
 use any information i give them for their own purposes.  i am licensed to
 carry a concealed pistol in my home state, but they never asked whether i 
 actually owned a firearm.  a safety class before issuing a permit to carry is
 reasonably, provided such classes are regularly available to the public.  of
 course, most places would consider my time in the reserves and on a competition
 rifle team to count.  
 :
 :perhaps, if it gave them permission to shoot in public roads and parks. :-)
 hey, now that's an idea :)

 now, unless you have an agenda against private ownership of firearms, why would
 you want to harass the person trying to legally defend themselves or exercise 
 their rights? (i know, defending oneself/family/whoever is a right... at least
 as far as my 9mm and i are concerned... ) (also as far as the state of alabama
 seems to be concerned)  why don't you push for stricter prosecution of those
 who use firearms in the commission of a crime?  i've already pointed out how
 we aren't nailing dui's hard enough...  comparing the us with other countries
 seldom works, but the european attitude towards alchohol and dui seems to work..
 their attitude towards weapons isn't really a valid comparison because they've
 historically done their best to keep the populace disarmed and submissive,
 while our country was founded by a bunch of rugged individualists who told the
 european monarchies (for the most part) to take a flying leap (used more polite
 language though).  we even weaseled out of our first international treaty, and
 then convinced the french that it was in their best interests not to complain..
 but first we had to overcome the fact that the brits were doing their best to 
 restrict us to squirrel guns and such, so we'd be properly submissive while
 they forced us to pay for their wars.  of course, most american history classes
 these days tend to gloss over facts that do not fit the image they wish to 
 convey... i'm glad my amer. hist. teacher was a libertarian who had us review
 a good portion of the federalist papers, and debate their origins and meanings.
 
 enough rambling,
