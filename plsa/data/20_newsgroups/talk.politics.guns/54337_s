 well, actually, the davidians (koreshians?) started the fire themselves, 
 the last i heard ( around 15:00 est). eight people ran out into the feilds
 surrounding the compound. all were captured and two admitted to setting the 
 fire. i don't buy your napalm theory at all (although it would have made a 
 great commercial for my .sig). why the hell would they have a wood stove
 burning on such a warm day?  flame throwers use liquid petroleum, napalm 
 is more of a gel. now to further dispute your theory, the diluted cs gas
 was inserted around 06:00 if i understood correctly. the place didn't start
 burning until around 10:00 or 11:00.

 calm down kid. vernon (koresh's real name) said himself that he would not leave
 that compound alive. the inhabitants thereof had accepted the fact that they 
 may very well have to kill themselves before it was all over.

 there are at least eight survivors. a caller on rush limbaugh today suggested
 that the rest may even be hiding in underground bunkers. that's not such a wild
 idea considering their weaponry and resolve.

 sheesh! get over it. i haven't heard (read) such ranting since the hindenberg
 burned. this should have ended 50 days ago. i'm glad my tax dollars have
 finally stopped working to pay a bunch of guys to stand around and give press
 conferences. now they can get back to more important things, like catching
 cigarrette smugglers.

 napalm sticks to kids.
