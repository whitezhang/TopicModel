     initial assault on the "compound" ( more like a wooden farm house if
   it burned to the ground like it did ) for what?  regardless of who
   started/caused the fire, none of this would have happened if the
   atf can honestly justify their initial assault and handled it 
   properly!  
 
    question authority!

     then i'm sure you won't mind if the atf or the dea raid your house
   someday on a bogus informant tip.  so what if they killed/wounded your 
   family "accidentally" during the raid, it's just a fair price to pay
   for law and order in this country, right?  answer this question 
   honestly before making anymore ignorant statements!
 
     what is even more disturbing than out of control government agencies
   are citizens who allow them to be irresponsible.
