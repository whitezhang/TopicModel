 this is a very, very good point.  who cares what kind of gun you've got if
 you're lying on the ground dead.

 another very good point that is well taken.  it seems that when lots of lead
 is flying (either the cops or the gangs) someone innocent always gets caught
 in the crossfire.

 all points made above are well taken.  i guess i am in the mindset of
 "having more makes it better" which is obviously not the correct mindset
 to take in this discussion.  now that i think about the situation a
 little more carefully i see your point exactly david and i
 wholeheartedly (sp?) agree.  like i said i'm just assuming that "more
 bullets and/or bigger bullets is better".  once again though i want to
 state that i am a pro-gun individual and do not believe that gun control
 is really a viable option here in the united states regardless of the drivel
 that i spout here :-)
