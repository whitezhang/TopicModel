 i would hope so.  let's define a nuclear weapon as an explosive weapon
 whose majority of energy comes from fission and/or fusion of atomic
 nuclei.  let's define a biological weapon as live organisms or viruses 
 in such state, quantity, and with such a vector that they could cause 
 death or serious disease [further defined] to a significant number of
 people if released in a city, similarly populated area, resevoir, or
 cropland.  
 
 
 nerve gas and mustard gas are well defined.  other poisonous
 gasses should be individually banned only if it can be shown that there
 is no use not related to weaponry.  licenses should be available for
 research purposes on such chemicals.
 
 i am not a lawyer, but these ideas could certainly be a basis for 
 definitions.

 it is not defined as a weapon of mass destruction.  many things are
 banned for other reasons.
