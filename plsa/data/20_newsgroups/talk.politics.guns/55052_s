 	i'd bet cash 90% of the people couldn't find the window after six
 minutes!  ask anybody who's taken basic training in the military.  it is
 not at all uncommon for a few soldiers who have not properly attached
 and cleared their masks to require assistance exiting the chamber.  since
 that chamber has a door, not just a window, it's likely a hell of a lot
 easier to exit than a multi-room, damaged house.
