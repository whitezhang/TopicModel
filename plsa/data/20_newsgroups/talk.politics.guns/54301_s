 even if it were a capital offense, the warrant was not even an arrest warrant,
 but a search warrant.  in other words, there was no evidence of illegal
 arms, just enough of a suggestion to get a judge to sign a license to
 search for illegal evidence.
 
 question:  as in the rodney king case, will the us doj institute
 criminal civil rights proceedings against the batf?  or at least an
 investigation?  ok, sorry i asked.
