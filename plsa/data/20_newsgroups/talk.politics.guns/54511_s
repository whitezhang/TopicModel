 wrong.  neglecting that the government and media have bullshitted the
 people almost nonstop on this issue, constitutional limitations are
 there to prevent a 'tyrrany of the majority'.  for example, a majority
 could vote that given ethnics have no rights, are not people, etc.
 and it would fly using the logic above.
 
 when government feels the constitution is not right for the times,
 there is a procedure called an amendment to the constitution.  this
 is deliberately difficult, and cumbersome, to prevent abuse of those
 who decide to ignore the people, or impose unjust policies of a
 majority on a minority.   a lynch mob is a majority, remember, outvoting
 the hangee.
 
 what the government is doing are violations, end-runs around the
 limitations on the government, probably because they know that the
 people would be very hard to convince that a good intention is behind
 tampering with the bill of rights.  government propeganda on guns has
 been very strong and persistant, but not that strong.  and it just
 shows how gullible the people have become to "i am from the government
 and am here to help you sort of line".  we have been lied to, fed
 half truths, rigged stats, while the government knows their control
 laws have no effect on crime.  they want a government monopoly on
 force, pure and simple.  do you really want the government to be able
 to override constitutional limitations by a simple vote of a bunch
 of elitists (congresscritters)?  i sure don't.  the founding fathers
 sure as hell didn't, either.
 
 <> mox nix, mr. rutledge.  you are the only one here claiming that the
 <-> rkba is dependent on the existence of a top-flight, well-regulated
 <-> militia.  why this is a false assumption has already been posted a 
 <-> number of times.  
 <
 <no, i simple stated that the people have a right to "join a well
 <organized militia."  and i have also stated that a militia that
 <meets once or twice a year is clearly "well organized."  and this
 <state of readiness that i have claimed the people have a "right"
 <to, is the same state of readiness expected of the militia as stated
 <by hamilton. 
 
 you better read the senate subcommitte on the constitution regarding the
 second amendment, and a linguist's analisys of the second itself.
 in the meanwhile, show us some stuff to back up your assertions.
 and yes, i have the above mentioned documents (and more) online.
