 
 today rush was criticizing clinton for not claiming responsibility for the
 actions and decisions of janet reno and the  fbi  early enough to suit
 rush.
 
 about 2 months ago rush was chortling over the fact that reagan has stumped
 "special persecutor walsh" with his croaking of "i don't remember" when
 asked about ollie north.
 
 if rush's criticism of clinton were to be applied to reagan and north... 
 reagan would have been impeached while north was convicted (and overturned on
 a technicality).
 
 gosh, rush sure wants to have it both ways... clinton must be held 
 responsible, but reagan was clever by using the "amnesia defense".
 
 maybe that's waht clinton should say about campaign promises and such
 "well, there you go again rush...  but to tell the truth, i wasn't in the
 loop and i just don't remember."
