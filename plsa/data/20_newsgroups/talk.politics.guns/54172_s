 what i'm wearing, or that my nra sticker isn't on straight?

      i find it sad that people won't accept the responsibility
 to defend themselves.  and i laugh with the same contempt you
 have for me at the sheep who expect the government to protect
 them.

 are canadians actually as uncivilized as we americans?

 well if it's anything like here it wouldn't matter if they
 did; they wouldn't be able to use them.
