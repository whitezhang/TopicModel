 	no chance.  if that cs ignited at all, it would have been
 quite similar to a grain bin explosion.  explosion, i note.  the
 entire compound would have been leveled, not merely burned.  as
 there was no explosion, there was no cs ignition causing the fire.
 
 	note: at five miles a decent grain elevator explosion will
 knock you on your butt and your ears will ring for days.  i speak
 from experience here.
