 if i recall correctly, the bill would provide for concealed carry if
 the person takes a 15-hr dps safety course in firearms and pays a $150
 fee for the license.  the bill is apparently veto-proof in the house,
 but ltgov bullock has said it will never come to the floor of the
 senate and dreamboat annie has vowed to veto it if it comes to her
 desk.  *shrug*
