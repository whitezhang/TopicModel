 proof by assertion!  i love it!  uh, please explain why the smugglers
 do not also rank a notch below (or above) the military in terms
 of communications, intelligence gathering (e.g., why fight officials
 when you can bribe them..."i'll give you a hundred grand to let that
 semi past..."), and firepower.

 this is the wrong way to quantify things.  the smuggler would
 be concerned about value/cubic foot.  go to a gun show and
 price out a crate of good quality handguns.

 what is a worthwhile firearm?  hell, anything that works!  go
 get yourself a copy of the army's 1969 improvised munitions manual.
 see how easy it is to make a functional firearm.
