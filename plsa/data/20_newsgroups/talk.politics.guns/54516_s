 	that really depends upon where you draw the line while defining
 these weapons, and also on if you intend the law to be reflective of
 modern practice five months or five centuries down the road.  i'll give
 you a little hint:  see that manure pile in the farmer's field down the
 road?  in the usa, that is a weapon of mass destruction, biological in
 nature, because if it gets washed into an open well it will contaminate
 the aquifers that supply thousands of cities with drinking water.  so,
 where do *you* draw the line?  in the usa, the epa has ruled that
 a pile of scrap iron is illegal.  care to draw a thinner line this time?
