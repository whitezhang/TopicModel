 	why sell them at a low price to poor people immediately?  the nra
 is an educational organization too, after all, and it would be a shame
 to pay all that money for new guns when these cheap guns would allow a
 lot of money thus saved to be used in opening more classes.  mention
 that the nra trains our boys in blue and you've got the media between
 a rock and a hard place.
 
 	"city pays $50 per gun to reduce crime."
 			or
 	"nra to pay $50 per gun to provide training guns for police
 	 and citizens.  classes expanded with money saved."
