 	if alcohol were again banned today, it would be much more
 	difficult to manage a large-scale smuggling operation. 
 	the cops now rank just a narrow notch below the military
 	in communications, intelligence gathering and firepower.
 
 	in a similar vein, the amount of marijuana smuggled into
 	this country has greatly decreased. this is because its
 	value-per-pound is very low when compared to cocaine or
 	heroin. it's simply not worth the risk, it's uneconomical.
 	now, most reefer is domestic. there is less pressure on
 	the domestic producer (showy raids notwithstanding) and
 	thus it is economical. of note though ... domestic reefer
 	is now very strong, so a small volume goes a long way.
 	you cannot make alcohol stronger than 200 proof - not a
 	good dollar/pound deal. 
 
 	firearms tend to fall into this low dollar/pound area.
 	it would not be economic to smuggle them in. all production
 	would have to be local. there are not all that many people
 	who have both the skill and motivation to assemble worthwhile
 	firearms from scratch. high-ranking crime figures could
 	obtain imported uzis and such, but the average person, and
 	average thug, would be lucky to get a zip-gun - and would
 	pay through the nose for it.
