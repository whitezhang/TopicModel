   there was at least one blast consistent with petroleum products that i
 saw, however propane is interesting stuff.  it doesn't explode on contact with
 air.  it is *possible* for a tank to rupture without exploding.  far more
 likely, however, is that the compound was equipped with ng outlets running to
 the tank.  damage from the cev's could have ruptured the gas lines, allowing
 the gas to spread, unnoticed in the cs fumes and general excitement (propane
 typically has a distinctive odor added to it for just this reason -- to smell
 leaks), until reaching a flame or spark, and then whooosh!  fire everywhere,
 and maybe an explosion.  use of ng is pretty common in texas, especially
 semi-rural areas.

   this is true, but so far the fbi/batf track record on this incident is very
 bad.

   i think it would have disarmed many people if the fbi followed this same
 policy.  they have not.  they are making claims without evidence, and what
 evidence we have so far tends to refute their story.
