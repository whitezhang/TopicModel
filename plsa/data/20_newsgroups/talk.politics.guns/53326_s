 on a los angeles radio station last weekend, the lawyers for the
 family of the murdered rancher said that the los angeles sheriff's
 department had an assessment done of the rancher's property before
 the raid.
 
 this strongly implies that the sheriff's department wanted the property;
 any drugs (which were not found) were only an excuse.
 
 in viet nam, lt calley was tried and convicted of murder because his
 troops, in a war setting, deliberately killed innocent people. it is time
 that the domestic law enforcement agencies in this country adhere to
 standards at least as moral as the military's.
 
 greed killed the rancher, possibly greed killed the davidian children.
 government greed.
 
 it is time to prosecute the leaders who perform these invasions.
