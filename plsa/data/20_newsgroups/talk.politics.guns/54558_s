 to rob and all others that have been debating about the wood stove.
    the original post claimed that the atf/fbi was pumping napalm into the 
 building with the hopes that the wood stove inside would ignite it.  i responed
 with why would the wood stove be lit in the first place?  it wouldn't be lit 
 for heating purposes because of the weather in texas.  everyone now claims 
 that it was for cooking.  stop and think about this.  cs gas was being pumped
 into the building and i presume that everyone was wearing gas masks (either
 bought or some type of makeshift type) and this had been going on for 6 hours.
 i don't know if you have ever been around cs, but i have.  being exposed to cs
 gas was part of my army training, so i know that without a mask it very 
 uncomfortable and makes your eyes water, nose run, and makes you sick in 
 the stomach.  and with the mask it is very difficult to drink water much less 
 eat.  so my question now is "why were they cooking food?"
    i will buy that a lantern could have been knocked over and caused the fire.
 but that stove was not being used for cooking (unless they were even more
 crazy than the atf/fbi claim).
