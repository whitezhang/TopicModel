  heavily armed religious cult battles government
 
  troops have been called out after a skirmish involving government
  officials and a religious cult which has been gathering weapons in their
  "private city".
 
  the cult's leaders, who claim that god speaks to them, have told cult
  members to arm themselves in preparation for the end of the world, which
  they believe to me imminent.
 
  weapons believed to be in their possession include large-bore military
  weapons as well as sporting arms.  a recent series in nearby newspapers
  has exposed the plans of the cult to take power throughout the region.
 
  troops have surrounded the cult's "city" after incidents in which
  officials have exchanged shots with cult members.  there have been
  reports of children being seen in the cult compound, where discipline is
  said to be strictly administered.
 
  governor liliburn boggs has issued an order that these "mormons" are to
  be exterminated, or driven from the state..

 since the jury's not yet in on exactly how the fire really started, the
 only dead children here for whom blame can be proven at the moment were 
 the ones shot by government fire.

 a citizen has the right to stop any attacking criminal -- even one with 
 a uniform.  clothing aside, you know, it's still not legal to serve a
 search warrant with a concussion grenade.

 well then, find out.
 
 by the way, this is not a claim of "koresh's folks," it is a claim of 
 the government -- the same government which did have grenades and grenade
 launchers and did use them.  no one has seen any evidence of the bd's 
 having, much less using, such weaponry.  if they were stocking such things 
 against armageddon, why would they have left them in the boxes when 
 armageddon actually arrived?

 see above, for one example.  the "abuses" involved were non-mainstream 
 religious beliefs, polygamy, child abuse, and fortification.  sound
 familiar?  in my opinion, the bd's were as much a real threat to society
 as the mormons were then or are now.  (that is, until they were provoked.)
 
 by the way, i find your statement about "non-nazi" law ironic.  koresh was 
 suspected of violating the gun control act of 1968, which was based on the
 text of the nazi weapons law of march 18, 1938.  ("gun control's nazi 
 connection;" jews for preservation of firearms ownership, 2872 s. 
 wentworth ave., milwaukee, wi 53207, (414) 769-0760.)
 
 by the way, what was koresh's specific violation?  failure to pay a tax.
 that's right -- the batf are treasury agents.  did a failure to pay a
 $200/gun tax really justify armed attack, night torture, and ultimately
 the death penalty?

 no -- think for yourself, for once.
