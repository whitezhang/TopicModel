 |mass destruction?  i find it hard to believe that you would support a 
 |neighbor's right to keep nuclear weapons, biological weapons, and nerve
 |gas on his/her property.  
 
 there is no law prohibiting having biological weapons or nerve gas
 on his/her property, or even walking on government property with such
 items: ipso facto it is now one's _right_ to have such weapons of
 "mass destruction."
 
 hell, the u.s. patent office has patents on the manufacture of nerve
 gas that anyone can obtain simply by sending a $1.50 to the patent
 office in washington, d.c. (p.o. box 8). these same patents are
 verboten to english citizens from their own patent office, which doesn't
 surprise me based on the mistrust of the uk government against private
 ownership of semi-automatic rifles.
 
 |if we cannot even agree on keeping weapons of mass destruction out of
 |the hands of individuals, can there be any hope for us?
 
 so, you are saying we should have legislation prohibiting owning 
 biological warfare agents or nerve agents? will you pass laws against
 owning chlorine gas or cyanide as well? will you pass laws against
 owning acetylene gas that could have been used against the bradley
 ifvs had the branch dividians known of their anti-combustion engine
 effects? will you pass laws against owning 5-gallon cylinders of
 propane because they could have been used as flame throwers? yes, the 
 proverbial "road to hell;" it's always for "our own good."
