 
 |this was no move fuck-up. a helicoptor was thermal-imaging the compound
 |that afternoon and detected three fires erupting almost simultaneously.
 
 did anyone notice any helicopters equipped with thermal imaging 
 equipment? they usually manifest themselves in a turret in the front
 of the helo, or a sphere on top of the rotor with optical elements.
 
 i didn't notice any uh-1s or other helos equipped as such. did they
 use handheld military thermal scanners? if so, there is no recording
 capability, and hence the credibility of the report is subject to
 human error.
