        the brady bill passed the house in 1992, but failed to reach a
 vote in the senate.  as such, it never reached bush.  (sarah brady's
 condemnation not-withstanding).
  
        it'll probably pass the house again, and will probably pass the
 senate if they can get it to a vote.  whether of not they'll be busy
 with other things will be the question.  i don't expect gung-ho opposition
 on the part of senate republicans, since they won't want to over-use their
 fillibuster trump card.
