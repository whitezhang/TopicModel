 i was shocked to see that the subject of my last rely to awesley was
 "luser!"  that was certainly not my intention.  i meant to leave the
 subject line unchanged.  i believe that the nntp server i use at columbia
 must have put in that subject line in protest over problems with my header.
  that was rather rude of them, but beggars can't be choosers, i suppose.
 
 in any case, i didn't do it and i apologize to awesley for the apparent
 insult.
