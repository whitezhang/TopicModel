 no, frank crary's arguments are based on the assumption that most people
 are sane, normal people. tpg disproves this of gun owners. usenet as a whole
 disproves it of humanity as a whole.
 
 we now have proof positive that guns don't make you safer. buy a lot of
 guns and you either get shot in the no knock raid or get the fbi to burn
 down your house. see even in the paranoid mindset of tpg there are good reasons
 to support gun control.
