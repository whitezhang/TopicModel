 this is quite corect, but a bullet hitting a burned body with little energy
 will show virtually no deformation, ie a hollow point probably would not
 expand, an fmj would be "pristene".  also the bullets will not be marked
 with the lands ang grooves of a barrel, because they didn't come out of
 one.  a good pathologist should be able to notice this right away.
 
 let us hope that the  me's that handle these bodies are more competent
 then the ones who did jfk's body.
