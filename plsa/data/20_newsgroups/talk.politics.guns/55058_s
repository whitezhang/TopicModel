 subject: should anybody be permitted to own a .50 bmg rifle?
 lines: 26
 
    for the moment, forget about batf incompetence or fbi hubris.  did
 anybody catch rep. charles shumer on the news last night holding up
 a .50 bmg cartridge and rhetorically asking if anybody should be allowed
 to own one of these.  (i presume he meant the rifle for which it is chambered
 and not the cartridge which you can get for a buck.)
 
   so what's your guess for the upcoming anti-gun agenda:
 
 1.   a ban on heavy caliber rifles. (read .50 bmg)
 
 2.   a ban on "sniper rifles"
 
 3. a ban on "stockpiling" guns and ammunition.
 
 
 btw: shumer is perhaps the most misinformed congressman i have seen on
      the news. i wonder how he finds the floor in the morning.

 shumer is not mis-informed, he knows full well what he is doing.
 
 if you look at his other votes, and positions as an agent of redistribution
 of wealth & property in this country, to him guns and personal freedom 
 are incompatible with his obvious world-view. they are a threat to the
 'order' he would impose.

 "it [collectivism vs individualism] is an ancient conflict. men have come
 close to the truth, but it was destroyed each time and one civilization fell
 after another. civilization is the progress toward a society of privacy. the
 savage's whole existence is public, ruled by the laws of his tribe.
 civilization is the process of setting man free from men."
