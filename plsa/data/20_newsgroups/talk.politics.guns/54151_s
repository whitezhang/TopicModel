 phill, here in indiana, where we not only have ccws (permits to
 carry firearms), but we also have a fairly low crime rate.  at any one
 given point the occupants in my vehicles are likely to be armed.
 i've never had to use my gun, but am prepared to do so if i am
 attacked.  in essence, i'm quite prepared.  i also have, in the glove
 box, my proof of insurance, as mandated by indiana law.  so, if i got
 into an accident and had to whip out my insurance policy to prove that
 i can pay for any damages i may have caused will you "wonder why i'm
 so prepared for an accident"?  even where it not indiana law i would
 still be carrying my automobile insurance.  i also wear my seatbelt.
 does that make me bad for "preparing for an accident"?

 just how would the physically weaker survive?
