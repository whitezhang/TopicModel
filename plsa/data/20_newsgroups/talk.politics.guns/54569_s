 the following is quoted from the tail end of a (rather condescending)
 article about paxton quigley, that appeared in us snooze and world lies,
 (sorry... i think it was in the wall street journal...)
 and was repeated in the colorado (people's) daily, a student newspaper
 at the university of colorado at boulder.
 
 "a study of residential gunsot deaths in king county, wash., found that
 a gun in the home was 43 times more likely to be used to kill its owner,
 spouse, a friend, or child than to kill an intruder.  studies by the 
 western psychiatric institute, in pittsburgh, found that the mere presence
 of a gun in the home sharply incresases the likelihood a family member
 will commit suicide, even in the absence of psychiatric illness."
 
 i have seen these numbers quoted before, and i have seen very specific
 refutation of them quoted as well.  if someone will be so kind as to
 email the relevant information, i will write a letter to the editor of
 the co. daily (which might get published) and send a copy to usn&wr as
 well.
 
 thanx...
