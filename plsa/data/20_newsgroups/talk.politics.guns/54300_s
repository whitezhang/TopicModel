 flame on!!
 
 is this guy serious????
 
 if he would ever really pay attention to the news (oops i forgot that the media
    for the most part loves to jump right on top of a story before all the facts 
    are known, as well as to manipulate what we see and thus what we believe). 
    any ways one of koresh's devoted followers that did i repeat did survive this
    "genocidal mass-slaughter of innocent people".  besides there are nine 
    survivors in the burn-unit of the local hospital and was reported that david
    was in one of the towers when the shit hit the fan.  besides, a majority of 
    these children were children that he was supposed to have been the father of,
    this then makes them bastard children to a sacraligious zeloit (sp).  also
    someone should have told david and his followers that if they can't the heat
    then they should stay out of the kitchen!! (pun intended)
 
 flame off
 
 " aaah daniaalson yah wanna fight,  fight me!!"
