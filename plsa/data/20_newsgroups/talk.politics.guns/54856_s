   if they had been quiet there would have been no deaths??  i thought thier
 neighbors said that the davidians never bothered them.  oh, well, that couldn't
 have been your point, then.  
 
   if they hadn't been stockpiling weapons, then the atf wouldn't have felt 
 threatened and had to move in.  here's a newsflash:  it isn't illegal to
 own more than one firearm.  it isn't even illegal to own *lots* of firearms.
  
   they shot federales?  the feds shot them, too.  
 
   how about that staying inside thing?  here's another newsflash:  sometimes
 the government does nasty things to you that you don't deserve.  since
 they were so nice to the davidians the first time round, i can see why
 the davidians didn't surrender so easily, especially because they were
 expecting the end of the world.
