   koresh had a lawyer, deguin(?) who he spoke to in person several times during

   this strikes me as a tad ingenous.  "if x had done/note done y, then z would
 never have happened."  i tend to place tha responsibility on the group/person
 actually committing the act, not on those whon "forced them to do it".
 
   after all, to take an extreme example, if the british were not in northern
 ireland, the ira would not be forced to place bombs in shopping centers.
 
   that said, this whole sorry story was a totally unecessary, utterly fucked
 up mess from the get go.
