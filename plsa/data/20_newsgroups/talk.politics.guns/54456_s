 did they or did they not sustain miller's conviction? i don't have the
 text of the case handy. 
 
 yes, shotguns had been used in wwi, the spanish-american war, and the

 you are free to produce evidence that i'm not willing to abide with
 all the implications of this. 
 
 just because i don't whole-heartedly endorse the nra position does not
 mean that i oppose the rkba. this attitude is what makes the nra
 unpopular.
