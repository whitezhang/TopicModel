 people are sucking up to the government when they decide that only the
 things the government says are plausible.  especially if they refuse to
 consider reasonable alternatives.
 
 however, from what i saw plastered all over the tv news last night, it's
 no longer necessary to be an "independent thinker" to depart from the
 government's party line.  it looks like our "independent press" may 
 actually be starting to be earn its clothes allowance.  this, to me, is
 a good sign.  i hope it continues.

 independent thinkers question authority.  in a situation where only one
 set of facts are being presented, "coming to a conclusion" is not the 
 hallmark of an independent thinker unless it's coupled with the ability
 to challenge those "facts" critically.  the scientific method consists
 of more than choosing the popular hypothesis; it's even more than choosing
 between two hypotheses that other people have proposed.
