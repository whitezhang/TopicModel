 hb 1776 is for concealed carry in texas.  it provides for licensing
 citizens to carry concealed firearms if they pass an instruction
 course (30 hours, if i remember correctly), pay a $140 fee (good for
 4 years), and meet several other criteria related to personal
 character, etc.
 
 while i don't agree with all of the criteria, i feel it's high time
 that pro-gun types fight the same way hci et al. do -- by getting
 incremental changes in the law.
