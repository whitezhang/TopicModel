 seeing as how people are willing to quote the fbi quoting cultists
 who just yesterday were deranged and not to be trusted (hmm the fbi
 or the cultists...) i think i'll quote the bbc quoting (actually voice
 interview) one of the two british survivors. he claimed that the fire
 started when the tanks caused an internal wooden wall/roof to collapse
 knocking over kerosene lamps and that they had no suicide plan.
 
 maybe true, partly true, or false.
