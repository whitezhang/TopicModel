 i'm not a lawyer but to the best of my understanding, the congress has no
 more rights than what is enumerated in the constitution.  that is the 
 prime reason why the national firearms act is based on collecting revenue.
 since the congress has the authority to levy taxes, the nfa is a tax act and
 the registration requirement within it is to assist in that tax collection.
 u.s.c 922, in order to be constitutional, must have a basis on a particular
 authority granted to the congress by the constitution.  congress can not
 arbitrarily ban a substance or product.  that is why prohibition came into
 effect, only by passing an ammendment.   what you said about constitutionality
 of law needs to be clarified.  i believe that an unconstitutional law was 
 never constitutional.  when a law is determined by the supreme court, to be
 unconstitutional, that law was never really a law.  the very nature of the law
 being unconstitutional invalidates the law at it's inception.  please correct
 me if i'm wrong, but when a law is deemed to be unconstitutional, anyone
 convicted of breaking that law is absolved.
    i don't believe u.s.c 922 has ever been challenged in court.  nfa has been
 invalidated in two federal district court cases( one may have been appellate
 level{ u.s. vs rock island armory  and u.s. vs dalton}).
