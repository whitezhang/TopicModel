 is this a joke?  the legal way to serve a search warrant is to knock on
 the door.  tossing in a grenade to serve a search warrant violates the
 us constitution and is hence, illegal.  the bd complied with legal
 search warrants in the past.  i do not understand why the batf used an
 illegal means to serve their search warrant last february.
