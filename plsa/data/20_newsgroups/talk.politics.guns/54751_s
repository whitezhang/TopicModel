 funny, the medical examiner today stated that there was no
 evidence one way or another that there were bullet wounds --
 not a single autopsy has been performed, so all reports are
 deemed speculative.  including reports that there were no
 bullet wounds.

 before long, i think all the kneejerk conspiracy theorists
 are going to start getting pretty pissed off at how easily
 they mislead themselves.  also, pretty disappointed at
 being ignored by the coutnry.
