 i was under the impression that to obtain fissionable materials (i.e.,
 plutonium or reactor/weapons-grade uranium) one was required to obtain
 a federal permit to own such materials.

 actually, why bother looking it up?  from the material we covered last
 term (in 10 weeks) of ge/ch 127 (nuclear chemistry), i could *derive*
 what it would take to build a bomb.  and as far as the explosive charge,
 i (as a chemist) could synthesize a variety of explosives from commonly
 available chemicals in the garage if i felt like.  the electronics 
 behind the detonator and the shaped charges are a little trickier,
 however . . . but not impossible using a few "tricks of the trade."
 and if i really wanted to be nasty, i could include a core of 
 hydrogen and deuterium . . .
 
 of course, the hardest part is getting the fissionable material
 to start with, and living long enough to put a bomb together. 
 (plutonium has some *nasty* properties . . .)
