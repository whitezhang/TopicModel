 i don't think your objection is beyond the bounds of rationality.  the
 right mentioned in the bill is already established under the second
 amendment; the bill should be reworded to reaffirm the second amendment
 rkba, and then establish the procedures for redress through the federal
 court system.
 
 the right already exists and is already embodied in our constitution.
