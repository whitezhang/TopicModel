 they do. according the the los angeles police department, illegal
 manufacture is one the three primary sources of machine guns and
 submachine guns used in crimes (sumggling and theft from the
 police and military being the other two.) washington d.c. police
 have stated that 40% (if i'm remembering the figure correctly) of
 the guns they conficate were illegally built.

 it takes about 6 hours and a few tools to make one (at least one
 of reasonable quality). unless the drug dealer enjoyes messing
 around on a lathe (say, as a hobby), he's going to have to 
 pay someone anyway. materials plus six hours of a machinist's
 time for something legal would run about $100. the blackmarket
 prices for guns are usually in the $50 to $200 range (at least
 those few i've seen cited in newspaper articles were...)

 washington d.c. has a total ban on handguns and prohibits assembled
 rifles within city limits. it's homicide rate is almost ten
 times the national average. it is also illegal for a d.c.
 resident to drive to the virginia or maryland suburbs and
 buy a gun (dealers are required by federal law to check ids
 and make sure the buyer isn't from another state) so the ban 
 can not be easily side-stepped.

 sure. but it you couldn't buy one, you would write your own (in
 fact, people _did_ write their own 15 years ago...) more likely,
 you would find a friend who was a particularly good programer
 and get him give you a copy of his. software is a _very_ bad
 example for your case: how many people do you know with illegal
 copies of $400 word processors? if people want something, and
 it isn't available (or affordable) legally, they will usually
 get it illegally.

 13-3-2. the formula has been around for half a million years.
 or are you going to restrict sales of sulpher, charcoal and
 saltpeter? that's alot cruder than modern smokless powder, but
 it works very well. the only real problems are a ~25% reduction
 in energy (so a .357 magnum would "only" be as deadly as a 9mm)
 and it makes alot more smoke... of course, a smart black marketeer
 could just make the gun in 9mm and steal the ammunition from the
 police (the police are often corruptable, and things are known
 to disappear from police evidence rooms and armories and
 reappear on the streets...)

 perhaps you weren't watching the news two years ago, but the serbs 
 also tried to invade slovinia. they were driven out after a few
 weeks by partisans armed with home-made _anti-tank_ weapons.
 the afghan rebels frequently made their own rifles.
