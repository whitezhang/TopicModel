        here's a question:  if most marijuana is domestic and
 producing it here is economical, why would we expect it to be
 imported?

        yet it was done.  done quite successfully for a number of years.
 *somebody* thought it was worth the risk.

        your assumption is that this "low" dollar/pound area is
 sufficiently low as to make gun-running unprofitable.  on what
 do you base this?  
 
        and given that smuggling channels are already established,
 and given the economies of scale, would it really add significantly
 more expense to start smuggling firearms, especially considering
 doing so would be less hazardous (in terms of getting caught) than
 drugs?

        now *that* was a jump.  in any case, define "local."  it's
 a big country.

        wow, you gotta love the speculation.
 
        as i posted before, we import billions upon billions of raw
 ores across the mexican border.  not only that but ships come in and
 out of u.s. harbors every day full stuff.  and customs doesn't even
 have the extra advantage of being able to sniff them out.  
 
        i'd be willing to wager that a shipload of handguns would be
 worth more than a shipload of raw ore, *and* you're virtually guaranteed
 to get it past customs, because they'd have to hand search every hold of
 every ship which came through.
 
        it's not simply a matter of how much money are they worth, but how
 much *more* money are they worth than other goods, based on the likelihood
 of being caught.  less money than drugs, but also a safer thing to smuggle.
