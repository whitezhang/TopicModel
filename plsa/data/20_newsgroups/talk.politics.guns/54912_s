 
 just saw a new commercial(?) by the nra. it starts out with a 
 bunch of politicians talking about how to get rid of crime.
 they finally realize that they need to put criminals away
 longer but there isn't enough jail space so they decide on another gun
 law.( during this whole seen there quoteing various statistics on how
 easy criminals get off ) 
 in the next seen the politician is announceing on tv how this gun law 
 will get rid of crime and there is this grungy looking guy (criminal)
 watching him on tv just laughing his ass off.
 classic.
