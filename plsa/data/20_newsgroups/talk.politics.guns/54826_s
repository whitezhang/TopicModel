 the batf is a part of the dept. of treasury, not justice.  if they needed
 to assault a place they could just do like the irs does...call in the
 federal marshalls service, their fugitive collection teams do similar type
 assaults all the time.  and they are very, very good about it, in both the
 tactical and legal parts of it.  but i suspect that the marshalls would
 not have touched it, because the search warrant (which is still sealed i
 believe) was so bogus.  
 
 besides the batf also could have gotton swat teams from: federal marshalls
 service; fbi; secret service; national park service; texas rangers; nearby
 large city police forces; the military.  but they had to use their own
 guys, nobody elses swat team was good enough for the holy cause of gun
 control.   
 
 	i also find the timing of the raid to be extremely interesting. 
 initial raid: two days before the nj senate was going to overturn their
 "assault weapon" confiscation law; a couple weeks before the batf's budget
 was going to come up in congress for review;  shortly after reno got
 confirmed as ag (i don't need to remind you about her anti-gun line);
 right around the presidents 100th day in office.   as a wise man once
 said: once is happenstance, twice is coincidence, three times is enemy
 action.    i don't believe that these four things are conincidental.  do
 you?  
 
 
 food for thought...
