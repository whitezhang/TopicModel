 saying "hopefully the effect of policy x will be y" is *much* different
 from saying "hopefully if there is any effect of policy x it will be y."
 here you've made both statements.
 if the former describes a reasonably-likely outcome of policy x, then
 perhaps policy x is worthy of consideration - but the latter statement
 is not something to base policy decisions on!

 according to groups like the center to prevent handgun violence (formerly
 the national coalition to ban handguns - interesting name change, don't you
 think?) who include murder and suicide by firearms in the "leading causes of
 unintentional death) figures but *don't* include murder and suicide by other
 means as causes of unintentional death.  can't you see past the bullshit?

 certainly accidental deaths by any cause are serious things - but the
 anti-gun groups insist over and over again that accidental death by
 firearms is a *stastically serious problem*, and even if you don't use
 these deaths as a justification for gun control, these groups do.  i'm
 sorry if i jumped to conclusions about your reason for mentioning
 accidental deaths due to firearms being something that warranted concern,
 but in light of your statement that you are a staunch supporter of gun
 control measures, i think the conclusion was a reasonable one.
 the fact remains that tragic though individual accidental gun deaths may
 be, they are *not* a serious problem statistically speaking.

 sorry if it wasn't clear to me.  i thought you were waffling on your view
 of buyback programs with the talk of symbolic offerings and hopefully
 preventing accidents and heat-of-passion shootings.  i have to disagree on
 all these counts; i can't understand how a buying guns from people who
 aren't intending to misuse them (obviously those who want to use guns to
 commit crimes aren't going to turn them in) could be construed as a
 positive way for police to respond to "interpersonal violence."

 what, the people who publish figures saying that as many children commit
 suicide by handguns alone each year as the fbi says commit suicide by all
 methods per year?  who do you think i should believe?  the people who call
 everyone up to age 24 "children" when they're screaming about the "carnage
 of our nation's children" being caused by handguns?
 
 >or the centers for disease control.
 
 ah, yes, the agency that considers accidental shootings of children to be
 such a statistical problem that a stated objective in the healthy people
 2000 document is to "enact laws in 50 states requiring manufacturers of
 handguns to make the handguns more difficult to fire, minimizing the
 likelihood of accidental or intentional dscharge by children?"  the
 agency that funded the "study" of dc which pronounced that the dc gun ban
 had saved x lives (yes, they actually gave us a number) on the basis of
 a look at the *number* of shootings rather than the *rate* of shootings?
 it wasn't their fault that the population of dc dropped in their "post law"
 period...

 okay, i'll concede i no longer have the numbers i once read on these.  i'll
 retract my dispute of your numbers.  however, i would be greatly interested
 in seeing how cphv and cdc came up with these numbers.

 what's this got to do with anything?  hell, when *i* was in elementary
 school i came home to an empty house with guns in it.  why is this a
 problem?  i didn't touch the guns - i had been taught not to.  i had also
 been taught not to mess with the gasoline in the garage, the fuse box, the
 car, the knives, the oven, and the tools.  the problem is not the guns,
 it's the parents!!!

 and what are these states doing with the kids they find with guns?
 nothing.  no criminal prosecution, no expulsion, in most cases not even
 suspension.  they take the gun, slap the kids on the wrist, say "ain't it
 awful," and go on as if everything's back to normal.  what's wrong with
 this picture?

 i don't think koresh was the messiah, either... but isn't it obvious that
 if he believed the forces of evil were come to destroy him, then he
 believed the children were much safer inside the compound?  i didn't say
 he was sane... just that he behaved in a pretty rational manner given what
 he thought was going on.  he thought he had them in the one place where
 harm *wouldn't* come to them.

 let's see *you* try to find the exits, unbarricade them, and flee a fire
 when you've been kept awake for most of 50 days by loudspeakers and subjected
 to six hours of tanks knocking in your walls and tear gas assault.
