 i thought that the clipper chip that was posted to t.p.g (sorry, i lost
 the original post) was a joke.  i really did.  i didn't believe it for
 a second.  but on the way to work this morning, i heard about it on npr.
 
 this scares me almost as much as the doublespeak emanating from the
 fbi and batf in waco.
