 excuse me, but if you really new what the show was about, you'd know that he
 doesn't just say vagina and penis and that is how he get's his ratings. he
 also addresss real issues as well as being outrageous. i don't hear any of these
 other idiots doing a funny show and getting into some serious topics at the
 same time, he get's people to think and entertains them at the same time, 
 so try listening to his show a little closer before you tell them that they are
 wrong, and by the way, if he is such a flash in the pan, why do his ratings sustain
 so well? hmm?
