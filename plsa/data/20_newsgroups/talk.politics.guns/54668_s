      i heartily agree.  now that the batf warrant has been 
      unsealed, it is clear that clinton and reno supported an
      illegal raid.  did they not know this?
 
 
 
      no authority for a 'no-knock" raid
      no authority to use helicopters.
      no authority to search for a "drug lab"
 
     and, apparently, not even any authority to search for "automatic
     weapons".
 
      51 days of government lies.
