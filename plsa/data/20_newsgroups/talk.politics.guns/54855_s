 what if.......
 
 what if the fbi thought that tear gas would force the davidians out;
 at least the mothers and the children, so they (the fbi) did not
 bother to think about the effect of tear gas on young children......
 
 what if the fbi knew they killed several of the children by using
 tear gas......(let`s assume the fbi knew via their listening devices)
 
 what if the fbi saw fire accidently break out at one end of the
 building, e.g. by an upset oil lamp.......
 
 what if the fbi thought they could finally force the rest of the
 davidians out and also destroy the evidence that they (the fbi) had
 killed the children by starting a fire at the other end......
 
 what if the fbi miscalculated and not many of the rest of the davidians
 made it out.......?????
 
 answer:  what happened.
