 	i remind you of shrapnel.  i consider 5' a reasonable space
 limitation, but make no mistake a gun blowing up is a hazard to
 those nearby, say in the next lane at the range.  my point was at
 what distance, or level of threat, we draw the line.  is it the
 endangerment of others, so we do a 5' restriction, or the possibility
 of being shot, hence we draw a 1.5 mile restriction, or a nuke and
 draw a 5 mile restriction?  to me they al suffer from the fundamental
 flaw that they restrict based upon the instrument rather than placing
 the responsibility for usage squarely upon the shoulders of the user.
 perhaps sen. metzenbaum declaring the barrett light fifty an assault
 rifle has made this more apparent to me, since the barrett has
 only range and acurracy going for it.

 	i disagree, on the grounds that a house can be rebuilt much
 more easily than my family once i have died.  i assume that word
 would get to the citizens that such an attack was planned.  if this
 is not the case, the tactical and strategic implications change
 quite a bit.  personally, my home is worth, say, twenty martians
 intent on taking over the world.  my family?  all of them.  the
 balancing act here is hard to judge sitting at my desk.

 	that seems to be the case already, given that heavy
 weapons aren't commonly owned by the citizenry.  with such low
 numbers, obviously due to cost, i don't think the superior
 weapons are going to be of great effect against a numerically
 superior foe.  furthermore, it is even more doubtful their training
 includes proper tactical movements that best utilize tanks,
 whereas the commonly rifleman is not so hampered in effectiveness.

 	i had envisioned that the armorer, perhaps the officers
 of a select group, and the like would exercise control over the
 heavier, more complex weapons.  but, if joe bob owns an old sherman
 tank i certainly wouldn't ask him to give it up.  follow orders
 from the officers, yes.  since the expense of a tank is so large,
 though, chances are it would be jointly purchased and should
 therefore be jointly maintained and operated.

 	this i'll agree with to a point.  the state having control
 over the heavy weapons should not be justification for the state
 to have them centrally located.  keep them spread out, such that
 the ability of the state to lock them up isn't so easy.  otherwise,
 i would have to assume that state control would rest on the
 authority of the governor and militia officers.

 	i'm having a hard time seeing how these heavy weapons,
 fairly few in numbers, could not be easily wielded by a few
 people with government support.  just as you argued above that
 the weapons should be divvied up and under democratic control
 so one side doesn't have all of them, i can't see where this
 situation is alleviated in having the select militia holding
 all the weapons and the unorganized militia being the infantry.
 i think a better mix is called for.  but, i would argue that
 the federal army should rely upon the select militia and the
 unorganized militia for the bulk of its infantry units.

 	we have to assume that there would be those who would
 side with the government-controlled forces, and if they've all
 the equipment an infantry force 3x the size would be in trouble.
 i'd like to see that heavy stuff, say tanks, offset by the
 local troups having a few 105's and anti-tank weapons in their
 armory.  these would be much more useful to infantry than the
 tank would be when cost and training requirements are figured in.
 i suppose i'm quibbling over what constitutes heavy equipment.

 	so would i, but the resources often aren't available to
 outfit local units well enough.  thus, we will certainly have to
 call in others, and a mechanized unit carries more stuff faster
 than anything else.

 	perhaps our ideas of heavy weapons are different?  i think
 main battle tanks, self-propelled artillery, and 155mm and up
 field pieces are heavy stuff.  m113 troop carriers, 2 1/2 ton
 trucks, humvee's, old m60 tanks, 105 howitzers, are more the stuff
 of a mechanized infantry.  actually, this is what the guard units
 in iowa are currently fielding in some units.
 
 	perhaps it is just my innate fear of having the real heavy
 equipment under state control, with little but numbers and light
 stuff to act as a deterrent.  allowing main battle tanks to the
 states should be balanced with anti-tank capability in the local
 ranks.  similarly, local units would need to band together quickly,
 hence small and fast response means mechanized infantry.  finally,
 the militia is more than just fighting.  equipment is needed for
 other responses.  the federal army, i'm convinced, should have a
 very minumum of infantry, relying on the state and local militias
 for these functions.
