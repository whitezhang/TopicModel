 	for the record, it wasn't until i came to college (excluding
 the times i went to omaha or council bluffs for something) that i
 ever removed the keys from the ignition of my car!  come to think of
 it, it was only after i moved to ames, ia (pop 45k) that i ever took
 to locking my doors at night.
 
 	i've discovered that $50k/year isn't worth living in fear
 all day.  i might just move back to the farm.
 
 	this weekend is veishea.  you know, when isu students riot
 for no apparent reason.  this year, we've the farm aid concert
 to add to the festivities.  anybody bet me there's another riot?
 remember, iowa law has three guys talking loud defined as a riot.
 stay tuned for an on-the-scene report this weekend.
