 i've already corrected my mistake earlier in this thread.  i saw a brief 
 news report which led to the above inaccuracy.  i have since seen detailed 
 summaries that show the tanks returned in the late morning.
 
 so, why didn't the bd's leave when the gas was first introduced much 
 earlier in the morning?  didn't they care about the children?
 
 why didn't they release the children weeks ago?
