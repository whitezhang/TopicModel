 our new attorney general seems determined to do so. in the past
 few days she has said:
 
 	she hopes the king beating will not reduce public confidince
 	in law enforcement.
 
 	the tactics of using tear gas and driving tanks through
 	walls in waco were intended to further a "peacefull solution"
 	to the crisis.
 
 	those same tactics were intended to prevent a mass suicide,
 	but she never expected the sect to react by killing themselves.
 
 it's comforting to know, at least, that she wasn't clinton's first
 choice...
