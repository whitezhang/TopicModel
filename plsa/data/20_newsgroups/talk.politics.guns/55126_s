 speaking of me's. the fbi said the fire victims were found face-up
 <fire victims, apparently, are usually found face down> 
 suggesting they died prior to the fire. the me says, in a word,
 bullshit, the victims were face down. the fbi says they sent a body
 of a victim that was shot, supposedly by bd guards, the me
 says, in a word, bullshit, the body showed no evidence of gunshot
 wounds. can the atf/fbi tell the difference between cya and truth?
