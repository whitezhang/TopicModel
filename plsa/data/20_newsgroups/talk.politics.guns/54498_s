 this is really stupid nitpicking.  capitalization rules in the late 18th
 century were quite different from today, and what was posted matches current
 capitalization rules.
 
 we also don't make 's' look like 'f' and other such things done in the late
 seventeen hundreds.
 
 in the original constitution, "militia", "arms", etc. were capitalized simply
 because they were nouns.  this is also done currently in german.  there is
 no special significance to these words simply because they are capitalized.
 the capitalization denotes no special emphasis.

 you are the pioneer type and hold most people in contempt.  you are
 quick tempered, impatient, and scornful of advice.  you are not very
 nice.
