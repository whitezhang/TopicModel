 [moderator:  nice summary, keith, thanks.]
 
 i talked to the federal dept. of justice (doj, ottawa) to try and
 clarify a bunch of things regarding changes to canadian gun laws.
 i am posting here for informational purposes; questions to email,
 followup to t.p.g.
 
 1. it is still technically feasible (but almost impossible) to get
    a concealed carry permit in canada.  this is contrary to what i
    was told by a police officer.
 2. it is still legal to use lethal force (such as a firearm) to
    protect life, also contrary to what the officer told me.  guns
    must be stored locked up and unloaded, however.
 3. regarding hi-capacity magazines, it is still not clear who will
    be exempt or how this will be managed.  this is up to each province.
    the general idea is that exempt persons will receive a letter/form
    authorizing them to possess the high capacity magazines.  
    apparently, the authorization is to specify how many of these
    'prohibited weapons' you will be allowed to possess.  dealers will
    be allowed to order high capacity mags for those allowed to possess
    them, but will not be allowed to stock them.
 4. high capacity magazines converted to comply with the new limits will
    not be considered prohibited weapons.  amendments to the regulations
    specify some possible methods to alter the magazines.  some 
    manufacturers (beretta) will be marketing reduced capacity magazines.
    (god knows how much they'll charge for these)
 
 this covers most of what we discussed.  i have typed this from memory,
 do not take it as gospel.  i am not a lawyer and i refuse to play one on tv.
