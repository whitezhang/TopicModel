 on a da revolver, you get another try on a misfire.  on a pistol where
 the trigger does not cock the hammer, like a jennings, or an astra m400,
 or a glock, a misfire requires the slide be cycled to get the gun  to
 function.
 
 rather than a high capacity revolver, think of a glock as an astra m400 
 with no manual safety and a heavier trigger pull.
