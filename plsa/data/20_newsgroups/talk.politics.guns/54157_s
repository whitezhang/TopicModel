 that's nice, but it doesn't answer the question.  there is a difference
 between "the feds can mandate literacy" and "the feds can't interfere
 with literacy/book possession".

 actually, the miller court did nothing of the kind.  it remanded
 the case back to the trial court because the miller court didn't
 know if the weapon in question was a militia weapon.  (doesn't it
 bother anyone that a major constitutional issue was taken up in
 a case where there was no defense?  miller had been released by
 the appeals court and disappeared - only the govt was represented.)
 
 we don't know what would have happened with the reasonable "all guns
 are militia weapons" argument.
