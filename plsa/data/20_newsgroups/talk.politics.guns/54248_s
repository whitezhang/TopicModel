 when does carrying a tool classify someone as a rambo.  so all the
 pioneers that came west were rambo's?  adrienne!!!  :-)

 would your tune change if you were one of the "dozen or two bear attacks"?
 believe me, when you need a firearm, you need a firearm.

 please cite your references.   i'll let others (please note followup)
 cite valid references to show you that this is an untruth.

 well, you might as well go naked.  forget the matches, backpack, sleeping
 bag and all the rest that's is a modern convenience.  a firearm is just
 a tool.  as some people won't carry gaiters, some people do.  firearms
 should be in the same category.  it should be a personal choice.
 
 and your factoid about shooting victims in the er.  count how many come in
 due to automobile accidents and automobile crimes.  maybe we should outlaw
 cars.
