 with one exception, that's a pretty good description of many of the
 baptists i know.  the exception is that they know the difference
 between an m-16 and an ar-15.  heck - they even know that "it looks
 like richard petty's stock car" doesn't mean "it's a racing stock
 car".  they may be uncouth, but they've figured out that appearance
 isn't function.
