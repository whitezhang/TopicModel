 and everybody who talked about the evil arising in europe was labeled 
 reactionary in the late 1930's... after all, we could negotiate with hitler and
 trust him to keep his end of the bargain... at least that's what stalin and
 chamberlin thought... i guess they forgot to teach you about your country being
 overrun by the germans in wwii, 'eh thomas?  and i'm sorry you consider outrage
 at government excesses to be ####... everytime the israelis conduct a mass 
 operation against a terrorist group that is actively killing their citizens and
 soldiers, the world gets indignant, but it's ok for the us to assault it's own
 citizens who were a religous minority and accused of sexual deviation and 
 hoarding weapons... i find it real ironic this happened the same day al gore
 arrived in poland to recognize the sacrifices made in the warsaw ghetto where
 the same 'justifications' were raised for an armed assault by black-clad troops
 with armor support...
