 some of the footage shown on "street stories" the other night 
 showed an atf agent screaming at the cameraman to "get that 
 camera out of here" while they were in retreat from the "compound".
 i think the same person may have also said to "turn the camera off".
 anyway, it was clear from the comments that the safety of the
 cameraman wasn't their paramount concern.
