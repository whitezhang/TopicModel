 no joke.  here's another copy for you to save.  npr, hmmm?  did they
 mention the part about "the fact of law enforcement access to the
 escrowed keys will not be concealed from the american public." ...?

 >> 
 >> installation of government-developed microcircuits
 >> 
 >> the attorney general of the united states, or her representative,
