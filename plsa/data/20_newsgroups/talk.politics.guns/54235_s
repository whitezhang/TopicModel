 are you sure about this? i'm currently looking at a copy of last 
 thursday's sf chronicle and there is the typical one column traders
 ad on page c7 in the sports section. not only that, but there is
 a part in the middle which rather prominently says "wanted: we pay
 cash for assault rifles and pistols.". granted, i haven't seen today's
 paper yet. but i'd be surprised if there wasn't a traders ad in it.
 it's probably worth it to write to the chronicle (and other papers)
 anyway, because all their anti-gun editorials are disgusting.
 
 by the way, let me put in a plug for traders. i have shopped all
 over the sf bay area and i have never seen another store with lower
 prices. and their selection is amazing.
