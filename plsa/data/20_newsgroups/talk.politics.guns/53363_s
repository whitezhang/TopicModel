 even a simpleton knows a baseball bat is considered a deadly weapon. 
 if one cannot run away (e.g. old, infirm, even middle-aged if the
 assailant is younger), a handgun is the most effective means of
 defense. you won't even have to fire a shot 98% of the time.

 any real streetfighter (and there are lots of them), with or without a
 knife, will kick the living sh** out of most people "trained in
 unarmed self defense".  for the majority of people, a gun is the most
 effective form of self defense.
