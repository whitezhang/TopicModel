 
 article in this morning's houston post...."negotiators send food to
 rebellious inmates as humanitarian gesture"...speaking about the ohio prison
 riot where they have killed at least one of the hostage guards.
 
 i know it's not the same "group" but the mindset appears to be common to
 "those what rule" here lately....they won't give diddley to the bd's in waco
 but they treat criminals as deserving of "humanitarian gestures".
 
 this is but another indicator that the criminal caste seems to enjoy more
 priviliges in today's society than their victims or other law abiding
 citizens. what is it that makes the criminal so precious to the "leaders of
 the system"?
 
 could it be that the criminal is one of the "tools" the "authorities" are
 using to "excuse" some of the rights negation they are trying to foist upon
 the law abiding citizen in the name of crime control....don't solve the crime
 problem because then the citizen couldn't be held hostage to "our help".
 
 if the crime problem were solved in favor of the citizen/victim at the
 expense of the criminal none of the crap such as rico and gun banning could
 be used as excuses to work the agenda of those who would control our every
 move and thought.
