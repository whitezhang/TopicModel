        as perhaps some insight into how this sort of thing works, the
 local college newspaper had a big crusade to have the u.t. police
 release crime stats.  (the school claimed that to do so would violate
 federal education records privacy laws).  they swore up and down they
 weren't interested in student discipline records, only for stats so people
 could make an evaluation of how safe the campus was.
 
        it was barely a week after crime stats were released before the
 daily beacon had an editorial calling for student disciplinary stats
 to be released, because they complained certain segments of the campus
 population were treated administratively rather than turned over to the
 police and therefore the criminal states weren't accurate.
 
        what people say they want public today may not be what they
 say tomorrow.
