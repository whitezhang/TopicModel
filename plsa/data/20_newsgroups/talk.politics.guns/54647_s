 we've heard a lot of talk about brainwashing in waco but the brainwashing
 of the general population never ceases to amaze me. here is an
 example of action being taken which results in the worst possible
 outcome and despite people's deep intuition telling them something
 is wrong the programming will still cut in and say that the
 agents probably acted in good faith. no they didn't. they either did
 not have enough information to act in good faith or else they acted
 knowing the risk. sums up human stupidity all over and one of these
 days it will destroy the fucking planet: "oh sorry. didn't think they
 would respond by launching a strike. all our best calculations told
 us they were bluffing."
