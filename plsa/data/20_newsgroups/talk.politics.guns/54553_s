 note that this doesn't affect all concealed carry.  (look after the
 word "except".)  it always helps to read the law before commenting on
 it.
 
 would a prudent storekeeper carry concealed?  how about someone at
 home?  note that both are legal, and a lot of "common" people qualify
 for one or the other.
