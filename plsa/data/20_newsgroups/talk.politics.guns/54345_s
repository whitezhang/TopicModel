                                            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 i watched the cnn report and i never heard them report that the atf started the
 fire.  they did speculate that the type of cs gas might have _accidentaly_
 started the fire.

                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 from my understanding of the cnn report it was 6 hours after they started.

               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 the track vehicle that i saw in the vicinity of the building where fire was 
 first noticed looked more like an armored recovery vehicle (the type used to 
 tow tanks of battle fields) and not an armored flame-thrower vehicle.

                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 as someone else has pointed out, why would the stove be in use on a warm day  
 in texas.  it seems to me that it would be very poor planing to hope for a wood
 stove to ignite the "napalm" when the stove would probably not be in use.  and 
 i doubt that it would have taken 6 hours to ignite it.

 in short mr. gorman (i am assuming mr. as a title because i don't think a woman
 would be stupid enough to make this post) i don't know what episode of cnn you
 were watching but it obviously was not the same one that i was watching or your
 tears seamed to have blured your hearing along with your eye sight.
 
 please excuse any mispelled words as i am a product of the arkansas education
 system which slick willie of the "double bubba ticket" has so greately improved
 during his tenour as governer of my great state (taking it from 49th in the 
 nation in 1980 and allowing it to drop to 51st, how i don't know, and bringing
 it to 44st and back to either 48th or 49th in 1990--sorry i can't rember the 
 source of these numbers but they can be found).
