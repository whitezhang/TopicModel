 by this, do you mean that you consider it absolutely impossible for the
 media to be guilty of hypocrisy?
 
 note that the film industry in california traded their political support
 for an "assault weapon" ban in the state for an amendment to the bill
 exempting the entertainment industry from that very ban.
 
 note that the very issue of the batman comic book ("seduction of the gun")
 that was produced as a tool for gun-control organizations carries a back-
 page ad for a "terminator ii" video game extolling the numerous and
 varied sophisticated weapons available to the player.
 
 note that arthur ochs sulzberger, publisher of the ny times -- one of the
 oldest and most incessant gun-control grinders -- himself carries a
 concealed handgun.
 
 still, you find it completely incredible that these folks live by the 
 aphorism, "do as i say, and not as i do."
