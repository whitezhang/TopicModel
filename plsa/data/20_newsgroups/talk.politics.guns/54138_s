  any projectile traveling at or near typical bullet speeds is potentially
 lethal.  even blanks [which have no projectile] can cause death if the
 muzzle is in close proximity to the victim.  i have heard of rubber or
 plastic bullets being used effectively during riot situations [where the
 intent is crowd control, rather than close range self defense]; i've also
 seen reports of deaths caused by them [the british in northern ireland].
  use of a firearm for self defense is appropriate and lawful only in the
 gravest of situations; at that point, i consider deadly [lethal] force to 
 be a proper reaction [and so does the law].  
  furthermore, use of less effective [but still potentially lethal] force
 has its own set of problems.  it may well take more applications of the
 less effective force to stop the incident; this places all parties at some
 risk; the victim because the attack has not stopped, and the assailent 
 since the aggregate damage done by the multiple applications may well be
 more deadly.
