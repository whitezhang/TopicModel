 the number bounces between 2% and 18%, depending on the study quoted and
 the type of gun being studied.

 a recent batf study (titled "protecting america, yes") surveyed 471 career 
 criminals and found that only 7% of guns used in violent crimes were
 purchased from retail dealers.

 (1) legitimate firearms retailers play only a minor role as direct
     sources of handguns for adult felony offenders.
 
 only about one-sixth of the gun-owning felons obtained their most
 recent handguns through a customary retail transaction involving a
 licensed firearms dealer.  the remainder -- five out of six --
 obtained them via informal, off-the-record transactions involving
 friends and associates, family members, and various black market
 outlets.  the means of acquisition from these informal sources
 included cash purchase, swaps and trades, borrowing and renting, and
 often theft.  the criminal handgun market is overwhelmingly dominated
 by informal transactions and theft as mechanisms of supply.

               why gun waiting periods threaten public safety
                              by david b. kopel
 
      the basic problem with waiting periods is shown by a bureau of alcohol,
 tobacco and firearms study of gun dealer sales in des moines and greenville.
 the study found that about one to two percent of sales were to dangerous
 criminals.[51]  in short, waiting periods have no statistically noticeable
 impact on any type of crime because only a tiny fraction of crime guns
 are purchased at retail by ineligible buyers.

 enforcement, memorandum to director, july 10, 1975 (greenville survey; of
 20,047 names submitted to fbi for record checks, 68 had felony convictions;
 of those, 41 had not been represented by counsel at their conviction or who
 committed crimes in the distant past; twenty-seven buyers were prosecuted)
 (of the 1.3% of buyers selected for prosecution, .9% had non-violent felony
 convictions, and .4% had violent convictions). bureau of alcohol, tobacco and
 firearms, assistant director for criminal enforcement, memorandum to
 director, may 8, 1975 (of 374 records checked, 39 were purchasers with felony
 records who were not appropriate for prosecution because of age or
 non-violent nature of felony; six purchasers were prosecuted).

                           the assault weapon panic:
                       political correctness" takes aim
                             at the constitution
 
                       by eric morgan and david kopel
 
      testimony before congress revealed that most "assault weapons" in the
 hands of criminals were obtained through illegal channels.{97}  the testimony
 is consistent with the national institute of justice's research findings
 based on studies of felons in state prisons. the nu study, authored by
 sociologists james d. wright and peter rossi found that only sixteen percent
 of criminals had obtained their most recent handgun from a gun store. (the
 figures included purchases by legal surrogates, rather than directly by the
 criminal.) wright and rossi, who had begun their research as firm proponents
 of gun control, concluded that no set of controls on retail purchases, and
 probably not even full scale gun prohibition, would reduce criminal use of
 guns. wright and rossi suggested that lawmakers concerned about gun crime
 directly target the black market in criminal guns, and
 leave the legitimate retail market alone.{98}   not surprisingly, wright
 believes that the consequences of current "assault weapon" legislation on
 street violence are likely to be ineffective.{99}   he warns that gun
 controls aimed at ordinary citizens are less likely to reduce the pool of
 criminal guns than to provide organized crime with lucrative new
 business.{100}
