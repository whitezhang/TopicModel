 i think this is a little extreme, i am concerned about a couple of things
 i've seen lately. it seems to me that the government is *beginning* to 
 enforce political correctness. the first king verdict was polically incorrect
 so the hell with constutitional protection from double jeopardy, try the cops
 again. the bd's are far as i can tell didn't do anything wrong. nothing that
 would justify the horrable end they were subjected too. they were simply
 polically incorrect in the extream. i can't help but wonder "who's next"
