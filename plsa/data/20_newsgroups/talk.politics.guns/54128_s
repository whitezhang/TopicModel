 all your points are very well taken and things that i haven't considered as
 i am not really familiar enough with handguns.

 hell, a glock is the last thing that should be switched to.  the only thing
 that i know about a glock is the lack of a real safety on it.  sure there is
 that little thing in the trigger but that isn't too great of a safety.

 actually i don't watch those shows :-)  and you're right (at least partially).
 i don't know much about handguns.  i'm more familiar with rifles.

 no flames here.  all your points are well taken.  guess i still have a
 lot to learn but thanks to this discussion i already am :-)  guess i
 assume too many things like more bullets are better and that sort of
 thing.  of course you know what happens when you assume ......... :-)
