 i don't know how quickly you can get a woodstove to heat up from a cold
 start, but mine takes about three hours.

 mox nix.  the bd's were prepared to provide their own heat and light,
 and were doing so for weeks while the power was out.  that means the
 compound contained containers of flammable liquids or gases (that could
 be busted by a tank intrusion), plus ignition sources, which no one can 
 tell for sure were all off at the time.

 on the contrary.  we are proposing alternate scenarios.  the people who
 are coming to wild conclusions are the feds, who are absolutely positive
 how the fire started, even though none of them were in a position to 
 see it, either (and the stories they "hear" from their prisoners changes
 hourly).
