 	no, you merely have to start working on yellowcake or else
 devise a system to get it from other sources.  btw: the doe handles
 reactor fuel, and merely leases it to reactors.  the nrc certifies these
 reactors.  the military have their own sources.  a private citizen has
 none of these official sources.

 	that's freshman-level chemistry.  big deal.  can you make it
 work?  that's phd-level physics.  big difference.

 	so you admit that there's no law that could stop you?  physics
 aside, could you make one if you had the funds and time?  the answer
 is yes.  so, do we lock you up now because of this?  surely you can
 see where the comparison with anti-gun laws comes into play here?

 	precisely why it's not as readily utilized as you seem to have
 been lead to believe.  btw: 98% u235 is far better for home-made bombs
 than trying to use plutonium.  the laws of physics make the creation of
 a device without serious manufacturing facilities very low in probability.
