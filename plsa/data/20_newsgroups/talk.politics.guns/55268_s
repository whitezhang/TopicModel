 or claims to have discovered so...  it would hardly be the first time
 they raided someone based on incorrect evidence.

 it was a "no-knock", according to the associated press report.
 here's something i found in my collection:
 
     excerpts from an article in the knoxville news-sentinel final
     edition monday, march 1, 1993 (the byline is associated press):
 
     waco, texas - fierce gun battles erupted sunday as more than 100
     law officers tried to arrest the leader of a heavily armed
     religious cult.  at least four federal agents and two cult members
     were reported killed.  [...]
 
     the gun battles began when federal agents hidden in livestock
     trailers stormed the sect's head-quarters sunday morning,
              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
     witnesses said.  the agents had warrants to search for guns and
     explosives and to arrest howell, said les stanford of the atf in
     washington.  [...]
 
     witnesses said the law officers stormed the compound's main home,
     throwing concussion grenades and screaming "come out," while three
     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
     national guard helicopters approached.  for a moment, there was no
     response.  then the shooting began. 
 
 i think "storming the sect's head-quaters" and "throwing concussion
 grenades" qualifies as a no-knock (or perhaps an illegal assault).

 probably not.  but then again, neither are you.

 and just what is "his background"?  what prior crimes had he been
 convicted of?

   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 sorry, batf are "federal tax enforcement officials".  they're not
 police, nor do they have police powers.
