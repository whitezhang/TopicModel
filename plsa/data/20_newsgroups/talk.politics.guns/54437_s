 was that your argument.  well, you didn't make it very well.  you started 
 from the questionable premise that the fire was necessarily an act of
 insanity, rather than an act of negligence or an accident.  recall, one
 survivor claims that the fire started when a tank knocked over a kerosene 
 lamp.  kind of makes arguments regarding relative sanity somewhat moot, no?

 "nice evasive maneuver, mr. chekov, but they're still on our tail."
 
 let me ask it more plainly.  which of the above complaints about david 
 koresh's religious or sexual proclivities justified an armed raid by the 
 bureau of alcohol, tobacco, and firearms?

 it's not entirely far-fetched.  nobody outside the compound would know 
 everybody inside the compound.  don't forget, the batf admits having 
 agents inside the compound, in any case.

 i'm simply being the devil's advocate.  there's reasonable doubt by the
 boatload standing in the way of anybody totally swallowing the official 
 government story on waco.
