 
 fact:  both janet reno and bill clinton have admitted responsibility,
        even grief, over the deaths in waco.
 
 fact:  regardless of who started the fire, there are more than enough
        things on tape to make a civil rights case against these two.
        cruel and unusual punishment (dying tortured rabbits on tape?)
        come to mind.  
 
 fact:  it is a federal felony to infringe civil rights under color of
        law; where death is involved, this offense carries a penalty
        of life in prison.
 
 fact:  impeachment is allowable for "high crimes and misdemeanors."
        anything that's a federal felony should qualify.
 
 conclusion:  we have no choice, if we are an honest people, but to 
              impeach mr. clinton, and remove reno from office.
