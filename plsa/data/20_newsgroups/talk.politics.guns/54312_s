 "put not your trust in princes" is the biblical proverb.  the modern
 analog is governments.  at the time of the founding of the us, the
 idea that citizens had rights above those of the government was not
 that common, but was explicit in the writings of the founders.  to a
 considerable extent, englishmen also had those rights.
 
 yes, times change, and technology changes.  the possibility of 
 a few governments enserfing all of mankind was not possible until
 quite recently.  in the feudal system, the lord was almost as
 restricted as the serfs, so having the people enserf themselves
 does not make anything better; most feudal lords, and even most
 slaveowners, did not mistreat those under them.
 
 freedom of speech and freedom of religion are under real attack now.
