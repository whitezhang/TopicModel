 i hope you realize how trivial it is to manufacture these compounds.  given
 about $10k in lab equipment and chemicals (which are commercially available)
 and given the knowledge that i have (graduating bs, ch, 1993) i could 
 synthesize enough of these compounds to make a serious dent in the population
 of several major us cities.  as also noted, the knowledge is there for
 the production of nuclear weapons.  it's not even that restricted.  the
 only thing is the expense.  
 
 now i'm not going around making these things, but it's not 'cause of any
 law; i simply don't get any marginal benefit out of killing anyone.  any
 law you enact in this respect is only going to give you the ability to 
 add a charge against someone who does make and use said weapons.  in the
 case of chemical agents, i seriously doubt that you would even know that
 someone had set up a lab until after the weapons had been used.  
 
 part of the trouble with the chemical-weapons ban treaty between the us
 and the ussr is that many of the precursors to chemical weapons such as
 gb and sarin, etc., is that they have very valid commercial uses, and 
 it is very easy to divert those precursors to chemical weapons manufacture
 without anyone knowing about it.
