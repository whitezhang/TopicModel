 	as a matter of fact, i know it.
 
 	there were several shootings recently in which the guns had
 been purchased at the baltimore gunsmith, on broadway - a favorite
 place to get cheap "popular" pieces. by "popular" i am referring to
 the kinds of guns our local youth gangs like: pistol grip shotguns,
 cheap magnums, and tec-9s.
 
 	i hate to poke a hole in your bubble, but i was referring
 to a specific gunstore, and specific incidents. any other questions?
 
 mjr.
