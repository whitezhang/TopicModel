 how we survived ww2:
 we mailed postings about things we didn't know any thing about
 to only the wrong places.
 
 i'm not trying to censor this or any newsgroup, i'm just trying to
 give some hints about other newsgroups.
 doesn't this belong to alt.conspiracy ??
 
 note!!!
 my posting was in reply to those about fbi torching the plasce after
 filling it with napalm, and arrested people dissapering.
 
 >we all know what a quisling is, right?
 obviously we don't.....
 vidkun quisling is known to be a traitor in norway, not a 'censor'.
 if i have betrayed my country (norway) bescause i implied that som of 
 you jumped to conclusions/sound a little paranoid then i think there
 is a lot of quislings in norway.......
 
 
 about waco
 it looks to me as the batf and fbi can't handle situations like this.
 the way it went reminds me of 'stun' bomb beeing dropped on a house
 in la from a helicopter. (whole block went up in flames, 5 died...)
 
 it doesn't have to be a conspiracy, maybe they just screwed up ???
 
 
 
 	this is not a .signature.
 	it's merely a computergenerated text to waste bandwith
 	and to bring down the evil internet.
