 oh, not more than a few feet, i wouldn't think.  i'm sorry if your paternal  
 grandparents died in oswiecym or aushwitz, which is easier to say than prove,  
 but if so, the lesson they paid thier lives for was wasted on you.

 you are the expert.  i often feel compelled to brag about the circumstances of  
 my grandparent's death.  8-}

 if they fired first, without announcing in a beleivable way who they were ( i  
 can pound on your door and claim to be the police, will you just lay down and  
 take it if i do?), then he could be justified in firing on the atf in  
 self-defense.
