  well i don't want my tax dollars going to that kind of philosophy. 
  maybe if the good folks you are talking about are people like you 
  than i might be inclined to accept it. what does the batf do anyway? 
  why don't we have a bureau for militant, paranoid, freedom killers 
  like yourself. people like you are more dangerous than alcohol, 
  tobacco and firearms.

  maybe we should just have nuked the whole city, i mean, what's a 
  100,000 good souls anyway?

  they will never get to fall in love, they won't see another sunrise, 
  no prom, no first date, no football, baseball no nothing.  why doesn't
