 well, may i point out that paranoia is an irrational fear, without basis
 in reality.  as we've seen here in the us, there is nothing irrational
 about it.  perhaps you folks in finland have been down on your knees
 being good little boys and girls so that the former soviet union didn't
 come across the border and stomp the snot out of you for so long that
 you just figure everybody should be so accomodating to tyranny.

 if you don't like us talking about political issues involving attacks
 on people for owning guns, don't read talk.politics.guns.

 nobody's trying to save you from anything, so butt out.  i couldn't
 care less about what somebody on the other side of the world thinks 
 about this. of course, you do have a right to an opinion...  but i've
 always figured that opinons are like hemmorhoids.  every asshole's
 got them, i just don't care about yours.
