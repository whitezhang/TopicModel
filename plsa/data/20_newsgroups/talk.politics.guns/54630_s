 is kratz claiming that he can reliably visually distinguish an m-16
 from an ar-15?  that he can see the difference between a semi-auto and
 a full-auto uzi?  that he can see the difference between the various
 versions (some full-auto, some semi-auto only) of the m-11/9?
 
 if so, i'd love to hear the details, if only because they'll demonstrate
 that kratz is blowing smoke.
 
 considering that one can design a gun so that it looks just like
 another gun, yet have very different properties, and that that's
 quite common....
 
 most kids in my neighborhood were quite young when they figured out
 that my parents car wasn't much like richard petty's, even though it
 looked just like it (except for the paint job).  things must have been
 different with kratz.
 
 >sure it's on tv but why does that make a difference?
 
 no, it doesn't, but that's irrelevant.  if visual inspection of the
 outside worked, tv would be acceptable, but since it doesn't, the fact
 that it's just as good as seeing in person doesn't mean much.
 
 -andy gave kratz a chance to back down on this in private
