 not to mention that the story was rewritten today. those two bd's who
 "admitted to starting the fire", forget 'em, they don't exist anyone.
 today, "a few saw someone starting a fire" and "our aerial surveillance
 showed them starting fires" at this morning's press conference. 
 tomorrow, even this excuse may evaporate. a reporter pointed out
 that a bd being brought to arraingement shouted that tanks knocking
 over lanterns started the fire. curiouser and curiouser.
