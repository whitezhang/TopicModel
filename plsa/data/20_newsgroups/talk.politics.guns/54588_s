 since neither side would be particularly interested in telling the truth,
 you have to weigh the 'facts' given by each yourself, and weigh it with
 the newsreporting if you care.
 
 many cult members will probably side with the attorney, and if he
 is lying, change their stories to match his.  and if the feds also
 lie, the cult members who become disillusioned will change their
 stories to match the feds.  
 
 neither sides are interested in the truth.  the media is more interested,
 but usually either don't have the time to get it straight or tie themselves
 to the ratings and deliberately distort.  
 
 for me, though, the black soot billowing outside the compound added with
 how fast the fire spread ponted to *someone* dousing large parts of the
 compound with some sort of gasoline or fire-starter.  i doubt the feds
 did that as they were more interested in arresting vernon.  the real
 unbalanced one (at least the one that lost his cool) was vernon, so
 i figured that he was more likely to do it (after all he was jesus 
 being persecuted by the authorities, and had followers to hold onto,
 so made the decision.  he and his followers also probably felt that they
 were rocketing to heaven by doing this stuff).  thsi conclusion, i came
 to after umpteen million hours of listening to npr and other radio
 shows (i always have the radio going when i am in my office on some
 innocuous talk-show or news program as background noise).
