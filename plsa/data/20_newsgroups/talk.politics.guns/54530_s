 
 today's atrocity in waco has finally impelled me to start working on
 something i've been thinking about for some time.  over the last few
 years i have heard of one case after another of government running
 completely amok.  unfortunately, most people are oblivious of the
 government's crimes and still think of it as their protector.  so i
 intend to put together what i call the "american horror file": a
 compilation of cases where the american government has run roughshod
 over the rights of its citizens over the last few years, focusing
 especially on deaths and injuries resulting from no-knock warrants,
 and financial ruin to innocents resulting from civil forfeiture laws,
 but including any other cases for which i can find decent
 documentation.  i hope to make people blood-boiling, artery-bursting,
 red-hot enraged at their government.
 
 the end result will probably be a book in electronic form (ascii text
 and postscript files) detailing the government's crimes of recent
 years.  this book will be distributed at cost, and i will encourage
 people to post copies to bbs's, send copies on disk to friends, and
 print out copies and give them to neighbors.
 
 this is a call for your help.  any information that you can send me on
 how government is running amok will be greatly appreciated.  i would prefer
 information that is well-documented, with sources given, about specific
 instances of governmental abuses.  i also welcome anyone who wants to
 join me in collecting and researching information for this project.
