 i don't recall saying baptists do any of that.  though i suppose some do.  and  
 none of them are listed in the dictionary as characteristics of a cult.  my  
 mother stockpiled campbells soup when it was on sale.

 far from it, i defend the rights of anyone to be different under our  
 constitution, which was formed in part to protect religious cults which had  
 been persecuted in england before migrating here to be free.  you are the one  
 endangering our constitution.
