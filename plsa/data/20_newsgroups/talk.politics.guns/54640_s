 i take it that when something happens that is wrong it's okay if
 a bunch of people say it is?  for instance, if some people go on a
 murderous rampage and lynch some blacks and then a poll is taken which
 shows that the majority of people think that this is acceptable then
 does this mean that what these people have done isn't bad?  this is an
 example of mob rule not a democracy---a democracy in which people's
 rights are protected.  i hope that i've made myself clear on this.

 fine...you have the right to hold any opinion that you want to.  but,
 let me ask you this:  are you outraged over this tragedy?  i hope
 that you are, your opinions of david koresh and his followers not
 withstanding.  i know i am.
