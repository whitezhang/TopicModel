 	you know, john, if you had kept the follow-up to line here on talk
 politics guns, we might have taken you a bit more seriously.  it would have
 at least implied that you had some backbone, perhaps a modicum of willingness
 to present your views and support them.  i guess we all know better now.
 
 >people dumb enough to give their money and possessions to a guy who says he's
 >jesus deserve all they get
 
 	really?  that's interesting, as i was always of the opinion that
 people dumb enough to keep a monarchy around and support them with tax
 funds when said monarchy is merely a figurehead deserve all that
 they get.  dunkirk, for example.  what?  that has nothing to do with it?
 then enjoy your helping of foot.
 
 >anyway, he killed a few feds
 
 	and they killed a few people of their own, including one child
 at last report.  so what?  being a federal agent is not license to kill.
 then there's cnn indicating that the atf/fbi actually *did* start the
 fires which would mean feds killed just under 100 people.  if you're
 so hot to assign blame, make sure you don't overlook the obvious.
 
 >he's not the goddam hero here
 
 	montgomery isn't much of a hero here, either.  amazing how
 different things look on the other side of the pond, isn't it?  not
 that what you think makes much of a difference in the usa, though, and
 for good reason.  when you can vote i'll take your rhetoric a bit more
 seriously.  right now, you're merely a waste of trans-atlantic bandwidth.
 
 >he's dead an' i'm happy!!!!!
 
 	proof positive that ignorance really is bliss.
