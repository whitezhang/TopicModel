 i suppose that depends on how you define 'vast' majority....
 
 you are correct about 'majority.'  somewhere between 1 out of three and 
 one out of 10 will at some period in their lives experience a violent 
 assault.  the risk is generally higher than emergency medical problems
 like heart attack and stroke.
 
 'vast' is probably too loose a term.  with approximately 1,000,000 americans
 using firearms each year, over a 30 year period we get (roughly, since some
 may have to do this more than once) 30 million americans with experience in 
 using firearms for self defense.  30/250 yields 12 percent of the population.
 (yes, i know that is a real rough estimate.  we're closer to 270 million now, 
 but many of these are minors and should be included etc, thus the percentage
 if anything is low.)
 
 at any rate, most minority groups in this range are not usually referred 
 to as 'tiny' minorities, so i don't see how the other part of the group 
 can be referred to as the 'vast' majority.  a little more work might 
 support a 'simple' majority of americans never use, own or display a firearm.
 
 certainly when you are talking about ownership you are wrong.  nearly half
 of your fellow citizens own one or more firearms.

 please provide a list of other means that are as effective.  then you might 
 convince your local police departments to switch.  good luck.
