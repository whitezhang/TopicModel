 this claim hasn't been retracted or contradicted yet, as many earlier
 government claims have?  at least one clip showed a fire erupting
 after a tank busted in a wall.  we have unsubstantiated claims by
 the government about the flirs spotting "simultaneous" fires.

 that's easy.  six hours of cs gas, heavy smoke from a rapidly spreading
 fire, confusion, panic.  only 10% got out.  the building was collapsing
 all around them and finding the way out was a matter of luck.
 
 >and besides... oh, i don't know why i'm even bothering.
 
 the davidians may have committed suicide, or some few zealots among
 them might have started the fires -- that is possible.  but, given
 the government's earlier inability to tell a straight story, i find
 my above scenario equally possible.  i wait for some independent
 investigation to look into the whole thing.
 
 it would be one thing if the government spokespeople had been
 consistent and forthright throughout.  keeping the press far away
 and ghettoized in "pools" was not conducive to building up trust.
 sealing the warrants was non-optimal, as well.  this operation
 was out of control from the git-go.

 speaking only for myself, i think bush and reagan should have been
 impeached over iran-contra.
 
 in 1979, i would probably have given the benefit of the doubt to
 the government.  no more.  like i said, i'll wait to see the
 results of an independent investigation -- if there is one --
 before i choose whom to believe.

 i generally vote for the lesser of two evils.  this last time, it
 was the least of three evils.

 it was a bureaucratic execution.  out of control bureaucracies driven
 by percieved self-interest and gross stupidity.

 clinton is just another statist.  my only problem with clinton on this
 is that he is apparently willing to blindly back the atf and fbi.
