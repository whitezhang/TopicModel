 i have the april 15, 1993 issue of the sf chronicle in my lap.  page
 e7 (in the "sporting green" section) has a trader's advert.  (the
 copy is a bit screwed up - it says that the prices offered expire
 4-14-93, but the ad is there.)
 
 the sf examiner and chronicle run the same set of adverts (because
 they have a joint printing/biz agreement and differ only in editorial
 content).
 
 i've seen gun ads recently in the merc, which is anti-gun editorially,
 albeit not from traders, but from its competitors.
 
 i don't know about the other papers.
 
 does traders claim that things are changing?  when?
 
 >- why tv journalists lie
 
 because it's easier than telling the truth and no one much cares
 either way.
 
 >let me know if you write to any of these bozos.
 
 before you do, make sure that the bozos are actually doing what
 you're accusing them of.
