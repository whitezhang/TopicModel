 unfortunately, elections can, and are, bought.  promise the voters money, and
 they will vote for you.

 same here.  convicted felons may not legally purchase firearms.

 that you know of.
 
 while i lived in the dbr, a gang robbed a joint us army/bundewehr armoury and
 got several hundred m-16s, ammunition, handguns and some explosives.  when i
 left two years later, there were no clues.

 who uses them is the problem.  crime, in the u.s., is "no big deal" if you are
 the criminal.  how about 5 years for murder.  credit for time served (in jail,
 waiting for trial) and you are out in 12 months, worst case.  if we would put
 criminals, especially violent ones, in the slam for true sentences, crime would
 drop.  instead, we reward them for being good and let them out early, very
 early.

 serbs, croats and muslims have been killing each other almost since before the
 invention of guns.  old women are throwing stones at un trucks.  this is a
 hatred that goes beyond reason.

 yes, the problem is the user.  question back (since you are one of the rational
 ones):  if all gun crime were to stop, would you support dropping all gun
 controls?

 they did not believe, from experience, that the "police" (including national
 guard) could/would protect them.  unless you want to argue that a human being
 does not have a right to protect him/herself, they did the right thing.  what
 would you suggest as a defense against a mob throwing bottles and rocks, and
 also likely armed with stolen firearms?

 criminals would move to scandinavia??? :-)  the average criminal would look for
 a less hazardous job, and the rest would likely be buried at county expense.

 personally, i criticize the fools who send money to the ira to "make ireland
 free".  of course, this is the last thing the ira wants, because they lose
 power if england pulls out.  but that's for another group.
 
 >don't flame them because of what to (three?) children did either.
 
 the u.s. has roughly 20 times the major sporting events as the u.k..  how many
 riots did we have at sporting events last year (off the playing field)? 
 hooligan is a word never used when reffering to sports fans here.  i guess
 that's where the different cultures thing comes in.
 
 >(can an jugoslav have an oppinion on guns or even peace??) (yes!)
 
 yes.  the question is, is the problem one of too many guns (mostly from the
 army) or not enough (nonserbians can not defend themselves.

 but disarming responsible gun owners is not the solution.  yet, that is exactly
 what hci is proposing.
