 when will you people realize that our right to keep and bear isn't
 primarily intended to be for protecting against criminals and beasties
 in the wild?  granted, it is a big part, but we also need military style
 weapons so we can fight off the government when they come to our door.
 when ten agents come to my door, it would be nice to be able to shoot
 all of them for 'not upholding the constitution to the best of their
 ability'.  it will be a lot harder doing that with the puny weapons you
 listed above.
 
 please read the federalist papers for all clarification on rkba.  these
 documents have cleared up plenty of misnomers that friends of mine have
 had.
