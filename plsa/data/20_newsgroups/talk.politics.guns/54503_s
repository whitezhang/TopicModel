 re: more on gun buybacks
 
 the denver buy back, trading guns for denver nuggets tickets was pretty much
 a bust. very few guns were turned in. the news tried to hype it but 
 when the best they could do was ".... including a loaded .38..." well,
 you get the picture.
 
 a side note- the news also reported that the guns would be checked for
 whether or not they were stolen. stolen guns will be returned to their
 owners!!!!! (they say)
 
 (does this have anything to do with the rally on the capital steps yesterday
  in support of the rkba????)
 
 even the rally made the 5 pm news on 3 channels :-)
