 ok... quick scenario... you're at home, not bothering anybody... next thing you
 know, somebody comes crashing in the upstairs window and you hear an explosion.
 you see that this individual has a submachinegun, and that more similarly armed
 individuals are rushing your front door.  will you a) defend yourself and family
 against this attack b) realize "oh, only the batf would enter like that, so i 
 better surrender" or c) roll over and let whoever is attacking your home do
 what they would like?  you have chosen a), and discover that the people you 
 defended yourself against are federal agents, who now are camped outside your
 door waiting for you to surrender.  you have learned that they intend to 
 charge you with murder, and are further defaming your name, while claiming that
 you can safely surrender at any time.  then they start using psychological 
 warfare techniques against you, while still claiming that you can safely give up
 and will receive a fair trial.  some weeks into this standoff, you are still
 holding out, when they begin a new ploy to induce your surrender, namely using
 tear gas to annoy you, and ramming your home with tanks.  yet they claim that
 you can safely surrender at any time.  while you patiently wait out this latest
 round of attacks, your house catches fire and the bales of hay you were using as
 cover spread the fire rapidly through the house, and you try to escape through
 the fortifications you had raised for your own defense and the rubble created
 by the tanks.  only 9 of your followers make it.
 
 i am not claiming that the above scenario is accurate.  i am disagreeing with
 the notion that it is their own fault for dying because they refused to 
 surrender to agents of the federal government after another federal agency
 committed an armed assault of their home on the basis of a flimsily concocted
 search warrant.  
 
 look at how the texas rangers view the batf.  look at the fbi statements
 regarding the batf actions.  from all apparent sources, the fbi blundered
 trying to clean up the mess made by the batf, resulting in an accidental fire
 which killed most of the bd's who were still in the compound, and are now 
 playing cya.  the batf committed an illegal assault, obtained the use of 
 texas ng resources with fabricated allegations, and compounded their abuses
 by accusing the bd's of crimes outside their jurisdiction once they had been
 held off in their assault.
