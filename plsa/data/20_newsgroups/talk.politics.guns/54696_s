    did i say that a child who unintentionally shoots someone is not negligent?
  no.  i hate to repeat myself jim, but like i told joe, i was not attempting
 in any way to justify gun control.  you're right, any death is serious.
 that was my point to joe who said that "anti-gunners" try to convinve
 the country that accidental gun deaths related to children are a serious
 problem.  i guess i assumed everyone thought that it was a problem.
 no, i don't want to discuss match control.  i don't equate a book of matches
 to a loaded 9 millimeter either.  don't confuse the issue.  and please don't
 say that tired old nra line "guns don't kill people, people kill people".
 sure, people can kill people without guns.  but easy access to guns makes it
 a lot more convenient.  "guns don't kill people, people with easy access to
 guns kill people".

     jim, i'm just saying how it is.  i'm not saying if that is a good thing
 or not. from the police who i have talked with who run some of these gun
 buyback programs, i get the impression that they really think they are
 having an impact on the community.  when i ask them if they have an evaluatory
 component to the program, they say "well no..."  so, in answer to your
 question, no, false hope is not the intent.  i think the intent is to
 show folks that police are attempting to do something to curb interpersonal
 gun violence whether its effective or not.  look, if you can't measure
 the impact of these programs using some sort of pre-test and post-test
 evaluation, what is the point?  it must be symbolic in nature.  the police are
 essentially saying "look, if you have a gun lying around and you don't
 want it, we'll give you $50 for it...because we care about the community".
 if you, i and joe could think of a way to measure the effectiveness or
 ineffectiveness of these programs we could become rich and famous.

   religion has nothing to do with this.  i could care less what religion
 they were okay?  to put children in that situation is wrong, pure and
 simple.  difference is good jim, i am the most progressive and diverse
 person in the world.  but, if different is allowing kids to be exposed
 to tanks and tear-gas, then yes jim, different is wrong.
