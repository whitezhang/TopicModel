 as i understand it was considered unsafe for the tv networks to get
 any closer. surely the networks can judge the risks of reporting
 for themselves. i haven't noticed cnn being banned from baghdad
 hotels yet despite the (all too real) risk of having a cruise
 missile land in the lobby. incidentally has that ever been explained
 or are we to assume that out of the whole of the city an off-course
 missile just happened to hit that hotel at a probability of about
 1 in some very large number?
 
 unsafe for who i wonder?
