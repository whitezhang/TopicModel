 editor, 
 
 i would like to ask you and your readers a few questions that are related to
 the "right to keep and bear arms", and to a greater degree, the many other
 "rights" that we take for granted on a daily basis. 
 
 1.	you're sleeping at night, when you hear someone in your house.  you
 call the police.  how will you defend yourself, should the need arise, while
 you are waiting for the police to arive? 
 
 2.	you are driving your family home when your car breaks down.  a "good
 samaritan" stops to "help", when you find you and your family at gun-point or
 knife-point.  how will you defend yourself?  and your family? 
 
 3.	you are a woman walking alone to your car or home.  a man appears
 suddenly with the intent to rape you.  how will you defend yourself?  are you
 strong enough to fight off your attacker?  are you willing to let this man rape
 you in order to survive the attack? 
 
 if the house and senate have their way, we will soon not have the right to keep
 and bear arms, as provided by the second amendment to the constitution. a gun
 may not be the answer to each and every dangerous situation, but are you going
 to let the politicians decide what sort of force or weapon you may use to
 defend yourself and your family? 
 
 many times a situation may be diffused by just brandishing your handgun.  if
 certain members of the house and senate have their way, .25, .32, and 9mm
 ammunition will be banned for sale to anyone other than the military and law
 enforcement departments.  very soon, you may not be able to purchase ammunition
 for use in your handgun. 
 
 there is already a 15 day waiting period in california.  do you really feel
 that any law abiding citizen should be required to wait this amount of time for
 the purchase of a handgun when his life or family members have been threatened?
 
 our local police do an excellent job, but they can not be there all the time,
 or in a moments notice.  you should have the right to protect yourself   while
 waiting for help to arrive. 
 
 there is currently legislation circulating in washington that would prohibit
 the sale of certain types of ammuntion, handguns, rifles, and shot-guns.  one
 elected official even wants to repeal the second amendment! 
 
 i want to ask the readers of this paper what they would do if their elected
 officials decided that they should only belong to a "certain church", or go to
 church on a "partiular day"?  what if you were told that you could only read
 certain books?  write about certain subjects?  what if you no longer had the
 right to a jury of your peers?  how about the right to assemble in a peaceful
 manner? 
 
 these are all rights that are provided by our constitution and the amendments.
 if we give up one right, we may as well give them all up.  if you do not fight
 for the right to keep and bear arms, what will you fight for?  when your life
 is affected?  write your law makers now!  protect all of your rights by
 defending your second amendment rights.
