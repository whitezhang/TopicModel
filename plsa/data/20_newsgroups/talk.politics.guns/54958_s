 	my god, a sane person!  somebody asking intelligent questions rather
 than spouting of unsubstantiated drivel and making comparisons to nazi
 germany.  i question, along with others, the initial raid by the atf.
 there are some definite questions needing answers.

 	probably.  which is why there are so many people angry at the
 initial confrontation.  why attack a compound with as many people in that
 compound who are willing to die for their leader?  further, they attacked
 in the daylight hours without proper backup, medical support, etc.  that
 was rather stupid...
 
 >2) could a further wait have resulted in a different outcome.
 
 	this i doubt.  while i question the atf's initial raid, i believe
 that the remainder of the standoff was handled fairly well with the single
 exception of the psychological "warfare" by blaring music, etc.  i think
 that was uncalled for and probably hindered the outcome.
 
 >3) were fbi actions (blaring loudspeakers, etc.) the "right" course of action?
 
 	see above...
 
 >and a few other questions.  like i said, i believe the actions taken, in
 >general, were proper.  but i still have some reservations.
 
 	agreed.

 	which is actually rather refreshing nowadays.  most of the time, the
 higher-ups claim "i don't remember..." or "i had no involvement..."  :-)
