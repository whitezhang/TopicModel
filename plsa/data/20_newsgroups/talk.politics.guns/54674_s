 this is taken a little out of context and i'm not flaming jason...it's just
 that this was the proverbial straw....
 
 i grow a little weary of the allegations (here, the media, people on the
 street) that the bd's had all these "horrible illegal weapons and other
 paraphenalia of destruction capable of blowing tanks 50 feet into the air..."
 and then, without missing a beat, discuss how the bd's willfully commited
 mass suicide, or killed their own less fanatical and *then* commited mass
 suicide, etc., etc.
 
 if the bd's had all these things and intended to "blow up their abode, blow up
 waco, blow up the entire country, or whatever suits your fancy, what happened
 to all the violence they were supposed to unleash? why wouldn't they have "gone
 out in the proverbial blaze of glory" and "come out shooting" with an attitude
 of "let's take as many of those dogs as possible with us"?
 
 instead, they seemed to have preferred death to whatever they thought was in
 store for them at the government's hands.
 
 it's totally immaterial whether they were all crazy, all fanatics, all followers
 of the antichrist, haters of the government, practicers of weird lifestyles, or
 whatever...they must have felt that they were being pressured into renouncing
 their beliefs, however how strange or lunatic those beliefs might appear to "you
 and me". there is much precedent for such devotion to cause.
 
 my conclusion at this point is that the "authorities" seriously misread their
 danger to society (else why did the bd's not do as suggested above) and/or chose
 this incident to make some heinous point or satisfy some internal agenda, up to
 and including ag j. renbo using this as an opportunity to assert her manhood.
 
 some people really do believe it is better to die than be subjected to what
 they perceive as the godless government. when i force myself to not judge
 others by my own personal standards and beliefs, i can almost admire their
 stand.
 
 i surely believe in the constitution but i don't know that i have such strength
 of conviction as evidenced by the bd's.
