 all very true.  i'm going on what i have read and heard from friends.
 basically the glock is great but i have heard/read that it is a lot harder to
 learn proper handling because of the type of safety that it has.  i was
 looking at a glock .40s&w and the s&w 4006 a couple of weeks ago and the
 safties on the guns were very different.  the saftey on the 4006 seemed a lot
 more "safe"  (for lack of a better word) than the one on the glock.  of course
 this could also be a bad thing if you were to pull the gun on somebody.  you
 would spend more time fiddling around turning the safety off.  personally i
 like the glocks because they are very light and i think they look really cool
 (guess that's why they use them in so many movies) but i wouldn't get one as
 my first semi-auto because of the safety.  i would prefer more training with
 a "traditional" semi-auto (ala colt .45) but of course that's just my opinion.
