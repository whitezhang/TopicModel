 even though i find this to be funny on the surface, the original poster of the
 joke has  tried and convicted the members of the bd to be a bunch of "nuts".
 this may be a dangerous thing to do.  it is my opinion that most educated
 or well informed people of this country have some distrust of the government.
 this should exist because as a bureaucracy, any government given enough time
 will tend to exist for it self and not for the original purpose it was 
 created for.  this distrust by the people should keep those in power in-line.
 that and a properly functioning press.  when a sensationalism oriented press
 portrays a group of people as "nuts" or crazies, a violation of those
 people's civil rights seem justified.   since we, as american's, have the 
 gurantee of rights as enumerated in the constitution, to include the
 2nd ammendment, the government must appease the public's opinion or risk 
 voted out of existance, or if it has become corrupt enough to tamper with
 domocratic process itself, being thrown out by force.
   our government as it stands, must appease the public.  therefore the 
 official press releases portray the bd's as fanatics who are a threat to
 public safety.  we must not prejudge people based on one sided information.
 so far the only information that we are being given is comming from the very
 agency that was embarrased by the bd(branch davidians sp?).  it is to their
 advantage to make the bd's as fanatical and dangerous as possible.  if they
 were portrayed as law-abiding citizen's, then they(atf) had no justification
 what so ever of doing what they did.
    so let's keep an open mind.  jokes like above, even though it may be funny,
 may mislead the public from the truth of the matter.
 
 just as an aside,  my understanding of u.s. vs rock island and u.s. vs dalton
 leads me to believe that the national firearms act, which allows the fed's
 (in this case atf) to regulate firearms(machine guns), has been deemed to be
 unconstitutional since 1986.(by two federal district courts at least).
 and since, i believe the only reason atf was involved
 in this case is because of firearms violations, it would be interesting to 
 find out whether or not the search warrent was based on the nfa.
 it would be very embarrassing indeed if a search warrent based on a possibly
 unconstitutional law has resulted in 4 deaths(law enforcement).
