   and another one:
 
 hasn't enyone heard of a leader's recon?  this is when the leader of the
 assult goes and looks at the objective to see if anything has changed that
 would affect the mission.  even the freshman cadets here in rotcland
 know about them.  mostly because they know it as the part where they 
 lie on the cold ground for an hour or so, but they've heard about it.
 maybe the atf should have hired out to the local rotc guys!
