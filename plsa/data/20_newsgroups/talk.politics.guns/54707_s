 what interpretations?  just read it as it's written.
    "a well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free
 state, the right of the people, to keep and bear arms, shall not be
 infringed."
 
 where does it say "the right of the people to be members of a militia shall
 not be infringed" or "the right of the militia to keep and bear arms shall
 not be infringed?"  nowhere.
 
 
 "well-educated businessmen being necessary to the ability of the nation to
 compete in the international marketplace, the right of the people to attend
 schools shall not be infringed."
 
 would you "interpret" this to mean that only businessmen should have a
 protected right to attend schools?  why or why not?
