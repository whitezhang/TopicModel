 i agree, i saw no reason they could not have had "close in" pool
 cameras manned by volunteers and protected by sandbags or whatever.

 dear, dear. they could have come out.

 okay, they were living in a fire hazard. that they built.

 no crime, irrelevant either way.

 ah yes, that is exactly what i would do.  hold bible study. take a nap.
 always a wise course of action when you're being gassed.

 i don't believe there was a "suicide pact".  i believe that koresh
 wanted a fiery conflagration ... which he may not have told his followers.
 in fact, this hypothesis is confirmed by the survivors' stories.

 yes, that's right.  and once the whole compound was demolished, where
 did they expect to go?

 the building is being rammed and they are going upstairs?  that's almost
 as bad as running into a fire.

 hm, an interesting notion.  we'll see.

 more bible study, no doubt.  hey, it's a *priority*.

 actually, on friday he stated that there was no evidence either way and
 he could not flatly contradict the federal agents' claims.  we'll know
 more later.  in any event, it's irrelevant.

 for six hours they were trapped?  the building was not "destroyed" 
 immediately.  they could have left at any time.

 six hours to move it away.  or come out.

 irrelevant, anyway.  pr one way or the other, but no crime or innocence
 indicated.

 no word on whether they were being fired back at, which is an operative
 question here.

 right.  for six hours you know that a tank could come thru the wall at 
 any point, and you leave a coleman lantern burning.  near bales of hay.

 it's ultimately irrelevant who "lit" the fire.  they had ample opportunity
 to leave.

 most charismatic leaders are extremely intelligent, actually.  they tend
 to be excellent actors and skilled manipulators.  (ex.: ted bundy.)

 medical assistance was jsut a phone call away.  gee, all he had to do
 was come out.

 not relevant to any crimes.

 while he was there.  anyway, outsiders rarely see abuse.  it's a secretive
 thing.  all we have to go on are the court documents in the jewell case
 and the mistrial in california.

 exactly.  by their own choice.

 looks like there will be several investigations, starting with congressional
 committee hearings next week....

 i have never judged them by their religion, but by their actions.
 
 if they had lived a quiet, religious life as they claimed, there would
 have been no raid, no siege, and no deaths.  instead, they chose courses
 of action at every turn that were at the very least stupid, if not
 irrational.  the first was to stockpile weapons.  the second was to
 shoot federal agents.  the third was to stay inside.
 
 just as we don't blame a cop who shoots a kid who had pointed a toy
 weapon at him, i don't think the fbi deserves blame in this case.
