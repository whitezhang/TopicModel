 they were using 50 caliber ammunition not 50mm ammo.  50mm would be 5cm; a
 shell of this size would be larger than a lot of cannon shells.
 
 snipers could have screened the people trying to put out the fire.  besides,
 the ranch house (not "fort apocalypse"; it was just a house despite what
 the fbi and atf says) was on *fire*.  the "gun loonies" couldn't hardly
 have been shooting at fire men while there house was engulfed in flames.
 the fbi and atf don't have any excuse for not having fire engines there
 to put out the blaze.  the bastards waited until the fire was *well*
 under way before they called the fire department in waco.  they didn't
 even tell the fire department to be on standby.  i sincerely hope that
 the fbi, atf, attorney general janet reno, and all others involved in
 this fiasco get the just punishment that they so richly deserve.
 someone should pay for this needless, tragic waste of human life.
 
 sadly, these evil sobs will probably never face justice.  the media
 and the government will just whitewash this incident and chalk it
 up as being solely david koresh's fault.  sadder still, the american
 people will probably believe them.

 this is not the problem...the problem is that we have a government that
 is becoming more tyrannical every day.  if people decide to own guns
 *and* live in one place together then that is their prerogative.  on
 the other hand, if the bds were in posession of explosives and illegal
 guns then the government did have the right to search their compound.
 but, the allegations that the bds were in posession of illegal weapons
 hasn't been proven yet, so i'm not going to conclude that the bds broke
 any laws.  david koresh was accused of abusing children, but if this
 is his *only* crime then the presence of the atf can't be justified.
 the atf is only supposed to deal with firearms, tobacco, and alcohol
 violations.  atf agents are basically cigarette cops...they should
 stay out of other kinds of law-enforcement actions that are out of
 their jurisdiction.  better yet, they should be s**tcanned imo.

 sounds like something the ss would do.  human life---children and adults
 alike---should be treated with respect---even if they are "heavily-armed
 religious wackos".
 
 david koresh's lawyer seemed to think that everyone *would* come out
 peacefully sooner or later.  the fbi and atf had nothing but time on
 their hands!  why did they have to escalate the situation and cause
 this senseless tragedy?  their job is to protect the public and save
 lives not kill people for crying out loud.

 don't be so sure about that.  i read in a newspaper today that one of the
 cult members said that when one of the tanks went through the wall that
 it knocked over a lantern which caused the ranch house to be caught on
 fire.  this cult member also said that david koresh had *no* intentions
 of committing mass suicide.  david koresh's lawyer also confirms this.
 therefore, if this is true then this means that the fbi and atf murdered
 everyone in that house!  even if this is not true, the fbi and atf still
 don't get off the hook because they waited a damn long time to call the
 waco fire department.  perhaps they wanted all these people to die.

 you're wrong on several accounts.  atf agents were adequately armed.  they
 had mp5s, ar-15s, and shotguns.  some agents were armed with automatic
 pistols but not all were.  the atf's initial claim---which they later
 retracted---that agents were underarmed is simply ludicrous.

 gun control isn't the only issue here.  if the sick little monkeys in
 washington try to use the waco incident as a reason to ban guns then
 they will have demonstrated just how f***ed up they are.  what concerns
 me much more than new gun control legislation is that the government
 seems to be able to get away with s**t like they did in waco...they are
 becoming more and more callous about people's rights and the law.  this
 greatly disturbs me and it should disturb you as well.
