 tolerent, aren't we?  their's was hardly the first faith/sect/cult 
 to espouse this type of belief.

 i keep hearing this, and while i'll agree that he "should" have come
 out (legally, that was his best option), he didn't; and as far as i know,
 there is no legal provision for "we're tired of this shit, lets just
 kick some ass..."
 
 so i have a question for you; here goes.
 
 i come up to you and point a gun at you, saying "i'm going to count
 to ten, if you aren't standing on your head by then, i'll kill you."
 you believe that standing on your head is the road to damnation, so
 you don't do it.
 "1..2..3..4..5..6..7..8..9..10...bang!"  you are now dead - is it my
 fault for shooting you, or you're fault for being shot?
 koresh wouldn't stand on his head.
