 such a measure would also have another benefit. it would relieve the
 various states of the thorny problem of what to do with the hundreds
 of millions of dollars hunters pour into the economy annually. i'm
 sure that, to attain sure a lofty, humane, liberal and ecologically
 (not to mention politically) correct goal, the environmental and animal
 rights groups/individuals supporting such a measure would be more than
 willing to add their names to a list of supporters seeking increased
 taxation to replace these lost revenues. i am equally confident that
 these same entities, given their noteworthy record in the area of social
 responsibility and respect for private property, would feel morally
 and ethically bound to raise the necessary funds to acquire the
 hundreds of thousands of acres of land now held in private hands
 solely for use as private hunting preserves by the landowner(s). to
 do less than this would place these same groups/individuals in
 the ethically untenable (to say nothing of environmentally and
 politically incorrect) position of sanctioning the logging and
 subsequent development and urbanization of these former private
 hunting lands, which would no longer be useable by, or of any
 benefit to, the landowner(s) in such a capacity.
