 	at the risk of starting the 'my gun is better than yours' flame
 war, i must disagree.
 	
 	there is no secret in handling a glock.  in fact, it is often
 chosen (besides its other merits) because it shoots like a revolver does
 basically.  it can limit the training time (read budget $$$) due to the
 fact there are no 'external' safties other than the trigger, hence less
 training time required. 
 
 	smith & wesson (among other types) are chosen due to the fact taht
 they do have the external safties (hammer drop,as well as mag drop) which
 if properly used have saved many lives when 'mr. bad' snatched the gun
 from the officer and tried to shoot said officer the gun was on safe and
 would not fire.  this point had been made in many articles in various 
 gun magazines.  if fact, one author (can't remember who) staged a little
 test where he had a revolver and a s&w on safe laying on a table and asked
 people with little firearms experience to on his signal, grab the gun and
 shoot a target.  he timed the people using each gun.  the revolver times
 were pretty close, but some of the times with the s&w were in minutes, or
 the person just gave up because they could not figure out the saftey.
 
 	you don't often see colt 45 autos issued due to the light trigger
 which can be accidentally fired in a stress situation, opening the issuing
 city,county, etc.. to lawsuits, bad press, etc..
 
 	of course any problem can be overcome with enough training, but
 such training is not always available to budget crunched departments.  i
 know if i were a cop i would want something like a s&w just for the off
 chance of the gun getting taken away.  the safety doesn't guarantee that
 'mr. bad' won't figure it out and shoot me, but it could buy enough time
 to draw a second gun and shoot 'mr. bad' before it's too late.
 
 	don't think i am too biassed here just because i have had 3 glocks
 in my possession at one time, because i have had a .45 as well.  in fact,
 it was my first handgun.  remember, the ultimate 'safety' is you the
 operator, and no safety is going to stop an negligent discharge (note i
 don't say accidental) if you break the rules of gun handling.
 
 	as per the part of being light weight and looking cool, i agree
 100%.  i wouldn't rule it out as a first purchase.
