 jason - i've heard the people who are talking about this dismissed as
 conspiracy nuts, but nobody seems to be talking about a conspiracy, at
 least at the beginning.  there were a lot of bad decisions that went into
 this tragedy, and some people may now be taking some serious evasive
 action to avoid being held responsible for the unexpected results of
 those bad decisions.  actually, the only ones i see that are tied into
 a conspiracy theory are the ones raving about deranged cultists with
 stockpiles of weapons and suicide pacts.

 i think there are a lot of us that have been following this pretty closely
 from the beginning, and we woud probably agree that this tragedy was more
 the result of stupidity than malice.
