 
 	the debate over the second amendment rages on.
 arguments continue over what a "well-regulated militia"
 is and what trkba means in practical terms.  however, the
 only authority in this area, is a binding court decision
 on the matter.  even a decision in this area is subject to
 an overturning by a higher court.  is there anyone who
 has the facts of a legal precedent, preferably a supreme
 court decision on the specific meaning of the 2nd amendment?
