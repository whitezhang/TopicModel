 an interesting idea consider:   
    at any locality where a buy-back program is being instituted, get a list
 of guns they received and compare serial numbers with a list of stolen guns
 and sue the people responsible for the program if those guns were destroyed.
 criminal charges can also be made.( receiving stolen property, destruction of
 private property etc.)
