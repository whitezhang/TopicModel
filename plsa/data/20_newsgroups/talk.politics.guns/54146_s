 recently while looking around in traders sporting goods store, a very well
 stocked firearms store, i discovered a printed document that was being 
 distributed by the good folks who work there.  traders, btw, is located in
 san leandro, ca.
 
 granted, the document may be asking you and i to help out traders, but in the
 big scope of things, i feel that we would do all gun owners a favor by helping
 to this cause.
 
 anyway, here it is:
 
 newspaper ad censorship
 
 are you letting the newspapers tell you how to live your life, what's good for
 you, what's not, and exercise blatant censorship over what you read in their
 advertisments?
 
 the newspapers have now decided to censor gun ads - which is why you no longer
 see the ads that traders, san leandro, has run for many years.
 
 these ads were run for the law-abiding honest citizens who own firearms for
 sporting use or self-protection.  they certainly have the right to do so, under
 the second amendment right to bear arms.
 
 if you are tired of newspapers who run sex and liquor ads galor, yet refuse to
 run legitimate gun ads, please send a letter to the editors indicating your
 displeasure over their censorship doctrine.
 
 following is a list of bay area newspapers who censor gun ads.  perhaps you'd
 like to send them your thoughts on this issue!

 then there are six pages of "facts".  i can not validate these facts, and 
 there were no sources, but many feel and sound very true.  here are the topic
 headlines:
 
 - big media snow job
 - blaming firearms for murder is like blaming hospitals for death
 - i could use the same nazi journalistic technique of cbs and abc to prove
   that hospitals cause death
 - how nbc, cbs, and abc have scammed the american people on "gun control"
 - american tv journalism is based on nazi journalism
 - why tv journalists lie
 - the government with the help of the tv networks, has succeeded in playing
   one group against the other
 - gun laws are unconstitutional
 - american gun laws are based on nazi gun laws
 - the government is trying to devide and conquer
 - the cia wants your firearms
 
 and so on for six pages.
 
 so now we have the media trying help put gun dealers out of business by trying
 to limit their exposure to potential customers, and preventing the customers
 from reading about sales of ammunition and firearms for sporting, hunting, or
 other recreational use.
 
 let me know if you write to any of these bozos.
