 *sigh*
 
 it is standard procedure to suspend law enforcement officers, or re-assign
 them to administrative (non enforcement) duties, while an investigation
 into possible misconduct is going on. the administration has given no
 indication that such suspensions will occur in this case. and given that
 the president, attorney general and governor were all involved in the
 decisions that led to the waco massacre, they should also suspend all
 activities regarding law enforcement. given their positions, that equates
 to an enforced vacation.
