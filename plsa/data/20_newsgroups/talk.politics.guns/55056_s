 on tv news this morning it was reported that the local texas authorities
 who have reviewed the cases of the 21 children who were released
 earlier in the siege have found no evidence of physical or sexual
 abuse of any of the children.  i don't recall if this was on good
 morning america or our local texas tv station.
