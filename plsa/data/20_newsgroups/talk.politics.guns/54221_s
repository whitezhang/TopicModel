 as i'm sure others will have pointed out to you by now, none of the above
 measures are required for you *on your own property*.  you do not have to
 have a license, your car does not have to be registered or inspected, and
 you do not have to have insurance or safety training classes, when you own
 and operate that vehicle on your own premises.  if you are going to make use
 of this dubious analogy, at least make it accurate.  and by the way, in texas
 you can drive a car in public (with the proper credentials), but an ordinary
 civilian can't carry a gun legally in public to save his/her life.
 
 so i won't even consider registration, *manadatory* safety classes, or
 *manadatory* liability insurance unless i get a federal law repealing
 all local, state, and federal gun control laws which abridge the second
 amendment, and a non-discretionary federal weapons carry permit, good
 anywhere in the united states.  come on, you wanted the analogy.
