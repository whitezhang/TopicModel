 well, let me see.  uzi, no.  m-11/9, no.  m-16/ar-15, maybe.  i remember there
 being a selector swtich on the ar-15.  if i remember correctly (please correct
 me if i'm wrong) the switch would set to an "off" position or an "on" position
 because the gun (ar-15) is semi-automatic.  wouldn't the m-16 have a position
 for semi-auto fire and full-auto fire (or maybe 3 round bursts)?  if this is
 correct wouldn't it be easy to distinguish each gun by this alone?  of course
 if the ar-15 were modified to full-auto fire i wouldn't think it would be that
 easy but i'm talking about distinguishing between an unmodified ar-15 and m-16.
 how about the other guns?  do they also have selector switch to switch between
 semi-auto and fully-auto fire?

 actually it was pretty hard for the kids in my neighborhood to figure that out
 as richard petty lived in my neighborhood and left his stock car in the 
 driveway. ;-)

 well, what about what i said above?  if that is correct i guess tv would be
 acceptable (if you had a good enough picture and a picture of the lower 
 receiver of the ar-15/m-16).
