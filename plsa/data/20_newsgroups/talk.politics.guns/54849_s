 though david sternlight pushes the envelope of credibility by claiming that
 talk.politics.guns is not the place to discuss guns, or the meaning of the
 second amendment, it seems he would rather post to millions of people out 
 of relative ignorance of the subject than to follow the currently active 
 threads discussing exactly this topic which at least explore the fallacies 
 of his erroneous claim, and at most explode them.
 
 basic fact #1, mr. sternlight:  the right described is a "right of the people
 to keep and bear arms;" not a "right of the people to form a militia," a
 "right of a militia to keep and bear arms," or a "right of well-regulated
 people to keep and bear arms."  this should be apparent from a simple
 reading of the sentence.
 
 for the other arguments, i suggest you check out the thread, "some more
 about gun control," playing now in an alt.politics.usa.constitution
 near you.
