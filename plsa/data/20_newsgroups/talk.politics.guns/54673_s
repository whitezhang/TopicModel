 for you, or the government, or anyone else to say what is dangerous or
 harmful to the followers is direct interference in religion; it has been
 used quite improperly even when nothing as drastic as waco has happened.
 
 no evidence has been presented that the davidians have engaged in any 
 activities harmful to others before the actions of the batf.  on this
 morning's news, there was an item about the batf warrant being unsealed.
 that they bought $200,000 worth of legal weapons has not been denied by
 anyone.  when they were accused of harming others in the past, the local
 sherriff had no problems in serving a warrant; our rights as free people
 were violated by the batf going in shooting.  
 
 this country was founded on the superiority of the rights of the individual.
 remember pastor niemoller's remarks.
