        the relevance is that if you've got x homicides and reduce
 the number of gun homicides in that group, but x doesn't decrease
 by a significant amount, have you made an improvement, and is that
 improvement worth what you've paid?

        if a baseball bat is a tenth as likely to kill a victim as a gun,
 is that any comfort to that tenth?

        i've faced a knife.  and i was damn annoyed i didn't *have*
 a gun.  all the statistics in the world didn't change the fact that
 *he* was interested in cutting *me*.

        "anyone trained in self-defense." 
 
        unarmed self-defense isn't for everyone.  what's more, it requires
 substantially more training to be safe and effective than a firearm.
 it requires physical proximity and thus a greater threat to the victim,
 which is a primary problem with stun guns.  you have to actually touch
 your assailant.  unless you're *very* good, a large, stronger assailant
 can simply ignore your blows long enough to incapacitate you.
