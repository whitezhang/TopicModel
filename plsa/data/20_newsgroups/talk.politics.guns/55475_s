 politicians want to eliminate private ownership of guns before the
 general public starts violently resisting the tax increases needed
 to fund the federal government as an ever higher percentage of tax
 revenue goes to pay interest on the national debt (currently 57 cents
 out of every tax dollar collected and rising).

 i'm beginning to look forward to reaching the %100 allocation of taxes
 to pay for the interest on the national debt. at that point the
 federal government will be will go out of business for lack of funds.
