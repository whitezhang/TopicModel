 ...and i'm sure that people who were big fans of fuedalism pissed and
 moaned about the emergence of the modern nation-state. imagine, the king
 allowing serfs their freedom if they could live in the city for a year!
 times change, technology changes, viable forms of social organization
 change. while concerns about preserving western notions of civil liberties
 in the face of cultures with very different values is a valid one, it's
 a waste of effort to try to turn back the tide. it's much smarter to focus
 on trying to make sure that the emerging forms of social organization are
 acceptable than it iss to lament the passing of the old forms.
