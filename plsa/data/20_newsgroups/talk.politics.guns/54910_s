 can you imagine what happens when a magazine explodes? bullets go flying every
 where. imho, these "gunshot wounds" were actually caused when the magazines 
 went up. a texas ranger does not a pathologist make, so i'll wait for an
 autopsy to determine if they were shot first. 
 
 either way, they're all dead and the fbi & atty. gen. vampria are still
 responable.
