 there is no evidence of effect of gun buyback programs but hopefully if
 there is any effect it may prevent injuries or deaths in one of these types
 of common incidents.

  firearms are the fifth-leading cause of unintentional deaths among children
 ages 14 and under.  i don't understand how the ratio to other accidental
 deaths is important.  so guns don't kill as many children as car accidents.
 what is the difference in severity between 1,000 deaths and 10,000 deaths?
 i am not trying to use accidental gun-related deaths among children as a
 justification for gun control.  who needs to be convinced that accidental
 gun deaths of children is a serious problem?  i assumed that any humane
 person would be concerned when any 10 year old got hold of their parents
 gun from their bedroom drawer and accidently blew away one of their friends.

  my point was, gun buyback programs which are almost always run by police
 departments might (i stress might) do a little (i stress little) good by
 giving people the impression that the police are attempting to respond
 to interpersonal gun violence in a unique way.  overall, i thought that i
 had made it clear that i did not think that gun buyback programs were
 useful.

  well joe, i suggest that you talk to the center to prevent handgun violence
 or the centers for disease control.  if you look carefully you will see
 that you greatly underestimate the presence of guns in the lives of youths.
 the cphv reports that 135,000 youth bring guns to school daily and that
 400,000 bring guns to school at least once a year.  the cdc estimates
 that 1 out 0f 25 high school students carried a gun to school at least once
 in 1990.  the cdc also says that 1.2 million elementary-aged, latch-key
 children (kids who come home from school to an empty house), have access
 to guns in their home.  california schools reported a 200% increase in
 student gun confiscations between 1986 and 1990, and a 40% increase between
 1988 and 1990.  florida reported a 61% percent increase in gun incidents in
 schools between 1986/87 amd 1987/88.  these are the "statistics".

  okay, maybe i worded it wrong...dad.  i meant that to put children in a
 situation (fortified compound) where harm could come to them is not the
 act of a messiah in my opinion.  i'm not saying that koresh had control over
 these children directly, but i would hope that whatever messiah there is
 would not let innocent children die.
 if as he claimed he was the messiah and people followed him as such, why
 did he not tell their parents to free the children instead of letting them
 burn alive?  thanks for the reality check joe, its been real.
