 this isn't rec.guns, so maybe this is getting a bet technical, but i

 i can't imagine doing much combat type shooting single action.....

 assuming the cylinder will rotate....

 never hurts to err on the side of safety, but if you've got one of those
 'new fangled' hammer blocks or transfer bar safeties, it's unnecessarily
 redundant.  i'd rather have the extra round.

 quite true.  speed loaders are a little less convenient to pack around
 than magazines though.

 true, but this is a training function.

 cocked and locked for single actions or hammer down on double actions
 are the only carry modes that make sense...  the 80 series colt's for
 example are quite safe to carry this way.

 agreed.
 
 now that i've shot off my mouth a bit, let me back some of this up.  it
 is true that a simple misfire on a revolver doesn't cost you much.  on
 the other hand, i've had all sorts of interesting things happen over the
 years.  for example, i've had factory ammunition that has had high
 primers.  a high primer will tie your revolver up somewhere from seconds
 to minutes while you try to pound the action open to clear the problem.
 an auto?  jack the slide and continue.
 
 i've had bullets come out of the case, keeping the cylinder from
 turning, see clearing paragraph above.  about the worst that can happen
 with a semi auto is a double feed.  this can be cleared in seconds.
 
 most revolvers are more 'fragile' then semi auto's.  there are all sorts
 of close tolerance parts and fitting involved.  dropping the gun, or a
 blow to the gun or all sorts of things can take it out of action.  many
 of the problems that can be cured on the spot with a (quality) semi auto
 take a gun smith for a revolver.  in short a revolver may be less likely
 to malfunction, but as a rule when it does, you're out of the fight.
 the majority of malfunctions that occur with semi autos does not fall
 into that category.
 
 vincint makes many good points in this post, but leaves off the opposing
 view of most of them.  a real good starting place is ayoob's "the semi
 auto pistol for police and self defense."
 
 in general, i'd agree, the revolver is an excellent first gun and self
 defense weapon for somebody that does not have the time, and inclination
 that is necessary for the training and practice needed to use a semi
 auto effectively as a self defense arm.
 
 most cops are notoriously indifferent to firearms.  if the department
 isn't going to train them, they aren't going to take the time on their
 own.  there is no doubt that training is an issue.  the amount of
 training required for effective use of a semi auto is probably several
 times that of a revolver.  many cops don't bother.
 
 for myself, i'd hate to be limited to one or the other.  i'd rather pick
 what fits better with my personal inclination, what i'm wearing that day
 and so on.  like the moderator on rec.guns says, buy em all!
 
 that said, i have to admit that often my advice to people thinking of
 buying their first defense arm is (right after taking a class) get a
 ruger or smith revolver....  (sorry colt fans.  colt revolvers are ok
 too!)
 
 if this post had gone the other way, i'd be arguing for revolvers. :-)
