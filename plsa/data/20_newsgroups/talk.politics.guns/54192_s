 for me, it would be an obvious choice: armed self-defence is clearly
 and strongly protected by the colorado constitution and the laws
 of the state. in the very clear-cut situation of your hypothetical,
 i wouldn't have anything to fear from the police (unless i had been
 publicly carrying the weapon concealed, something i'm not in
 the habit of doing... even then, the worst i'd have to deal with 
 was a class 2 misdemeanor.) even if the situation were not so
 clear, and i might have to worry about arrest for manslaughter or
 homicide, it would still be safer to wait for the police. if
 i were to leave and try to avoid police involvement, i'd be committing
 several felonies and ruining my chances of claiming self-defence
 in court ("if it really was self-defence," the prosecuter would
 ask, "why did you run away and hide from the police?")
 
 in other states, however, this decision might not be so clear-cut:
 if someone in, say, washington d.c. were to use a gun in self-defence
 he would _automatically_ be guilty of several felony violations of
 that city's gun control laws. such a person's choices would be
 between certain conviction for a couple of felonies versus possible
 conviction for half a dozen.
