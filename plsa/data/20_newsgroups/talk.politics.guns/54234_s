 ahem!!!  hrumph!!!!  you have encurred the wrath of glock owners.  we will beat
 you with our hammers.  oooops, don't have any  :-)
 
 seriously.  there is no difference in the safeties betweena glock and any da
 revolver.  intellectually, think of the glock as a very high cap revolver. 
 ignoring stove pipes, misfeeds and all the other bonus exercises that
 autoloaders give you, that is.
 
 every gun has its safe moment and its dangerous moment.  if you just learn how
 to handle it, it becomes a lot less dangerous (to you).
