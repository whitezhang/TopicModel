 moreover, the batf has admitted having agents in the compound, and as
 far as i have been able to ascertain, those agents were still in the
 compound when the first shots were fired.  for all we know, these two
 people may be the agents, who would certainly be unlikely to stay around
 and "cook" with the faithful...
 
 assuming the two people in question were even in the compound at all.
 
 maybe i sound paranoid, but i watched janet reno last night harping on
 how much david koresh was a big, bad child abuser, and i kept wondering 
 why she -- much less batf -- wanted us to infer that she had any 
 jurisdiction over such accusations in the first place.
 
 i'm positive that the "sealed warrant" is not for child abuse.  what was
 it for?  peobably weapons violations.  janet reno didn't say word one
 last night about weapons violations.  why?  because she knows that such
 a case is no longer believable?
