 i've lived through the bombing of cambodia; my lai; inflated body counts
 in vietnam; the funding of noreiga; watergate; contragate; chappaquiddick;
 kent state; domestic spying by the cia; edwin meese's pornography 
 commission; the war on drugs; civil seizure; the move disaster; the la 
 disaster; and now waco.
