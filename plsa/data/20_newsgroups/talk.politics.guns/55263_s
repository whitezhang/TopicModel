 	when i might possibly be on the receiving end of a violent gesture, 
 	then *i* get to decide for myself.  if someone does not like it, too
 	bad.  i would be doing exactly what you  or any other living creature
 	would do in terms of evaluation.  what's the big deal?

 	sometimes.

 	i might.

 	not in my experience.  and let us not forget that context is often an
 	important factor in evaluating a situation.  seeing disheveled persons
 	on a hiking trail is not likely to be evaluated equally with meeting
 	a grimey sort, as described above, on a lonely city street at 3 am.
 	anyone that cannot properly discriminate between these two different
 	situations is legitimate fodder for the old "survival of the fittest" 
 	principle.

 	sounds like you doubt your own abilities.  you sound pretty
 	typical in this respect.  you also seem to think that you'll
 	be safe or safer if others are unarmed.  this is dangerous 
 	fantasy.

 	then you are in need of some form of therapy.  not necessarily that
 	of an analyst, but maybe you should learn about guns.  your fear is
 	seems to be based in ignorance and false knowledge.  you see a person
 	with a gun and you feel threatened.  why is this so?  have you any
 	legitimate basis for this?  any first-hand experience that lends
 	validity to your fears?  or are your fears based on mediated experience,
 	i.e. the anecdotes of others such as network news?  i trust you can
 	see the lack of legitimacy in such mediated inputs?
 
 	and why are you afraid of the people as mentioned above?  forgive me,
 	but you sound afraid to the point of paranoia.  perhaps you should talk
 	to someone about this.  i am not saying this to be rude or fascetious,
 	but i think anyone with fear as deep and baseless as yours *seems* to
 	be needs some sort of help.  living in fear really sucks, even if it
 	is only when around people with guns in the back country.
 
 	tell me: would you be as fearful of a park ranger who was right in 
 	front of you with their side arm in clear view?  why or why not?
