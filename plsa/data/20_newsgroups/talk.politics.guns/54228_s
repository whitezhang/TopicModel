 |lady not only killed her attacker, but chased him down to do it!  all
 |four of her shots, fired after she had been shot, struck the perp.  atta
 |girl!  the bullet entered her on a downward angle, went through the apex
 |of her heart, down through the diaphragm, clipped her liver and
 |destroyed her spleen.  it then exited her back leaving a tennis ball
 |sized hole.  she died about six times on the operating table, but was
 |out of the hospital in 15 days and was back on full duty in eight
 |months!  she was off duty at the time and not wearing her vest.  she was
 |on her way home so happened to have her gun.  no, she doesn't think
 |civilians should have the same rights.  sigh.
 
 well, if police think they are so special that only _they_ are worthy
 of self-defense, perhaps we start putting the arm on police; maybe
 we should start demanding that police are only police when on-duty,
 that after that they are just like the ordinary disarmed helpless
 chumps they consider "civilians."
 
 let's prohibit arms carrying by police when off-duty. or, if they make
 the assertion that "well, i need to maintain my gun" let's make it
 regulation that they can carry an unloaded firearm home, that it's
 only fair that they be just as helpless as poor schmuck coming home
 from his computer operator job...
 
 nra director/ex-san jose cop leroy pyle states in the latest swat
 magazine that anti-cops better watch out for this schism between
 rkba folks and the police. he asks the rhetorical question of 'what
 if what's left of the gun lobby starts demanding the disarmament
 of the police?"
 
 well, i guess anti-gun cops who think only they should be armed,
 along with the wealthy and politically connected, should be made
 to realize that screwing can cut in ways they have yet to imagine.
