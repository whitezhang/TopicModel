 ok, here goes.  yes folks, i realize i have stuck my foot in my mouth
 quite a few times already so please let me make some clarifications.  my
 inaccurate information in my posts was due to lack of knowledge.  thanks
 to you kind (and some not so kind) people i am learning.   some people
 have given me several good points to ponder and i see how i was wrong.
 in no way was this inaccurate information supposed to be trying to
 further the anti-gun cause.  i have said several times before (but
 nobody seemed to be listening) that i am pro-gun and anti-gun-control.
 
 as far as the race can of worms that i have opened up i have only one
 thing to say - i am in no way prejudiced.  some of the things i have
 stated were said to demonstrate that i am not prejudiced and/or a racist
 but i have been accused of being too aware of race and prejudiced.  i will not
 say anymore about that subject because no matter what i say it will be the
 wrong thing.
 
 boy, what a start to being on a new group.  oh well, things have been
 worse in my life.
 
 i hope this clears things up but i guess that will remain to be seen.
 
 by for now,
 
 jason
