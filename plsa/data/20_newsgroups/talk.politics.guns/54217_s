 excerpted from a letter i wrote a while ago:
 
      although less apparent to those who have not researched
 the facts, personal protection is as legitimate a reason  as
 sport for the private citizen to own a gun.  the most recent
 research  is  that  of dr. gary kleck of the  florida  state
 university  school of criminology.1  he found that  handguns
 are  more  often  used by victims to defeat  crime  than  by
 criminals to commit it (645,000 vs. 580,000 respectively  in
 this  study).  these figures are even more encouraging  when
 you  consider the number of crimes that never occur  because
 of  the  presence  of a gun in the hands  of  a  law-abiding
 private  citizen.  in a national institute of justice  study
 of  ten state prisons across the country they found that 39%
 of  the  felons  surveyed had aborted  at  least  one  crime
 because  they believed that the intended victim was  armed.,
 and  57% agreed that "most criminals are more worried  about
 meeting an armed victim than they are about running into the
 police."2
      one  of the most heinous of crimes is that against  the
 women  of  this country.  it has been my recent  observation
 that  more  women  are purchasing handguns  for  defense  in
 response  to  the  present danger of these  assaults.   this
 should be taken as encouraging news if the events of orlando
 florida  are any indicator.  in the late 1960's  the  female
 populace was plagued with a series of brutal assaults;  just
 the  publicity of the record number of women buying guns and
 obtaining training resulted in an 88% decrease in  rape  for
 that  area,  the  only city of its size in  the  country  to
 experience a decrease of crime for that year.  additionally,
 a 1979 us justice department study of 32,000 attempted rapes
 showed  that overall, when rape is attempted, the completion
 rate  is 36%. but when a woman defends herself with  a  gun,
 the completion rate drops to 3%.
