 i watched it live, and have re-watched it several times, and from the press  
 vantage point, there was only one starting point visible, where the tank  
 punched in on the windward side, and the winds whipped that fire across the  
 whole, dry, wooden, structure in minutes.  faned by the 30 mph gusts, and the  
 hueys.   if there were other fires started, they were not visible, nor were  
 they needed to cause the flame progression i observed.
