 i'd like to point out that i was in error - "terminator" began posting only 
 six months before he purchased his first firearm, according to private email
 from him.
 
 i can't produce an archived posting of his earlier than january 1992,
 and he purchased his first firearm in march 1992.
 
 i guess it only seemed like years.
 
 back to your regularly scheduled flame fest.
