 hmm... all reports from texas authorities indicate that none of the children
 which the group released showed any signs of child abuse.. given that the same
 results were found the last time the group was investigated for such allegations,
 i can pretty much state that i strongly suspect the government of disinformation
 /deception on this issue.  and about stockpiling weapons/food, many recognized
 religous groups practice maintaining a one years supply of food, and some even
 maintain a supply of weapons and ammunition, why are those two facts grounds 
 for an armed assault?  and from the dollar value of the weapons purchased, 
 if they bought decent firearms it comes out to about one handgun, rifle, and
 shotgun for each adult, with a few extras...  going by that rule, the batf
 best get ready for the fight of their life when they assault alabama...
