 i hope this is a joke... if not, here's my response:
 
 the batf has a history of no-knock raids with poor evidence, often resulting in
 innocent people being killed or suffering injury to person or property.  i will
 not support the batf until they clean up their act... maybe...  as to equipment,
 the batf has damn near anything it wants...  their faults were in intelligence
 (military and civilian definitions apply), tactics (attacking during daylight??), methodology (the fbi stated that it is against government policy to assault
 a position where there are non-combatants/potential hostages without attempting
 negotiations first), and legality.  the batf's jurisdiction is taxes on firearms
 and tobacco.  they are a branch of the department of the treasury.  they have
 very curiously backed away from their claims of illegal weaponry to push the
 child-abuse charges... the batf has no jurisdiction over non-firearms/tobacco
 issues! and the charges of child-abuse had been investigated in the past with
 no violence and no validation.  this was a clear case of first the batf, then
 the fbi, having watched too many rambo movies...  my opinion is that the agent
 in charge should be charged with executing an illegal raid, criminal negligence,
 murder, civil rights violations, and breaking his/her oath to uphold and defend
 the constitution of the us.  the warrant should be unsealed to reveal to the 
 public what justification the batf thought it had in committing an armed assault
 on american citizens.  and while on the issue of investigating this issue,
 the randy weaver case and the johnny lawmaster case should be investigated for
 batf wrongdoing.

 btw, if the batf came busting in my windows with concussion grenades, you could damn well bet i would return fire to the utmost of my ability.
