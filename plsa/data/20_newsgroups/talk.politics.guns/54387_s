 here is a letter i sent to david skaggs, (dem, co).  before anybody says
 something, yes the letter is a bit "sharp" in tone.  i have been writting
 reasonable and polite letters to him for years, and all i get in return
 in the hci party line.  since he already is nra f rated, i don't think that
 upsetting him will harm the cause.  sorry if you disagree, but recent events
 in texas really have me pissed.

 representative skaggs,
 
 recently i wrote to you regarding my outrage over the tactics used by the
 bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms, (batf), in texas.  in your response
 you stated that "events in texas underscore the need for stricter gun control
 legislation to keep guns out of the hand of groups such as the branch davidians.
 my question to you is, "what grounds would you use to deny them access to 
 firearms?"  best i can tell this statement underscores your apparent total
 ignorance of the subject, and highlights your personal bias against firearms.
 i say this because there are only two possible paths of "gun control" which you
 could have been referencing.
 
 either:
 1) you were talking about their access to semi-automatics firearms.  in this
 case i should point out that semi-automatic firearms are legal in most areas of
 this country, including texas and colorado.  in addition the members of the
 "cult" have never been convicted of any crimes which would deny them the ability
 to purchase these weapons.  so under what grounds would you deny them these
 guns?  their religion?  the fact they they live in a large group alone by
 themselves?  because you consider them to be a cult?  maybe i consider your
 church to be a cult!
 
 this line of reasoning by you borders on the concept of "thought crimes."  you
 and pat robertson should really get along.
 
 2) you were referring to the alleged fully automatic weapons possessed by the
 "cult."  under current us law, fully automatic weapons have been covered by
 some of the strictest gun control laws in this nation.  so if david koresh
 illegally possessed them, he would have had to circumvent some of the strictest
 laws we have.  how will more laws help?  by the way, it has been reported that
 david koresh possessed a federal firearms license which would have permitted 
 him to possess fully automatic weapons.  if true, the 85 people who perished
 monday in the fire, died so that the federal government could collect a couple
 hundred dollars in taxes on guns david koresh didn't declare.
 
 i have heard claims that they were "stockpiling weapons."  yet considering the
 number of people in the complex, even 200+ weapons would not have been out of
 line with gun ownership statistics for all of texas.  what's next?  a siege of
 dallas/ft worth for alleged "stockpiling?"
 
 face it david skaggs, you have voted for virtually every gun control law that
 has passed through congress, yet you claim that you are only for "reasonable"
 restrictions.  bull****!   handgun control inc. is struggling to maintain
 250,000 paid members, while the nra has just exceeded 3,000,000 members.  they
 are still growing at a rate of 2,000 new members per day.  driving around your
 district i see nra stickers every day.  in eight plus years of living here i
 have only seen one hci bumper sticker.  when you vote for your "reasonable"
 gun control laws, are you really representing your district, or are you
 representing sarah bradys'?
 
 
 					thank you,
