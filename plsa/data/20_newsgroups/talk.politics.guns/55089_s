 not when the power has been cut off for weeks on end.  any generators are
 no doubt out of fuel, too.  so all they would have is wood stoves and
 kerosene lanters (maybe).  it is alleged that the tanks pushing in the
 walls knocked over the lanters, starting the fire.  remember, the fbi
 had bugs which they even used (illegally) to eavesdrop on private
 conversations with the lawyers.  if a suicide order were given they
 would have known it in time.  if the feds had been concerned they would
 have had emergency equipment ready.  not an hour or so later, not
 leaving the water they turned off, off.  they could have turned it back
 on.  they just didn't wanna.  scores to settle...
