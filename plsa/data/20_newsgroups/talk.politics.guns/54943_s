 rather, people kill people with guns.  the sad truth is: sometimes that is
 good, or at least, better than the alternative.
 
 >but let's ignore guns for defence and/or crime and look at gun accidents.
 
 ok.  there are about 1400 fatal firearm accidents per year [1], and the
 number has been in decline since early this century [2].  most of these
 accidents involve rifles or shot guns, not handguns.

 in fact there are both guns and bullets designed specifically for that. 
 the idea that my ruger mark ii bull barrel (a semi-auto 0.22 caliber
 handgun) was designed to kill or hurt people, even for self defense,
 would, i'm sure, come as a surprise to its designer.  it certainly isn't
 why i have it.  it certainly would hurt someone if you shot them with it,
 and might even kill them, but it is simply wrong to say it was designed to
 kill people.
 
 >this is not designed to act as a tool for home  defence where you show
 >someone  that you have a gun and they go "gee, perhaps i should leave".
 
 in fact, that is what happens most of the time.  most self defensive uses
 of firearms don't involve firing any shots.  most criminals would prefer
 not to be shot, and will go to some effort not to be, including doing what
 you say when you point a gun at them.
 
 if you were called on to design a tool, that could be easily carried, to
 immediately stop someone attacking you, what would it be?  a handgun is
 about the best anyone has come up with and experience shows it does work
 the best.[3]
 
 >no, you see the gun was designed to fire that little bullet into a human
 >body and hurt them.  not a tough concept to swallow, for most.
 
 certainly, no one argues that handguns (of the type we are discussing)
 aren't deadly weapons.  however, it simply isn't true to say that all of
 them were designed to kill people.  moreover, what exactly is wrong with
 having deadly weapons?  there are times when it is perfectly legitimate to
 use deadly force, e.g. in self defense.  i consider it not just my right,
 but my duty to defend myself and my family, and that includes having and
 knowing how to use the tools to do that.
 
 "the strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear
 arms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in
 government."

 i think what jefferson said is still true.
 
 >and the trouble with having such an item is often the little bullet goes
 >off into the wrong fleshy target.
 
 not very often compared to other use.[3]
 
 >or else uncle frank gets pissed and blows  away his wife.
 
 this isn't that common either, at least when compared to other uses.  it is
 very rare that a non-violent person will suddenly "get-pissed" and kill
 someone, gun or not.  in most cases, the people who murder have long
 histories of violence.  if you have good reason to believe that these
 people wouldn't kill if they didn't have a gun, feel free to present it.
 
 >having a thing  specificly designed to kill means it is much easier to
 >kill things.  right?
 
 right, but there are times when killing things is called for.  i hope i
 never have to shoot a person, but i've had to kill a number of animals from
 rodents to cows, and when i do, i don't want them to suffer any more than
 is necessary.  i prefer they die instantly, but failing that, i want them
 to drop so i can quickly finish them with the next shot, and failing that,
 i don't want them to go fast or far.  i try to choose the best weapon and
 ammunition i have to try to achieve that goal for the size of animal i'm
 after, but it doesn't always work as i plan.  without belaboring the point,
 people who are overly impressed with the killing or shopping power of guns,
 particularly handguns, haven't used them much for that purpose.

 [2] rkba.002 - declining trend of accidental deaths by firearms
            version 1.1 (last changed on 90/04/23 at 22:28:19)
 
 description
 ===========
 the accidental deaths by firearm per capita has been declining steadily 
 for almost sixty years. in 1932, the accidental deaths by firearm per 
 1,000,000 people was 24.03. in 1987, it was 5.74. the decline has been 
 steady, consistent, and a fairly straight line when plotted. at the rate 
 of the last sixty years, it will reach zero sometime around 2025 ad.
 
 conclusion
 ==========
 firearms have been a declining factor in accidental deaths for over 
 sixty years, despite rising per-capita gun ownership.
