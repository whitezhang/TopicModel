 
 in the videos of the original batf attack on the bd church, did anyone
 happen to see batf agents on the highest structure, where koresh's
 room was? i don't recall seeing batf agents higher than the roof of the
 lowest structures, so i made an assumption that batf helos did the
 firing down into the tower. any other info on how the rounds came
 through the roof?
