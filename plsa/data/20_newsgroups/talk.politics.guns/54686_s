 on the subject of cs/cn/tear gas: when i received my initial introduction to
 tear gas, the first thing that came to mind was the location of the exit.  if
 there had been anything in the way, corners to negotiate, doors to open, or 
 any other obstacles to movement, i would have had a difficult time exiting the
 chamber.  and any concentration of tear gas is hazardous to individuals with
 respiratory problems, and the wearing of soft contact lenses in a tear gas 
 contaminated area is considered a real bad idea.  so hoping the bd's would
 peaceably come strolling out the door after being gassed is a bit unrealistic.
 if they could have found the door, having them staggering out retching wouldn't
 be too far fetched.  throw in the factor of 50-51 days of being under siege and
 subject to psychological warfare, and all bets on functional abilities are off.
 anybody tried to get amnesty international to jump in on this one?
