 	i dont know.  the usual practice would be for the government
 to confiscate the children and put them into the "system".  after they
 are deprogrammed of course.
 
 	the government is capable of incredible evils in the name of
 "child protection".  much of the time "child protection" concerns
 itself with protecting the child from its natural parents.  once its
 in the "system", the government's concern for the child tends to 
 go to zero. 
 
 	it may not be as bad as roman behavior, but it could hardly
 be described as "kindly"....unless your a believer in the intrinsic
 goodness of the government.
