 and why is this freeman?  even if a pro-gun person doesn't know what they are
 talking about there is always the possibility that they will learn a thing or
 two.  i am and will continue to post even if people get angry with what i have
 to say.  i have several good sources of material now that i know where to look
 so calm down.

 ah, freeman seems to forget from my statement that i am learning.  i have also
 asked several of the not-so-hostile folks on this group for sources of
 information to read.  do you think, freeman, that maybe this means i am
 interested in learning?  i think it does because as you said people who don't
 know anything won't be good for the pro-gun cause.

 another good habit to get into is to realize that not everyone is you freeman
 and accept mistakes.  sure, maybe it could have been some type of
 misinformation being slung by some anti-gun nut but it wasn't.  i made my
 statement to inform everyone of this and everyone who replied said don't worry
 about it but also to learn as much as you can.  they accepted my mistake and
 gave me sources of information and told me to read as much as possible.  i have
 read several posts of yours and have found them informative.  why don't you
 give me the same chance?
