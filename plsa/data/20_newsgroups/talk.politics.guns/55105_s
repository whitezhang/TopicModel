 they did have the proper equipment.  the problem is that they went about
 things the wrong way.  the atf should have served the warrant in a
 peacable manner instead of going in there like a bunch of rambos with
 guns blazing.  i'm not trying to excuse what david koresh did.  i'm
 just saying that the atf (henceforth to be known as the cigarette cops :-)
 went about the "raid" in an improper manner.

 let the fbi, customs, and local police officers do the atf's job.  we
 don't need them anymore!!!  the cigarette cops are just leftovers
 from prohibition days.  they are an anachronism!

 including you?  what if the cigarette cops kicked down your door and
 cut you in half with a machine gun?  this could actually happen.
 maybe they get the wrong address and then raid *your* home, for example.
 it's happened before and it can happen *again*.  i have heard of more
 than one instance of a no-knock raid going sour.  just recently i
 heard about a case in which police raided this guy's home because they
 thought he had dope or something.  the guy blew both of the officers
 away and he didn't go to jail for it.  the judge hearing the case
 ruled that the man was acting in self-defense.

 are you sure that that would have been the way to go?  surely the fbi
 and atf could have handled this fiasco better.  they didn't have to
 massacre all those people.  as stimpy said in "fake dad", "shame, shame,
 double shame!"  the fbi and atf should be ashamed of theirselves.
