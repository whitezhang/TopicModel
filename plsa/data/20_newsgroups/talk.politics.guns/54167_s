 you're getting warmer.  the 'little thing in the trigger' has to be
 depressed before the trigger can move.  what this means is the damned
 thing won't go off until the trigger is pulled.  this makes it just
 about (there have been some problems, but we're assuming the gun is
 functioning correctly..) as safe as a revolver.  the gun when working
 correctly is totally drop safe.
 
 now, in police work this is a consideration.  there is not a single
 documented case i'm aware of where a police officer was killed because
 he failed to operate the safety on his firearm.  there are quite a few
 documented cases where criminals got hold of the cops gun and couldn't
 figure out how to get the safety off in time to use the gun, thus the
 proprietary nature of the safety (to the criminal at least) very likely
 prevented the office from getting shot.
 
 the purpose of a safety is to make the gun safe from unintentional fire.
 this does not mean it should be so complicated as to slow down
 intentional use!  thus the glock safety is perfectly adequate from a
 'safety' standpoint, but not necessarily the most desirable from the
 standpoint of open carry where it is easily grabbed by somebody else.
 by this criteria it does make a lot of sense as a concealed carry piece.
 from the standpoint of police use, it is no better (or worse) than a
 revolver as far as being 'proprietary' to the officer in the method of
 firing it.
 
 the ideal solution may someday be biometric sensing of the user so that
 the firearm can't be used by anybody but it's owner, but for now the
 wide variety of safety systems helps, unless the criminal happens to be
 familiar with that particular type of firearm.
