     the lethality in small part, but mostly what i found frightening 
 was the fact that they were wielded by people who believed that they 
 ate breakfast every morning with jesus christ. now i wasn't there in 
 galilee back in the roman occupation, so i don't know for certain that 
 david koresh was not jesus christ, but i strongly suspect that he was 
 not (even aside from the fact of never having seen them in a photograph 
 together).

     i admit i can't cite a specific, but if there isn't a law against 
 purchasing grenade components and assembling them into functioning units 
 then perhaps we need one. all second ammendment arguments aside, i'm just 
 not sure that i like the idea of private citizens with hand grenades.
