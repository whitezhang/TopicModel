 indeed.  larry king had the two attorneys (whose clients are now
 dead) of koresh and another davidian on his show last night.  their
 discussions with the survivors differ from the fbi account.  the
 attorneys say that they were told that the tanks knocked over lanterns
 in the compound which started the fires.
 
 government spokespeople have lied and contradicted each other 
 throughout this whole affair.  i'll wait for some better evidence before
 i form an opinion.
