 for those of you still unsure whether this is satire, the jury is still out:
 
     "also yesterday, even though the compound no longer exists, the
      us attorney's office here released formerly sealed documents,
      including a search warrant and related affidavits, that authorities
      planned to use when the siege was over.
 
     "these documents did not include the original warrants the bureau of
      alcohol, tobacco, and firearms had in late february, which to this
      day have never been released.
 
     "...one of the documents indicated the agency planned to seek
      samples of koresh's handwriting not only to verify that he had
      signed for some gun purchases, but also that he espoused
      'certain doctrines hostile to law enforcement and particularly
      the atf.'"
 
 so, one of the charges against koresh seems to be contempt of cop -- he
 expressed hostility to the batf.  that chilly feeling in your gonads is 
 perfectly normal, folks... it should go away in about 51 days.
 
         the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.

 that should save them the trouble of subpoena-ing samples.  heavens knows 
 i want to cooperate fully, meinherren.
