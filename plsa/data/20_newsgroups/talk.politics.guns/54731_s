 kratz comments above show otherwise.

 bingo - now the question is, does the glock's qualify?  let's see
 the evidence that kratz uses.

 but first an aside.  having an air gun proves nothing.  moreover,
 my comments are based on what kratz writes.  he's free to argue that
 he babbles in text but actually knows something off-line.

 harder than what?  i note that almost all revolvers work the same way,
 so it can't be "harder than revolvers".
 
 >every article that i have read can't be wrong about the damn thing.
 
 sure they can.  (moreover, we know now that kratz' sample is
 unrepresentative.)  we can look at the reasoning.  it is basically
 "these glocks are dangerous because they're not like my 1911/s&w third
 generation."  part of that is true, but since those same people don't
 claim that revolvers, which share the relevant property, are
 dangerous, we see that the argument fails.
 
 >me to quote my sources because i don't keep a ton of gun magazines and/or
 
 why would i care?  i'm not looking for more bogus reasoning.

 one can make hundreds of simple statements without having anyone
 "getting right on your ass".  one merely has to make accurate simple
 statements.  then you get "attaboy"s by mail and publically.
 
 accuracy is a severe burden, but most of us manage it.
