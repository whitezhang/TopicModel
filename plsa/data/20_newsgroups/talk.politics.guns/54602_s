 the branch davidians were not violent and were not planning to start
 violence.
  
 when the bd compound was assaulted by the atf the bd did fire back.
 but they agreed to a cease fire and they allowed the atf to care for
 their wounded.  the bd even released the atf agents they captured.  it
 is clear from the release of the agents and allowing the atf medical
 attention that the bd were not looking for trouble.
  
 if the bd were violent they would have held the atf agents as
 hostages.  they would not have released them like they did.  if they
 had kept the agents hostage they could have used them as bargening
 chips for medical attention etc.
  
 a big thing is being made of the bd collection of weapons but no one
 has shown that they had any plans to use them.  it is also apparent
 that the bd did not have any military training.  if they had, they
 could have dug bunkers and trenches and increased their
 fortifications.  they could have shot out the lights and speakers.  it
 appears that the bd were not violent, they shot back at the attacking
 atf agents out of panic.  there were shots fired on the last day but
 they were in response to the fbi attack on the compound with armor.
  
 all the violence in waco was initiated by the federal agents, not the
 bd.
