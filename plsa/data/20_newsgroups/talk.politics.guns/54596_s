 or, did anyone notice that when clinton referred to the davidians as
 'religious fanatics' that a round of spontaneous applause burst forth from
 the reporters ? 
 
 to me this was not only in poor taste, but it showed the media's bias and
 hostility to anyone not of the politically correct stripe.  no wonder they
 have been cheerleading for the kgbatf and the fbi during this whole affair.

 civilization is the process of setting man free from men."
