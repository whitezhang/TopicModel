 hmm.  i beg to differ.  it will probably make a big difference at some
 point.

 thankfully, it is true that the majority go through life without
 having to use a firearm.  howver, there are situations where firearms
 are the most effective means of self protection.  what other means do
 you propose as equally effective?

 new to this country? new to political theory?
 alas, i was speaking of principle.  without principle, all attempts at
 republican forms of gov't are futile.  there are times when public and
 political opinion are contrary to principle, which is why we have a
 constitution which enumerates gov't powers and presumes certain
 rights.  a major reason for this was to prevent a tyranny of the
 majority.

 this is exactly why law should be based on reasoned thought, not
 immediate perception.  of course, it doesn't always work that way.
 fortunately, while there are no guarantees, logic sometimes does
 prevail.  and, if not, there are still means for correction.  
 as far as "enough active voters" are concerned, that is still
 an open question until the vote is made.

 you portray a possible scenario for the future.  but, how will you
 silence rkba supporters right now?  as long as public debate is
 allowed, such debate will continue. if we allow public debate to be
 restricted or denied, then we will get a gov't we deserve.
