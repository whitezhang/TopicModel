 and you shouldn't, as the matches kill more kids.  so why are you bleating
 about guns?

 it may be tired, but it is true.

 no, that's not right either.  people who have both easy access and the
 desire to kill, kill people.  considering that people who have the
 desire to kill turn that into easy access ....  (haven't you folks
 learned anything from either prohibition or the war on drugs?)
 
 if you don't affect the desire, you're wasting your time, not to
 mention the other costs incurred.

 good for them.  i note that the tm folks make the same argument.  if
 you'll pay their expesnses ($21 million for a reasonable size city),
 they promise to meditate away all crime, disease, etc.  at least
 they're not promising to jail me if i don't go along with their little
 plan - they're going to just sit in a room and fly, leaving me alone.

 ah, but we have evaluated gun control using before-after and it
 doesn't work to reduce crime.  what is the point?  we can't claim that
 it is symbolic, as people do get jailed.

 no, they're essentially saying "we hope this will keep you from
 noticing that we're not doing anything useful".  pissing away
 resources isn't "caring".

 nope, you'll merely be ignored, as wright, rossi, and daly were after
 finishing "under the gun".  they were supposed to prove that gun
 control worked, so ....

 so, who gassed them?  given their previous experience with thugs who
 threw grenades before yelling "we're from the govt and we're here to
 help you", would a rational person think that the feds had their best
 interests at heart?  would you "know" that the gas was "non-lethal"?
