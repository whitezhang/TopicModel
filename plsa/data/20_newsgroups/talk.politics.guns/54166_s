 also, you need to consider our legal system.  since any of these things
 can be lethal, you are going to have a hard time explaining why you applied 
 lethal force when you didn't think it was necessary.  (if you thought lethal
 force was necessary, you wouldn't be using rubber bullets, would you?) ouch.  
 if you are justified in shooting them at all, you are justified in using 
 the best self defense ammunition you can get your hands on.  it might actually
 improve the legal outcome.
 
 this is why hollow points hold up in court.  they are safer for you, safer
 for innocent by standers, (don't as a rule go through the perp) and actually
 safer for the perp.  if you are using military hard ball, you may have to 
 shoot him 'many' times, where one or two hollow points might stop him and 
 do the job.  as a rule, the fewer wound channels, the better the chance 
 for his surviving the incident.
