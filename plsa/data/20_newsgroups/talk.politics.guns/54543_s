 here are a few ideas:
 
 1) a free library card so they can look up the fbi
    uniform crime report which shows how good hci is
    at lying through their teeth,
 
 2) a free rtd transit pass which will allow anti-gunners
    to tour south central los angeles and convince
    people living there that they don't need guns to protect
    themselves because the police will do it for them 
    (don't lose the pass, you'll need it to get out),
 
 3) a free bus ride to vermont, which has almost no gun
    control and, curiously enough, almost no crime either,
 
 4) a free calculator, since anti-gunners have heretofore
    been unable to figure out what a small percentage of
    the guns owned in america are used to commit violent crime.
