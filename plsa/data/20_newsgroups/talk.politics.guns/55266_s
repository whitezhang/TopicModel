 no crime here.
 also no substantiation of your claim that koresh said this.  i for one have
 never heard this mentioned before.  where did you hear it?

 up to which moment?  the one where you decided that anyone who claims to be
 god no longer has the protection of the constitution?
 what happened to the separation of church and state?

 i have yet to see any evidence of *this*, either.  from what i hear the
 *original* warrant (the reason for the feb. raid) is still sealed.  what are
 "unsealed" seem to be warrants taken out after the initial raid.

 funny, i haven't seen any of these "interviews."
 interesting that when the social services agencies investigated koresh on
 these previous charges, they found absolutely no evidence of abuse.

 funny, i don't remember hearing anything about childrens' statements,
 either.  where did you say you heard all this?
 
 what *i* heard was that none of the children who left the compound early in
 the seige exhibited any signs typical of abuse, physical or mental.  this
 from the newspaper and national tv news.
 
 did you also hear that it's the job of the batf and the fbi to lay siege to
 homes where child abuse is suspected?  i thought you did.

 "clearly?"  please tell us what koresh was doing that can be construed as
 other than "minding his own business" before the batf raided the place.

 your logic just amazes me.  i think your grandparents who died in
 auschwitz would be turning over in their graves if they could hear how
 cavalierly you throw away people's protection of law because you think
 they're "scary" and "not the sort of person you'd want your daughter to
 date."  what sort of people do you suppose the nazis thought your
 grandparents were?  probably not the sort they'd want their little
 frauleins dating...

 and next i suppose you'll tell us exactly who these "well-trained killers"
 have killed?

 because you said so, right?  right.

 so someone with a different background, say someone who didn't claim to be
 the messiah, in your book could shoot and kill federal law enforcement
 officials would be a good citizen whose crusade enjoys our support?

 worth the paper it's printed on.
 
 you're amazing, simply amazing.
