 attention please!
 
 according to the rules of usenet flame wars, once a discussion degenerates
 to the point where hitler is mentioned, that flame war may be declared
 ended.  i would like to take this opportunity to do that now.  clearly
 further discussion is not useful with the current set of facts, and the
 current name calling and invocation of hitler's name is not productive even
 by the standards of usenet talk groups.
 
 if you must continue, please don't discuss this in misc.legal.  it's not
 about the law.  if you would like to discuss the law as it applies to the
 waco incident, please ask questions of the form: "if the fbi started the
 fire accidentally, who would be legally responsible for the deaths".
 
 note that followups are set not to include misc.legal.
