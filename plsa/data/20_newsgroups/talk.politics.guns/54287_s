         to amend section 1531.01 of the revised code to add mourning dove 
 to the game bird list and permit the chief of the division of wildlife in 
 the department of natural resources to regulate the hunting of mourning 
 doves, and to make an appropriation.
  
 this would allow the hunting of mourning doves in ohio and give the 
 sportsman something they have been pushing for.
