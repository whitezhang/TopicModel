 i'm not sure were this thread has been before i popped in, but i've never
 thought of waiting periods as having anything to do with training or
 competence. i just can't imagin any valid reason for having a gun that
 can't wait a few days. i can think of plenty of bad reasons for not
 wanting a waiting period: i want to buy a gun and kill so-and-so right
 now, i've crossed the state line to buy a gun illegally and i can't
 afford to spend the night here, etc.
 
 i'm not a big fan of guns, but i feel that it is important to guard
 american's rights to own them. on the other hand, we license and regulate
 many things without seriously impeding anyones constitutional rights.
