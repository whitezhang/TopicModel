 there were some significant differences.  whereas the branch davidians are
 reported to have gotten along rather well with their neighbors, the move
 people are generally conceded to have gone far out of the way to antagonize
 their black neighbors, using loudspeakers to all hours of the night, keeping
 large piles of garbage, promoting rat and insect infestation, and allegedly
 threatening to kidnap their neighbors' children.
 
 still the same sort of questions regarding use of force remain in that case.
