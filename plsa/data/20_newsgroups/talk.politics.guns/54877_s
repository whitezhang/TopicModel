 the best reason to abolishing the atf is that they don't have enough
 to do.  if the organization were disbanded and its duties assigned to
 the fbi (firearms) and irs (tobacco and alcohol).  both of these
 organizations have enough to do.  the fbi is probably not going to try
 to get a criminal charge of illegal machine gun for having a broken
 gun.
  
 there have been postings stating that law enforcement should be
 divided and and weak.  but there is nothing more dangerous to
 liberties than a law enforcement agency without enough criminals to
 chase.  the atf is one and look at the trouble it started in
 waco.
