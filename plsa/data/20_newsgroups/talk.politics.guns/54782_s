 that's an interesting statement.  there's quite a difference between
 hollywood's "old west" and the real one.  yes, there were drunks,
 saloons, mining camps, and thugs.  however, as mcgrath showed, the
 thugs preyed almost exclusively on one another.  mcgrath claims that
 this was due to the fact that no one much cared if someone who
 insisted on getting into a fight got his way, even if he lost, while
 they really did care when thugs preyed on others.

 we haven't figured out that those distinctions don't actually work.
 machine guns have been strictly regulated since 1934.  said regulation
 is both perfect (legally owned machine guns aren't ever used
 criminally) and a complete waste of time (the criminal use of machine
 guns hasn't change at all).  the result - we're now arguing about
 guns that look like machine guns, but are no different than other
 guns.
