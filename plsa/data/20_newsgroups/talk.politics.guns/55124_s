 ob ill-wind-and-all-that:  with bill the prez in there, at least the
 anti-gunners are out of the closet.  the provision that any existing
 so-called "assault weapons" die with their current owners was worked
 into h.r. 3371 (102nd congress bill number) a couple of years ago,
 in a complicated way that the anti's claimed was a "drafting error."
