        while i wouldn't be too terribly impressed with anybody who got
 to be paranoid based on either usenet in general or phill hallam-baker's
 comments in general, you'd be surprised.
  
        for most people, if you accuse them of something long enough and
 loud enough, to enough people, they start to ask why they're bothering
 to fight it.
  
        if nothing you do will be considered right, why bother to do right?
 it's pretty basic human nature.

        what an amazing thing.  i didn't realize that over a hundred million
 gun owners all posted to tpg.
  
        even if *all* the posts in talk.politics.guns illustrated what
 you say they illustrate, it would still only reflect the written
 personas (which is often different from face-to-face) of a very, very
 small and select group.
  
        anybody who seriously generalizes any attitudes or positions on
 usenet to the general population of any country either doesn't care
 about accuracy or needs to have a few realities explained to them.
  
 >usenet as a whole
 >disproves it of humanity as a whole.
  
         speaking of which...
  
       most of the "readership" posts i've seen put the most read
 newsgroups at about 160,000 readers, a number i have a feeling is
 fairly inflated.  the posters, rare and regular, are themseleves a
 very tiny minority of that group.  and the whole of usenet readers
 are themselves a very distorted sample of humanity.
  
        if anything, the only real thing you can get out of the relative
 sample of usenet readers is that we've got too much equipment and too
 much time available to us.

         proof that guns don't make you safer is that if you buy one the
 government will show up and kill you?
  
         tell me, if the government took away the voting rights of
 everybody who exercised their free speech, would that then be proof
 that free speech squelches political activity?
  
         you are equating two things with each other that don't.
  
 >see even in the paranoid mindset of tpg there are good reasons

         phill, if you really believe that the various posts on
 computer nets represents *either* most of the poster's in person
 personalities *or* the general public's general opinions, then
 i have some serious reservations about your grasp on reality.
  
         but don't expect you really do believe that.  it's simply
 a convenient way to make your point, and hopefully make those
 people you don't like look bad.
