 "we" know because the area that the gun shop/shooting range is in is right on
 the border of the west side of chicago.  that is a gang infested area.  there
 are many, many bad things going on in that area.  also, i have several friends
 that live very close to that area who have had problems with some of these
 folks.  by the way, where did i say that they were minorities?  do you think
 that only minorities have gangs?  not so.  as far as the quotes are concerned
 it was totally obvious that they weren't just practicing for marksmanship.  i
 don't know about you but i have never seen anyone else practice marksmanship by
 taking their gun out of their coat as fast as possible and start shooting.  if
 you would have been there andy it would've been obvious to you too.  of course
 it might not have been.  who knows.  all i do know is that i was there, i live
 here and i know that they were gang bangers.  when you live here long enough it
 becomes pretty easy to spot them via gang colors, gang signs, etc.  one last
 thing.  my sister is a social worker.  she makes it her point to find these
 things out (gang signs, colors, etc) because it is in her best interest to do
 so.  she is nice enough to let me know these things so i can watch out for
 myself as i live right on the border of the west side of the city. enough said.
