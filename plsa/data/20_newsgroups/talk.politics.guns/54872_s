 it wasn't "invented", but was supposed by the writers of the constitution
 to be a universal, pre-existing right. howsomever...

 hmmm.  you need to spend some time in a library, son.
 
 when the bill of rights was written, in addition to the (muzzleloading)
 shotgun and pistol you mention we had:
 
  - rifles in calibers ranging from around .30 to .69 caliber and up.
  - cannon with various different projectiles to choose from (and owned
    by civilians).
  - breech-loading rifles
 
 in addition, semiautomatic and full-automatic firearms had been patented
 and/or demonstrated by several people in various places during the preceding
 century or so.

 sounds good.  any refererences to this actually happening, or is it
 just exaggeration for effect following one or more incidents of someone
 firing a handful of shots from something that may or may not be an
 uzi, semi- or full-auto?
 
 >just because someting was good once, does not mean it will be forever.
 
 until the root conditions that justified it go away (criminal behavior,
 either private or government, which should be defended against), there's
 no reason it should go away.
