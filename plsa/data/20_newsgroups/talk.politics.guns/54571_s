 ah, clarification by obfuscation.
 
 actually, the words "a well regulated milita, being necessary to the
 security of a free state" is a present participle, used as an
 adjective to modify 'militia', which is followed by the main clause of
 the sentence, the subject being 'the right', the verb 'shall'.  it
 asserts that the right to keep and bear arms is essential for
 maintaining a milita.  the sentence doesn't restrict the right, or
 state or imply possession of the right by anyone or anything other
 than the people.  all it does is make a positive statement regarding a
 right of the people. the people, as in you and me, as in the first,
 fourth, ninth, tenth, as well as the second amendment.
 the existence of this right is assumed - it is not granted by the
 amendment. there is no stated or implied condition relating the right
 to bear arms to the necessity of a well-regulated militia to the security of
 a free state.
 in other words, the entire sentence says that the right to keep and
 bear arms is unconditional.

 the final word on liberties and rights should not belong "to the
 many".  that is why we have a constitution.  otherwise, a tyrrany of
 the majority can ensue from "popular" opinion, a concept which you
 should be familiar with from the federalist papers.
