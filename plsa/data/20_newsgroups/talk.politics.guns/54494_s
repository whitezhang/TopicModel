 	not so, arnie.  you forget repeating arms (which include machine
 guns, gatling-style guns, etc...), cannon, rifles, and let's not forget
 the bullets they managed to use.  everything from rocks to lead to
 a couple iron balls with a chain between them.  if you think warfare
 is brutal today, buddy you have no idea how brutal things can get.
