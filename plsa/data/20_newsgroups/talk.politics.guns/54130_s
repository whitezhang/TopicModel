 preliminary data regarding similar research into kangaroo overpopulation
 in australia do not in any way support the cost-effectiveness of this
 approach.  it _may_ be cost-effective for deer--if you quietly overlook
 the fact that the net cost to the state of deer hunting is _negative_
 (i.e. a profit) because the (majority of) hunters pay for licences.
 the cost comparisons are probably being done assuming that people have
 to be employed to cull the animals, which is not in fact the case.
 you figure people are going to pay for licences to implant contraceptive
 pellets or spread baits?
 
 there has been a fair bit of discussion about this here recently,
 because the kangaroo population in the grounds of the governor-
 general's residence has now reached plague proportions.  despite the
 whines of the rampant animal-libbers, the most effective method of
 controlling the population is still considered to be controlled
 shooting.

 some people take satisfaction (imho, legitimate satisfaction) in eating
 food that they have harvested themselves.  the pleasure derived from
 hunting is the same as that you get from eating fruit and vegetables
 grown in your own garden (and, in general, game meat is probably much 
 freer of unpleasant chemicals than what you buy from the butcher or
 the supermarket).

 by "cannot now be justified" i guess you mean that you personally
 don't see any justification.  fine--but what makes your opinion
 so important?

 certainly the last point is correct.  if politicians don't see any
 votes for themselves in opposing stupid legislation or in developing
 and supporting measures which might be effective in reducing the 
 incidence of violent crime they won't do these things.
