 no, they didn't have electrical power, but no, i don't find the idea of
 davidians calmly cooking lunch with gas masks on as the fbi knocks the
 buildings down very credible,either.
 
 it's not like this whole discussion is relevant.  it started when some-
 one made the wholly unsubstantiated allegation that the wood stove ig-
 nited napalm the fbi shot into the buildings.
 
 i'm not a groveling apoligist for the feds, far from it.  but wild ac-
 cusations like this are ridiculous and obfuscate legitimate criticism of
 their conduct in this whole affair.
