 it appears it is time that this article (originally posted by larry
 cipriani last year, and which i saved) gets posted again.  it offers
 as good an analysis of the meaning of the second amendment, especially
 regarding the militia clause, as i have seen.  i have not seen any
 rebuttles with similar bone fides...
 
 enjoy.  (flames to /dev/null)

 			the unabridged second amendment
 
 			      by j. neil schulman
 
 if you wanted to know all about the big bang, you'd ring up carl sagan,
 right ?  and if you wanted to know about desert warfare, the man to call
 would be norman schwarzkopf, no question about it.  but who would you call
 if you wanted the top expert on american usage, to tell you the meaning
 of the second amendment to the united states constitution ?
 
 that was the question i asked a.c. brocki, editorial coordinator of the los
 angeles unified school district and formerly senior editor at houghton
 mifflin publishers -- who himself had been recommended to me as the
 foremost expert on english usage in the los angeles school system.  mr.
 brocki told me to get in touch with roy copperud, a retired professor
 journalism at the university of southern california and the author of
 "american usage and style: the consensus."
 
 a little research lent support to brocki's opinion of professor copperud's
 expertise.
 
 roy copperud was a newspaper writer on major dailies for over three decades
 before embarking on a a distinguished 17-year career teaching journalism at
 usc.  since 1952, copperud has been writing a column dealing with the
 professional aspects of journalism for "editor and publisher", a weekly
 magazine focusing on the journalism field.
 
 he's on the usage panel of the american heritage dictionary, and merriam
 webster's usage dictionary frequently cites him as an expert.  copperud's
 fifth book on usage, "american usage and style: the consensus," has been in
 continuous print from van nostrand reinhold since 1981, and is the winner
 of the association of american publisher's humanities award.
 
 that sounds like an expert to me.
 
 after a brief telephone call to professor copperud in which i introduced
 myself but did not give him any indication of why i was interested, i sent
 the following letter:
 
 "i am writing you to ask you for your professional opinion as an expert in
 english usage, to analyze the text of the second amendment to the united
 states constitution, and extract the intent from the text.
 
 "the text of the second amendment is, 'a well-regulated militia, being
 necessary for the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep
 and bear arms, shall not be infringed.'
 
 "the debate over this amendment has been whether the first part of the
 sentence, 'a well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a
 free state', is a restrictive clause or a subordinate clause, with respect
 to the independent clause containing the subject of the sentence, 'the
 right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.'
 
 "i would request that your analysis of this sentence not take into
 consideration issues of political impact or public policy, but be restricted
 entirely to a linguistic analysis of its meaning and intent.  further,
 since your professional analysis will likely become part of litigation
 regarding the consequences of the second amendment, i ask that whatever
 analysis you make be a professional opinion that you would be willing to
 stand behind with your reputation, and even be willing to testify under
 oath to support, if necessary."
 
 my letter framed several questions about the test of the second amendment,
 then concluded:
 
 "i realize that i am asking you to take on a major responsibility and task
 with this letter.  i am doing so because, as a citizen, i believe it is
 vitally important to extract the actual meaning of the second amendment.
 while i ask that your analysis not be affected by the political importance of
 its results, i ask that you do this because of that importance."
 
 after several more letters and phone calls, in which we discussed terms for
 his doing such an analysis, but in which we never discussed either of our
 opinions regarding the second amendment, gun control, or any other political
 subject, professor copperud sent me the follow analysis (into which i have
 inserted my questions for the sake of clarity):
 
 [copperud:] "the words 'a well-regulated militia, being necessary to the
 security of a free state,' contrary to the interpretation cited in your
 letter of july 26, 1991, constitutes a present participle, rather than a
 clause.  it is used as an adjective, modifying 'militia,' which is
 followed by the main clause of the sentence (subject 'the right', verb
 'shall').  the to keep and bear arms is asserted as an essential for
 maintaining a militia.
 
 "in reply to your numbered questions:
 
 [schulman:] "(1) can the sentence be interpreted to grant the right to keep
 and bear arms solely to 'a well-regulated militia'?"
 
 [copperud:] "(1) the sentence does not restrict the right to keep and bear
 arms, nor does it state or imply possession of the right elsewhere or by
 others than the people; it simply makes a positive statement with respect
 to a right of the people."
 
 [schulman:] "(2) is 'the right of the people to keep and bear arms' granted
 by the words of the second amendment, or does the second amendment assume a
 preexisting right of the people to keep and bear arms, and merely state
 that such right 'shall not be infringed'?"
 
 [copperud:] "(2) the right is not granted by the amendment; its existence
 is assumed.  the thrust of the sentence is that the right shall be
 preserved inviolate for the sake of ensuring a militia."
 
 [schulman:] "(3) is the right of the people to keep and bear arms
 conditioned upon whether or not a well regulated militia, is, in fact
 necessary to the security of a free state, and if that condition is not
 existing, is the statement 'the right of the people to keep and bear arms,
 shall not be infringed' null and void?"
 
 [copperud:] "(3) no such condition is expressed or implied.  the right to
 keep and bear arms is not said by the amendment to depend on the existence
 of a militia.  no condition is stated or implied as to the relation of the
 right to keep and bear arms and to the necessity of a well-regulated
 militia as a requisite to the security of a free state.  the right to keep
 and bear arms is deemed unconditional by the entire sentence."
 
 [schulman:] "(4) does the clause 'a well-regulated militia, being necessary
 to the security of a free state,' grant a right to the government to place
 conditions on the 'right of the people to keep and bear arms,' or is such
 right deemed unconditional by the meaning of the entire sentence?"
 
 [copperud:] "(4) the right is assumed to exist and to be unconditional, as
 previously stated.  it is invoked here specifically for the sake of the
 militia."
 
 [schulman:] "(5) which of the following does the phrase 'well-regulated
 militia' mean: 'well-equipped', 'well-organized,' 'well-drilled,'
 'well-educated,' or 'subject to regulations of a superior authority'?"
 
 [copperud:] "(5) the phrase means 'subject to regulations of a superior
 authority;' this accords with the desire of the writers for civilian
 control over the military."
 
 [schulman:] "(6) (if at all possible, i would ask you to take account the
 changed meanings of words, or usage, since that sentence was written 200
 years ago, but not take into account historical interpretations of the
 intents of the authors, unless those issues can be clearly separated."
 
 [copperud:] "to the best of my knowledge, there has been no change in the
 meaning of words or in usage that would affect the meaning of the
 amendment.  if it were written today, it might be put: "since a
 well-regulated militia is necessary tot he security of a free state, the
 right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be abridged.'
 
 [schulman:] "as a 'scientific control' on this analysis, i would also
 appreciate it if you could compare your analysis of the text of the second
 amendment to the following sentence,
 
 "a well-schooled electorate, being necessary to the security of a free
 state, the right of the people to keep and read books, shall not be
 infringed.'
 
 "my questions for the usage analysis of this sentence would be,
 
 "(1) is the grammatical structure and usage of this sentence and the way
 the words modify each other, identical to the second amendment's sentence?;
 and
 
 "(2) could this sentence be interpreted to restrict 'the right of the people
 to keep and read books' _only_ to 'a well-educated electorate' -- for
 example, registered voters with a high-school diploma?"
 
 [copperud:] "(1) your 'scientific control' sentence precisely parallels the
 amendment in grammatical structure.
 
 "(2) there is nothing in your sentence that either indicates or implies the
 possibility of a restricted interpretation."
 
 professor copperud had only one additional comment, which he placed in his
 cover letter: "with well-known human curiosity, i made some speculative
 efforts to decide how the material might be used, but was unable to reach
 any conclusion."
 
 so now we have been told by one of the top experts on american usage what
 many knew all along: the constitution of the united states unconditionally
 protects the people's right to keep and bear arms, forbidding all
 governments formed under the constitution from abridging that right.
 
 as i write this, the attempted coup against constitutional government in the
 soviet union has failed, apparently because the will of the people in that
 part of the world to be free from capricious tyranny is stronger than the
 old guard's desire to maintain a monopoly on dictatorial power.
 
 and here in the united states, elected lawmakers, judges, and appointed
 officials who are pledged to defend the constitution of the united states
 ignore, marginalize, or prevaricate about the second amendment routinely.
 american citizens are put in american prisons for carrying arms, owning
 arms of forbidden sorts, or failing to satisfy bureaucratic requirements
 regarding the owning and carrying of firearms -- all of which is an
 abridgement of the unconditional right of the people to keep and bear arms,
 guaranteed by the constitution.
 
 and even the american civil liberties union (aclu), staunch defender of the
 rest of the bill of rights, stands by and does nothing.
 
 it seems it is up to those who believe in the right to keep and bear arms to
 preserve that right.  no one else will.  no one else can.  will we beg our
 elected representatives not to take away our rights, and continue regarding
 them as representing us if they do?  will we continue obeying judges who
 decide that the second amendment doesn't mean what it says it means but
 means whatever they say it means in their orwellian doublespeak ?
 
 or will be simply keep and bear the arms of our choice, as the constitution
 of the united states promises us we can, and pledge that we will defend
 that promise with our lives, our fortuned, and our sacred honor ?
