 	while dedicating the holocaust memorial museum, president 
 clinton remarked:
 
 	``the evil represented in this museum is incontestable, 
 but as we are its witness, so must we remain its adversary in the 
 world in which we live, so we must stop the fabricators of history 
 and the bullies as well."
 
 	clinton made this comment shortly after giving janet reno 
 the go-ahead to hastily construct a gas chamber and crematorium
 in waco... on the fiftieth anniversary of the warsaw uprising.
 
 	say, wasn't monday also the anniversary of paul revere's ride?
 is that a clue?
