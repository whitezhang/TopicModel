 while it may mean that in 1993, the relevant meaning comes from 1789.
 moreover, "controlled" doesn't tell you who's doing the controllling.
 
 fletcher's political works, pub'd in 1749, defines a "well-regulated
 militia", that being the relevant phrase, as being an armed people not
 under the control of govt.  the wigged gents who argued about the
 constituion used it in that way.
 
 feel free to provide a 1790s-era reference showing a usage other than
 "individual right, not to be interfered with by govt".
 
 note that the first clause has a meaning - it is a restriction on
 govt military power.  see scarry's university of penn law review
 article for an extended discussion.  the existence of a well-regulated
 militia is a necessary part of that restriction, but it is not sufficient.
