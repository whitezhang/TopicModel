 you know, i was reading 18 u.s.c. 922 and something just did not make 
 sence and i was wondering if someone could help me out.
 
 say u.s.c. 922 :
 
 (1) except as provided in paragraph (2), it shall be unlawful for
 any person to transfer or possess a machinegun.
 
  well i got to looking in my law dictionary and i found that a "person" 
 might also be an artificial entity that is created by government 
 and has no rights under the federal constitution. so, what i 
 don't understand is how a statute like 922 can be enforced on 
 an individual. so someone tell me how my government can tell
 me what i can or cannot possess. just passing a law 
 does not make it law. everyone knows that laws are constitional
 until it goes to court. so, has it ever gone to court, not
 just your run of the mill "ok i had it i am guilty, put me in jail"
 
 has anyone ever claimed that they had a right to possess and was told
 by the supreme court that they didn't have that right?
