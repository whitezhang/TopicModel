 i've yet to meet a group of baptists who were stockpiling cambell's soup
 and m-16's/ar-15's and banging/marrying thirteen yuear olds. you're a sorry
 son of a bitch if you can't draw a distinction between these two things.
 people like you cheapen our constitution by using it to defend sociopaths
 who aren't deserved of it. get a life and chill on the paranoia.
