 the fbi released large amounts of cs tear gas into the compound in
 waco.  cs tear gas is a fine power.  is cs inflammable.  grain dust
 suspended in air can form an explosive mixture, will cs suspended in air
 form an explosive mix? could large quantities of cs have fueled the
 rapid spread of fire in the compound?
