 assuming the fire was caused by lanterns and stoves being knocked about
 by the tanks pushing on the walls (would shake a building pretty good)
 perhaps they didn't flee because fleeing would have meant entering the
 fire from the other side?  like they were surrounded by the fire, and
 rubble, which finally (combined with teargas, and combustion gasses)
 overcame and enveloped them?
 
 in other words they were trapped by the flames, heat, fumes and rubble?
 
 does that sound plausable?  not as dramatic as korash forcing them to
 stay, or shooting them (no shot victims found yet), but plausable...
