 yes, i am pro-gun, and yes, i do disagree with this statement.
 nuclear weapons in and of themselves are dangerous.  radioactive
 decay of plutonium and uranium, as well as the tritium in the
 weapon, tends to be somewhat dangerous to living things.
 (can you say "neutron flux"?)  plus these things have no self-
 defense purposes.  it's kinda hard to justify their use as
 a militia weapon when at best they are meant for battlefield use
 (low-yield weapons) or at worst for industrial target obliteration
 (translation:  cities and population centers).  not to mention that
 for it to be used as a militia weapon and expect the user to live
 requires some sort of launch vehicle . . .
