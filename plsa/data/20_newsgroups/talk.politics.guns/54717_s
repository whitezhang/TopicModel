 let me clarify.  in order to more clearly understand scripture, one must
 look in the context of where the verse is found.  the section you refer
 to here is found in luke 22.  i'd like to start back at verse 35 and i'll
 include it here for the sake of completeness:
 
    then jesus asked them, "when i sent you without purse, bag or sandals,
    did you lack anything?"
    "nothing." the disciples replied.
 
 verse 36 says:  "but now, if you have a purse take it and also a bag; and
     if you don't have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one.  it is written,
     "and he was numbered with the transgressors."
 
 verse 38 says:  the disciples said, "see, lord, here are two swords."
                 "that is enough."  he replied.
 
 what does this all mean?
  
 in verse 35, jesus points out to the disciples that when he sent them out
 previously, they did not need to take anything with them.  their food,
 lodging and transport were often provided through the generosity of others.
 if verse 36, jesus alludes to the change in attitude that is to come in the
 near future.  remember, jesus was saying these things shortly before he was
 to be arrested.  in verse 36, he tells the disciples that they will have
 to take their own possessions and provisions with them.  they will have to
 carry their own purse because there will be no longer any generosity from
 anyone.  and there will be times of peril when they will have to take care
 of themselves.  this was implied by the reference to the sword.  jesus knew
 that he was going to be arrested and labeled as a criminal.  the charges
 brought against him were likely to be passed on to his disciples.
 
 in verse 38, we see that the disciples have taken jesus too literally.  it is
 not the first time that the disciples got his message wrong.  they had done 
 this on several occassions.  instead of understanding the gist of his words,
 they presented him with two swords.  jesus was perhaps taken aback by
 this promptly concludes the discussion by saying, "that is enough."
 
 the disciples could not understand why jesus had to die.  jesus kept telling
 them over and over again that he would soon not be with them but they could
 not grasp this.  they wanted their messiah to be a political leader who would
 lead them in rebellion against the romans.  that is why they were so keen on
 presenting him with the swords.  they had no idea that jesus was referring to
 a different kingdom of which they were to be a part of.  the disciples could
 only perceive of a kingdom on earth rather than the one in heaven.
 
 understand that jesus never intended his followers to take up arms in rebellion.
 this was clearly in evidence in luke 22:51 when jesus rebuked his disciples for 
 using the sword against the servant of the high priest when they came to arrest 
 him.  as further evidence, jesus goes so far as to heal the man injured by the disciples.  jesus did not condone violence as a means for his purpose.
 
 contrast this behaviour with that of david koresh and you will clearly see that
 dk was not jesus as he claimed.  jesus surrendered himself to the authourities
 and allowed himself to be crucified.  he didn't go out in a blaze of glory, but
 rather jesus was executed like a common criminal.  
 
 i hope this makes it a little more clear.
 
 god be with you,
