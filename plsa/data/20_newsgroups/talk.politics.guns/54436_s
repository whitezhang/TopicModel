 could someone email me a usnail address for the nra? i'd like to write them
 a letter encouraging them to see to it very emphatically that the 2nd
 amendment is restored to the form that the founding fathers intended.
 
 people like howard metzenbaum seem very intent on diluting the 2nd amendment
 to the point where it is no effort for the governmentski to do what they
 did in waco.
 
 after all, from what i know of the federalist papers, it is this kind of
 tyranny the 2nd amendment was supposed to be designed to protect against.
 
 honestly! m-60 tanks against the civilian population! attack helicopters!
 
 we need the right to keep and bear anti-tank weapons. actually, if they
 intend to mass armour against the (weakly-armed, at that) civilian population,
 we need the right to field tactical nukes. government tyranny! who would
 have ever thought it would happen here!
 
 i wonder who'se house they'll run tanks through next, because the gov.
 suspects child abuse. maybe yours! maybe mine!
 and what is an illegal weapon (which they have yet to show us), if the
 2nd amendment is designed to do what i believe it is, and the gov. uses
 tanks against you? government self-serving? naaaah. not here.
 
 time was when the u.s. used armour/attack helicopters against small countries.
 now, we're down to using them against to what amounts to a busload and a
 half of civilians.
 
 "first they came for the jews, but i did not stop them, because i was
 not a jew: then they came for the catholics, but i did not stop them
 because i was not a catholic! then they came for the lutherans, but
 there was now no one left to stop them!" rev. martin niemoller.
 (probably didn't get it verbatim, but you get the idea).
 
 if the nra reads this, then never mind about the address.
 god save us!
