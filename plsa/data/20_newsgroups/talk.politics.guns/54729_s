     actually all the liberals i've seen have deplored the burning of 
 children. i would far preferred that the davidians had not set the 
 fire that burned themselves and their children to death, but i don't 
 believe that the responsibility for the fire (or the almost complete 
 absense of attempts to escape the blaze) can be placed at the door of 
 the federal authorities.
