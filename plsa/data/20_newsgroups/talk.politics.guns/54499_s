 	would *you* have come out if you knew the only national tv
 cameras were well over a mile away, and yet the agents with the guns
 were only a few yards away?  they had contact with a lawyer, so i
 am inclined to believe they had an idea of what their situation
 actually was.  this also leads to the conspiracy theory that the
 lawyer had the batf pinned on rights violations if the bd's
 acted as witnesses, hence the arson.  i doubt that one too, but
 it is still quite clear that leaving a safe place to surrender is
 a rather stupid thing to do until that place is no longer safe.
 
 >do you disbelieve everything the fbi says?
 
 	as a matter of course, given how they've allowed no other
 views to be heard.  i'll reserve judgement until the trial, but so
 far as the fbi is concerned their statements carry the same amount
 of weight as photons at rest.

 	ludicrous, yes.  possible, yes.  plausible?  get the jury.

 	that's what gets me too.  it is likely the cult members were
 holed up in an enforced place inside the building.  with a decent arson
 attempt i suspect many of them could have been trapped.  in addition,
 the introduction of cs gas for several hours would have rendered many
 of them immobile if not unconscious when their masks quit.  all the props
 are there, but proving what scene was played is difficult.  the only
 certainty is that the fbi and batf have few witnesses against them.
