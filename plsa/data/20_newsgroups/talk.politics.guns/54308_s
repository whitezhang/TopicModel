 greetings,
     specious reasoning alert!  sorry folks, i don't like gun control
 too much, but this is just too crazy.
 
     1)  the main gun control law is similar to (or even based on) a
 german gun control law.
 
     2)  germany was controlled with evil nazi's at the time.
 
     3)  nazi's are bad.
 
     therefore gun control is bad!  (if this seems reasonable to you,
 try reading it as guncontrolisanaziplot!  that's pretty much what it's
 saying.)
 
     look, let's try to beat gun control with reason and sense, not by
 trying to appeal to emotions, and threatening conspiracies.  denounce
 gca '68 as wrong because it's wrong, not because it's based off of a
 law from someone else's government.
 
     as for the 'lots of brave men died fighting nazi's, so their laws
 have no place on our books!'  well, lots of brave men died fighting
 england.  wanna bet we've got lots of english laws on our books?  oh,
 but they're our allies now, so everything's hunky-dory.  i'm *very*
 sure that the gca is not the only law that we have on the books which
 is similar, or even based on, a law on the german books.  however,
 that does not give invalidation in and of itself.
 
     we, the people, must state that we find the law unappealing and
 contrary to our freedom.  we must use logic, and reason, and compelling
 arguments.  to use emotion, and appeal to fear is to lower yourselves
 to the level of your enemies.
 
     a side issue...  when talking about the amendments, it bothers
 me to see people acting as if they empower them, but require no
 responsibility from them.  free speech also assumes restraint, well
 armed militia expects well trained militia, the right to vote expects
 the citizen to try to become educated enough to make a reasonable
 decision.  you are not granted these rights without any responsibility
 to the society that offers them.  you have a responsibility in return,
 and it's to do more than bitch.
