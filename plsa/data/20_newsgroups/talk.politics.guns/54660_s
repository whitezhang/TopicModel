 in texas, you cannot carry a handgun.  period.  either concealed or open.
 and your numbers are misleading; they include suicides and accidents.  the
 real number from the department of public safety:
 
                    murders, non-neg hom		car fatalities
 1991			2651			  3079
 1992			2240			  3057
 
 texas only has "liberal" gun laws as far as purchasing a firearm; aside 
 from that, it's probably more restrictive than most states as far as carry
 goes.

 the state was virginia, and the law passed.

 that right only inflicts on those who threaten my rights to life,
 liberty, the pursuit of happiness, etc., in the first place.  i am not
 a criminal, and i don't indiscriminately fire my weapons at random.  
 so please explain how i am "inflicting" anything on other people.
