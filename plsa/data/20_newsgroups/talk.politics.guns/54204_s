 the point that i forgot to bring up here (and this has nothing to do with being
 a gang member or not) is that it is illegal to carry a concealed weapon in this
 area (or in the state of illinois for that matter).  this is not to say that
 people in illinois don't carry concealed weapons illegaly but practicing like
 that when there are other people around wasn't too bright of an idea.

 i agree.      if you don't practice at all and carry a gun for self-defense you
 most likely would be in big trouble if a situation were to arise.
