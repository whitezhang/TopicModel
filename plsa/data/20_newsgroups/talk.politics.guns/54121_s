 which crap, the ridiculous assertions that uzis are mowing down cops
 right and left? the assertions that dialing 911 should be the proper
 and only option available to the law-abiding citizens?
 
 a factoid:
 
 56 cops were killed in the whole country last year. this is down from
 around 100 in the early '80s. wow, a real explosion in cop killings
 there eh?  :-)
