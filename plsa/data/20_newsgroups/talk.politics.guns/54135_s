 	ok ... a near-majority actually own firearms, but i will still
 	claim that the vast majority never needs to use them or even
 	threaten anyone with them. what do they do right ... or are
 	they just lucky ? in either case, this means the 'average
 	threat level' in this country is rather low.

 	i think you have weapons on the brain. i never said that these
 	alternative means of self-protection involved any hardware.
 	why are 'good' neighborhoods 'good' ? it isn't because every
 	person is armed to the teeth. it is because of (1) attitude
 	and (2) cooperation. in the 'good' neighborhoods, the residents
 	make themselves aware of their neighbors and notice when
 	strangers are lurking around. 'good' neighborhoods form groups
 	like 'crime-watch' to increase this effect, and the relative
 	effectiveness of the police. when hostiles are arrested, the
 	good neighbors step up and say "that's the one officer ! he
 	was robbing mr. jones' house". 
 
 	in short, the alternative to firepower is gangs ... or at
 	least a benificent manifestation of that social cooperative.
 	replace lead with flesh ... the flesh makes a better
 	conversationalist too and you can invite it over for a
 	block party.

 	oliver north. the man is positively worshiped in many
 	all-american 'conservative' quarters. he and big ron
 	set-up a secret government and did all sorts of severely
 	illegal deeds - the kind of stuff you and i would be doing
 	twenty-to-life for, yet he walks free. this bs happens all
 	the time. in fact, it happens so much that no one really
 	cares anymore.  'legitimacy' is a non-issue. legality is
 	a non-issue. so long as we get t-bones and our mtv, who
 	gives a rats ass ?

 	no. i claimed that no one is interested in the statistical
 	aspects of the argument. pure emotion, like the abortion issue.

 	firearms-related mindless mayhem will be related to the
 	availibility of firearms. if they become scarce and 
 	and expensive, a different psychology will take hold.
 	i *think* they would be used far less to settle trivial
 	complaints.
