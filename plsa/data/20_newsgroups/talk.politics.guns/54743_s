 i tend to agree, but i would like a better explanation of why the fbi stopped  
 the firetrucks at the gate.  i saw this in realtime.  it concerns me that the  
 fbi "appeared" to not be too interested in stopping the fire after it started,  
 and actually started flying hueys around the compound, which had to add in some  
 small part to the winds driving the fire.
