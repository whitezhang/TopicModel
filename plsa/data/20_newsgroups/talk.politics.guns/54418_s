 really?  how do you avoid situations which encourage criminals?  i'd
 really like to know.  would you, say, prohibit female college
 students from riding their bicycles near the university during the
 daytime?  
 
 sounds a bit drastic, doesn't it?  especially when the university is
 locatd in a nice residential area.  a friend of mine was attacked and
 nearly raped in just this situation.  the police didn't feel she was
 in a situation which 'encouraged criminals'.
 
 what do you think?  should we just tell her, that it was her fault
 for daring to ride a bicycle in the middle of the day?  that she
 didn't avoid a situation that encouraged criminals?  if that's the
 case, then we'd all better put bars on our doors and windows and
 pray for a police state to keep us all safe.  crime happens in all
 situations - there are no defined areas that criminals avoid.
