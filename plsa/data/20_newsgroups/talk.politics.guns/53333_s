 no, lt calley was later acquitted. his troops killed 400-500
 people, including kids, elderly and women... i sure don't want
 to see the domestic law enforcement agencies in this country
 adhere to those "military standards"... if they did, we're
 all in big trouble...(the my lai massacre was covered up
 by high-ranking officials and all who were involved were
 acquitted).
