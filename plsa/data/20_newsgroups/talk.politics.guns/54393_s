 we will see what will happen to the "survivors".  don't forget however
 that the members of the cult are responsible for the deaths of 4 atf
 agents.  do you really expect koresh (dead or alive) to take sole 
 responsibility for this?  i can just see it now, survivior at trial 
 "i was just following orders".  where have we heard that before???
