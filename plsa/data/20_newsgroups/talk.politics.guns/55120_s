 i'd appreciate any help anyone could give me on these two questions:
  
 the brady bill was in the news throughout 1992 but what actually happened to
 it in congress?  did bush veto it?  if so, when?
  
 also, the state of virginia, i believe, just passed a gun control bill on
 febrauary 25 of this year.  i think it limits gun purchases to one a month -
 is this correct?  what was the bill number?
  
 anyone?
