 this whole thread is rediculous.  who cares if they had a stove going
 or not.  does it matter if they had a stove burning, or lanterns
 burning, or candles burning, or someone smoking, etc, etc, etc.  the
 premise is that the fbi was filling the house with napalm so that it
 would catch fire.  this is crazy.  fbi was not pumping napalm into the
 davidians home.  you will have to have pretty damn strong evidence to
 convince me of that.
 
 i can believe mass suicide/murder by koresh.  i can believe an
 accident by the davidians.  i can believe an accident by the fbi.  i
 can easily believe mass stupidity on all sides but i can not believe
 that the fbi lit this fire intentionally.  no way.
