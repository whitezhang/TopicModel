 i don't know this specific ratio, but i do have an earlier post that says
 a gun is 33 times more likely to defend someone (including the times where
 the gun isn't fired, just scares the perpetrator away) than it is to kill
 someone. (including self defense)  the post is kind of long, but i'll be
 glad to dig it up and email it to anyone who asks.
