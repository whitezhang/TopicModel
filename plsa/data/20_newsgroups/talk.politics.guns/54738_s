        i don't think we've got a conspiracy on our hands, or anything
 vaugely similar.  i do think that the feds showed a distinct lack of
 both intelligence and disregard for others safety throughout this whole
 mess.
 
        i do think the fbi and the batf screwed up big.  what made me
 really concerned was fbi director william sessions being on cnn engaging
 in what could only be called spin control before the place had even
 cooled down.  evertyhing had literally blown up in their faces and i felt
 there had to be something more important he should have been doing...
