 consider this: the bds had more than one lamp; the tanks made more than
 one hole in the building. did anyone else notice on the video that it
 appeared that wherever there was smoke coming out of the building, there
 was a tank nearby?
 
 the fact that it appears that fires started in several places does not
 rule out anything.
 
 also, where are these several witnesses? the way i heard it (from the fbi
 spokesman on cnn) the "witnesses" were all people driving the tanks.

 too bad nothing will happen to her or him. the fbi and the media have
 done their job well.
