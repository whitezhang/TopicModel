 hello,
 
 	i understand this philosophy.  the bears are a national
 treasure, the area is their sanctuary and people who enter it
 do so at their own risk.  it is better that that rare human be
 killed by a bear than that bears be provoked or shot by unbear-savvy
 visitors.  the bears aren't having a population explosion, humans
 are so it is better that a human be killed than endanger the bears.
 i don't agree with this philosopy, but i understand it.
 
 	the psychos are a bit different.  they are not a national
 treasure but i suppose the decision has been made that to "allow"
 provision for defense against them would also "allow" provision
 for defense against bears.  again, i suppose it has been decided
 that it is better for the rare human to be killed by a psycho than
 to take a chance on threatening the bears.
 
 	personally, i wouldn't go into an area where i would be
 "managed" so as to reduce my safety ..... but ... come to think
 of it i guess i live in a managed wilderness myself :-)
