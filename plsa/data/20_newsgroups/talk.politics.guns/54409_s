 hoover was for many years up near the top of my hate list.  and i hold no 
 brief for the fbi.  but where does this notion come from that hoover made 
 special efforts to recruit lds members?  and is there credible evidence for 
 the assertion that they are "pledged to defend secrets with their lives and 
 atone for sin with blood"?  i've known only a few mormons; but none of them 
 seemed to me to fit this description.  sounds to me reminiscent of the jewish- 
 and masonic-conspiracy theories of blessed memory.
