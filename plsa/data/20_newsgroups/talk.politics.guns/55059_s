 the paucity of this line of argument is that it is provably false.
 
 texas state officials could and did investigate child abuse charges.
 they could and did apprehend koresh peaceably.  the could and did
 impound his weapons for the duration.  and koresh was not convicted.
 
 note that child abuse and similar accusations are state matters, not
 federal.  the state could and did handle them properly and peaceably,
 and furthermore violating no one's constitutional rights in the process.
 
 so maybe the best way for batf/fbi to save people is to mind their 
 own fucking business.
