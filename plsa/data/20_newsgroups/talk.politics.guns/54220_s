 i will join the ranks here.  if someone has the ability to actually put this
 thing together and get enough support, i'll also contribute $1000 to the 
 effort.  and jeeze, people, i'm a *student*, with *no job* yet, and i will
 put up my own hard-earned savings if it means we have a shot at getting
 the truth told on the airwaves.  count me in.
