 flash over is a frequent occurrence with indoor fires.  a fire will
 start small and in one location and heat the air.  the temperature in
 the room builds up and then everything inflammable in the room catches
 fire at once.
  
 this may have occurred in the bd compound, i have heard reports that
 the windows were covered which would permit a fire to start unnoticed
 by those outside the compound.  when the fire got big enough, and
 broke through the walls, it appeared to be started in two places but
 was really one big fire.
  
 because of the large quantities of tear gas inserted into the building
 it is possible that many of the women and children were in a room free
 of tear gas they would try to seal the door to keep out the tear gas.
 when they learned that a fire had broken out it was too late for them
 to escape.  they were trapped by the flames in their safe room.
  
 i find it hard to believe that the fbi was not recording the final
 assault.  i think that they would have wanted to have tapes to show
 their agents of the the fbi overcoming the "forces of evil", aka
 the branch davidians.  the tapes would also allow the fbi to prove
 that they were not using excessive force.
