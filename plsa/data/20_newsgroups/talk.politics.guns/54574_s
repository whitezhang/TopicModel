 hi folks;
 
 thursday, april 15 marked day 3 of the trial.
 
 this day marked the first testimony of the trial.  deputy
 u.s. marshal larry cooper took the stand for the prosecution.
 
 the short version is that his testimony was consistent with
 the opening statements for the prosecution.
 
 cooper testified that he had arrived in spokane (washington)
 on august 17, 1992 to participate in a surveillance operation
 with five other deputies near the weaver cabin.  the team was
 using night vision equipment for surveillance, and split up
 into two teams of three people.  the six later met at an
 observation point above the cabin.  after this, deputies
 cooper, william degan, and arthur roderick began a descent to
 scout further possible surveillance sites.
 
 cooper told the court that roderick threw two large rocks into
 a gully to see, "whether the [weaver family] dogs would respond."
 striker, the weaver's yellow lab, started toward them barking
 loudly.  roderick led the three in a run from the area.
 
 they ran through some dense woods into an open area [called the
 "fern field"] with the dog in pursuit.  by this time, kevin
 harris and samuel weaver had joined the chase.  the surveillance
 team had reached a y in the road: cooper decided that they should
 take cover in the woods because otherwise they would be an easy
 target and might be "shot in the back."
 
 as degan reached the y, he spotted randy weaver coming down the
 road from the cabin ahead.  weaver was startled but did not fire.
 
 at this moment, striker reached degan, and cooper had to "fend
 him off with his gun."  [it is unclear whether this means he
 clubbed the dog or shot the dog].  both cooper and degan then
 took cover in the woods.  according to cooper, kevin harris and
 samuel weaver continued walking down the road, apparently not
 noticing the two.  after they had passed by on the road, degan
 got up on one knee, raised his gun, and shouted, "stop!  u.s.
 marshal!"  harris then "...brought the weapon around at hip level
 and fired.  he didn't bring the weapon up to eye level.  i saw
 bill's arm going back, and i knew he had been hit."  cooper fired
 at harris, and harris went down.  cooper then brought his weapon
 to bear on samuel, but did not fire.  at this point, cooper then
 heard two shots to his right.  samuel weaver looked in the
 direction of the shots, yelled, "you son of a bitch!" and ran
 toward them.  cooper then realized that shots were coming at him
 from directly ahead, so he fired a three-round burst at the
 cabin.  at this point he then saw samuel weaver running toward
 the cabin.  when cooper reached degan, he placed his first two
 fingers on degan carotid artery, counted two or three beats, and
 then his heart stopped.  shortly thereafter, roderick and the
 other three marshals joined him.  they then all heard a large
 burst of gunfire from the area around the cabin.
 
 on cross-examination, david nevin questioned the point of
 throwing rocks into the gulley, asking, "you wanted to lure that
 dog out so you could shoot that dog, didn't you?"  nevin also
 pointed out that in last september's testimony, cooper had
 claimed that he spotted weaver after the dog had left him.
 cooper claimed that he had gone over the events in his head and
 decided that thursday's account was correct.  nevin continued the
 cross-examination by asking what cooper would have done had an
 armed man dressed in full camouflage jumped out of the woods at
 him [no answer was available].
 
 friday, april 16 marks continued cross-examination of cooper.
 
 notes: there was no coverage of protestors.
