 hello,
 
 i just want to make 2 points:
 
 1) the fbi is not stupid. these people are chosen for their intelligence,
 education, loyalty to the government, etc. they are given much intensive
 training. so, to all of you who refuse to believe there could be any
 conspiracy here, and say that the fbi was just stupid, i say i don't
 believe it.
 
 2) the fbi has acces to the latest in audio and video technology -- the
 latest digital systems. the fbi can manufacture evidence. need a tape of
 koresh saying, "light the fire", and you can have one. need a thermal
 imaging video of three people lighting fires, and through the magic of
 computer graphics, you can have one. the thing is, manufacturing these
 pieces of evidence takes time. so it may be a few more days before we
 get to see them. or maybe we just haven't heard any tapes or seen any
 fbi video is because it is:
 	1) classified
 	2) too gruesome for our eyes
 	3) lost/got coffee spilled on it

 btw, i get my information from live video feeds. i read the papers too,
 but almost everything in them contradicts what i have seen with my own eyes.
