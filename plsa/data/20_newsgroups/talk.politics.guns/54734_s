 look, folks, i don't know what happened in waco.  i do not claim the bds are  
 angels, i never did.  koresh may very well be the devil incarnate.  i just  
 don't know.  but i do know that i must question any single source of  
 information, such as we have here.  and i must question even harder given that  
 it is single source at the insistance of that very government.  what ever else  
 happened at waco, that is perhaps the biggest evil done.  and even more so in  
 light of the discrepencies turning up between the federal officials and the  
 state officials.
 
 but what i really don't understand is the hoards of devoted government  
 worshipers who believe the government could not possibly do any wrong.  they  
 are fanatic to the point of making things up, such as brent's microwave oven  
 disclaim of the bd's using fire for food heating.  
 
 i am hard pressed to see any real difference between the claimed power koresh  
 held over the bds, and the demonstrated power the government holds over those  
 rapid apologists.
