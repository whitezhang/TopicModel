 : go to hell. i'm no "government [-] following fanatic." your sweeping

 : just let him be? 
 
 yes.  given the history of the bd's and the fact that they were just 
 peacefully minding their own business, i think this would have been
 the correct course of action in the very beginning.  everything that
 followed was a direct result of the major media fuck-up that the batf
 perpetrated just over 51 days ago.
 
 :fuck him. fuck the atf, too. they should've done it right

 yep, no doubt about it.  they should have just bombed those kooks
 right from the git-go.  yeah, sure!  so much for any resemblence
 to an america that abides by the constitution.  so much for feeling
 safe in your home.  so much for any of the rights enumerated in the
 bill of rights being upheld.  why bother?  they just get in the way
 of an effective government.  that is, a government of the elite, by
 the elite, for the elite.  
 
 joe, attitudes like yours frighten me.  you have very few facts about
 what actually happened, and what information you do have came from a 
 single source, the fbi/batf.  yet you are more than happy to pronounce
 the bd's guilty-as-charged based on this one-sided testimony.  scary!
