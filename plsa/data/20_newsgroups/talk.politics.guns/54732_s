 so?  kratz was there - does that mean that he's a gang member?
 
 even in the most gang-infested areas, most of the residents are not
 gang-members.

 how was it obvious?  were they not trying to hit the target?  or, does
 kratz confuse "marksmanship" with "trying to simulate a post"?  if so,
 that excludes self-defense shooting, but the rest of us understand
 that that exclusion would be an error.  (it excludes a lot of legit
 "gun games" as well.)

 sounds like practical pistol or maybe ipsc.  it also sounds like how a
 self-defense shooter might well practice.  the only things that action
 excludes are hunting and "like a post" shooting.  kratz should get out
 more often.
