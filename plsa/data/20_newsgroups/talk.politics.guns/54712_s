 compared to the second amendment?  i think it's worse.
 
 the problem is, the devil is in the details.  you know, the brady bill
 sounds like a "good idea" too, until you discover that there is no check,
 and that the police don't have to allow your purchase even if you check
 out, and that you have no recourse if they don't.
 
 are there any loopholes here?  i'm no lawyer, i can't be sure.  i
 would have never noticed the second one mentioned above in the brady
 bill, for example.
 
 the more words involved, the more details.  what was that saying about
 abraham lincoln requiring 200 words to free the slaves, and the modern
 congress requiring 3,000,000 words to describe price controls on rice?

 that only works with bad laws.  good laws are like good computer programs.  
 quality has to be written in from the start, not added on later.
