 no, bill, my full original post included sufficient disclaimers so that
 you could see that i was not claiming that it was a perfect world from
 the branch davidians point of view. the point of my article was that it
 is inappropriate to compare massada and the fate of the jewish rebels
 to waco. the zealot men faced certain execution in a way that was
 anathema to their religion, and they knew that their wives and children
 would be enslaved. american prisons may not be garden spots, but they
 don't compare to what the survivors of massada might have faced. you
 indicate that you agree that the branch davidians faced a trial. how
 does that fact alone make for a comparison here?  even if the
 government had wanted to find "fall guys" for the batf deaths, they
 still had to prove it to a jury.
 
 once again, my point was quite simple--any comparison between the
 situation of the branch davidians and the jews of massada is absurd.
