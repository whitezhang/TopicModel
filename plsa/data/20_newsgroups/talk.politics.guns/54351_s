 hmmm... i hadn't heard about rockets. atf must be escalating their
 tall tails... anyway
 >if they had rocket launchers and such (as the press and gov claims) why
 >shouldn't they have done something?
 
 why should they have "done something"? the davidians had not attacked
 or even threatened anyone.
 
 >what possible use would a religious cult have for a rocket launcher?
 
 it is not yours nor the governments right to tell others what they have
 a legitimate right to own.
 
 >also, is child abuse covered by the bill of rights?
 
 is child abuse now within the jurisdiction of the department of the
 treasury? attacking citizens without due process on the strength of
 unsubstantiated rumors about a violation of a law which does not
 fall under your jurisdiction is a pretty serious breech of rights.
