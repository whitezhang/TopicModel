 are you saying that the indians who became christians did so because the
 us army marched them into church at gunpoint?
 
 this will be news to the indians of the great lakes and upper mississippi
 basin-- of the southwest-- of mexico and south america-- who converted even
 before there was such a thing as the us.  are you saying that indians are
 incapable of coming to a decision themselves about their religion without
 being forced to at gunpoint?  what about the christian cherokees who were
 given the boot by the us government after the civil war... because the
 cherokee nation gave mild support to the confederacy, since they themselves
 owned black slaves.  no, reducing it all to a matter of religion is to
 support a much too narrow view of history.
 
 i've never heard of a single treaty, whether broken by the us government or
 not (were any not????), that said, if you guys convert to christianity, you
 get to keep all the land you claim.  no, treaties were invariably about land...
 it meant ceding indian claims to the government.  sometimes in return the
 us government promised the hunter-gatherer tribes (and plenty of tribes were
 already farming for centuries, but we don't hear about non-plains indians
 in movies) food and training in return for taking up a non-nomadic existence.
 promises, of course, which all to often proved empty.
