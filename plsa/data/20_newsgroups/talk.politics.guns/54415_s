 if one reasons that the united states of america at one time represented 
 and protected freedom << individual liberty and personal responsibility >> 
 (and i do, in fact, think that this is true) and that totalitarianism << 
 absolute government control and tyranny >> represents freedom's opposite 
 (which it does), did the usa really win the cold war?
 
 standard disclaimers always apply!
