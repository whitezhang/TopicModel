 i see that i misphrased my question.  i should have asked which
 full-autos kratz can accurately distinguish from semi-auto
 look-alikes.  i should have also included some semi-auto only guns in
 my list to see if he'd ask how to distinguish them from their
 non-existent full-auto "relatives".
 
 let's do the former now.  kratz has claimed that he can visually
 distinguish full-autos from semi-autos.  for which full-autos is he
 making that claim?  how does he do it?  let's get specific, and as
 exhaustive as possible.

 maybe?  why is kratz asking about what he told us that he knows?
 
 is kratz certain that he can distinguish a three position switch from
 a two position switch via tv inspection?  (does he even get to see the
 switch in the typical police display of guns?)  note that one might
 well be able to see this sort of thing in a hands on visual inspection
 even though it won't be seen on tv.  and to think that kratz was
 telling us that seeing it on tv was just as accurate as being
 there....

 why all the questions?  kratz assured us that he could make this distinction
 and now he's asking us how he did it....

 what about it?  it only demonstrates that, as i predicted, kratz
 was blowing smoke on this.
