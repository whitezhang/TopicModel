 today the texas me found two people, a man and a woman shot in the head
 inside the burned compound. but these were not the people that the fbi
 described a few days before. the fbi said that the person found in front of
 the compound had been shot and several children were also. the two people
 found today were on top of the main inside concrete bunker that provided
 the most protection during the fire. so the comment that children were
 shot is still not proved.
