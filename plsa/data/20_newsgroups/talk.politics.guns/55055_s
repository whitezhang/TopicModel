 catch tonight's (thursday's) cbs street stories.  covers, among others,
 the work of aware (arming women against rape and endangerment), a women's
 empowerment and training group in massachusetts.  they'll be interviewing
 spokesperson nancy bittle, as well as some of her students.  (assuming
 all of the "interesting" stuff they taped makes the final cut.)
