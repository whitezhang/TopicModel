 
 
 i wrote a letter the other day to empower america - the organization
 which claims to be championing conservative issues, esp. in the wake 
 of the republican defeat last fall. 
 
 some might consider them just a an organization to create a network of 
 support among conservatives for some individuals in prep. for '96 run.
 
 you'd be close to the truth.
 
 their two leading spokesmen are bill bennett, former 'drug czar' who heartily
 supported bush's semi-auto import ban, and wondered if it went far enough - 
 who helped put the big lie about 'sporting use' into the public's eye - and
 jack kemp - who recently came out in support of semi-auto bans. 
 
 these are conservatives ? 
 
 anyway i thought it interesting that when i ran word perfect's spell check
 against my letter - it came up with the following corrections for 'bennett' :
 
 1. banned
 2. bayonet
 
 
 needless to say, i found these choices rather amusing.

 "it [collectivism vs individualism] is an ancient conflict. men have come
 close to the truth, but it was destroyed each time and one civilization fell
 after another. civilization is the progress toward a society of privacy. the
 savage's whole existence is public, ruled by the laws of his tribe.
 civilization is the process of setting man free from men."

 i don't speak for my company. we hire the 'politically correct' to do that.
