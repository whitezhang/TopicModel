 i leave the anti-semitism to anti-gun types like holly silva.  i have in
 fact been calling for the disbanding of the batf for quite some time.
 it is an outlaw agency run by incompetants who only have contempt for

 i attribute the acts of the fbi to stupidity.  i attribute the acts of
 the batf to malice.  so did senator dennis deconcini when he held
 hearings about their misconduct.
