 what happened in waco is not the fault of the batf. if they would of
 had the proper equipment and personal then they could of captured the
 compound on the initial assault and none of this would of happened.
 
 the batf needs more people, better weapons and more armored
 transports. when they meet hostile fire they should be able to use
 more force instead of retreating to a stand off. if you are going to
 do a job then do it right. the batf is there to protect us and they
 must have the proper equipment and people to do the job.
 
 with the wod and the increased crime in the streets the batf is needed
 more now then ever. if they blast away a few good fokes then that is
 the price we all have to pay for law and order in this country. look
 at all the good people that died in wars to protect this great country
 of ours.
 
 with the arms build up in waco they needed to hit that compound with
 mega fire power. they could of gone in there blasting and killed a few
 women and kids but it would of been better then letting them all burn
 to death 51 days later.
