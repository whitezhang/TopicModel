 	excellent point, mark.  we should all remember that if nixon
 	hadn't tried to cover up the misguided actions of some of his
 	subordinates in the watergate burglary, the scandal would
 	never have brought down his presidency.  so far, klinton seems
 	to be stonewalling this the same way tricky dick did.  his whole
 	case seems to be "we didn't do anything wrong".  however, if
 	in the course of the investigation it turns out that the
 	gov't did do something wrong, and he tried to cover it up,
 	then that's an impeachable crime, i believe...  
 
 	perhaps he is inadvertently cooking up his own scandal...  can you 
 	say "wacogate", little neighbor?...   ;-)
