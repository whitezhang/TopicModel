 as william o. douglas noted, "if a powerful sponsor is lacking,
 individual liberty withers -- in spite of glowing opinions and
 resounding constitutional phrases."
  
 the legislative scorecard outlined below resulted from subcommittee,
 committee, and floor action.  many important victories, however, come
 from coordinating with legislators to ensure anti-gun/anti-hunting
 legislation is either amended favorably, rejected, or never voted.
 these quiet victories are no less impressive in protecting our
 fundamental civil liberties guaranteed by the second amendment to the
 u.s. constitution.

 wisconsin - in a referendum up against all odds, the determined
 efforts of the madison area citizens against crime paid off on april
 6 when a nonbinding referendum banning the possession of handguns in
 madison, wisconsin, was defeated.  despite opposition to the ban --
 aired largely by firearms owners at a series of public meetings on
 the issue -- the common council voted on february 17 to place the
 referendum on the ballot, allowing only seven weeks of campaigning to
 reverse public opinion on the controversial issue.
  
 an october 1992 poll conducted by the wisconsin state journal found
 57% in support and 38% opposed, with 5% expressing no opinion.  by
 election day, of the more than 56,000 voters who went to the polls,
 51% cast ballots in opposition to the proposal while 49% voted to
 have the madison common council enact such a ban.  the campaign
 committee, spearheaded by the wisconsin pro-gun movement and nra-ila,
 relied on neighborhood canvassing, direct mail and radio/tv
 advertising to educate voters on the civil liberties implications
 raised by enforcement of the ban if the referendum was approved.
  
 despite the surprising defeat, it is expected that the madison
 initiative's chief proponent, mayor paul soglin, will attempt to have
 the common council enact an ordinance banning handguns.
