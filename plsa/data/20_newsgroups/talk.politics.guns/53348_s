 
 good job to whoever posted the article.  i'd
 been saving that nytimes edition for a while, planning to ytpe it
 in myself, but now i don't have to.
 
 for all of those people who were worried about whether or not
 the media would even question the raid, we owe it to the
 ny times (despite their rabidly anti-gun editorials) for 
 being willing to talk to these 4 batf  agents.
