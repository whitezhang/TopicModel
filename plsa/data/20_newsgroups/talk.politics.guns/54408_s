 actually if 'a few minutes' translates into 6 hours, you have it
 right.  but you (and i guess your single-source news agency cnn)
 failed to mention the davidians pouring kerosene all over and lighting it in plain
 view.
 
 >this is murder!
 
 well, small-scale jim jones type suicide with fire instead of kool-aid.

 sorry, guy, you got it wrong.  atf was pumping tear gas into the compound.
 the branch davidians (going along with their apocolyptic faith) set their
 own compound on fire killing all but 9 or so.  no children survived.
 
 >this is genocidal mass-slaughter of innocent people, including children!
 
 self-slaughter, anyway.  i pity the children who were to young to be able
 to make a conscious choice.

 you are wrong.  thank goodness.  i would suggest, however, that you take
 a deep breath, and wait 30 minutes or so before posting.  also make sure
 your facts are correct before making your allegations(sp.).
 
 >i repeat, as of this time there are **no  survivors**!
 
 you repeated wrong.  there were 9.
 
 >god help us all.
 
 god help the branch davidians.
 
 >please crosspost -- don't let them get away with the slaughter of the children!
 
 no don't!!!!  there is way too much of this crap being crossposted all over
 creation as it is!!!!!!
