 does anyone know the particulars on the senate file 303?
 does this bill allow or deny off-duty police from carrying concealed?
 
 from what information that i have, iowa has a discretionary permit policy
 on ccw.  if s 303 allows police(off-duty) to carry concealed then i would
 be inclined to oppose it.  i don't believe off-duty police officers should
 have any more rights than civilians.  if law or policy prevents law-abiding
 citizens from being armed for self defense then why should off-duty police
 officer be treated any differently.
