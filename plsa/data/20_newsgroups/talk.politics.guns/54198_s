 
 here is a copy of my first update on the randy weaver trial.
 after a large response (about 15 email messages), i've decided
 that there is sufficient interest here on t.p.g. to warrant
 posting.

 hi folks;
 
 as perhaps the only boise resident on the list, i guess it
 kind of falls on me to keep people updated about the
 randy weaver/kevin harris trial.
 
 yesterday marked the seating of the jury.  apparently no other
 legal activities occurred.  the jury was selected and things
 start today.
 
 more interesting is what happenned outside.  about a dozen
 weaver supporters showed up to stage a protest outside the
 courthouse.  one woman carried a sign that read, "who stands
 trial for the murder of vicki and (son's name - i forget)
 weaver?"  on the evening news she said, "i am here protesting
 because i believe in freedom of speech and freedom of religion.
 i thought we all did."  nice sound bite (grin)!
 
 the news reporter also interviewed some guy named "tim"
 who refused to give his last name.  not to prejudge the
 guy, but he looked like a neo-nazi.  he also said he
 expected many neo-nazis to show up throughout the trial.
 "tim" had been handing out leaflets in support of weaver
 and harris and the news had footage of a boise cop
 telling him to move along or he'd arrest.  i don't know
 the finer points of this one.  perhaps there's a law
 against political activity within x feet of a courthouse
 or something (what happenned to the first amendment?!?).
 
 most ominous of all was that the local reporter filmed
 an agent of the gestapo...err...atf with a minicam
 filming the protestors!  welcome to the world of big brother.
 
 anyhow, gerry spence came out and asked the protestors to
 leave because he didn't think it would help weaver's case
 any.  he said he was confident that, once the evidence
 came out, that weaver would be aquitted.
 
 more stuff as it comes available.
