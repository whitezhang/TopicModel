        cute word angst.  conveys volumes.
  
        i'd be interested in this particular definition of "we."  it's
 such a fluid pronoun.

        the bd were a paranoid little cult out in the middle of nowhere,
 which all of a sudden had their worst paranoid fears reinforced.
  
        joy.

        yes, they probably should have, although how many paranoid
 nuts can say they held off the feds for 51 days?

         the voting booth is highly over-rated.  people need to get up
 off their lazy butts more than every year or every two years.  hell,
 most don't even do that.

         no, because "we" have decided that it doesn't make enough
 difference to "us" to get up and do something.  that's something,
 for instance, a lot of people who go speak against gun control
 bills at their local government.  dozens of "pro-gun" speakers
 show up and few if any antis do, but  they often win anyway.
  
         why?  because it doesn't matter who shows up, it matters
 who's willing to scream afterwards.  and it isn't that most people
 give a damn one way of the other, but that they don't.  nobody
 gives a damn about anybody beyond their own little worlds.

        the general public's usually not even read the constitution.
 and what they have learned is a distorted picture of the whole thing.
