 the u.s. government has become a garrotte around the necks of its
 citizens.  just as with a garrotte, the more people struggle to breathe
 the air of freedom, the more the government tightens its stranglehold. the
 only possible outcomes at this point are the death of government or the
 elimination of personal freedom.
