 
 cnn just reported the atf and the fbi have begun killing everyone in the
 united states. a press release stated this action was required because
 bugs had revealed that many people were doing something illegal in their
 homes, and statistical data indicated that those who weren't might someday
 do something illegal. an atf spokesperson, just before he shot himself, stated
 that "this would clean up things once and for all".
 
 if the citizens can be gathered into groups of more than 100, the fbi has
 indicated they will "burn them, just like we did those kooks in waco". 
 it hasn't been decided how the new proposed "energy tax" will enter into
 this, an irs representative stated "we're looking at the tax code to determine
 if taxes really end at death. with this many dead americans, we don't want
 to overlook anything". an atf agent ran into the room, and shot her.
 
 stay tuned....rich
