   imo, 90% of all "conspiracy" charges are easily explained by the simple
 fact that in these days of instantaneous news transmission, all kinds of

 then the story changes once the facts are in and suddenly cries of "its all a 
 whitewash!" start.  naturally, everybody wants to cover his/her ass.
