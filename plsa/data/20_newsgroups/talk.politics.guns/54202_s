 you know, in many ways this might be just the kick we need to straighten
 things out in this country.  also, people would have a need to replace
 guns with something else, perhaps deadly sprays that would make mace and oc
 seem like water.  they would be lighter and easier to conceal.
 
 guns are really "old" in design and as long as we have tons of them, no one
 is motivated to design something better.  i'm sure we could come up with
 some real nasty stuff if we tried and getting rid of these guns would get
 us moving on this track asap.  this is what we really want, right?  stuff
 that's smaller, lighter and far more deadly.
 
 remember, in this country we'll really scramble to accomplish impossible
 feats if we are motivated enough and i think "self-defense" is high on our
 list of motivators.
