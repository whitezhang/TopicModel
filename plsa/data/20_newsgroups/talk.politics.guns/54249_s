 so, you have the right unless the federal government says you don't.
 i don't think i like this very much.
 
 this would be much better if it said "everyone except those who have
 been striped of this right by due process of law" or some such thing.
 
 also, i don't care for the federal government stepping on states rights
 regardless of which state right is being stepped on.  if the constitution
 doesn't give the feds some power then they have to just shut up about
 it.
 
 the only way the feds should have anything to say is if the constitution
 prohibits localities from infringing on the rkba.  in which case this
 bill should just reiterate that the rkba is guaranteed by the constitution
 and that the feds will take appropriate action if it is infringed.
