       not provable.  it's about as "provable" as the number of votes
 vast for bill clinton in the last election.  if you accept the information
 available, you can prove one way or the other.  if you refuse to accept
 it, nothing is "provable."

       fine, support your assertation.  but, you haven't supported
 any assertations just yet.
 
       the national crime survey, that secret arm of the nra, estimates
 between 40,000 and 50,000 with-gun self-defenses from assaults, and
 is considered to considerably under-report.  when broken down by weapon,
 there is no form of "self-defense" including dowing nothing which is
 more effective at avoiding injury or death.

       ok, support *this* assertation.  hell, support *one*.

       that's nice.

       that's nice, too.

        why on earth should we?  if you're correct we've nothing to
 lose by continuing to argue against it and everything to gain.
