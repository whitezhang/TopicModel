 so?  look in the trunk some time.  heck - look at the dash.  that
 funny thing attached with a quick-release is a gun.  the ones in the
 trunk are "better".  (i don't have numbers for chicago, but
 philadelphia police cars carried multiple automatic weapons and
 thousands of rounds as standard issue in the 60s.)

 what is the nature of this disadvantage?  if the cop can shoot, 6
 rounds will do the job against a single opponent (especially since the
 cop has guaranteed backup).  if the "gang member" can shoot, the extra
 rounds don't help.  the only time this difference can matter is if
 neither can shoot, and cops aren't supposed to be throwing lead around
 like that.
 
 btw - most cops carry multiple guns.  you're not supposed to know
 about the second, third, and so on.

 how do "we" know that they were gang members and not undercover cops
 or even law-abiding menacing minorities.  btw - why the sneer quotes?
 
 they were actually practicing

 then the extra rounds won't make any difference, so why is it an issue?
