    this is hilarious.  here we have a self-described libertarian 
    getting all sentimental over a religious and national entity
    not exactly known for respecting individualism.   in somewhat
    more detail it should be noted that the whole concept of a 
    religion, and especially a patriarchial one like judaism 
    (or islam, or christianity) is obediance to rules and authority.
    leviticus, deuteronomy, etc are full of "thou shalt"s and "thou
    shalt not"s.   and of course israel's concept of human rights, while
    no doubt better than places like syria's or iraqs, is hardly the 
    stuff to warm the cockles of a libertarian's heart.
