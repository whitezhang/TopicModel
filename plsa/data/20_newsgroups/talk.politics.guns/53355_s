 there is a (likely) veto proof majority in the house.  the senate,
 unfortunately, is a different story.  the lt.gov. has vowed that the bill will
 not be voted on, and he has the power to do it.  in addition, the senate is a
 much smaller, and more readily manipulated body.
 
 on ther other hand, the semi-automatic ban will likely not live, as at least
 fifty per cent of the house currently opposes it, and it is very far down in
 the bill order in the senate (i believe it will be addressed after the ccw
 bill).
 
 and i thought my tx political science class was a waste of time!
