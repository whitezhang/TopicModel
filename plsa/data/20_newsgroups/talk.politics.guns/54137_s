 you don't know much about modern automatic weapons, do you?  just about anybody
 with basic manufacturing skill can turn out high quality submachineguns.  a 
 couple of high school shop teachers were recently arrested for building 
 submachineguns in the school shop.
 
 i suggest that you go to the library and find a copy of "smallarms of the 
 world".  your entire premise is based on non-factual assumptions.
