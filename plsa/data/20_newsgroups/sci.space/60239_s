 well they don't export anywhere near 50% of their gnp. mexico's perhaps
 but not their own. they actually export around the 9-10% mark. similar
 to most developed countries actually. australia exports a larger share
 of gnp as does the united states (14% i think off hand. always likely to
 be out by a factor of 12 or more though) this would be immediately obvious
 if you thought about it.

 it is their import routes that count. they can do without exports but
 they couldn't live without imports for any longer than six months if that.
 
 >given they import everything,  oil is just one more critical commodity.
 
 too true! but one that is unstable and hence a source of serious worry.
