 it was more than a theoretical concept; it was seriously pursued by
 freeman dyson et al many years ago. i don't know how well-known this is,
 but a high explosive orion prototype flew (in the atmosphere) in san
 diego back in 1957 or 1958. i was working at general atomic at the time,
 but i didn't learn about the experiment until almost thirty years later,
 when 
 ted taylor visited us and revealed that it had been done. i feel sure
 that someone must have film of that experiment, and i'd really like to
 see it. has anyone out there seen it?
