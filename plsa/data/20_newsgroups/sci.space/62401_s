 in some sense, i think that the folks who think the idea is wonderful, and the
 folks who want to boycott anyone who has anything to do with this project are
 both right.
 
 that is, i think that space advertising is an interesting idea, and if someone
 wants to try it out, more power to them. however, a company may discover that
 the cost of launch is not the only cost of advertising, and a company who 
 gauged that ill will would lose them more revenue than the advertising would
 gain might decide to bow out of the project.
 
 i got incensed when i read that carl sagan called this idea an "abomination." 
 i don't think that word means what he thinks it does. children starving in the
 richest country in the world is an abomination; an ad agency is at worst just
 in poor taste.
