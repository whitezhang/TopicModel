 i am taking a course entitled "exploring science using internet".
 for our final project, we are to find a compendium of internet resources 
 dealing with a science-related topic. i chose astronomy. anyway, i was 
 wondering if anyone out there knew of any interesting resources on internet
 that provide information on astronomy, space, nasa, or anything like that.
 
 thanks!
