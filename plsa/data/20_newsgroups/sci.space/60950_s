 wishful thinking mostly. it's more likely that the moon will never
 be the site of major commercial activity. as far as we know it has no
 materials we can't get cheaper right here on earth or from asteroids
 and comets, aside from the semi-mythic he3 that *might* be useful in low
 grade fusion reactors. exploring it would satisfy a curiosity itch, 
 and it's position in the gravity well of earth coupled with it's heat 
 sink capacity could offer some military utility for "high ground" military
 weapons systems, but it holds very minute commercial value. if space 
 travel becomes cheap enough, it might become a tourist attraction as 
 mt. everest and the antarctic have become, but that's a very minor 
 activity in the global scope of things.
 
 luna has an inconvienent gravity field. it's likely too low to prevent
 calcium loss, muscle atrophy, and long term genetic drift. yet it's
 too high to do micro-g manufacturing. space based colonies and factories
 that can be spun to any convienent value of g look much better. luna
 has a modest vacuum and raw solar exposure two weeks a month, but orbital
 sites can have better vacuums and continous solar exposure. luna offers
 a source of light element rocks that can serve as raw materials, heatsink,
 and shielding. the asteroids and comets offer sources of both light and
 heavy elements, and volatile compounds, and many are in less steep gravity
 wells so that less delta-v is required to reach them.
 
 we don't use 2/3rds of the earth now, the seafloors, and we virtually
 ignore antarctica, a whole continent. that's because we don't have to
 deal with those conditions in order to make a buck. luna is a much more
 expensive place to visit, or to live and work. i think we'll use the
 easier places first. that pushes lunar development back at least a few
 centuries, if not much longer.
 
 luna's main short term value would be as a place for a farside radio
 astronomy observatory, shielded from the noisy earth. or as the site
 of a laser, particle beam, or linear accelerator weapons system for
 defending earth, or bombarding it as the case may be. the first is
 unlikely because of the high cost for such a basic science instrument.
 the second is just as unlikely because conventional nukes are good
 enough, and the military would really rather see the earth safe for
 conventional warfare again. there's little glory in watching from a
 bunker as machines fight each other over continental ranges. little
 ultimate profit either.
