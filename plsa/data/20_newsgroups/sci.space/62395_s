 
 pennicillin if i have everything correct,  was a highly valuable
 myco-toxin,  discovered during ww2.  it proved to have an amazing
 bacterio-cidal effect without human toxicity.   it's immediate
 administration  showed immediate dramatic results  solving
 problems  that previously were fatal.  although initially
 enormously expensive to culture,  within 3 years,
 the price had fallen at least two orders of magnitude,
 and within 10 years,  was  not much more expensive then
 aspirin.  penicillin was also usable for an amazingly wide
 class of infections.
 
 centoxin is a drug that is not passing fda approval.  it promised
 amazing results for toxic shock, a rapidly fatal disease.
 it consumed enormous amounts of funding  in testing and
 developement,  however it works  less then 1 in 5 times
 of administration  and costs $2,000 per administration
 with no promise of any reduction in manufacturing cost.
 the drug thus costs $10,000 per useful case,  and is
 implicated in a slight increase in mortality for some
 patients.
 
 i would not dare to compare the shuttle to pennicillin,
 but to centoxin.
