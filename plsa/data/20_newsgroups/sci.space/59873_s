 online and other sources of images, data, etc.
 
 
 introduction
 
     a wide variety of images, data, catalogs, information releases, and
     other material dealing with space and astronomy may be found on the net.
     a few sites offer direct dialup access or remote login access, while the
     remainder support some form of file transfer. many sites are listed as
     providing 'anonymous ftp'. this refers to the file transfer protocol on
     the internet. sites not connected to the internet cannot use ftp
     directly, but there are a few automated ftp servers which operates via
     email. send mail containing only the word help to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com
     or bitftp@pucc.princeton.edu, and the servers will send you instructions
     on how to make requests.
 
     the sources with the broadest selection of material are the nasa ames
     space archive and the national space science data center.
 
     don't even ask for images to be posted to the net. the data volume is
     huge and nobody wants to spend the time on it.
 
 
 viewing images
 
     the possible combinations of image formats and machines is forebodingly
     large, and i won't attempt to cover common formats (gif, etc.) here. to
     read pds and vicar (and many other) formats on unix systems running x,
     use xv 2.11, available by anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu
     (18.24.0.12) in contrib/xv-2.11.tar.z and the other standard x11 ftp
     sites.
 
     the faq for the usenet group alt.binaries.pictures discusses image
     formats and how to get image viewing software. a copy of this document
     is available by anonymous ftp from the usenet faq archives at
     pit-manager.mit.edu (18.72.1.58), in directory
     pub/usenet/alt.binaries.pictures.
 
 
 online archives
 
     nasa ames
 
     extensive archives are maintained at nasa ames and are available via
     anonymous ftp or an email server. these archives include many images and
     a wide variety of documents including this faq list, nasa press
     releases, shuttle launch advisories, and mission status reports. please
     note that these are not maintained on an official basis.
 
     ftp users should connect to ames.arc.nasa.gov (128.102.18.3) and look in
     pub/space. pub/space/index contains a listing of files available in the
     archive (the index is about 200k by itself).
 
     to access the archives by email, send a letter to
     archive-server@ames.arc.nasa.gov (or ames!archive-server). in the
     subject of your letter (or in the body), use commands like:
 
 	send space index
 	send space shuttle/ss01.23.91.
 
     the capitalization of the subdirectory names is important. all are in
     caps. only text files are handled by the email server at present; use
     one of the ftp email servers described in the introduction to this
     section for images or programs.
 
     the magellan venus and voyager jupiter, saturn, and uranus cd-rom image
     disks have been put online in the cdrom and cdrom2 directories. the
     disks will be rotated on a weekly basis. thousands of images are
     available in these collections.
 
     the gif directory contains images in gif format. the vicar directory
     contains magellan images in vicar format (these are also available in
     the gif directory). a pc program capable of displaying these files is
     found in the imdisp directory (see the item "viewing images" below).
 
     the nasa media guide describes the various nasa centers and how to
     contact their public affairs officers; this may be useful when pursuing
     specific information. it's in misc/media.guide.
 
     any problems with the archive server should be reported to peter yee
     (yee@ames.arc.nasa.gov).
 
 
     nasa astrophysics data system
 
     the ads is a distributed data retrieval system which is easy to use and
     provides uniform access to ground-based and space-based astronomy data
     from nasa data centers across the country. it currently has over 140
     data catalogs of radio, infrared, optical, uv, and x-ray data which can
     be queried by position or any other parameter in the catalog. the ads
     also provides tools to manipulate and plot tabular results. in addition,
     ads has a beta version of an abstracts service which allows users to
     query over 125,000 abstracts of astronomy papers since 1975 by authors,
     keywords, title words, or abstract text words.
 
     ads use requires direct internet access. for more info and to sign up to
     become a user, email ads@cuads.coloradu.edu. the user's guide and
     "quickstart" guide are available by anonymous ftp to sao-ftp.harvard.edu
     in directory pub/ads/ads_user_guide (postscript files).
 
     contact carolyn stern grant (stern@cfa.harvard.edu).
 
 
     nasa jet propulsion lab (mission information and images)
 
     pubinfo.jpl.nasa.gov (128.149.6.2) is an anonymous ftp site operated by
     the jpl public information office, containing news releases, status
     reports, fact sheets, images, and other data on jpl missions. it may
     also be reached by modem at (818)-354-1333 (no parity, 8 data bits, 1
     stop bit).

     nasa spacelink
 
     spacelink is an online service located at marshall space flight center
     in huntsville, alabama. the system is specifically designed for
     teachers. the data base is arranged to provide easy access to current
     and historical information on nasa aeronautics, space research, and
     technology transfer information. also included are suggested classroom
     activities that incorporate information on nasa projects to teach a
     number of scientific principles. unlike bulletin board systems, nasa
     spacelink does not provide for interaction between callers. however it
     does allow teachers and other callers to leave questions and comments
     for nasa which may be answered by regular mail. messages are answered
     electronically, even to acknowledge requests which will be fulfilled by
     mail. messages are generally handled the next working day except during
     missions when turnaround times increase. the mail system is closed-loop
     between the user and nasa.
 
     spacelink also offers downloadable shareware and public domain programs
     useful for science educators as well as space graphics and gif images
     from nasa's planetary probes and the hubble telescope.
 
     you can dial in at (205)-895-0028 (300/1200/2400/9600(v.32) baud, 8
     bits, no parity, 1 stop bit), or telnet to spacelink.msfc.nasa.gov
     (128.158.13.250, also known as xsl.msfc.nasa.gov) if you're on the
     internet. anonymous ftp capability (password guest) is now available.
 
     most of this information is also available from the ames server in
     directory spacelink.
 
 
     national space science data center (nssdc)
 
     the national space science data center is the official clearinghouse for
     nasa data. the data catalog (*not* the data itself) is available online.
     internet users can telnet to nssdca.gsfc.nasa.gov (128.183.36.23) and
     log in as 'nodis' (no password). you can also get the catalog by sending
     email to 'request@nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov'.
 
     you can also dial in at (301)-286-9000 (300, 1200, or 2400 baud, 8 bits,
     no parity, one stop). at the "enter number:" prompt, enter md and
     carriage return. when the system responds "call complete," enter a few
     more carriage returns to get the "username:" and log in as 'nodis' (no
     password).
 
     the system is menu-driven; topics available as of 3/93 are:
 
 	1   -	master directory - nasa & global change
 	2   -	personnel information management system
 	3   -	nimbus-7 grid toms data
 	4   -	interplanetary medium data (omni)
 	5   -	request data and/or information from nssdc

 	12  -	standards and technology information system
 	13  -	planetary science & magellan project information
 	14  -	other online data services at nssdc
 	15  -	cd-roms available at nssdc
 
     for users with internet access, datasets are made available via
     anonymous ftp once you select the desired datasets from the online
     catalog. for other users, data may be ordered on cd-rom and in other
     formats. among the many types of data available are voyager, magellan,
     and other planetary images, earth observation data, and star catalogs.
     viewers for macintosh and ibm systems are also available. as an example
     of the cost, an 8 cd set of voyager images is $75. data may ordered
     online, by email, or by physical mail. the postal address is:

     astronomical databases
 
     the full sao stellar database is *not* available online, probably due to
     the 40 mb size. it may be ordered on magnetic tape from the nssdc. a
     subset containing position and magnitude only is available by ftp (see
     "astronomy programs" below).
 
     nic.funet.fi (128.214.6.100) has a large collection of astronomical
     programs for many types of computers, databases of stars and deep sky
     objects, and general astronomy information in directory /pub/astro. this
     site is mainly for european users, but overseas connections are
     possible.
 
     the ames archives contain a database of 8,436 galaxies including name,
     ra, declination, magnitude, and radial velocity in misc/galaxy.dat.
     supplied by wayne hayes (wayne@csri.utoronto.ca).
 
     iris1.ucis.dal.ca (129.173.18.107) has a number of gifs from voyager,
     hubble, and other sources available by anonymous ftp in pub/gif (most of
     this data is also in space/gif on the ames server). please restrict
     access to 5pm - 8am atlantic time.
 
     pomona.claremont.edu has the yale bright star catalog for anonymous ftp
     in directory [.yale_bsc]. contact james dishaw
     (jdishaw@hmcvax.claremont.edu).

     the "variable stars analysis software archive" is available via
     anonymous ftp from kauri.vuw.ac.nz (130.195.11.3) in directory
     pub/astrophys. this is intended for specialists in this field, and they
     would appreciate people from outside new zealand confining their ftp
     access to the astrophys directory, as they pay a significant amount for
     internet access. contents are relatively sparse at present due to the
     youth of the archive - contributions are encouraged. contact the archive
     administrator, timothy banks (bankst@kauri.vuw.ac.nz) for more
     information.
 
     the "idl astronomy users library" is available by anonymous ftp from

     get an index of files; send it the message "get filename filetype" to
     get a particular file.
 
 
 landsat and nasa photos
 
     you can get black-and-white 1:1m prints, negatives, or positives for
     $10, $18, $12 respectively for any landsat data more than 2 years old
     from edc, (eros (earth resources orbiting satellite) data center). call
     them at (605)-594-6511. you get 80 meter resolution from the mss
     scanner, 135x180 kilometers on a picture 135x180 mm in size. i think you
     have to select one band from (green, red, near ir, second near ir), but
     i'm not sure. digitial data is also available at higher prices.
 
     transparencies of all nasa photos available to the public can be
     borrowed from the nasa photo archive; you can have copies or prints
     made.

 planetary maps
 
     the usgs address for maps of the planets is:
 
     u.s. geological survey,
     distribution branch,
     box 25286, federal center, bldg. 41
     denver, co 80225
 
     maps cost $2.40 to $3.10 per sheet (a few come in sets of 2 or 3 sheets).
 
     the best global maps of mars based on viking images are 1:15,000,000
     scale in 3 sheets. these maps are:
 
     i-1535 (2 sheets only) - relief, albedo, names
     i-1535
     i-1618 (3 sheets) - relief, names
     i-2030 (3 sheets) - relief, topographic contours
     i-1802-a,b,c (3 sheets) - geology
 
     there are many other maps as well: 30 sheets at 1:5,000,000 scale in
     relief, albedo, geology, photomosaic forms (not all 30 sheets available
     in all formats); 140 sheets at 1:2,000,000 scale as photomosaics of the
     whole planet, about 100 sheets of interesting sites at 1:500,000 scale
     in photomosaic format, and lots of special sheets.
 
     then there are maps of mercury, venus, the moon, the four galilean
     satellites, six moons of saturn and five of uranus. [phil stooke
     (stooke@vaxr.sscl.uwo.ca), the author of this item, has offered to
     respond to email requests for information on any topic relating to lunar
     and planetary maps.]
 
 
 cometary orbit data
 
     the central bureau for astronomical telegrams and the minor planet
     center announce the sixth edition of the catalogue of cometary orbits in
     iau circular 4935. the catalogue contains 1292 entries which represent
     all known comets through november 1989 and is 96 pages long.
     non-subscribers to the circulars may purchase the catalogue for $15.00
     while the cost to subscribers is $7.50. the basic catalogue in ascii
     along with a program to extract specific orbits and calculate
     ephemerides is available on ms-dos 5.25-inch 2s2d diskette at a cost of
     $75.00 (the program requires an 8087 math coprocessor). the catalogue
     alone is also available by e-mail for $37.50 or on magnetic tape for
     $300.00.
 
     except for the printed version of the catalogue, the various magnetic
     media or e-mail forms of the catalogue do not specifically meantion
     non-subscribers. it is possible that these forms of the catalogue may
     not be available to non-subscribers or that their prices may be more
     expensive than those given. mail requests for specific information and
