       request for ideas for applications of remote sensing databases 
                              via the internet
  
 nasa is planning to expand the domain of users of its earth and space science
 data.  this effort will:
  
   o   use the evolving infrastructure of the u.s. global change research 
       program including the mission to planet earth (mtpe) and the earth 
       observing system data and information system (eosdis) programs.
  
   o   use the internet, particularly the high performance computing and 
       communications program's nren (national research and education 
       network), as a means of providing access to and distribution of 
       science data and images and value added products.
  
   o   provide broad access to and utilization of remotely sensed images in 
       cooperation with other agencies (especially noaa, epa, doe, ded, 
       doi/usgs, and usda). 
  
   o   support remote sensing image and data users and development 
       communities. 
  
 the user and development communities to be included (but not limited to) as
 part of this effort are educators, commercial application developers (e.g., 
 television weather forecasters), librarians, publishers, agriculture 
 specialists, transportation, forestry, state and local government planners, and
 aqua business.
  
 this program will be initiated in 1994.  your assistance is requested to 
 identify potential applications of remote sensing images and data.  we would 
 like your ideas for potential application areas to assist with development of
 the implementation plan.
  
 please note: this is not a request for proposals.  
  
 we are seeking your ideas in these areas: 
  
   (1)  potential commercial use of remote sensing data and images; 
  
   (2)  potential noncommercial use of remote sensing data and images in 
        education (especially levels k-12) and other noncommercial areas;
  
   (3)  types of on-line capabilities and protocols to make the data more 
        accessible;
  
   (4)  additional points of contacts for ideas; and 
  
   (5)  addresses and names  from whom to request proposals. 
  
 for your convenience, a standard format for responses is included below.  feel
 free to amend it as necessary.  either e-mail or fax your responses to us by
 may 5, 1993.
  
 e-mail:   on internet "rsdwg@orion.ossa.hq.nasa.gov"  ascii  - no binary 
 attachments please
  
 fax:   ernie lucier, c/o rsdwg, nasa hq, fax 202-358-3098
  
 survey responses in the following formats may also be placed in the ftp 
 directory ~ftp/pub/rsdwg on orion.nasa.gov.  please indicate the format. 
 acceptable formats are: word for windows 2.x, macintosh word 4.x and 5.x, and 
 rtf.

 request for ideas for applications of remote sensing databases via the internet
  
 (1)  potential commercial use of remote sensing data and images  (if possible,
 identify the relevant types of data or science products, user tools, and
 standards).
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 (2)  uses of remote sensing data and images in education (especially levels
 k-12) and other noncommercial areas (if possible, identify the relevant types
 of data or science products, user tools, and standards). 
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 (3)  types of on-line capabilities and protocols to make the data and images
 more accessible (if possible, identify relevant types of formats, standards,
 and user tools)
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 (4)  additional suggested persons or organizations that may be resources for 
 further ideas on applications areas.  please include: name, organization, 
 address and telephone number.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 (5)  organizations, mailing lists (electronic and paper), periodicals, etc. to
 whom a solicitation for proposals should be sent when developed.  please 
 include: name, organization, address and telephone number.
  
  
  
 (6)  we would benefit from knowing why users that know about nasa remote 
 sensing data do not use the data.  is it because they do not have ties to nasa
 investigators, or high cost, lack of accessibility, incompatible data formats,
 poor area of interest coverage, inadequate spatial or spectral resolution, ...?
  
  
  
  
  
 (7)  in case we have questions, please send us your name, address, phone number
 (and e-mail address if you have one).  if you don't wish to send us this
 information, feel free to respond to the survey anonymously.  thank you for
 your assistance.
