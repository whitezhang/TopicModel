 you are talking about the bozos who can't even manage in november to
 keep promises about taxes made in october, and you expect them to make
 (and keep!) a 50-year promise like that?  your faith in the political
 system is much higher than mine.  i wouldn't even begin to expect that
 in australia, and we don't have institutionalised corruption like you
 do.
