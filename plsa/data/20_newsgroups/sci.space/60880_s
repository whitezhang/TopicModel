 my understanding is that the 'expected errors' are basically
 known bugs in the warning system software - things are checked
 that don't have the right values in yet because they aren't
 set till after launch, and suchlike. rather than fix the code
 and possibly introduce new bugs, they just tell the crew
 'ok, if you see a warning no. 213 before liftoff, ignore it'.
