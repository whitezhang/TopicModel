 the jpl/san gabriel aiaa session last week showed the russian
 lander encased in a single large airbag with ravelable stitches.
 the russian design is pretty firm and hardware is due from
 international experimenters by 1/94.
 the proposed 1997 american lander has a bunch of airbags shaped
 like a bunch of grapes.  they were dropping it in the desert last
 month.  it may have a 20 kg mini-rover in it.
