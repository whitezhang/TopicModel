 here are some recent observations taken by the hubble space telescope:
 
      o the faint object spectrograph (fos) was used to make ultraviolet
        observations of both the planet pluto, and its moon charon. the
        peakups were successful. the observations were executed as
        scheduled, and no problems were reported.
 
      o observations were made using the high speed photometer of the planet
        uranus during an occultation by a faint star in capricornus. these
        observations will help in our understanding of the planet's
        atmospheric radiative and dynamical processes. this event occurred
        close to the last quarter moon, and special arrangements had to be
        made to modify the lunar limit tests to allow these observations.
        the observations are currently being reviewed, and all the
        observations looked okay.
