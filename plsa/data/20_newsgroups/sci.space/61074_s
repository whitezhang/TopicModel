 what do you mean? are you saying they thought the effort was
 profitable or that the money was efficiently spent (providing max
 value per money spent)?
 
 i think they would answer yes on ballance to both questions. exceptions
 would be places like the us from the french indian war to the end of
 the us revolution. 
 
 but even after the colonies revolted or where given independance the
 british engaged in very lucrative trading with the former colonies.
 five years after the american revolution england was still the largest
 us trading partner.
