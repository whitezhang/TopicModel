 afraid i can't give any more info on this.. and hoping someone in greter
 netland has some details.
 
 a short story in the newspaper a few days ago made some sort of mention
 about how the japanese, using what sounded like a gravity assist, had just
 managed to crash (or crash-land) a package on the moon.
 
 the article was very vague and unclear.  and, to make matters worse, i
 didn't clip it.
 
 does this jog anyone's memory?
 
 
 thanks
