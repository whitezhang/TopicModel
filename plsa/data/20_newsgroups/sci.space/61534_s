 |has someone actually verified that mass is the predominant constraint on this

 someone from nasa posted that there were very significant mass margins
 on the hst re-boost mission.  a while back i had asked why not carry
 the edo pallet up,  and the answer was the mass margins were tight enough, they weren't even carrying extra suits.

 |pat, this would be slower, more expensive and worse.  
 |
 |slower:  the shuttle mission is scheduled to go up in december.  that's less
 |than eight months away.  there is no way you could build new hardware, retrain
 |and reschedule the eva's in that time.

 where's wingo when you need him:-)
 
 come on.   knock that s**t off.
 
 you forget,  that during skylab,  they did  overnight mission planning
 for the repair eva's.   also during theøÄ   
 intelsat mission,   they did overnight  wetf simulations.
 i somehow think they could train up a new  eva in  8 months.
 
 and as for building hardware,  anything can  be built if you want it
 bad enough.
 
 you forget,  the  bus 1  is already built.  all they'd ahve to do
 is soup it up, even test it  on a delta mission.
 
 don't get into this mode of  negativism.   besides,  at the rate
 missions slip,   the discovery won't launch on this mission until
 march.  that's almost a year.
 
 |more expensive:  your proposal still requires the shuttle to do everything it
 |was going to do execpt fire the oms.  in addition, you've added significant
 |extra cost for a new piece of complex hardware.
 |
 
 ah,  but how much more expensive is the second hst servicing mission.
 
 you forget,  there is a bum fgs,  the solar array electronics, are
 getting hinky  and there is still 8 months until the servicing mission.
 
 the time for the space walks are growing rapidly.  this was orignally
 planned out as 3 spacewalks,  now they are at 5 eva's  with 3 reserve
 walks.
 
 if the smt can avoid a second servicing mission that's $500 million
 saved.  if the weight savings,  means they  can sit on orbit  for 30 days.
 and  handle any contingency  problems,  that's quite a savings.

 |according to a gao report on the omv i have before me, there are

 of course,  there wasn't any need for the saturn  v  after apollo too.
 
 as for the problems with the aperture door,  i am sure they can
 work out some way to handle  that.  maybe a plug  made from
 frozen ice.?   it'll keep out any contamination,
 yet sublime away  after teh boost.
