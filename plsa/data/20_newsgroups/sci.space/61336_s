      you'll find that in allen, c.w., "astrophysical quantities", athlone
 press, dover, nh, 3rd edition, pp. 268-269 (1973).  to the accuracy it can
 be calculated (see specific references in allen about how it is
 calculated), the temperature is 3 degrees k.
 
      lots of people have remarked on this temperature.  the first may have
 been in eddington's book, "internal constitution of stars", ch. 13 (1926;
 reprinted 1986), where he gives the "temperature of space" as 3 degrees.
 
      the source of this temperature is the radiation of starlight.

      to the accuracy of measurement, it's the same temperature.  some of us
 think this may not be a coincidence.  -|tom|-

 meta research was founded to foster research into ideas not otherwise
 supported because they conflict with mainstream theories in astronomy.
