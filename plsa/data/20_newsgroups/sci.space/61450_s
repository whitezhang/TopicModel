 if this man clark is a nasa administrator then god save nasa. of course
 the shuttles record is unrivaled !  there is only one shuttle. furthermore,
 there is only likely to be one shuttle now that hermes and boron are 
 effectively cancelled.
 
 these officials should spend more of their time explaining to their
 european and asian partners how we are expected to believe in them
 when their paymasters change their minds on major international
 projects everytime a new us administration takes office (considering
 the major impacts this has on the european and asian (japanese)
 industry). it is also appreciated how this affects american
 industry. i am of course talking about space stattion freedom.
