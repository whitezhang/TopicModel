 
 the other week i saw a tv program about the american space industry and nasa.
 it said that in the 60's they developed a rocket that used ions or nuclear
 particles for propolsion.
 the government however, didn't give them $1billion for the developement
 of a full scale rocket.
 did anybody see this program?
 if not, has anybody heard of the particle propolsion system?
 
 thanx. 8-)
