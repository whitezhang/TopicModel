                        mars observer status report
                              april 30, 1993

 dss-65 (madrid 34 meter antenna) did not acquire the expected mars observer
 spacecraft signal at the scheduled beginning of track yesterday morning (4/29)
 at approximately 6:00 am.  indications were that the spacecraft had entered a
 fault protection mode sometime between that time and receipt of normal
 telemetry at the end of the previous station pass (dss-15 - goldstone 34
 meter antenna) at approximately 8:00 pm the evening before.  entry into
 contingency mode was verified when signal was reacquired and telemetry
 indicated that the spacecraft was sun coning.  after subsystem engineers
 reported all systems performing nominally, fault protection telemetry modes
 were reconfigured and memory readouts of command system audit queue and
 aacs (attitude and articulation control subsystem) starex performed.  these
 readouts verified that contingency mode entry occurred shortly after 1:30 am
 yesterday, 4/29/93.  preliminary indications are that a sun ephemeris check
 failure triggered fault protection.  however, the flight team will be
 determining the precise cause over the next few days.
 
 as of last evening, the spacecraft had been commanded back to inertial
 reference and was stable in that mode.  the flight team is planning to
 command the spacecraft back to array normal spin state today.
 
 magnetometer calibration activities had completed prior to contingency
 mode entry.  mag calibration data has been recorded on digital tape
 recorders 2 and 3.  playback of dtrs 2 and 3, scheduled to be completed
 yesterday, was postponed when contingency mode entry halted flight
 sequence c9 execution.  the flight team is developing a strategy to restart
 c9 to complete data playback.  present planning is to perform playbacks
 between  as soon as wednesday, or as late as friday of next week (5/5-
 5/7), dependent on contingency mode recovery activity.  dtr playback will
 be performed via the high gain antenna at 42,667 bits per second.  upon
 verification of successful dtr playbacks, downlink will be maintained at
 the 4k s & e rate.
