 yes, long before star trek.  before einstein, in fact.
 
 vulcan as a planet inside mercury was hypothesized to explain a perturbation
 of mercury's orbit that could not be explained by the known planets.  but
 einstein's theory of relativity explained mercury's motion, and analysis
 of mercury's motion now shows there are _not_ any planets inside its orbit.
