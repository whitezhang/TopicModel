 uh, why do they have to ask a state commision? unless the state's buying...
 
 such a process will only increace the overhead to the power company
 of selling different types of light, and will decreace the likleihood
 that they will do so. and any efficient lights they might have been
 planning in the future, go down the drain.....

 you could order it special. if enough people did so, it would be 
 low cost. last i checked, you could use ups to buy stuff in arizona
 before going there.
 
 finally, i'm sure your state has things like small factories and
 machine shops. you could go into business making lights that are
 cheaper to use (thanks to their higher efficiency and the
 fact that they aren't wasting energy on broadcasting to space)
 and therefore _better_ than the old style...

 _my_ *experience* seems to suggest that you're trying too hard
 to *educate* them (with the same methods used in american schools
 to make any subject whatsoever as relevant and boring as proto-ugric)
 instead of *selling* them on the idea.

 well, wake up. space is becoming a field of human endeavor
 instead of just something we can look at from a long long
 way away. there are practical space projects that could conceivably
 (although probably not) cause lots of light pollution, and 
 have been argued against on those grounds, even though they
 might open up such possibilities, that people could vacation on
 mars if they wanted really dark skies...
