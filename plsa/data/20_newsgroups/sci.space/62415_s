    think for a moment about the technology required to do that.  by 
    the time they could make the earth's sky look like las vegas, 
    the people could afford to go backpacking on the moon. round
    trip costs for 500 kg to the moon would be about the same as
    5000 kg in a low earth "advertising" orbit: very roughly the
    same cost as a smallish billboard, therefore. if such ads were
    to become common place, that would have to be a very low price...
 
 this is nonsense.  its like saying that by the time commercials
 on television become commonplace every citizen will have their own
 hour long nationally broadcast tv program.
 
    there's always been a problem of having to get 
    away from civilization before you can really find "natural"
    scenery. 100 years ago, this usually didn't take a trip
    of over 5 miles. today, most people would have to go 100 miles
    or more. if we ever get to the point where we have billboards
    on orbit, that essentially means that no place on earth is still
    "wild." while that may or may not be a good thing, the orbital
    billboards aren't the problem: they are just a symptom of 
    growing, densely-populated civilization. banning such ads will
    not save your view of the night sky, because by the time 
    such ads could become widespread you will probably have trouble
    finding a place without street lights, where you can _see_
    the stars...
 
 the rest of your post is strange mishmash of "its already really bad"
 and "it doesn't really matter if it gets worse."  you should try to
 figure out what you are really arguing for.  (kneejerk anti-environ-
 mentalism?)

 p.s.  a passing sattelite does not have the same effect on visible
 light astronomy as an object as bright as the full moon.
