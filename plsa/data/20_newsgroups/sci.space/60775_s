 a practical suggestion, to be sure, but one could *also* peek into
 news.lists, where brian reid has posted "usenet readership report for
 mar 93." another posting called "usenet readership summary report for
 mar 93" gives the methodology and caveats of reid's survey.  (these
 postings failed to appear for a while-- i wonder why?-- but they are
 now back.)
 
 reid, alas, gives us no measure of the "power/influence" of readers...
 sorry, mark.
 
 i suspect mark, dangling out there on fidonet, may not get news.lists
 so i've mailed him copies of these reports.
 
 the bottom line?
 
         +-- estimated total number of people who read the group, worldwide.
         |     +-- actual number of readers in sampled population
         |     |     +-- propagation: how many sites receive this group at all
         |     |     |      +-- recent traffic (messages per month)
         |     |     |      |      +-- recent traffic (kilobytes per month)
         |     |     |      |      |      +-- crossposting percentage
         |     |     |      |      |      |    +-- cost ratio: $us/month/rdr
         |     |     |      |      |      |    |      +-- share: % of newsrders
         |     |     |      |      |      |    |      |   who read this group.
         v     v     v      v      v      v    v      v
   88  62000  1493   80%  1958  4283.9    19%  0.10   2.9%  sci.space 
 
 the first figure indicates that sci.space ranks 88th among most-read
 newsgroups.
 
 i've been keeping track sporadically to watch the growth of traffic
 and readership.  you might be entertained to see this.
 
 oct 91   55  71000  1387   84%   718  1865.2    21%  0.04   4.2%  sci.space

 (some kind of glitch in estimating number of readers happens here)

 (revision in ranking groups happens here(?))
 mar 93   88  62000  1493   80%  1958  4283.9    19%  0.10   2.9%  sci.space 
 
 possibly old usenet hands could give me some more background on how to
 interpret these figures, glitches, or the history of reid's reporting
 effort.  take it to e-mail-- it doesn't belong in sci.space.
