 the "face" is an accident of light and shadow.  there are many "faces" in
 landforms on earth; none is artificial (well, excluding mount rushmore and
 the like...).  there is also a smiley face on mars, and a kermit the frog.
 
 the question of life in a more mundane sense -- bacteria or the like -- is
 not quite closed, although the odds are against it, and the most that the
 more orthodox exobiologists are hoping for now is fossils.
 
 there are currently no particular plans to do any further searches for life.
 
 >are we going back to mars to look at this face agian?
 
 mars observer, currently approaching mars, will probably try to get a better
 image or two of the "face" at some point.  it's not high priority; nobody
 takes it very seriously.  the shadowed half of the face does not look very
 face-like, so all it will take is one shot at a different sun angle to ruin
 the illusion.
