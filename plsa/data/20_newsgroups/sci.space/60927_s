 hey!  my dad has an old hangar and judy has some old rockets in her attic,
 let's put on a lunar program! . . .  sounds good, but . . .
 let's play a game - what would be a reasonable reward?  what companies would
 have a reasonable shot at pulling off such a feat?  just where in the
 budget would the reward come from?  should there be a time limit?  would a
 straight cash money award be enough or should we throw in say . . . 
 exclusive mining rights for the first fifty years? you get the idea.
 
 i'd like to play but i don't have a clue to the answers.
