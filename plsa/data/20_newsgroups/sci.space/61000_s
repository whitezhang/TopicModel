 sei level 5 (the highest level -- the sei stands for software
 engineering institute).  i'm not sure, but i believe that this rating
 only applies to the flight software.  also keep in mind that it was
 *not* achieved through the use of sophisticated tools, but rather
 through a 'brute force and ignorance' attack on the problem during the
 challenger standdown - they simply threw hundreds of people at it and
 did the whole process by hand.  i would not consider receiving a 'warning'
 status on systems which are not yet in use would detract much (if
 anything) from such a rating -- i'll have to get the latest copy of
 the guidelines to make sure (they just issued new ones, i think).
 
 also keep in mind that the sei levels are concerned primarily with
 control of the software process; the assumption is that a
 well controlled process will produce good software.  also keep in mind
 that sei level 5 is damned hard.  most software in this country is
 produced by 'engineering practicies' that only rate an sei level 1 (if
 that).
