 i was suggesting that the minority of professional and amateur astronomers
 have the right to a dark, uncluttered night sky.
 
 let me give you an example.  when you watch tv, they have commercials to pay
 for the programming.  you accept that as part of watching.  if you don't like
 it, you can turn it off.  if you want to view the night sky, and there is a
 floating billboard out there, you can't turn it off.  it's the same 
 reasoning that limits billboards in scenic areas.

 	it's called a democracy.  the majority rules.  sorry.
 if ytou don't like it, i suggest you modify the constitution to include
 a constitutional right to dark skies.   the theory of government
 here is that the majority rules,  except in the nature of fundamental
 civil rights.
 
 i say: 
 	any reasonably in-depth perusal of american history will show
 	you that many wasps have continued the practices of prejudice,
 	discrimination, and violence against others of different
 	races, religions, and beliefs, despite the law.
 
 pat says:
 if you really are annoyed,   get some legislation
 to create a dark sky zone,  where in all light emissions are protected
 in the zone.  kind of like the national radio quiet zone.  did you
 know about that?  near teh radio telescope  observatory in west virginia,
 they have a 90?????? mile emcon zone.  theoretically they can prevent
 you from running light ac motors, like air conditioners and vacuums.
 in practice, they use it mostly to  control  large radio users.
 
 i say:
 what i'm objecting to here is a floating billboard that, presumably,
 would move around in the sky.  i, for one, am against legislating
 at all.  i just wish that people had a bit of common courtesy, and
 would consider how their greed for money impacts the more ethereal and
 aesthetic values that make us human.  this includes the need for wild
 and unspoiled things, including the night sky.
