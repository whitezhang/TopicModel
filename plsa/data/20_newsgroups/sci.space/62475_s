  that doesn't seem like a fair comparison.  infrared astronomy 
  didn't really get started until something like 25 yrs. ago; it
  didn't explode until iras in 1983.  gamma-ray (and i think 
  x-ray) observations didn't really get started until the '70s.
  i believe the same is true of ultraviolet observations in 
  general, and i know that extreme uv (short of 1000 angstroms)
  observations, until the euve (launched last year) had almost 
  no history except a few observations on skylab in the '70s.
 
  twenty-five years ago, the vast majority of astronomers only 
  had access to optical or radio instruments.  now, with far more
  instruments available, growth in some of these new fields has
  resulted in optical work representing a smaller fraction of 
  total astronomical work.

  hmm, some of the folks in this department planning on using 
  adaptive optics at the 5 m at palomar for near-infrared 
  observations (1 and 2 microns) might be surprised to hear this.
 
  and isn't the ntt already pushing toward 0.1 arcsecond resolution, 
  from a ground-based site (remember 0.1 arcseconds was one of the 
  selling points of hst).
