 thanks for the information!
 
 i assume p is the semi-major axis and e the eccentricity.  the peri-
 helion and aphelion are then given by p(1-e) and p(1+e), i.e., about
 2.90 and 3.95 au respectively.  for jupiter, they are 4.95 and 5.45 au.
 if 1977 was after the temporary capture, this means that the comet
 ended up in an orbit that comes no closer than 1 au to jupiter's --
 which i take to be a rough indication of how far from jupiter it could
 get under jupiter's influence.

 where 1 jupiter radius = 71,000 km = 44,000 mi = 0.0005 au.  so the
 1970 figure seems unlikely to actually be anything but a perijove.
 is that the case for the 1973 figure as well?
