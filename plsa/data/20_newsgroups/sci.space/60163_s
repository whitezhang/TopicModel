 /no, northrup has a plant on long island.
 
 i don't think northrup ever had a plant on long island.  the two main airframe
 manufacturers there were (fairchild)/republic which closed its doors after the
 t-46 cancellation, and grumman (which is still hanging on last i time i called).
 i think sperry also started there.  if you're ever in the area check out the
 cradle of aviation museum at mitchell field (now mostly parking lots behind the
 nassau coliseum and the community college).  good display of vehicles from long
 island, including a lem flight article.
