 okay, the earth has a magnetic field (unless someone missed something?)
 
 okay if you put a object in the earth magnetic field, it produces electricty..
 
 now the question. can you use electricity to power a space/low earth orbit
 vehicle? and i fyou can, can you use the magnetic field of the earth to power
 it??
 can the idea of a "dragless" satellite be used in part to create the electrical
 field?
 
 after all the dragless satellite is (i might be wrong), a suspended between to
 pilons, the the pilons compensate for drag.. i think i know what i want to say,
 just not sure how to say it..
 
 a dragless satellite sounds interestingly enough liek a generator.
