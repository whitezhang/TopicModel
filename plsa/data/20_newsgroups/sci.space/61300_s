 reboost may not be a problem, if they have enough fuel.  if they don't do a 
 reboost this time, they will definitely have to do one on the next servicing
 mission.  but try to land a shuttle with that big huge telescope in the 
 back and you could have problems.  the shuttle just isn't designed to land 
 with that much weight in the payload.

 of course that is a concern too, and the loss of science during the time
 that it is on the ground.  plus a fear that if it comes down, some
 big-wig might not allow it to go back up.  but the main concern, i
 believe is the danger of the landing.  just to add another bad vibe,
 they also increase the risk of damaging an instrument.  finally, 
 this is a chance for nasa astronanuts to prove they could build and
 service a space station.  hubble was designed for in flight servicing.
 
 bringing the telescope down, to my understanding, was considered
 even very recently, but all these factors contribute to the 
 decision to do it the way it was planned in the beginning.
