 there is a whole constellation of custom built navigation beacon satellites
 in the process of being phased out right now. the transit/oscar satellites
 are being replaced by gps. or were you thinking of deep space navigation,
 which is best done with doppler/vlbi/ stellar measurements. i do not think
 additional radio beacons would help much.
