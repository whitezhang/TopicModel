 redwood city, ca (api) -- a tense stand-off entered its third week
 today as authorities reported no progress in negotiations with
 charismatic cult leader steve jobs.
 
 negotiators are uncertain of the situation inside the compound, but
 some reports suggest that half of the hundreds of followers inside
 have been terminated.  others claim to be staying of their own free
 will, but jobs' persuasive manner makes this hard to confirm.
 
 in conversations with authorities, jobs has given conflicting
 information on how heavily prepared the group is for war with the
 industry.  at times, he has claimed to "have hardware which will blow
 anything else away", while more recently he claims they have stopped
 manufacturing their own.
 
 agents from the atf (apple-taligent forces) believe that the group is
 equipped with serious hardware, including 486-caliber pieces and
 possibly canon equipment.
 
 the siege has attracted a variety of spectators, from the curious to
 other cultists.  some have offered to intercede in negotiations,
 including a young man who will identify himself only as "bill" and
 claims to be the "ms-iah".
 
 former members of the cult, some only recently deprogrammed, speak
 hesitantly of their former lives, including being forced to work
 20-hour days, and subsisting on jolt and twinkies.  there were
 frequent lectures in which they were indoctrinated into a theory of
 "interpersonal computing" which rejects traditional roles.
 
 late-night vigils on chesapeake drive are taking their toll on
 federal marshals.  loud rock and roll, mostly talking heads, blares
 throughout the night.  some fear that jobs will fulfill his own
 apocalyptic prophecies, a worry reinforced when the loudspeakers
 carry jobs' own speeches -- typically beginning with a chilling "i
 want to welcome you to the 'next world' ".
