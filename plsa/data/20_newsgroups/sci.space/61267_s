         i had to turn to one of my problem sets that i did in class for this
 little problem.  i don't have a calculator, but i do have the problem set that
 we did not too long ago, so i'll use that, and hope it's what you wanted.  
 this is a highly simplified problem, with a very simple burst.  bursts are
 usually more complex than this example i will use here.
         our burst has a peak flux of 5.43e-6 ergs cm^-2 sec^-1 and a duration
 of 8.95 seconds.  during the frst second of the burst, and the last 4 seconds,
 its flux is half of the peak flux.  it's flux is the peak flux the rest of the
 time.  assume that the background flux is 10e-7 erg cm^-2 sec^-1.
         then we had to find the integrated luminosity of the burst, for several
 different spheres: r=.25pc(oort cloud radius), r=22.5pc(at the edge of the
 galaxy), r=183.5pc or the edge of the galactic corona, and lastly at a
 r=8800mpc.  
         we integrated the flux over all time to find the fluence, then used the
 old standby formula:
                         luminosity=4(pi)(r^2)fpeak
         for a radius of .25 pc, we found an l around 10^32 erg/sec.  pretty
 energetic for close by.  for the coronal model, we found around 10^43 erg/sec.
 and lastly, for the cosmological model an l=10^53. that's what you'd call
 moderately energetic, i'd say.  any suggestions about what could put out that
 much energy in one second?
