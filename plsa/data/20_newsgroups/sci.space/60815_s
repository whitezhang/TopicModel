 let's see. these aren't, in a strict sense, amateur rockets. that term
 denotes rockets, the engines of which are constructed by the user. the
 rockets you describe are called hpr, or high power rockets, to
 distinguish them from (smaller) model rockets. they use factory-made
 ammonium perchlorate composite propellants in phenolic plastic engines
 with graphite nozzles. the engines are classified by impulse. a "d"
 engine, for example, can have no more than 20 newton-seconds of impulse.
 an "f" engine can have no more than 40 ns. each letter corresponds to a
 doubling of the maximum impulse. so far, engines up to size "o" are
 available pretty much off the shelf. engines of size h and above are
 shipped as class b explosives, and as such are controlled. engines of
 size f and below are shipped as class c explosives, and are not as
 controlled. class f engines, btw, are not hpr engines, but model rocket
 engines. (class g engines go in and out of legal limbo.)
 
 there is an hpr society, the tripoli rocket society, i believe, which
 holds events at various sites throughout the year, with all legalities
 (faa waiver included) taken care of. the national association of
 rocketry is more concerned with engines below h, though it is involved
 in hpr as well. these societies certify users of hpr rockets, and
 companies will not sell to uncertified individuals.
 
 bottom line: it's legit. i suggest you send for a catalog - but forget
 the dynamite, will ya?
