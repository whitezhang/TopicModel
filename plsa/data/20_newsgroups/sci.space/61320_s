 fine. i'll buy from george. georgeee!!!!
 
 that assumes i can't weasel out a cooperative venture of some sort (cut me a
 break on the launcher, i'll cut you in on the proceeds if it works).  only the
 government pays higher-than-list price.

 unless you're martin marietta, since (as i recall) they bought out the gd line
 of aerospace products. 
 
 if mm/gd does it as an in-house project, their costs would look much better
 than buying at "list price."  does anyone really know the profit margins built
 in to the titan?  c'mon. allen is telling us how cheap we can get improved this
 or that...

 oh please.  how much of a profit do you want?  pulling $100-150 million after
 all is said and done wouldn't be too shabby.  not to mention the other goodies
 i'll collect in:
 
 	a)  movie & tv rights (say $100-150 million conservatively)
 	b)  advertising       ("look mommie, they're drinking coke!")
 	c)  intangibles	      (name recognization, experience & data 
 				acculumated)

 if you want lean, fine.  a $500 million prize would be more than adequate for a
 prize.
 
 maybe wales would be kind enough to define what a company would consider
 a decent profit.
 
 if you want r&d done, you'll have to write in r&d clauses.  i suppose you could
 make it a sbir set-aside :)  
 
 
 
     software engineering? that's like military intelligence, isn't it?
