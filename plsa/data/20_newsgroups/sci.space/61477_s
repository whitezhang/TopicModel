 i have to agree with ward.  the problem with your approach is they add
 up what you can reasonably claim as 'spin-offs', add up what's been
 spent on space, and then come back with something like, "you spent $x
 billion for that?  wouldn't it be better just to spend the money on
 direct research and forget all this space stuff?  we could have got
 all that stuff a *lot* cheaper that way.  space is wasteful and
 inefficient."
 
 then they cancel your funding and spend it studying mating rituals of
 new guinea tribesmen or something.
