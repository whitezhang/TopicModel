 	kudos to mark for his generous offer, but there already exists a
 large (email-based) forwarding system for sci.space posts:  space digest.
 it mirrors sci.space exactly, and provides simple two-way communication.
 
 	to subscribe:
 	   send the following message in the *body* (not subject) of an
 	   email message:
 
 		subscribe space john q public
 
 	   to one of these addresses:
 
 		listserv@uga
 		listserv@uga.cc.uga.edu
 		listserv@finhutc
 		listserv@finhuc.hut.fi
 		space-request@isu.isunet.edu
 
 	   you'll receive all the posts in "digest" form once a day.  please
 	   use a listserv if you can, the "space-request" address is handled
 	   manually.
 
 	to post messages:
 	   send your message (with a reasonable subject line) to:
 
 		space@isu.isunet.edu
