 the command loss timer is a timer that does just what its name says;
 it indicates to the probe that it has lost its data link for receiving
 commands.  upon expiration of the command loss timer, i believe the
 probe starts a 'search for earth' sequence (involving antenna pointing
 and attitude changes which consume fuel) to try to reestablish
 communications.  no-ops are sent periodically through those periods
 when there are no real commands to be sent, just so the probe knows
 that we haven't forgotten about it.
 
 hope that's clear enough to be comprehensible.
