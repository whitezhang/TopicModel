 to all -- i thought the net would find this amusing..
   
 from the march 1993 "aero vision" (the newsletter for the employees
 of mcdonnell douglas aerospace at huntington beach, california).
   
   space clippers launched successfully
   
   "on monday, march 15 at noon, quest aerospace education, inc.
   launched two dc-y space clippers in the mall near the cafeteria.
   the first rocket was launched by dr. bill gaubatz, director and
   ssto program manager, and the second by air force captain ed
   spalding, who with staff sgt. don gisburne represents air force
   space command, which was requested by sdio to assess the dc-x for
   potential military operational use.  both rocket launches were
   successful.  the first floated to the ground between the cafeteria
   and building 11, and the second landed on the roof of the
   cafeteria.
   
   quest's space clipper is the first flying model rocket of the
   mcdonnell douglas dc-x.  the 1/122nd semi-scale model of the
   mcdonnell douglas delta clipper has an estimated maximum altitude
   of 300 feet.  the space clippers can be used in educational
   settings to teach mathematics and science, as well as social
   studies and other applications.  the space clipper is available
   either in the $35 space clipper outfit, which includes everything
   needed for three launches, or as individual rockets for $12 each.
   both are available through hobby shops or by calling 1-800-858-
   7302."
   
 by the way -- this is not an endorsement to buy the product nor is
 it an advertisement to buy the product.  i make no claims about the
 product.  this is posted for public information only (hey, i found
 it amusing...), and is merely a repeat of what was included in the
 mdssc huntington beach newsletter.
