 i had spacefood sticks just about every morning for breakfast in
 first and second grade (69-70, 70-71).  they came in chocolate,
 strawberry, and peanut butter and were cylinders about 10cm long
 and 1cm in diameter wrapped in yellow space foil (well, it seemed
 like space foil at the time).  
 
 the taste is hard to describe, although i remember it fondly.  it was
 most certainly more "candy" than say a modern "power bar."  sort of
 a toffee injected with vitamins.  the chocolate power bar is a rough
 approximation of the taste.  strawberry sucked.
 
 man, these were my "60's."
