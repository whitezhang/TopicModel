 thanks for typing that in, steven.  sounds like a "fall back and
 regroup" strategy session.
 
 i wanted to add that my copy of the brochure arrived with a flattering
 cover letter:
 
 "invitations are being extended to those who have demonstrated a
 strong committment to space program development and have been
 influential in its advancement.  we sincerely hope you will be able to
 attend."
 
 wow! i wonder which of my contributions to the conquest of space
 convinced them to send me this letter?
 
 i hope you decide to go, pat.  the net can use some eyes and ears
 there...
