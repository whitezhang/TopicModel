 have one small question.  as i understand it, the dc-x derived orbital
 vehicle (dc-y & 1) is to reenter the atmosphere sort of sideways, not
 completely nose-first.  so why is the dc-y look symmetric in every drawing
 i've seen?  i would think that an asymmetric design, sort of like 
 wingless orbiter, may work better, since less shielding is required on the
 top side.  can anybody explain?
