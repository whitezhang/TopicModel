 the gravity maneuvering that was used was to exploit 'fuzzy regions'.  these
 are described by the inventor as exploiting the second-order perturbations in a
 three body system.  the probe was launched into this region for the
 earth-moon-sun system, where the perturbations affected it in such a way as to
 allow it to go into lunar orbit without large expenditures of fuel to slow
 down. the idea is that 'natural objects sometimes get captured without
 expending fuel, we'll just find the trajectory that makes it possible". the
 originator of the technique said that nasa wasn't interested, but that japan
 was because their probe was small and couldn't hold a lot of fuel for
 deceleration.
 
 	this from an issue of 'science news' or 'the planetary report' i
 believe, about 2 months ago(?).
