 the people involved in it have been building hardware rather than writing
 press releases.  this is not a high-manpower project; they don't *have*
 spare people sitting around.
 
 as i understand it, there has also been some feeling on the part of some
 of the project management that publicity was not a good idea.  a lot of
 people have been working on changing this view, with some success.
