 several people have enquired about the availability of the book about the
 great 72" reflector built at birr castle, ireland in 1845 which remained the
 largest in the world until the the start of the 20th century.
 
 "the astronomy of birr castle" was written by patrick moore who now sits on
 the committee which is going to restore the telescope. (the remains are on
 public display all year round - the massive support walls, the 60 foot long
 tube, and other bits and pieces). this book is the definitivie history of
 how one man, the third earl of rosse, pulled off the most impressive
 technical achievement, perhaps ever, in the history of the telescope, and
 the discoveries made with the instrument.
 
 patrick moore is donating all proceeds from the book's sale to help restore
 the telescope. astronomy ireland is making the book available world wide by
 mail order. it's a fascinating read and by ordering a copy you bring the day
 when we can all look through it once again that little bit nearer.
