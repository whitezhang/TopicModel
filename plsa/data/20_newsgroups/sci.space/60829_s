 now, i had put a wink at the end of my suggestion indicating it was
 intensely sarcastic.  i can't help it if everyone got all serious.

 	i never saw your original posting.  it dropped on the floor
 somewhere.  i just saw the trickle down, thought it was intensely
 stupid,  not knowing anything about the joke, mentioned arbitron
 and left it with an equally stupid joke.  bill in his ever increasing
 devotion to thoroughness dug up  several  arbitron stats.
 
 i myself think the arbitron stats are  severely methodologically impaired,
 but are a good measure of proportion.  i don't think anyone
 knows how many people read news anymore.
