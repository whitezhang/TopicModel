 i have a nice quote that i like (or as close as i can remember it).
 
 if i say something that you think is crazy, ask me what i mean before you think
 its crazy.. 
 
 so some of my ideas are a bit odd, off the wall and such, but so was wilbur and
 orville wright, and quite a few others.. sorry if i do not have the big degrees
 and such, but i think (i might be wrong, to error is human) i have something
 that is in many ways just as important, i have imagination, dreams. and without
 dreams all the knowledge is worthless.. 
 
 sorry my two cents worth. or is it two rubles worth?
 
 the basic quote idea is from h. beam pipers book "space vikings". its a good
 book on how civilization can fall, and how it can be raised to new heights.
 
 unfortunately h. beam piper killed him self just weeks short of having his
 first book published, and have his ideas see light.. such a waste.
