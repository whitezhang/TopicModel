 hum, do you enjoy putting words in my mouth? 
 come to nome and meet some of these miners.. i am not sure how things go down
 south in the lower 48 (i used to visit, but), of course to believe the
 media/news its going to heck (or just plain crazy). 
 well it seems that alot of unionist types seem to think that having a job is a
 right, and not a priviledge. right to the same job as your forbearers, see:
 kennedy's and tel me what you see (and the families they have married into).
 there is a reason why many historians and poli-sci types use unionist and
 socialist in the same breath.
 the miners that i know, are just your average hardworking people who pay there
 taxes and earn a living.. but taxes are not the answer. but maybe we could move
 this discussion to some more appropriate newsgroup..
