     computing crater diameters from earth-impacting asteroids
 
     astrogeologist gene shoemaker proposes the following formula, based on
     studies of cratering caused by nuclear tests.
 
 		     (1/3.4)
     d = s  s  c  k  w	    : crater diameter in km
 	 g  p  f  n
 
 	       (1/6)
     s = (g /g )		    : gravity correction factor for bodies other than
      g	  e  t		      earth, where g = 9.8 m/s^2 and g	is the surface
 					    e		      t
 			      gravity of the target body. this scaling is
 			      cited for lunar craters and may hold true for
 			      other bodies.
 
 		(1/3.4)
     s = (p / p )	    : correction factor for target density p  ,
      p	  a   t							    t
 			      p  = 1.8 g/cm^3 for alluvium at the jangle u
 			       a
 			      crater site, p = 2.6 g/cm^3 for average
 			      rock on the continental shields.
 
     c			    : crater collapse factor, 1 for craters <= 3 km
 			      in diameter, 1.3 for larger craters (on earth).
 
 							    (1/3.4)
     k			    : .074 km / (kt tnt equivalent)
      n			      empirically determined from the jangle u
 			      nuclear test crater.
 
 	      3		   2		       19
     w = pi * d	* delta * v  / (12 * 4.185 * 10  )
 			    : projectile kinetic energy in kt tnt equivalent
 			      given diameter d, velocity v, and projectile
 			      density delta in cgs units. delta of around 3
 			      g/cm^3 is fairly good for an asteroid.
 
     an rms velocity of v = 20 km/sec may be used for earth-crossing
     asteroids.
 
     under these assumptions, the body which created the barringer meteor
     crater in arizona (1.13 km diameter) would have been about 40 meters in
     diameter.
 
     more generally, one can use (after gehrels, 1985):
 
     asteroid	    number of objects  impact probability  impact energy
     diameter (km)		       (impacts/year)	   (* 5*10^20 ergs)
 
      10			    10		     10^-8		10^9
       1			 1 000		     10^-6		10^6
       0.1	       100 000		     10^-4		10^3
 
     assuming simple scaling laws. note that 5*10^20 ergs = 13 000 tons tnt
     equivalent, or the energy released by the hiroshima a-bomb.

     map projections and spherical trignometry
 
     two easy-to-find sources of map projections are the "encyclopaedia
     brittanica", (particularly the older volumes) and a tutorial appearing
     in _graphics gems_ (academic press, 1990). the latter was written with
     simplicity of exposition and suitability of digital computation in mind
     (spherical trig formulae also appear, as do digitally-plotted examples).
 
     more than you ever cared to know about map projections is in john
     snyder's usgs publication "map projections--a working manual", usgs
     professional paper 1395. this contains detailed descriptions of 32
     projections, with history, features, projection formulas (for both
     spherical earth and ellipsoidal earth), and numerical test cases. it's a
     neat book, all 382 pages worth. this one's $20.
 
     you might also want the companion volume, by snyder and philip voxland,
     "an album of map projections", usgs professional paper 1453. this
     contains less detail on about 130 projections and variants. formulas are
     in the back, example plots in the front. $14, 250 pages.
 
     you can order these 2 ways. the cheap, slow way is direct from usgs:
     earth science information center, us geological survey, 507 national
     center, reston, va 22092. (800)-usa-maps. they can quote you a price and
     tell you where to send your money. expect a 6-8 week turnaround time.
 
     a much faster way (about 1 week) is through timely discount topos,
     (303)-469-5022, 9769 w. 119th drive, suite 9, broomfield, co 80021. call
     them and tell them what you want. they'll quote a price, you send a
     check, and then they go to usgs customer service counter and pick it up
     for you. add about a $3-4 service charge, plus shipping.
 
     a (perhaps more accessible) mapping article is:
 
 	r. miller and f. reddy, "mapping the world in pascal",
 	byte v12 #14, december 1987
 
 	contains turbo pascal procedures for five common map projections. a
 	demo program, cartog.pas, and a small (6,000 point) coastline data
 	is available on compuserve, genie, and many bbss.

     interpreting the fits image format
 
     if you just need to examine fits images, use the ppm package (see the
     comp.graphics faq) to convert them to your preferred format. for more
     information on the format and other software to read and write it, see
     the sci.astro.fits faq.
 
 
     sky (unix ephemeris program)
 
     the 6th edition of the unix operating system came with several software
     systems not distributed because of older media capacity limitations.
     included were an ephmeris, a satellite track, and speech synthesis
     software. the ephmeris, sky(6), is available within at&t and to sites
     possessing a unix source code license. the program is regarded as unix
     source code. sky is <0.5mb. send proof of source code license to

     three-dimensional star/galaxy coordinates
 
     to generate 3d coordinates of astronomical objects, first obtain an
     astronomical database which specifies right ascension, declination, and
     parallax for the objects. convert parallax into distance using the
     formula in part 6 of the faq, convert ra and declination to coordinates
     on a unit sphere (see some of the references on planetary positions and
     spherical trignometry earlier in this section for details on this), and
     scale this by the distance.
 
     two databases useful for this purpose are the yale bright star catalog
     (sources listed in faq section 3) or "the catalogue of stars within 25
     parsecs of the sun" (in pub/space/faq/stars.data and stars.doc on
     ames.arc.nasa.gov).
