    i assume that can only be guessed at by the assumed energy of the
    event and the 1/r^2 law.  so, if the 1/r^2 law is incorrect (assume
    some unknown material [dark matter??] inhibits gamma ray propagation),
    could it be possible that we are actually seeing much less energetic
    events happening much closer to us?  the even distribution could
    be caused by the characteristic propagation distance of gamma rays 
    being shorter then 1/2 the thickness of the disk of the galaxy.
 
 i believe the problem with this theory is that we see gamma-ray
 sources at that energy range and their energy doesn't seem to be
 significantly absorbed.
