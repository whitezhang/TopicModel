     on april 21. at 00.25 ut two people saw a bright, luminous
     pillar-shaped phenomenon in the low eastern horizont near
     mikkeli. the head of the pillar was circular. the lower part
     was a little winding. it was like a monster they told. they
     were little frightened. soon the yellowish pillar became
     enlarged. a bright spot like the sun was appeared in the middle
     of the phenomenon. at last the light landed behind the nearby
     forest. now there was only luminous trails in the sky which were
     visible till morning sunrise.
 
     the same phenomenon was observed also by jaakko kokkonen in
     lappeenranta. at 00.26 ut he saw a luminous yellowish trail in
     the low northeastern horizont. the altitude of the trail was
     only about 3-4 degrees. soon the trail began to grow taller.
     a loop was appeared in the head of the trail. it was like a
     spoon. this lasted only 10 seconds. now the altitude was about
     five degress above horizont. he noted a bright spot at the
     upper stage of loop. the spot was at magnitude -2. the loop
     became enlarged and the spot was now visible in the middle of
     the loop. a cartwheel-shaped trail was appeared round the bright
     spot. after a minute the spot disappeared and only fuzzy trails
     were only visible in the low horizont. luminous trails were still
     visible at 01.45 ut in the morning sky.
 
     the phenomenon was caused by a russian rocket. i don't know if
     there were satellite launches in plesetsk cosmodrome near
     arkhangelsk, but this may be a rocket experiment too. since 1969
     we have observed over 80 rocket phenomena in finland. most of
     these are rocket experiments (military missile tests?), barium
     experiments and other chemical releases. during these years we
     have observed 17 satellite launches.
