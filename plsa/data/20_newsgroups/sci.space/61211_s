 that is an idea.. the most efficient moon habitat.. 
 
 also the idea of how to get the people off the moon once the prize was won..
 
 also the idea of how to rescue someone who is "dying" on the moon.
 
 maybe have a area where they can all "see" each other, and can help each other
 if something happens.. 
 
 i liek the idea of one prize for the first moon landing and return, by a
 non-governmental body..
 
 also the idea of then having a moon habitat race.. 
 
 i know we need to do somthing to get people involved..
 
 eccentric millionaire/billionaire would be nice.. we see how old ross feels
 about it.. after all it would be a great promotional thing and a way to show he
 does care about commericalization and the people.. will try to broach the
 subject to him.. 
 
 moonbase on the cheap is a good idea.. nasa and friends seem to take to much
 time and give us to expensive stuff that of late does not work (hubble and
 such). basically what is the difference between a $1mil peice of junk and a
 multi $1mil piece of junk.. i know junk..
