 as i heard the story, before albert came up the the theory
 o'relativity and warped space, nobody could account for
 mercury's orbit.  it ran a little fast (i think) for simple
 newtonian physics.  with the success in finding neptune to
 explain the odd movments of uranus, it was postulated that there
 might be another inner planet to explain mercury's orbit.  
 
 it's unlikely anything bigger than an asteroid is closer to the
 sun than mercury.  i'm sure we would have spotted it by now.
 perhaps some professionals can confirm that.
