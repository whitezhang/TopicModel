 yes, but that's because interstellar grains are very poor radiators, not
 remotely black bodies.  as a consequence they are a lot warmer than the
 "ambient".

 when i was in graduate school, a long time ago, we used 10,000 deg k with
 a dilution factor of 10+4 for representative values of the radiant energy
 background in the galaxy due to starlight.
