 well, i'm working on it, but getting a little impatient. so far, 
 i've made it through egyptian, chinese, and greek cultures, and
 up through the rennaisance. but so far, these insights just don't 
 seem to be gelling. perhaps it's in an appendix somewhere.
 
 in its own right, though, the history is kind of fun. lots of 
 good yarns in there, with varied and interesting characters. and,
 more to come.
