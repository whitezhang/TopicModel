 i don't think this will work.  still the same in space
 integration problems,  small modules, especially the bus-1 modules.
 the mol would be bigger.   
 
 also,  budget problems  may end up stalling developemnt.  
 a small undersized station wont have the science community support.

 program effeciencies may cut costs,  but the basic problems
 with freedom remain.  in space integration,  too many flights
 too build.  not enough science retrurn.

 essentialy  $5 billion to build mir.
 
 i think had nasa  locked onto this design, back in 1984,  with
 scarring to support a truss for real expandability,  we'd be looking
 at a flying space station.
 
 this looks the most realistic, to me,  imho,  but,  i dont know if
 there is enough will power  to toss the cdr'd  existing hardware
 and then  take a 1/3rd  power cut  and do it this way.
 
 the core  launch station has a lot of positive ideas.  you could stick
 in more hatches for  experimental  concept modules.  like the et
 derived workshops.  or inflatable modules.
