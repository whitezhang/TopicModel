 sirtf is still very much in business

      in these times of extra-tight nasa budgets, the very
 survival of a number of missions has been uncertain. but thanks
 to major design refinements implemented in recent months, jpl's
 space infrared telescope facility (sirtf) -- a major project
 considered to be in trouble a couple of years ago -- is "alive
 and well," according to project scientist michael werner.
      a lighter spacecraft, revised orbit and shorter mission have
 added up to a less expensive project with "tremendous scientific
 power" and a bright future, said werner.
      designed as a follow-up to the highly successful infrared
 astronomical satellite (iras) and cosmic background explorer
 (cobe) missions, sirtf -- a cryogenically cooled observatory for
 infrared astronomy from space -- is scheduled for launch in 2000
 or 2001 if plans proceed as scheduled.
      iras' pioneering work in space-based infrared astronomy 10
 years ago allowed astronomers to view the milky way as never
 before and revealed, among other things, 60,000 galaxies and 25
 comets. it provided a sky survey 1,000 times more sensitive than
 any previously available from ground-based observations. cobe has
 measured the infrared and microwave background radiation on large
 angular scales, and revealed new facts about the early universe.
      but to illuminate sirtf's potential, jim evans, jpl's
 manager of astrophysics and fundamental physics pre-projects,
 recently said that the project is "1,000 to 1 million times more
 capable than iras," based on technological advances in infrared
 detector arrays.
      however, despite the enormous strides in infrared
 exploration sirtf promised, and the fact that it was cited as the
 highest priority new initiative for all of astronomy in the 1990s
 (by the national academy of sciences), it took a "diet or die"
 directive from nasa headquarters last year to keep the project
 going, according to werner.
      the project is now known as atlas sirtf, based on the key
 factor in its new design: the satellite will orbit the sun
 instead of the earth, permitting the use of an atlas rocket
 launch instead of the formerly proposed and heavier titan. "the
 main advantage of the solar orbit is that you can use all of your
 launch capability for boosting the payload -- you don't have to
 carry up a second rocket to circularize the orbit," werner said.
 the other advantage to a solar orbit, he said, is that "it's in a
 better thermal environment, away from the heat of the earth."
      additional major changes in sirtf's redesign include
 shortening the mission from five to three years and building a
 spacecraft that is less than half as heavy as in the original
 plan -- atlas sirtf will weigh 2,470 kilograms (5,400 pounds)
 compared to titan sirtf's 5,500 kilograms (12,100 pounds).
      all of that adds up to "a less stressful launch
 environment," werner said, and a cost savings of more than $200
 million for the launch, in addition to increased savings in the
 design of the smaller, less massive spacecraft.
      werner said sirtf's redesign came as a result of congress'
 telling nasa "you're trying to do too many things. if you want us
 to support sirtf, which is a good project, develop a plan to see
 how it fits into (nasa's) overall strategy."
      shortly thereafter, sirtf was named as nasa's highest
 priority "flagship" scientific mission by the interdisciplinary
 space sciences advisory committee, in addition to the blessing
 from the national academy of sciences.
      while the spacecraft and its instruments required descoping
 to keep the project alive, sirtf's major scientific contribution
 always promised to come about from its advanced infrared detector
 arrays, which will allow images to be developed "tens of
 thousands of times faster" than before, according to evans.
      "up until a couple of years ago," werner said, "all infrared
 astronomy was done with single detectors -- or very small arrays
 of individually assembled detectors. since then, the department
 of defense has developed a program to produce arrays of tens or
 hundreds of thousands of detectors, rather than just a few, and
 those are very well suited for use on sirtf."
      werner noted that in addition to dealing with budget
 pressures, congress is currently watching nasa projects with an
 eye out for any "technological spinoff."
      "on that question, i think we have some things to say," he
 said, "because the detectors we're using are straight off various
 military developments. also, sirtf will be built by the u.s.
 aerospace industry, and it's a real technological and engineering
 challenge in addition to being a tremendous scientific project.
      "sirtf will be used by the entire astronomical community,"
 werner added, but the revised three-year mission "puts a premium
 on observing time. we have to educate the user community and
 develop a program that involves early surveys and quick
 turnaround of the data."
      werner said the downsizing of the project required a
 reduction in scope and complexity of sirtf's three instruments --
 the infrared spectrograph, infrared array camera and multiband
 imaging photometer. however, these reductions will only result in
 losses of efficiency rather than capability, he said.
      the project hopes to start a "phase b" activity in 1995,
 which will provide a detailed concept for development and design.
 building the hardware would begin about two years later.
      projected cost estimates, evans said, are $850 million-$950
 million.
      "i am very optimistic about sirtf," he said. "it will
 provide a tremendous return for the investment."
      werner added that an additional benefit from the project
 will be the "enrichment of our intellectual and cultural
 environment. people on the street are very interested in
 astronomy ... black holes, the possibility of life on other
 planets, the origin of the universe ... and those are the kind of
 questions sirtf will help answer."
