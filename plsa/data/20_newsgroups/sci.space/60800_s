 it still applies, except the astronomy these days is very long baseline
 radio astronomy coupled to gps and satellite laser ranging. the data
 from nasa's and the naval observatory's (among others) is a vital 
 source of data for studies into crustal dynamics, earth rotation, and
 purturbations. every time there is a leap second added to the new year,
 remember the military and science are still co-habiting nicely. the
 same vlbi was used to track gallileo as it passed the earth, and used
 so little fuel that it can afford to observe ida.
