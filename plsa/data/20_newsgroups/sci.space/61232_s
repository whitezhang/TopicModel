 level 5 refers to the carnegie-mellon software engineering institute's
 capability maturity model.  this model rates software development
 org's from1-5.  with 1 being chaotic and 5 being optimizing.  dod is
 beginning to use this rating system as a discriminator in contracts.  i
 have more data on thifrom 1 page to 1000.  i have a 20-30 page
 presentation that summarizes it wethat i could fax to you if you're
 interested...
