 i realy like this idea, it would be wonderfull to see such a 
 big bright satelite on the night sky. i will even promise to
 try to buy whatever product it advertises to help this project.
 
 please write to space marketing and encourage this project.
 i sadly dosent have enough money to invest in it.
