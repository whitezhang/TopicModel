 i know its semantics, but the "no-op" _doesn't_ do anything.  the
 command loss timer is simply looking for a command, any command.  a
 "no-op" is simply a spacecraft command that drops bits into the big
 bit bucket in the sky.  "no-op" also get used as timekeepers to provide
 millisecond delays between command sequences (used on the thruster preps
 on gro, er, compton) and to verify command links at the beginning of
 tdrs events.  all in all, a rather useful command.  and, an intelligent
 fdc test on galileo (the command loss timer).
