 you'd need to launch hlvs to send up large amounts of stuff *if* you assume
 no new launcher development.  if you assume new launcher development, with
 lower costs as a specific objective, then you probably don't want to
 build something hlv-sized anyway.
 
 nobody who is interested in launching things cheaply will buy titans.  it
 doesn't take many titan pricetags to pay for a laser launcher or a large
 gas gun or a development program for a big dumb booster, all of which
 would have far better cost-effectiveness.
