 	sigh.
 	i try to make a little joke, i try to inject some humour here
 and what happens?  in the immortal words of foghorn leghorn:
 
 	"i say, that was a _joke_, son."
 
 	i thought that the bit about mcelwaine, not to mention the two

 joking.
 	sigh.
 	(and will everyone who pat's suggestion (thanks bunches, pat)
 *please* stop sending me email.)
