 it is kind of absurd, isn't it?  some players even want more distortion,
 especially the hendrix fans :-)  but there are a lot of them out there
 that can only afford the amp, or who like playing music without distortion.
 then there are your hard-core hendirx fans that want particular *types*
 of distortion, i.e., they make it, not their amps.

 i didn't see a thing about waste-heat from babbage, and haven't seen one
 of those mechanical tv's in a while, so it's anybodie's guess :-)
