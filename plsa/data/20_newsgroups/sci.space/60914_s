 a brief political/cultural item.
 
 radio station wgms in washington is a classical music station with
 a large audience among high officials (elected and otherwise).  
 imagine a radio station that advertises mercedes benzes, diamond
 jewelry, expensive resorts and (truthfully) trident submarines.
 
 this morning i heard a commercial for the space station project.
 didn't catch the advertiser.
 
 guess they're pulling out all the stops.
