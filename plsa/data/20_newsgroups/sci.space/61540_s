 i didn't think the bi-stem design was used so much for the retrieval as
 for the ability to launch in a tight (size) sts envelope.  this is my own 
 guess, based on similar designs flown on other large sts-launched s/c 
 (gro, uars).  also, there _might_ be some consideration given to mass 
 requirements (bi-stems weight less than conventional s/a).  finally, 
 the hst arrays _do_ have the ability to be detached--remember, they're 
 going to be replaced with new arrays.
 
 however, as an acs guy who's seen his branch management pull their
 collective hair out over hst, i would voice a hearty 'yea' to using
 conventional arrays over bi-stems, whenever possible.  no half hertz
 flexible modes, no thermal snap, no problem.
