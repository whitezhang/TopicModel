 
 
 for an essay, i am writing about the space shuttle and a need for a better
 propulsion system.  through research, i have found that it is rather clumsy 
 (i.e. all the checks/tests before launch), the safety hazards ("sitting
 on a hydrogen bomb"), etc..  if you have any beefs about the current
 space shuttle program re: propulsion, please send me your ideas.
 
 thanks a lot.
