 has someone actually verified that mass is the predominant constraint on this
 mission?  you seem to be assuming it without giving supporting evidence.

 pat, this would be slower, more expensive and worse.  
 
 slower:  the shuttle mission is scheduled to go up in december.  that's less
 than eight months away.  there is no way you could build new hardware, retrain
 and reschedule the eva's in that time.
 
 more expensive:  your proposal still requires the shuttle to do everything it
 was going to do execpt fire the oms.  in addition, you've added significant
 extra cost for a new piece of complex hardware.
 
 
 according to a gao report on the omv i have before me, there are
 only two currently planned missions that could use such a vehicle -- hst and
 axaf.  since axaf has since been scaled back and hst can rely on the shuttle,
 there doesn't seem to be any need for your vehicle.
