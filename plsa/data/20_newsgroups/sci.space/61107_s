    other idea for old space crafts is as navigation beacons and such..
    why not??
 
 because to be any use as a nav point you need to know -exactly- where
 it is, which means you either nail it to something that doesn't move
 or you watch it all the time.  neither of which is possible on a
 deactivated spacecraft.  then you have to know exactly how far away
 from it you are; this may or may not be possible with the hardware on
 board. 
 
 apart from which, there is absolutely no need for navigation beacons.
