 i'd be willing to bet that a majority of the cost difference could be
 accounted for by the af's requirement for superfluous 2167 documentation, 5
 or 6 huge requirements and design reviews, travel expenses flying personnel
 around to meetings, and over specifying the hardware. i doubt that the
 actual fabrication cost in materials and labor would be very different from
 sdio's costs.
 
 of course, this is my cynical opinion based on years of watching the
 government procurement process try to cover up a lack of creativity and
 innovation with reams of documentation. ;)
