 henry, i made the assumption that he who gets there firstest with the mostest
 wins. 
 
 ohhh, you want to put in fine print which says "thou shall do wonderous r&d
 rather than use off-the-shelf hardware"? sorry, didn't see that in my copy.
 most of the pournellesque proposals run along the lines of <some dollar
 amount> reward for <some simple goal>.  
 
 you go ahead and do your development, i'll buy off the shelf at higher cost (or
 even russian; but i also assume that there'd be some "buy us" provos in there)
 and be camped out in the moon while you are launching and assembling little
 itty-bitty payloads in leo with your laser or gas gun.  and working out the
 bugs of assembly & integration in leo. 
 
 oh, hey, could i get a couple of canadarms tuned for the lunar environment?  i
 wanna do some teleoperated prospecting while i'm up there...
 
 
 
 
     software engineering? that's like military intelligence, isn't it?
