 you're assuming that "go solar" = "photovoltaic".  solar dynamic power
 (turbo-alternators) doesn't have this problem.  it also has rather less
 air drag due to its higher efficiency, which is a non-trivial win for big
 solar plants at low altitude.
 
 now, you might have to replace the *rest* of the electronics fairly often,
 unless you invest substantial amounts of mass in shielding.

 references?  such treaties have been *proposed*, but as far as i know,
 none of them has ever been negotiated or signed.
