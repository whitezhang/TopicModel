 comet (commercial experiment transport) is to launch from wallops island
 virginia and orbit earth for about 30 days. it is scheduled to come down
 in the utah test & training range, west of salt lake city, utah. i saw
 a message in this group toward the end of march that it was to launch 
 on march 27. does anyone know if it launched on that day, or if not, 
 when it is scheduled to launch and/or when it will come down.
 
 i would also be interested in what kind(s) of payload(s) are onboard.
 
 thanks for your help.
