 this is, shall we say, an overly-broad statement.  in particular, are you
 referring to the native american culture that existed in 1400, or the one
 that existed in 1800?  (simplify things by assuming we're talking about
 the eastern us rather than the whole continent.)  given that those were
 *radically* different cultures, which one are you referring to?

 note that the pre-columbian native americans, east of the mississippi,
 did all of these things.  (well, maybe not "on sunday", but they did
 have organized religions, not to mention cities and governments.)  if
 you are judging the native americans by the tribal culture that existed
 in 1800, you might want to read an account of the de soto expedition
 to find out what pre-columbian native american culture, at least in the
 more civilized parts of the continent, was like.
