 the japanese spacecraft, hiten, crashed on the moon last weekend.  for the
 past three years it has made several lunar flybys and even did some
 aerobraking experiments with earth's atmosphere.  it was placed in lunar
 orbit in february 1992, and i guess it finally ran out of fuel and was
 unable to maintain its orbit around the moon.
