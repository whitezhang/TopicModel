 for the purpose of a contest, i'd bet some things could be cut.  like fuel
 for re-entry, any kind of heat shielding, etc., etc.  even still, if the
 contest participants had to fund dc-1 development, it probably wouldn't be
 worth it to develop dc-1 (just for the contest).  just give me the cheapest
 heaviest lift man rated (or at least under 6 or so gs) booster...  if i
 don't have to pay for dc-1 development, great!, i'll use it.
 
 but back to the contest goals, there was a recent article in aw&st about a
 low cost (it's all relative...) manned return to the moon.  a general
 dynamics scheme involving a titan iv & shuttle to lift a centaur upper
 stage, lev, and crew capsule.  the mission consists of delivering two
 unmanned payloads to the lunar surface, followed by a manned mission. 
 total cost:  us was $10-$13 billion.  joint esa(?)/nasa project was $6-$9
 billion for the us share.
 
 i didn't find a mention of how long the crew could stay, but i'd bet that
 its  around 30 days.  and the total payload delivered was about 30 metric
 tonnes.  so if you ignore the scientific payload, hitch a ride in the crew
 habitation module (no return trip...), and toss in a few more tonnes for
 the additional consumables to last another 11 months, then you *might* be
 able to get a year visit out of 15 tonnes (and in case its not obvious,
 that's a wild ass guess).  a pretty boring visit, since every trip outdoors
 eats up a bit of lox.  and i'm not certain if a home brewed (or
 college-brewed) life support system could last a year.  but let's round
 this up to 19.4 tonnes (convient, since the gd plan talks about 9.7 ton
 payloads delivered to the lunar surface.  this adds up to two centaurs, two
 levs, two shuttle flights... all to put a single man on the moon for a
 year.   hmmm.  not really practical.  anyone got a cheaper/better way of
 delivering 15-20 tonnes to the lunar surface within the decade?  anyone
 have a more precise guess about how much a year's supply of consumables and
 equipment would weigh?
 
 and i was wondering about the gd lev.  is it reusable?  or is it discarded
 to burn up on return to leo?  if its not discarded, could it be refueled? 
 henry: do you know anything about the gd lev?  i noted that it uses rl-10
 engines.  aren't they reusable/restartable?  would a lev fit in a dc-1? 
 i've forgotten (if i ever knew) what the cargo bay dimensions are for the
 dc-1.
 
 all in all, i'm not certain that the single goal/prize of staying on the
 moon for a year is wise and/or useful.  how about:  a prize for the first
 non-government sponsered unmanned moon landing, then another for a manned
 moon landing, then yet another for a system to extract consumables from
 lunar soil, another for a reusable earth/moon shuttle, and so forth.  find
 some way to build civilian moonbase infrastructure...  having a single goal
 might result in a bunch of contestents giving up after one person appeared
 to win.  and for those that didn't give up, i find something a little scary
 about a half dozen people huddling in rickety little moon shelters.  i'd
 like to see as much a reward for co-operation as for competition.
 
 lastly, about ten or fifteen years back i seem to recall that there was an
 english space magazine that had an on-going discussion about moonbases on
 the cheap.  i recalled it discussed things like how much heat the human
 body produced, how much lunar material it'd need for protection from solar
 flares, etc.  unfortunately i don't remember the name of this magazine. 
 does this ring a bell to anyone?
