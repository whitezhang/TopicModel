 this sounds like another of ali abutaha's 57 different "real causes" of
 the challenger accident.  as far as i know, there has never been the
 slightest shred of evidence for a "harmonic resonance" having occurred.
 
 the windshear-induced maneuvering probably *did* contribute to opening
 up the leak path in the srb joint again -- it seems to have sealed itself
 after the puffs of smoke during liftoff -- but the existing explanation
 of this and related events seems to account for the evidence adequately.
