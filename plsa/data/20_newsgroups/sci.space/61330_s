 astronomy & space magazine's uk telephone newsline carries the times to
 see the russian space station mir which will be visible every evening (some
 time between 9 o'clock and midnight) from april 27 to may 7. it's about as
 bright as jupiter at its best. there are two cosmonuats on board.
 
 for the time to watch, tel. 0891-88-19-50 (48p/min peak 36p/min all other
 times, but prediction is at start of the weekly message so it only costs a
 few pence).
 
 e-mail reports of sightings would be appreciated: give lat/long and ut (a
 few seconds accuracy if possible) when it passes above or below any bright
 star (say brighter than mag. 3), planet or moon.
 
 with moon in evening sky also, note that from somewhere in u.k. mir will
 pass in front of the moon each night! please alert local clubs to the
 telephone newsline, and general public as mir can cause quite a stir!
