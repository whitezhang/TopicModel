 as for sf and advertising in space. there is a romantic episode
 in mead's "the big ball of wax" where the lovers are watching 
 the constellation pepsi cola rising over the horizon and noting
 the some 'stars' had slipped cause the teamsters were on strike.
 
 this was the inspiration for my article on orbiting a formation
 of space mirrors published in spaceflight in 1986. as the reviews
 said: this seems technically feasible, and could be commercially viable
 but is it aesthetically desirable?  these days the only aesthetics
 that count are the ones you can count!
