 sorry folks, i should have done this, and meant to just after i hit the 
 send key...
 
 orbital elements of comet 1977vii (from dance files)
 
 p(au)          3.424346
 e              0.151899
 i              1.0988
 cap_omega(0) 243.5652
 w(0)         231.1607
 epoch       1977.04110
 
 also, perihelions of gehrels3 were:
 
 april  1973     83 jupiter radii
 august 1970     ~3 jupiter radii
 
 hope this helps...i'm even less of an orbital mechanic than i am an artist.
