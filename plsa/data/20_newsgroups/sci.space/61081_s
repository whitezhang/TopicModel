 this is a common misconception.  there was nothing "off the wall"
 about the wright brothers.  they were in correspondance with a number
 of other experimenters (octave chanute, lillienthal, etc), they flew
 models, they had a wind tunnel.  in short, they were quite mainstream
 and were not regarded as odd or eccentric by the community.
 
 i suggest you read the bishop's boys or the biography by harry gates?
 combs?  (i can never remember which it is--the guy that had the fbos
 and owned learjet for a while).  these are both in print and easily
 obtainable.  the bishop's boys is in trade paperback, even.
 
 even better would be the multi-volume set of the wrights' writings,
 but this is out of print, rare, and hideously expensive.
