 sure about that? maybe proxima might cause problems, but at oort
 cloud distances ac a and ac b together look like a point source.
 
 besides, even the solar system's oort cloud is unstable over
 geologic time, right, and needs to be replentished from somewhere
 else, like the short period comets of the kupier belt?
 
 (or maybe i'm misremembering something i read or heard somewhere...)

 until we're able to perform a broad-band survey of nearby stars
 to detect planets, we won't know enough to say whether or not
 a single star has planets. and we're likely to find out about the
 close ones first.
 
 heck, if neutron stars can have planets, anything can have planets.
 (or was that discovery disconfirmed?)
