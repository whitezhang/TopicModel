 just a thought... (let's pretend it is inflated and pressurized) wouldn't
 there be a large static electricity build up around the puncture?
 if the metalization is behind a clear sandwich (ie. insulated) then the 
 deflating balloon would generate electrical interference - "noise"
 
 by the way, any serious high velocity impact would simply cut a "bugs
 bunny" hole through the wall, highly unlikely to "boom", and the fabric
 would almost certainly be ripstop.
