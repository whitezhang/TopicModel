 the japanese are still on the learning curve as far as nuclear power goes.
 this means that unlike the germans (who do great things all by themselves)
 the japanese tie up with foreign companies. the major one is mitsubishi
 (who else) who have a sharing agreement with ge i think. no chance of a
 new design.

 sodium has *lots* of chemical problems. like it eats stainless steel. very
 slowly but it gets there in the end. not what i call a desired property.
 as for design difficulties, what does sodium do there? it is a bitch and
 it is only its chemical properties (flwed though they are) that means it
 gets used. two loops? that's not a design problem? isolation from air and
 water? that doesn't cause design problems? in comparison bwr's a dream rides!

 don't get none of that in a liquid sodium breeder! more steel, more complexity.
