 it would be nice if someone here from the hst program was talking instead
 of all the speculation that is going on here. from what i understand from
 dr. frank six of the marshall space flight center there is no insrmountable
 problem in bringing hst back. it was designed that way to begin with.
 
 also it is my understanding that the solar arrays will be one of the items
 replaced on this mission. the originals were built by brit aerospace and
 i think the new ones are too. i am currently working with the guys at msfc
 that are in charge is the hst power system, although i have not spoken with
 them in a long time about hst.
