 ;1. space billboards! is this one the "spinoffs" we were promised?
 ;what about light pollution in observations? (i read somewhere else that

 ;is nasa really supporting this junk?
 ;are protesting groups being organized in the states?

 i wouldn't worry about it.  there's enough space debris up there that
 a mile-long inflatable would probably deflate in some very short
 period of time (less than a year) while cleaning up leo somewhat.
 sort of a giant fly-paper in orbit.
 
 hmm, that could actually be useful.
 
 as for advertising -- sure, why not?  a nasa friend and i spent one
 drunken night figuring out just exactly how much gold mylar we'd need
 to put the golden arches of a certain american fast food organization
 on the face of the moon.  fortunately, we sobered up in the morning.
