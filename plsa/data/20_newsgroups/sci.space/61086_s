   of course; sorry for the misunderstanding.  i was referring to the fact
 that far more aeronautical development took place in the '30's.  for much
 of the '20's, the super-abundance of jennies and ox-5 engines held down the
 industry.  by 1926, many of the obsolete wwi aircraft had been retired
 and whirlwind had their power/weight ratio and reliability up to the point
 where long-distance flights became practical.  it's important to note that
 the atlantic was flown not once but three times in 1927:  lindbergh,
 chamberlin and levine, and byrd's _america_.  "when it's time to railroad,
 you railroad."

   not off the top of my head; i'll have to dig out my reference books again.
 however, i will say that the most common arrangement in prince henry the
 navigator's portugal was for the prince to put up part of the money and
 merchants to put up the rest.  they profits from the voyage would then be
 shared.

   the problem is that the amount of prize money required to inspire a
 moon base is much larger than any but a handful of individuals or corporations
 can even consider putting up.  the kremer prizes (human powered aircraft),
 orteig's prize, lord northcliffe's prize for crossing the atlantic (won in
 1919 by alcock and brown) were much smaller.  the technologies required were
 within the reach of individual inventors, and the prize amounts were well
 within the reach of a large number of wealthy individuals.  i think that only
 a gov't could afford to set up a $1b+ prize for any purpose whatsoever.
   note that burt rutan suggested that nasp could be built most cheaply by
 taking out an ad in avweek stating that the first company to build a plane
 that could take off and fly the profile would be handed $3b, no questions
 asked.
