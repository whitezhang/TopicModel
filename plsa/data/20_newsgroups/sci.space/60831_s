 portuguese launch complex??? gosh.... polish are for american in the 
 same way as portuguese are for brazilians (i am from brazil). there is 
 a joke about the portuguese space agency that wanted to send a 
 portuguese  astronaut to the surface of the sun (if there is such a thing).
 how did they solve all problems of sending a man to the surface of the 
 sun??? simple... their astronauts travelled during the night...
