 if not for the lack of extraneously capitalized words, i'd swear that
 mcelwaine had changed his name and moved to cal poly.  i also find the
 choice of newsgroups 'interesting'.  perhaps someone should tell this
 guy that 'sci.astro' doesn't stand for 'astrology'?
 
 it's truly frightening that posts like this are originating at what
 are ostensibly centers of higher learning in this country.  small
 wonder that the rest of the world thinks we're all nuts and that we
 have the problems that we do.
 
 [in case you haven't gotten it yet, david, i don't think this was
 quite appropriate for a posting to 'sci' groups.]
