 but with cheaper fuel from space based sources it will be cheaper to 
 reach more orbits than from the ground.
 
 also remember, that the presence of a repair/supply facility adds value
 to the space around it. if you can put your satellite in an orbit where it
 can be reached by a ready source of supply you can make it cheaper and gain
 benefit from economies of scale.
