 okay, del, so michael was being unfair, but you are being unfair back.  
 he is taking college courses now, i presume he is studying hard, and
 his postings reveal that he is *somewhat* hip to the technical issues
 of astronautics.  plus, he is attentively following the erudite
 discourse of the big brains who post to sci.space; is it not
 inevitable that he will get a splendid technical education from
 reading the likes of you and me? [1]
 
 like others involved in sci.space, mr. adams shows symptoms of being a
 fledgling member of the technoculture, and i think he's soaking it up
 fast.  i was a young guy with dreams once, and they led me to get a
 technical education to follow them up.  too bad i wound up in an
 assembly-line job stamping out identical neutrinos day after day...
 (-:
 
 [1] though rumors persist that del and i are both pseudonyms of fred
 mccall.
