  let me get this right - sorry, try again.  let me get this straight - 
 well maybe that too is a poor choice of words - someone might think 
 i'm pushing a gay agenda.  how about:  let me try to understand this 
 by re-phrasing it as an extreme.  i, as a minority of one, have no right 
 to a beautiful world.  you, on the other hand have the right to make an 
 ugly one because you presume to speak for all the rest.  and i cannot 
 complain.  curious.

 and do you want everyone to do as you wish (insist on putting something 
 up that will impact everyone for selfish reasons) _without_ any legislation?  
 and no one else can even object?  somehow i think this whole shoving 
 contest has gotten way off the track.  i'm ready to let this thread 
 die a quick and merciful death.
