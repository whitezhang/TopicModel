 a harmonic of the earth's gravitational field?  what is a harmonic of the
 earth's gravitational field?

 14:1 resonance with what?  it's not like there's any wavelength or frequency
 to the earth's gravitational field.  now, there' might be some interesting
 interactions with the moon's tidal effect--is that what you're talking about?

 what are the physics of the situation?  the only way i can see gravitational
 effects being useful in adding energy to an object orbiting earth is some
 sort of interaction with the moon.
