 i sometimes wonder if your newsfeed gives you different articles than
 everyone else, pat.  just a *few* corrections:
 
 1) i never 'defended' 20khz power, other than as something reasonable
 to go look at.
 
 2) i have also never opposed a *research project* into feasibility of
 the spalling reactor approach to 'cleaning' nuclear waste -- i simply
 doubt it could be made to work in the real world (tm), which ought to
 become clear fairly quickly during a research program into feasibility
 (sort of like what happened to 20 khz power -- it proved to have a
 down-side that was too expensive to overcome).
 
 i figure 2 things wrong in a single sentence is a high enough fault
 density for even you, pat.
