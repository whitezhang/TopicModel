 i know that alot of how people think and act in a long distance space project
 would be much like old tiem explorers, sailors, hunters and such who spent alot
 of time alone, isolated, and alone or in minimal surroundings and sopcial
 contacts.. such as the old arctic and antarctic expeditions and such..
 
 i vote for a later on sci.space.medicine or similar newsgroup fro the
 discussion of long term missions into space and there affects on humans and
 such..
