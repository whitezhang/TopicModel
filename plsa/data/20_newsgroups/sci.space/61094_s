 in my first posting on this subject i threw out an idea of how to fund
 such a contest without delving to deep into the budget.  i mentioned
 granting mineral rights to the winner (my actual wording was, "mining
 rights.)  somebody pointed out, quite correctly, that such rights are
 not anybody's to grant (although i imagine it would be a fait accompli
 situation for the winner.)  so how about this?  give the winning group
 (i can't see one company or corp doing it) a 10, 20, or 50 year
 moratorium on taxes.
