 a young french skeptic, who reads (skeptically) the ufo review ovni
 presence (o.p.), sent me the following excerpt from an august 92
 issue of this review (r.g. = robert galley, french minister of
 defense in 1974, answering about the belgian ufo wave):
 
 "o.p. : can you conceive that the u.s. could allow themselves to send
  their most modern crafts over foreign territory, with the belgian
  hierarchy ignoring that ?"
 "r.g. : absolutely ! the best proof which i can give is that, some time
  ago, without informing the french authorities, the u.s. based in
  germany sent a plane to make photos of pierrelatte (*). we followed
  this plane, and, after its landing on the ramstein airport, colonel x
  got back the shots of pierrelatte. the u.s. had not informed us..."
 (*) there is an important military plant of enrichment of uranium at
 pierrelatte (drome).
 
 what kind of plane could it be ? surely not an sr-71, which our planes
 could not follow (and still can't)...
