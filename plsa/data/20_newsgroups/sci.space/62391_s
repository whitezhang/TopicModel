 well, there are several bursts in species diversity i can think of.
 the cambrian and ordovician explosions resulted in a vast increase
 in animal diversity. likewise, after the one-two punch of the
 permian and triassic extinctions, the number of marine animals
 rose steadily (**) to an all-time high (*) just prior to the spread 
 of humans.
 
 (**) biggest exception being the k/t (bye bye dinos) extinction
 
 (*) about 800 families
 
 also, plants arose from green algae and colonized the land in
 succesive sweeps. mosses colonized very wet environments first,
 ferns (who had evolved vascular tissues) took over more territory
 when they evolved (1). these were eventually (mostly) replaced by gymnosperms
 (pines and the like) (2) and then (mostly) displaced by angiosperms (flowering
 plants -- now the dominant plant group on the planet(3). fungi
 also radiated greatly with the invasion of the land. 
 
 (1) around the carboniferous (up to about 200 families)
 (2) around the triassic (up to maybe 250 families)
 (3) starting in the cretaceous (rising to about 600 families currently)
 
 it's unclear (to me at least) what the max equilibrium number
 of species the earth can hold (***) and if it has ever hit this
 in the past. it could be (warning: speculation alert) that
 diversity has never reached a peak because mass extinctions
 happen often enough to keep the total number down.
 
 (***) this would depend a great deal on how fragmented
 specific ecosystems were. 
 
 see cowen's book "history of life" for a not-too-technical
 run-down on, well, like the title sez, the history of life.
 or see, wilson's "diversity of life" for a view centered more
 on current ecology -- this is (imho) the best popular biology
 book of (what the hell, i'll say it) all time.
