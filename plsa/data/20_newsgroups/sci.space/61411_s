 i don't think a reboost exercise is analogous to a shuttle landing/launch
 in terms of stresses/misalignments/etc.  i would think of the reboost as
 a gentile push, where a landing, then launch as two jolts which would
 put more mechanical stress on the instruments.  additionally, there might
 be a concern about landing loads to the shuttle in the event of a laden
 landing.  finally, probably some thought went into possible contamination 
 problems if the instruments came back to earth.
 
 of course, the cost of two shuttle launches _is_ a good reason to avoid
 something that might be done in one shuttle launch.  here's hoping
 cepi's gang gets the job done right the first time.
