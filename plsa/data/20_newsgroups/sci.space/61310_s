 come on, this is sci.space.  an orbital billboard won't
 do any permanent damage; in a few years it will reenter
 and probably hit los angles anyway :-)
 
 the boost to space commerce orbital advertising might
 provide might speed the day it is possible for those with a 
 yen for dark skies to get some really dark skies beyond
 the dust producing the zodiacal light. 
 
 now, if they wanted to paint the cocacola symbol on the
 moon in lampblack, that would give me pause.  it would
 be very difficult to reverse such a widespread application
 of pigments.
