 the european space agency has involvement with remote earth 
 observation, and i presume this includes surveillance (optical etc.).
 so it's not just the us/ussr(ex) who are in the game.
 
 but what *is* the game? what can be done with space observation?
 the military functions of missile spotting, troop spotting etc. are well
 documented, but what about anything else?
 
 the biggest eg i can think of is to get a  metal sensing sat over a
 paying country and scan their territory for  precious metals.
 
 more importantly, if radar can spot water vapour (clouds), presumably
 a radar based sat will be capable of spotting rivers,open water and 
 *underground water* from space. this would be a positive life saver
 for african or other drought affected countries. implementing a
 clean water and irrigation program would be of imense benifit to such
 countries and should cut down mortalities considerably.
 
 so how about it? is there a charity or government agency that would
 pay for a third world country to have their minerals and water deposits
 mapped?
 
 or is this still sci-fi?
 
 mail replies would be great.
 
 thought for the day: thermal energy needs water to make steam so sstick
 it in the ocean!
