 re: space billboards
 
 even easier to implement than writing messages on the moon, once upon
 a time a group of space activists i belonged to in seattle considered
 a "goodyear blimp in orbit".  the idea was to use a large structure
 that could carry an array of lights like the goodyear blimp has.
 placed in a low earth orbit of high inclination, it could eventually
 be seen by almost everyone on earth.  only our collective disapproval
 of cluttering up space with such a thing stopped us from pursuing
 it.  it had quite feasible economics, which i will not post here
 because i don't want to encourage the idea (if you want to do such
 a thing, go figure it out for yourself).
