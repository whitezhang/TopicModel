 having read in the past about the fail-safe mechanisms on spacecraft, i had
 assumed that the command loss timer had that sort of function.  however i
 always find disturbing the oxymoron of a "no-op" command that does something.
 if the command changes the behavior or status of the spacecraft it is not
 a "no-op" command.
 
 of course this terminology comes from a jet propulsion laboratory which has
 nothing to do with jet propulsion.
