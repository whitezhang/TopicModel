 i think you're both right.  teflon was actually discovered by accident
 before wwii.  from what i've heard, they had some chemical (i assume it
 was tetrafluoroethylene) in a tank and but the valve got gummed up.
 cutting it open revealed that it had polymerized.
 
 the material was useful for seals, but it had a major problem for, say
 the linings of vessels: it wouldn't stick to metal.  what the space
 program did was to find a way to get it to stick.  thus we had no-stick
 frypans on the market in the late '60s.
