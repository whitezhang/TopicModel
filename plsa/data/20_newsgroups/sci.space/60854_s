 	i was hoping someone could help me out.  i'm writing a program
 	for my astronautics class for assent of the shuttle into a low
 	orbit.  there are two things i'd like to know, first, how much 
 	time elapses between launch and the pitch over. second, what is
 	the cross-sectional area of the shuttle, srb's, and ext. tank.
 
 	thanks for any information, post or e-mail.
