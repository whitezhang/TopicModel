 much of cook's later exploration was privately funded, by joseph banks
 among others (eg in resolution & the earlier endeavour).  colnett's voyage
 to the galapagos was substantially privately funded by the owners of
 british whaling vessels.  chancellor and willoughby were privately funded
 by london merchant companies in their voyages to muscovy.  the list is
 almost endless.  those doing the funding were about eighty percent
 motivated by potential profit, ten percent by potential glory and ten
 percent by the desire to advance the sum of human knowledge.
