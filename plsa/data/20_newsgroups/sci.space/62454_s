 for some reasons we humans think that it is our place to control
 everything.  i doubt that space advertising is any worse than any other
 kind advertising, but it will be a lot harder to escape, and is probably
 the most blatant example yet of our disregard for the fact that we are 
 not in fact creaters of the universe.  annoying little species, aren't we?
