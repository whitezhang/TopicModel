 considering the magnitude of loss of life in both the moro castle
 and titanic disasters,  i can't believe you can be so blithe

 checks on all watercraft.  they use this as an excuse to
 make narcotics  searches, without warrants.
 
 i suspect, that  commercial craft need a certificate at least similiar
 in scope to an air worthiness certificate from the dot.
