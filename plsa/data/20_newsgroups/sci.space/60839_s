 in reference to the limits of acceleration with guns launching solid
 rockets as payloads.  thiokol provided me with samples and data on
 a reinforcement to solid motor grains for high accelerations.  solid
 motor propellants usually have a substantial percentage of 
 aluminum in the mix.  for example, the space shuttle srbs are 16 percent
 aluminum.  the technique is to use a 'foamed aluminum' structure.
 the structure looks like the inverse of a set of bubbles (an i suspect
 some bubbling process is used to form it).  in other words, if you made
 a bunch of bubbles in molten aluminum, then froze it, this is what
 you get.  it forms a strong network of effectively aluminum wires in
 all directions.  the remaining solid fuel mix is infiltrated into
 the voids, and you get aluminum-reinforced solid propellant.  the
 foamed-aluminum makes up about 6 percent of the total propellant,
 so there is still aluminum particles in the bulk grain.  the major
 improvement is the higher resistance to grain cracking, which is the
 principal failure mode for solid propellant.
