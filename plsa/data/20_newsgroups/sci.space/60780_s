 there has been something bothering me while watching
 nasa select for a while.  well, i should'nt say
 bothering, maybe wondering would be better.  when
 they are going to launch they say (sorry but i forget
 exactly who is saying what, otc to plt i think)
 "clear caution & warning memory.  verify no unexpected
 errors. ...".  i am wondering what an "expected error" might
 be.  sorry if this is a really dumb question, but
 inquiring minds just gotta know............
 
 yeah, yeah, i know, its those dumb cosmospheres again!
