 the dc-x will not take of horizontally.  it takes of vertically. 
 
 >why do the martian landing thing.. 
 
 for several reasons.  vertical landings don't require miles of runway and limit
 noise pollution.  they don't require wheels or wings.  just turn on the engines
 and touch down.  of course, as henry pointed out, vetical landings aren't quite
 that simple.

 well, to be blunt, yes.  but at least you're learning.
 
 >why not just fall to earth like the russian crafts?? parachute in then...
 
 the soyuz vehicles use parachutes for the descent and then fire small rockets
 just before they hit the ground.  parachutes are, however, not especially
 practical if you want to reuse something without much effort.  the landings
 are also not very comfortable.  however, in the words of georgy grechko,
 "i prefer to have bruises, not to sink."
