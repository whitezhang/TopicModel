 picture our universe floating like a log
 in a river.  as the log floats down the
 river, it occasionally strikes rocks, the
 bank, the bottom, other logs.  when this collission
 occurs, kinetic energy is translated into heat, the
 log degrades, gets scraped up, and other energy 
 translaions occur.  the distribution of damage to
 the log depends on the shape of the log.
 
 however, to a very small virus in a mite on the head of a
 termite in the center of the log, the shock waves from the
 collissions would appear uniformly random in direction.
 
 this is my theory for grb.  they are evidence of our universe
 interacting with other universes!  why not!  makes
 just as much sense as the grb coming from the oort cloud!
 
 the log theory of universes can't be ruled out!
 
 of course, i'm a layman in the physics world.  you 
 physicists out there, tell me about this !!!!
