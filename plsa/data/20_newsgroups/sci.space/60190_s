 they have a few problems. the biggest technical problem is the need to find
 two satellites going to the same rough orbit for a luanch.
 
 they also don't show much interest in commercial launches. there is more
 money to be made churning out titan iv's for the government. after all,
 it isn't every day you find a sucker, er, customer who thinks paying
 three times the commercial rate for launch services is a good idea!
