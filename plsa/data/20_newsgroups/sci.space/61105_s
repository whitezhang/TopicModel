 nope, you're confusing separate programs.  atlas was the first-generation
 us icbm; titan i was the second-generation one; titan ii, which all the
 titan launchers are based on, was the third-generation heavy icbm.  there
 was essentially nothing in common between these three programs.
 
 (yes, *three* programs.  despite the similarity of names, titan i and
 titan ii were completely different missiles.  they didn't even use the
 same fuels, never mind the same launch facilities.)

 sorry, the titan silos (a) can't handle the titan launchers with their
 large srbs, (b) can't handle *any* sort of launcher without massive
 violations of normal range-safety rules (nobody cares about such things
 in the event of a nuclear war, but in peacetime they matter), and (c) were
 scrapped years ago.
