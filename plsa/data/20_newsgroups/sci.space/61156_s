                        mars observer status report

                               10:00 am pdt
 
 flight sequence c8 is active, the spacecraft subsystems and instrument
 payload performing well in array normal spin and outer cruise
 configuration, with uplink and downlink via the high gain antenna; uplink
 at 125 bps, downlink at the 2 k engineering data rate.
 
 as a result of the spacecraft entering contingency mode on april 9, all
 payload instruments were automatically powered off by on-board fault
 protection software.  gamma ray spectrometer random access memory
 was successfully reloaded on monday, april 19.  to prepare for
 magnetometer calibrations which were rescheduled for execution in flight
 sequence c9 on tuesday and wednesday of next week, a reload of payload
 data system random access memory will take place this morning
 beginning at 10:30 am.
 
 over this weekend, the flight team will send real-time commands to
 perform differential one-way ranging to obtain additional data for
 analysis by the navigation team.  radio science ultra stable oscillator
 testing will take place on monday .
 
 the flight sequence c9 uplink will occur on sunday, april 25, with
 activation at midnight, monday evening april 26.  c9 has been modified to
 include magnetometer calibrations which could not be performed in c8 due
 to contingency mode entry on april 9.  these magnetometer instrument
 calibrations will allow the instrument team to better characterize the
 spacecraft-generated magnetic field and its effect on their instrument.
 this information is critical to martian magnetic field measurements
 which occur during approach and mapping phases. mag cals will require
 the sequence to command the spacecraft out of array normal spin state
 and perform slew and roll maneuvers to provide the mag team data points
 in varying spacecraft attitudes and orientations.
 
 today, the spacecraft is 22,971,250 km (14,273,673 mi.) from mars
 travelling at a velocity of 2.09 kilometers/second (4,677 mph) with
 respect to mars.  one-way light time is approximately 10 minutes, 38
 seconds.
