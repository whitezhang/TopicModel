 someone named hansk asked about pictures.
 
 well, there is an archive of portraits in xfaces format at
 ftp.uu.net. henry spencer's picture is there somewhere, along
 with several thousand others.
 
 i don't remember the path, though it should be easy to find.
 remember, though, it seems to use both internet and uucp
 addresses.
