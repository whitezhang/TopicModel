    dandridge cole and isaac asimov collaborated on a book titled,
 "habitable planets for man" (i think) in 1964.  it should be available
 in most good libraries, or through inter-library loan.
 
    it answered the questions you ask (speculatively, of course), along
 with many more that need to be considered in habitability studies:
 length of day (for day/night temperature variation, and agricultural
 concerns), partial pressures of certain unexpected gasses (ever hear of
 xenon narcosis?  neither did i), density of particulates in the atm, and
 their composition (ever hear of silicosis?  not much fun), etc.
 
    climate isn't a global phenomenon and probably needn't concern you,
 but axial tilt ought to.  it plays a large part in determining the
 severity of seasonal differences, and a lesser but still significant
 part in determining the speed of prevailing winds.
