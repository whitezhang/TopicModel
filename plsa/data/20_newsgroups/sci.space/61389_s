 but i believe that there is a fundamental difference here.  the other x
 three instruments are focusing instruments, that, more or less, form
 an image, so positional errors are limited by craft attitude and the 
 resolving power of the optics.  batse is an altogether different
 beast, effectively just 8 coincidence counters, one on each corner of 
 the craft.  positional information is triangulated from the 
 differential signal arrival times at each of the detectors.
 positional error would be predominantly determined by timing errors
 and errors in craft attitude. since none of the 8 baste detectors have
 any independant angular resolution whatsoever, they can not be used to
 determine parallax.  indeed, parallax would just add a very small 
 component to the positional error.  
 
 demonstrating that these puppies are beyond the oort cloud would 
 require resolution on the order of arcseconds, since the oort 
 cloud is postulated to extend to about 0.5 parsec (all together 
 now: "parallax arc second", a parsec is the distance of an object 
 that demonstrates one arc second of parallax with a 2 au base line).
 if the 3 degree accuracy reported above is true, we're going to 
 have to add a baste to the pluto fast flyby to get enough baseline.
 
 the beauty of baste is that it both gives positional information and
 watches the entire sky simultaneously, a realy handy combination
 when you have no idea where the next burst is coming from.
