 about three weeks ago on the space list, someone was quoting a source on the
 relative traffic and rankings of this listserv.  a figure of 88th in
 traffic(?) was given.  unfortunately i did not clip the message and i would
 like to know the source of the rankings list.  if anybody still has that
 discussion on their disk or knows the source (or is the poster himself!)
 i'd appreciate getting that reference.  being on the road i have temporarily
 unsubscribed to the list to cut down mail box stuffing <g> so please reply
 via e-mail to lek@aip.org or 71160.2356@compuserve.com or i won't get your
 answer!
