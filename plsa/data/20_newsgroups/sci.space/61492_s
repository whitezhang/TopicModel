 they can be detached in an emergency.  but expensive hardware is not thrown
 away casually (bearing in mind that nobody knew the design was defective).
 if the deployment crew had found some nasty flaw -- the lid failing to open,
 for example -- it would have been a bit embarrassing to have to throw the
 solar arrays away to get the thing back in the payload bay.
