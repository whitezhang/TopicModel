 
 hi all,
 
 i really thought that by now i would have seen something
 about this, but i haven't, so here goes:  last night on
 the evening news, the anchorperson said something to the
 effect that one of the ssrbs that was recovered after the
 recent space shuttle launch was found to have a wrench of
 some sort rattling around apparently inside the case.  there
 was no elaboration as to where specfically the item was
 found, of what type of wrench it was, but the anchorperson
 did say something about a nasa official commenting that
 there would be an inquiry into how the thing got in the ssrb.
 
 has anybody else on the net whose info sources may be 
 better than mine heard anything about this?  it seems rather
 weird.
