 in my last post i referred to michael adams as "nick."  completely my
 error; nick adams was a film and tv actor from the '50's and early '60's
 (remember johnny yuma, the rebel?).  he was from my part of the country,
 and michael's email address of "nmsca[...]" probably helped confuse things
 in my mind.  purely user headspace error on my part.  sorry.
