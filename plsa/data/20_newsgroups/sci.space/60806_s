 : double wow.  can you land a shuttle with a 5cm hole in the wall?
 
 personnally, i don't know, but i'd like to try it sometime.
 
 programmatically, yes, we can land an orbiter with a 5 cm hole in
 the wall -- provided that the thing which caused 5 cm hole didn't
 cause a crit 1 failure on some of the internal systems.  there are
 a few places where a 5 cm hole would cause a bad day -- especially
 if the 5 cm hole went all the way through the orbiter and out the
 other side, as could easily happen with a meteor strike.  but a
 hole in the pressure vessel would cause us to immediately de-orbit
 to the next available landing site.
