 
 	sorry, i've lost track of who asked the question originally 
 	(our news server at gsfc keeps things around for tremendously
 	short periods of time), but wanted to be certain before i
 	replied. someone asked about displaying the compressed images
 	from the voyager imaging cd-roms on a mac. as peter ford (mit)
 	pointed out, a decompression program is available via ftp.
 	(sorry, i don't remember the name of the node offhand, 
 	although it's .mit.edu.) in any case, though, one of the mac
 	display programs (cd rom browser by dana swift) does display
 	the compressed images directly. the program is shareware and
 	is distributed by nssdc for nominal reproduction costs ($9 +
 	shipping, if memory serves). this does *not* cover the
 	shareware price which should go to dana for his diligent work
 	and upgrades, however.
 
 	to request current pricing information, information about
 	available display software, catalogs, or data from nssdc,
 	contact our user support office at:
