 
 reading from a amoco performance products data sheet, their
 erl-1906 resin with t40 carbon fiber reinforcement has a compressive
 strength of 280,000 psi.  it has a density of 0.058 lb/cu in,
 therefore the theoretical height for a constant section column
 that can just support itself is 4.8 million inches, or 400,000 ft,
 or 75 statute miles.
 
 now, a real structure will have horizontal bracing (either a truss
 type, or guy wires, or both) and will be used below the crush strength.
 let us assume that we will operate at 40% of the theoretical 
 strength.  this gives a working height of 30 miles for a constant
 section column.  
 
 a constant section column is not the limit on how high you can
 build something if you allow a tapering of the cross section
 as you go up.  for example, let us say you have a 280,000 pound
 load to support at the top of the tower (for simplicity in
 calculation).  this requires 2.5 square inches of column cross
 sectional area to support the weight.  the mile of structure
 below the payload will itself weigh 9,200 lb, so at 1 mile 
 below the payload, the total load is now 289,200 lb, a 3.3% increase.
 
 the next mile of structure must be 3.3% thicker in cross section
 to support the top mile of tower plus the payload.  each mile
 of structure must increase in area by the same ratio all the way
 to the bottom.  we can see from this that there is no theoretical
 limit on area, although there will be practical limits based
 on how much composites we can afford to by at $40/lb, and how
 much load you need to support on the ground (for which you need
 a foundation that the bedrock can support.
 
 let us arbitrarily choose $1 billion as the limit in costruction
 cost.  with this we can afford perhaps 10,000,000 lb of composites,
 assuming our finished structure costs $100/lb.  the $40/lb figure
 is just for materials cost.  then we have a tower/payload mass
 ratio of 35.7:1.  at a 3.3% mass ratio per mile, the tower
 height becomes 111 miles.  this is clearly above the significant
 atmosphere.  a rocket launched from the top of the tower will still
 have to provide orbital velocity, but atmospheric drag and g-losses
 will be almost eliminated.  g-losses are the component of
 rocket thrust in the vertical direction to counter gravity,
 but which do not contribute to horizontal orbital velocity.  thus
 they represent wasted thrust.  together with drag, rockets starting
 from the ground have a 15% velocity penalty to contend with.
 
 this analysis is simplified, in that it does not consider wind
 loads.  these will require more structural support over the first
 15 miles of height.  above that, the air pressure drops to a low
 enough value for it not to be a big factor.
