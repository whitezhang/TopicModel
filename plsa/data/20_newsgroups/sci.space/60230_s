 all reaction-controlled aircraft are fly-by-wire, at least the rcs part
 is.  on the x-15 the aerodynamic control surfaces (elevator, rudder, etc)
 were conventionally controlled (pushrods and cables) but the rcs jets
 were fly-by-wire.

 navy aircraft have folding or sweeping wings, in order to save space
 on the hangar deck.  the f-14 wings sweep, all the rest fold the
 wingtips up at a joint.
 
 air force planes don't have folding wings, since the air force has
 lots of room.
