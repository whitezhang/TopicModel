 how can you tell the difference between an intensity distribution which
 is due to an "edge" in the spatial distribution and an intensity
 distribution which is due an a sharp dropoff of intrinsic luminosities
 below a certain threshold?  could you describe (roughly) what the
 intensity distribution is like?
