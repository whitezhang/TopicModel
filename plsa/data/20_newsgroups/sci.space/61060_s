 every new computer technology was actually lower and slower then what it
 replaced.  silicon was less  effective then the germanium  products
 then available.   gaas  was less capable then silicon.  multi-processors
 were slower then  existent single processors.
 
 what the argument was, though was that these new technologies promised either
 theoretically future higher performance  or lower cost or higher densities.
 
 i think that the dc-1  may g=fit into this same model.
 
 elv's can certainly launch more weight  then  a ssrt,  but 
 an ssrt offers the prospect of  greater cycle times and  lower costs.
 
 this is kind of a speculative posting,  but i thought i'd throw it out as
 a hjistorical framework  for those interested in the project.
