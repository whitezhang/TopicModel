 lindbergh's flight took place in '27, not the thirties.

 could you give examples of privately funded ones?

 your logic certainly applies to standard investment strategies.  however, the
 concept of a prize for a difficult goal is done for different reasons, i 
 suspect.  i'm not aware that mr orteig received any significant economic 
 benefit from lindbergh's flight.  modern analogies, such as the prize for a
 human powered helicopter face similar arguments.  there is little economic
 benefit in such a thing.  the advantage comes in the new approaches developed
 and the fact that a prize will frequently generate far more work than the 
 equivalent amount of direct investment would.  a person who puts up $ x billion
 for a moon base is much more likely to do it because they want to see it done
 than because they expect to make money off the deal.
