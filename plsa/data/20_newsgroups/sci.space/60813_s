 their hiten engineering-test mission spent a while in a highly eccentric
 earth orbit doing lunar flybys, and then was inserted into lunar orbit
 using some very tricky gravity-assist-like maneuvering.  this meant that
 it would crash on the moon eventually, since there is no such thing as
 a stable lunar orbit (as far as anyone knows), and i believe i recall
 hearing recently that it was about to happen.
