 this is a good question.  there are major blind spots in our understanding
 of what makes the earth habitable.  for example, why does the earth's
 atmosphere have the concentration of oxygen it does?  the naive
 answer is "photosynthesis", but this is clearly incomplete.  photosynthesis
 by itself can't make the atmosphere oxygenated, as the oxygen produced
 is consumed when the plants decay or are eaten.  what is needed
 is photosynthesis plus some mechanism to sequester some fraction of
 the resulting reduced material.
 
 on earth, this mechanism is burial in seafloor sediments of organic
 matter, mostly from oceanic sources.  however, this burial requires
 continental sediments (in the deep ocean, the burial rate is so slow
 that most material is consumed before it can be sequestered).
 
 this suggests that a planet without large oceans, or a planet without
 continents undergoing weathering, will have a hard time accumulating
 an oxygen atmosphere.  in particular, an all-ocean planet may have a
 hard time supporting an oxygen atmosphere.
 
 there is also the problem of why the oxygen in the earth's atmosphere
 has been relatively stable over geological time, for a period at least
 2 orders of magnitude longer than the decay time of atmospheric o2 to
 weathering in the absence of replenishment.  no convincing feedback
 mechanism has been identified.  perhaps the reason is the weak
 anthropic principle: if during the last 500 myr or so, the oxygen
 level had dropped too low, we wouldn't be here to be wondering about
 it.
