 if this facility is in kaliningrad, this is not near moscow,
 it is in fact the ex-east prussian konigsberg, now a russian
 enclave on the baltic coast.  it is served by ships and rail, 
 and the intrepid traveller in europe would find it accessible 
 and might even want to try to arrange a tour (??).
