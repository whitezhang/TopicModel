 i wonder why the term "bio-engineered" was added to the comment? as i
 review the problems of space biosphere2 in arizona, and work on
 modelling a new composting/vermiculture system to propose for the next
 generation of closed system environments, i believe that biological
 carbon sinks are essential to help regulate co2. in my models, humus is
 an optimum carbon repository that can help buffer increases in
 atmpospheric co2. why consider "bio-engineering" some mythical plant
 when the existing organisms are well suited to the task if managed
 properly?
