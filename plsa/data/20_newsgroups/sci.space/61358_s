 i have often thought about, if its possible to have a powerfull laser
 on earth, to light at the moon, and show lasergraphics at the surface
 so clearly that you can see it with your eyes when there is a new
 moon.
 
 how about a coca cola logo at the moon, easy way to target billions of
 people.
 
 do you know if its possible?
