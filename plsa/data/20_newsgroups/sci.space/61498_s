 i am sure your numbers are far better then mine.  as i said above,
 i don't have exact numbers.

 how different would the contamination threat of a small manuevering tug
 be from that of the shuttle and it's oms engines??????
 
 i know that no small manuevering tug exists,  but maybe  one could
 soup up a bus 1.   does anyone out there have the de-clasified
 specs on hte bus 1?  would it be able to provide enough  control
 force to balance the hst,  and  still have the rocket thrust
 to hurl her into a decent high orbit?

 sorry,  that should be intrument pointing.

 plus, if the second box gets fritzy, you could be in shitter ville
 real fast.

 the problem is no-one seems to have the exact numbers.  when the mission
 was planned originally at 3 spacewalks,  and 3 astronauts,  there was
 enormous concern over the mass margins for the flight.  they
 have now planned for 5 eva's,  an 11 day mission and have 2 reserve
 eva's and an emergency eva.  obviously that is coming from somewhere.
 my guess is the oms burn  fuel,  or  re-boost  margin.   
 
 i just figured, if goldin wants to really,  prove out faster, cheaper
 better,   have some of the whiz kids  slap together an expendable
 space manuevering tug  out of a bus1,  and use that for the re-boost.
 it has to be better then using the discovery as a tow truck.
