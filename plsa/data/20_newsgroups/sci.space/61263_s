 no, no, no!  the previous one was called "smiley".  1992 qb1 = smiley,
 and 1993 fw = karla.
 
 note that neither name is official.  it seems the discoverers have an
 aversion to the designation scheme.
 
 by the way, 1992 qb1 can never be known as "smiley" officially, because
 that moniker has already been assigned to asteroid number 1613.
