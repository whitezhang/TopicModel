 mr. hathaway's post is right on the money, if a little lengthy.  in short,
 an orbiting billboard would be trash, in the same way that a billboard on
 the earth is trash.  billboards make a place look trashy.  that is why there
 are laws in many places prohibiting their use.  the light pollution
 complaints are mainly an attempt to find some tangible reason to be against
 orbiting billboards because people don't feel morally justified to complain
 on the grounds that these things would defile the beauty of the sky.
 
 regular orbiting spacecraft are not the same in this respect, since they are
 more like abstract entities, but a billboard in space would be like a beer
 can somebody had thrown on the side of the road: just trash.
