   that's _five weeks in a balloon_.  and if anyone can tell me where to
 get it, i sure would like a reply!  i've been looking for that book for
 ten year+, and never found it.  (note that i am _not_ looking for a $200
 collector's item; i'm hoping that *someone* has published it in modern
 times, either in paperback or hardcover.  i'm willing to spend $50 or
 so to get a copy.
