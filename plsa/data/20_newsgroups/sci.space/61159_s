 i missed the presentations given in the morning session (when shea gave
 his "rambling and almost inaudible" presentation), but i did attend
 the afternoon session. the meeting was in a small conference room. the
 speaker was wired with a mike, and there were microphones on the table for
 the panel members to use. peons (like me) sat in a foyer outside the
 conference room, and watched the presentations on closed circuit tv. in
 general, the sound system was fair to poor, and some of the other
 speakers (like the committee member from the italian space agency)
 also were "almost inaudible."
 
 shea didn't "lead the formal presentation," in the sense of running
 or guiding the presentation. he didn't even attend the afternoon
 session. vest ran the show (president of mit, the chair of the
 advisory panel).

 note that o'connor has been running the day-to-day
 operations of the of the redesign team since shea got sick (which
 was immediately after the panel was formed).
