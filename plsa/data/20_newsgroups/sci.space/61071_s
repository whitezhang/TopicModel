 dfw was designed with the sts in mind (which really mean very little).  much of
 their early pr material had scenes with a shuttle landing and two or three
 others pulled up to gates.  i guess they were trying to stress how advanced the
 airport was.
 
 for dallas types:  imagine the fit grapevine and irving would be having if the
 shuttle was landing at dfw. (for the rest, they are currently having some power
 struggles between the airport and surrounding cities).
