 uh, no. these burst detectors are just that, burst detectors.
 they have no angular resolution.
 
 now a network of burst detectors could have angular resolution,
 but we do not have a decent set of different networks at the distances
 neccesary from each other to determine if they're happening in the oort
 cloud or not.
 
 we have one network, and trying to make two networks out of it
 degrades what angular resolution we have.
