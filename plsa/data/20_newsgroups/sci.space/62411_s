 it's a moot point: step out of your door go _anywhere_ (except possibly
 your mailbox). you will be "subject to some ad agency's 'poor taste'"

 while i'm sure sagan considers it sacrilegious, that wouldn't be
 because of his doubtfull credibility as an astronomer. modern, 
 ground-based, visible light astronomy (what these proposed
 orbiting billboards would upset) is already a dying field: the
 opacity and distortions caused by the atmosphere itself have
 driven most of the field to use radio, far infrared or space-based
 telescopes. in any case, a bright point of light passing through
 the field doesn't ruin observations. if that were the case, the
 thousands of existing satellites would have already done so (satelliets
 might not seem so bright to the eyes, but as far as astronomy is concerned,
 they are extremely bright.)
