 i don't think that idea means what you think it does. having everyone
 on earth subject to some ad agency's "poor taste" *is* an abomination.
 (abomination : n. loathing; odious or degrading habit or act; an
 object of disgust. (oxford concise dictionary)) maybe *you* don't mind
 having every part of your life saturated with commercials, but many of
 us loathe it. i'd rather not have the beauty of the night sky always marred
 by a giant billboard, and i'll bet the idea is virtually sacrilegious
 to an astronomer like sagan.
