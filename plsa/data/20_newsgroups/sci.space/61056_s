 here is a computation i did a long time ago that computes the length
 of the daylight.  you should be able to convert the information here
 to sunrise and sunset times.

 ======================================================================
 definitions:
 
 z = the tilt of the axis of the planet away from the normal to its
 orbital plane.  in case of the earth z is about 23.5 degrees, i think.
 i do not recall the exact value.  in case of uranus, z is almost
 90 degrees.
 
 u = latitude of the location where the length of the day is measured.
 paris is at about 45 degrees.  north pole is at 90.
 
 a = angular position of the planet around the sun.  as a goes from
 0 to 360 degrees, the planet makes a full circle around the sun.
 the spring equinox occurs at a=0.
 
 l = daylight fraction = (duration of daylight)/(duration of a full day).
 on the equator (u=0) l is always 1/2.  near the north pole (u=90 degrees)
 l is sometimes one and sometimes zero, depending on the time of the year.
 
 computation:
 define the auxiliary angles p and q by:
 sin p = sin a sin z
 cos q = h ( tan u tan p ),       (0 < q < 180 degrees)
 
 conclusion:
 l = q / 180   (if q is measured in degrees)
 l = q / pi    (if q is measured in radians)
 
 wait!  but what is h?
 the cutoff function h is defined as follows:
 
 h (s) = s    if  |s| < 1
       = 1    if   s > 1
       = -1   if   s < 1
 
 as an interesting exercise, plot l versus a.   the graph will shows
 how the length of the daylight varies with the time of the year.
 experiment with various choices of latitudes and tilt angles.
 compare the behavior of the function at locations above and below
 the arctic circle.
