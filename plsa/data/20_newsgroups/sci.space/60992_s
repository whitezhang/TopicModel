 i would guess not.  dr. neil gehrels of cgro is the son of dr. tom
 gehrels of the university of arizona.  since he's long had research
 interests in asteroids and other solar-system astronomy, tom is the
 one more likely to have discovered  a comet (and thus had his name
 attached to it).
 
 tom gehrels is a leader in the spacewatch project, which has recently
 increased mankind's discovery rate on near-earth asteroids (they're
 finding a couple every month).  for much more on this interesting guy,
 read his autobiography, *on a glassy sea*.
 
 "do you know the asteroids, mr.kemp?...    bill higgins
 hundreds of thousands of them.  all        
 wandering around the sun in strange        fermilab
 orbits.  some never named, never
 charted.  the orphans of the solar         higgins@fnal.fnal.gov
 system, mr. kemp."
                                            higgins@fnal.bitnet
 "and you want to become a father."
