 well pat for once i agree with you and i like your first idea that you had.
 it probably is the gamma ray signature of the warp transitions of interstellar
 spacecraft! :)
 
 well it makes as much sense as some things. i was at the first gamma ray
 burst conference here at uah and had great fun watching the discomfiture
 of many of the gamma ray scientists. much scruitiny was given to the
 data reductions. i remember one person in particular who passionately declared
 that the data was completely wrong as there were no explanation for the
 phenomena of the smooth sky distribution. (heck it even shoots down the
 warp transition theory :(. the next conference is soon and i will endeavour
 to keep in touch with this fun subject.
