 unfortunately, if you launch this from the us (or are a us citizen),
 you will need a launch permit from the office of commercial space
 transportation, and i think it may be difficult to get a permit for
 an antisatellite weapon... :-)
 
 the threshold at which ocst licensing kicks in is roughly 100km.
