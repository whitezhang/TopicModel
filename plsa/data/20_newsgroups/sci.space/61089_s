 seems like a lot of trouble to go to. its probably better to   
 invest in newer launch systems. i don't think a big cost advantage
 for using russian systems will last for very long (maybe a few years). 
 lockheed would be the place to ask, since you would probably have to buy 
 the proton from them (they market the proton world wide except russia). 
 they should know a lot about the possibilities, i haven't heard them
 propose us launches, so i assume they looked into it and found it 
 unprofitable.

 comparable to the zenit i suppose, but since it looks like
 nothing will be built there, you might just as well pick any
 spot.
 
 the message is: to launch now while its cheap and while russia and
 kazakstan are still cooperating. later, the story may be different.
