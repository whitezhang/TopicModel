 what's new (in my opinion), friday, 16 april 1993  washington, dc
 
 1. space billboards! is this one the "spinoffs" we were promised?
 in 1950, science fiction writer robert heinlein published "the
 man who sold the moon," which involved a dispute over the sale of
 rights to the moon for use as billboard. nasa has taken the firsteps toward this
  hideous vision of the future.  observers were
 startled this spring when a nasa launch vehicle arrived at the
 pad with "schwarzenegger" painted in huge block letters on the
 side of the booster rockets.  space marketing inc. had arranged
 for the ad to promote arnold's latest movie. now, space marketing
 is working with university of colorado and livermore engineers on
 a plan to place a mile-long inflatable billboard in low-earth
 orbit.  nasa would provide contractual launch services. however,
 since nasa bases its charge on seriously flawed cost estimates
 (wn 26 mar 93) the taxpayers would bear most of the expense. this
 may look like environmental vandalism, but mike lawson, ceo of
 space marketing, told us yesterday that the real purpose of the
 project is to help the environment! the platform will carry ozone
 monitors he explained--advertising is just to help defray costs.

 what do you think of this revolting and hideous attempt to vandalize
 the night sky? it is not even april 1 anymore.
 what about light pollution in observations? (i read somewhere else that
 it might even be visible during the day, leave alone at night).
 is nasa really supporting this junk?
 are protesting groups being organized in the states?
 really, really depressed.
