                          ==========================
 
      two gif images of the ozone maps over the northern and southern
 hemispheres are now available at the jpl info public access site.  these maps
 were produced by the microwave limb sounder aboard the upper atmosphere
 research satellite (uars), and are courtesy of the public information office
 at jpl.  note that the images are in gif89a format, so make sure your display
 software supports this format (as opposed to the older gif87a format).  the
 caption files accompanying the images are appended at the end of this message,
 as well as being embedded in the images.  the images are available by dialup
 modem at +1 (818) 354-1333, up to 9600 bps, parameters n-8-1, or by using
 anonymous ftp to:
 
         ftp:      pubinfo.jpl.nasa.gov (128.149.6.2)
         user:     anonymous
         cd:       news (will be moved to the images directory in 30 days)
         files:    ozone93a.gif - northern hemisphere
                   ozone93b.gif - southern hemisphere
 
      also, photographic prints of these images can be ordered from newell color
 lab listed below.  refer to the p number associated with the images when
 ordering.

 this graphic depicts chlorine monoxide and ozone over earth's
 northern hemisphere in february 1992 and 1993.  these maps were
 produced by the microwave limb sounder aboard the upper
 atmosphere research satellite.  the chlorine monoxide (clo) maps
 (left) are for a layer about 20 kilometers (66,000 feet) above
 the earth's surface on february 17, 1992 (above) and 1993
 (below).  the ozone maps show the total amount above an altitude
 of about 12 kilometers (41,000 feet) averaged over the period
 from february 15 to march 6 for the two years.  the microwave
 limb sounder, developed and operated by a team at nasa's jet
 propulsion laboratory, is one of several instruments on the
 goddard space flight center's upper atmosphere research
 satellite, launched in september 1991.

 this graphic depicts chlorine monoxide (clo) and the antarctic
 ozone hole.  these maps, produced by the microwave limb sounder
 aboard the upper atmosphere research satellite, show the amount
 of chlorine monoxide (left) and ozone (right) in the stratosphere
 at altitudes above 20 kilometers (66,000 feet).  very small
 abundances of ozone appear where there are large abundances of
 chlorine monoxide, the dominant form of chlorine that destroys
 ozone.  data from september 21, 1991 (top) are compared with
 those from september 20, 1992 (bottom).  the microwave limb
 sounder, developed and operated by a team at nasa's jet
 propulsion laboratory, is one of several instruments on goddard
 space flight center's upper atmosphere research satellite
 launched september 12, 1991.
