 
 hi,
   
   i'm writing a science fiction script and i'm looking for some
 answers to questions regarding the moon and earth. my starting point
 is an impossible situation.  [i checked with a professor at berkeley
 and his response was a very helpful "can't happen".] if you enjoy
 playing with unusual ideas and are willing answer some questions
 please contact me via e-mail (jennise@dgi.com).
 
   i get extremely annoyed when screen and tele-plays ignore basic
 facts about computers that i'm determined to be as scientifically
 accurate as i can.
 
 
   sorry for being vague, but i'd like to protect my idea as much as i
 can until i'm ready to sell it (hopefully).
