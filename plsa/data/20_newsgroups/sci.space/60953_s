 i'll say!  imagine that there were a couple groups up there, maybe landing
 a few weeks apart.  the year-mark starts coming on for the first group.
 isn't a billion pretty good incentive to take a shot at a potential
 winner?  "yeah, that's a shame that team a's life support gave out
 so close to the deadline.  thanks for the billion."
 
 on the other hand, if apollo cost ~25billion, for a few days or weeks
 in space, in 1970 dollars, then won't the reward have to be a lot more
 than only 1 billion to get any takers?
