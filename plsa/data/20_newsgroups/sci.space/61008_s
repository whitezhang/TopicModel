 hell, yes. i'm not going to let a bunch of seven suits tell
 me what the right way to estimate cost effectiveness is, at
 least not until they can make their mind up long enough
 to leave their scheme stable for a fiscal year or two.
 
 
 seriously though. if you were to ask the british government
 whether their colonisation efforts in the americas were cost
 effective, what answer do you think you'd get? what if you asked
 in 1765, 1815, 1865, 1915 and 1945 respectively? ;-)
