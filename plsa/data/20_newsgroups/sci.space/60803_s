 well, first you work out how much cold gas you need, then make the
 tanks big enough.
 
 working out how much cold gas is another problem, depending on
 vehicle configuration, flight duration, thruster isp (which couples
 into storage pressure, which may be a factor in selecting tank
 wall thickness etc.)
