 i know people hate it when someone says somethings like "there was an article 
 about that somewhere a while ago" but i'm going to say it anyway.  i read an
 article on this subject, almost certainly in space news, and something like
 six months ago.  if anyone is really interested in the subject i can probably
 hunt it down given enough motivation.
