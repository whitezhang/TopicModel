 here is a way to get the commericial companies into space and mineral
 exploration.
 
 basically get the eci-freaks to make it so hard to get the minerals on earth..
 you think this is crazy. well in a way it is, but in a way it is reality.
 
 there is a billin the congress to do just that.. basically to make it so
 expensive to mine minerals in the us, unless you can by off the inspectors or
 tax collectors.. ascially what i understand from talking to a few miner friends 
 of mine, that they (the congress) propose to have a tax on the gross income of
 the mine, versus the adjusted income, also the state governments have there
 normal taxes. so by the time you get done, paying for materials, workers, and
 other expenses you can owe more than what you made.
 basically if you make a 1000.00 and spend 500. ofor expenses, you can owe
 600.00 in federal taxes.. bascially it is driving the miners off the land.. and
 the only peopel who benefit are the eco-freaks.. 
 
 basically to get back to my beginning statement, is space is the way to go
 cause it might just get to expensive to mine on earth because of either the
 eco-freaks or the protectionist.. 
 such fun we have in these interesting times..
