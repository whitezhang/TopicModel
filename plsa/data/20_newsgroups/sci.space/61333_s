 mike adams suggested discussions on long-term effects of spaceflight
 to the human being.  i love this topic, as some of you regulars know.
 
 so, having seen henry's encouraging statement about starting to talk
 about it; i shall.
 
 i feel that we as a community of people have unique resources
 to deliver to the world a comprehensive book which can elaborate
 on the utility of spaceflight to fields which are as divergent 
 as medical intensive care, agriculture, environmental protection, and 
 probably more.  i do not believe that the general public understands
 the impact of spaceflight on the whole of society.  in the absence
 of such knowledge, we see dwindling support of the world's space effort.
 
 i believe that we as a group have the responsibility to not only
 communicate amongst ourselves, but also with others through print media.
 
 a well-orchestrated and technically oriented analysis of life science
 variables required to support long-duration spaceflight (like long
 expenditions to the moon or mars) would be entertaining and educational
 to the general public.  the objective of such an effort would be to 
 compile resources and publications from accepted scientific and technical
 journals which would address each major life science area.  in addition,
 ideas for further research and development could be put forward for
 the general public to ponder...allowing the general public to take
 part in the excitement of exploration.
 
 individuals interested should be willing to devote an hour per week
 to running literature searches and finding journal articles.  in addition,
 we need to obtain the assistance of personnel from within the halls
 of nasa and industry.
 
 i have appreciated the positive responses to date and i am personally
 eager to start this project.  perhaps we could start with debate regarding
 how best to grade the viability of various technologies for application
 to spaceflight.
