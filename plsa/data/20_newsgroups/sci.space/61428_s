 
 
 there are a number of philosophical questions that i would like to ask:
 
 1)  if we encounter a life form during our space exploration, how do we
 determine if we should capture it, imprison it, and then discect it?
 
 2)  if we encounter a civilization that is suffering economicly, will
 we expend resources from earth to help them?
 
 3)  with all of the deseases we currently have that are deadly and undetectable,
 what will be done to ensure that more new deadly deseases aren't brought
 back, or that our deseases don't destroy life elsewhere?
