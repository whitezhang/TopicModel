 depends. if you assume the existance of a working ssto like dc, on billion
 $$ would be enough to put about a quarter million pounds of stuff on the
 moon. if some of that mass went to send equipment to make lox for the
 transfer vehicle, you could send a lot more. either way, its a lot
 more than needed.
 
 this prize isn't big enough to warrent developing a ssto, but it is
 enough to do it if the vehicle exists.
