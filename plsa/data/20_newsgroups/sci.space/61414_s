 sorry to split hairs, but i just read in "the making of the atomic
 bomb"(*) that teflon was developed during world war 2.  a sealant was
 needed for the tubing in which uranium hexafluoride passed as it was
 gradually enriched by difussion.  uf6 is very corrosive, and some very
 inert yet flexible material was needed for the seals.
