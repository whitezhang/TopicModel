 sure.  contact the world space foundation.  they're listed in the sci.space
 frequently asked questions file, which i'll excerpt.
 
     world space foundation - has been designing and building a solar-sail
     spacecraft for longer than any similar group; many jpl employees lend
     their talents to this project. wsf also provides partial funding for the
     palomar sky survey, an extremely successful search for near-earth
     asteroids. publishes *foundation news* and *foundation astronautics
     notebook*, each a quarterly 4-8 page newsletter. contributing associate,
     minimum of $15/year (but more money always welcome to support projects).

 wsf put together a little paperback anthology of fiction and
 nonfiction about solar sails: *project solar sail*.  i think robert
 staehle, david brin,  or arthur clarke may be listed as editor.
 
 also there is a nontechnical book on solar sailing by louis friedman,
 a technical one by a guy whose name escapes me (help me out, josh),
 and i would expect that greg matloff and eugene mallove have something
 to say about the subject in *the starflight handbook*, as well as
 quite a few references.
 
 
 check the following articles in *journal of the british interplanetary
 society*:
 
 v36 p. 201-209 (1983)
 v36 p. 483-489 (1983)
 v37 p. 135-141 (1984)
 v37 p. 491-494 (1984)
 v38 p. 113-119 (1984)
 v38 p. 133-136 (1984)
 
 (can you guess that matloff visited fermilab and gave me a bunch of
 reprints? i just found the file.)
 
 and k. eric drexler's paper "high performance solar sails and related
 reflecting devices," aiaa paper 79-1418, probably in a book called
 *space manufacturing*, maybe the proceedings of the second (?)
 conference on space manufacturing.  the 1979 one, at any rate.

 pictures, radio, television, bouncing radar       fermilab
 vibrations off the moon, rocket ships, and        higgins@fnal.bitnet

 has yet been able to figure out a music           span:  43011::higgins
