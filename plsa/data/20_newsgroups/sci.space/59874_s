     careers in the space industry
 
     in 1990 the princeton planetary society published the first edition of
     "space jobs: the guide to careers in space-related fields." the
     publication was enormously successful: we distributed 2000 copies to
     space enthusiasts across the country and even sent a few to people in
     great britain, australia, and ecuador. due to the tremendous response to
     the first edition, pps has published an expanded, up-to-date second
     edition of the guide.
 
     the 40-page publication boasts 69 listings for summer and full-time job
     opportunities as well as graduate school programs. the second edition of
     "space jobs" features strategies for entering the space field and
     describes positions at consulting and engineering firms, nasa, and
     non-profit organizations. the expanded special section on graduate
     schools highlights a myriad of programs ranging from space manufacturing
     to space policy. additional sections include tips on becoming an
     astronaut and listings of nasa space grant fellowships and consortia, as
     well as nasa centers for the commercial development of space.

     sdi's ssrt (single stage rocket technology) project has funded a
     suborbital technology demonstrator called dc-x that should fly in
     mid-1993. further development towards an operational single-stage to
     orbit vehicle (called delta clipper) is uncertain at present.

     how to name a star after a person
 
     official names are decided by committees of the international
     astronomical union, and are not for sale. there are purely commercial
     organizations which will, for a fee, send you pretty certificates and
     star maps describing where to find "your" star. these organizations have
     absolutely no standing in the astronomical community and the names they
     assign are not used by anyone else. it's also likely that you won't be
     able to see "your" star without binoculars or a telescope. see the back
     pages of astronomy or other amateur astronomy publications for contact
     info; one such organization may be found at:

 	"fusion as electric propulsion", robert w. bussard, journal of

 	    fusion rocket engines are analyzed as electric propulsion
 	    systems, with propulsion thrust-power-input-power ratio (the
 	    thrust-power "gain" g(t)) much greater than unity. gain values
 	    of conventional (solar, fission) electric propulsion systems are
 	    always quite small (e.g., g(t)<0.8). with these, "high-thrust"
 	    interplanetary flight is not possible, because system
 	    acceleration (a(t)) capabilities are always less than the local
 	    gravitational acceleration. in contrast, gain values 50-100
 	    times higher are found for some fusion concepts, which offer
 	    "high-thrust" flight capability. one performance example shows a
 	    53.3 day (34.4 powered; 18.9 coast), one-way transit time with
 	    19% payload for a single-stage earth/mars vehicle. another shows
 	    the potential for high acceleration (a(t)=0.55g(o)) flight in
 	    earth/moon space.

 	"plasmaktm star power for energy intensive space applications", by
 	paul m. koloc, eight ans topical meeting on technology of fusion
 	energy, special issue fusion technology, march 1989.
 
 	    aneutronic energy (fusion with little or negligible neutron
 	    flux) requires plasma pressures and stable confinement times
 	    larger than can be delivered by current approaches. if plasma
 	    pressures appropriate to burn times on the order of milliseconds
 	    could be achieved in aneutronic fuels, then high power densities
 	    and very compact, realtively clean burning engines for space and
 	    other special applications would be at hand. the plasmaktm
 	    innovation will make this possible; its unique pressure
 	    efficient structure, exceptional stability, fluid-mechanically
 	    compressible mantle and direct inductive mhd electric power
 	    conversion advantages are described. peak burn densities of tens
 	    of megawats per cc give it compactness even in the
 	    multi-gigawatt electric output size. engineering advantages
 	    indicate a rapid development schedule at very modest cost. [i
 	    strongly recommend that people take this guy seriously. bob
 	    hirsch, the primary proponent of the tokamak, has recently
 	    declared koloc's plasmaktm precursor, the spheromak, to be one
 	    of 3 promising fusion technologies that should be pursued rather
 	    than tokamak. aside from the preceeding appeal to authority, the
 	    plasmaktm looks like it finally models ball-lightning with solid
 	    mhd physics. -- jim bowery]
