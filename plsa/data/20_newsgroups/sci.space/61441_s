 idea for repair of satellites:
 
 warning i am getting creative again:
 
 why not build a inflatable space dock.
 
 basically deploy one side of the space dock (using a scissor shaped structure,
 saw it on beyond 2000), then maneuer the side to next to the satellite and then
 move the rest of the dock around the satellite and seal it..
 the inflate the dock with a gas (is does not have to be oxygen, just neeeds to
 be non-flameble, non-damaging to the satellite and abel to maintain heat),
 thenheat the space dock (for the astronaut who will be working onthe satellite
 to be able to not have to wear the normal bulky space suit, but a much striped
 down own).. 
 
 i know this might take a slot of work or not??? or just to plain wierd, but
 ideas need to be thought of, for where is tomorrow, but in the imagination of
 the present..
