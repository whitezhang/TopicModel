 could it be public missile, inc in michigan?
 
 from the description of ad here, it sounds like they're talking about
 "high power rocketry", an outgrowth of model rocketry.  this hobby
 uses non-metallic structural compoments and commerically manufactured
 engines ranging in impulse classification from g to p.  the hobby
 has been flourishing from early 1980s and is becoming increasing popular.
 technically this is not consider amateur rocketry.
 
 any rocket with a liftoff weight greater than 3.3 pounds or using a
 total impulse of g or greater, requires an faa waiver to launch.
 typically, a group of people get an faa waiver for specified period
 of time (ie week, weekend, etc.) at a designated site and time, and
 all of the launches are then covered under this "blanket waiver".
 there is also a "high power safety code" which designates more
 specific rules such as launch field size, etc.
 
 finally, in order to purchase any of the larger (class b) rocket 
 motors you need to certified through either the national association
 of rocketry or tripoli rocketry association. certification procedures
 require a demonstarted handling and "safe" flight at a total impulse
 level.
