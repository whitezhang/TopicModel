 but now i need to clarify the situation.  the "/incoming" directory on
 ics.uci.edu does not allow you to do an "ls" command.  the files are
 there (i just checked on 04/28/93 at 9:35 cdt), and you can "get" them
 (don't forget the "binary" mode!), but you can't "ls" in the
 "/incoming" directory.
 
 a further update: mark's design made the cover of space news this week
 as one of the design alternatives which was rejected.  but he's still
 in there plugging.  i wish him luck -- using et's as the basis of a
 space station has been a good idea for a long time.
 
 may the best design win.
