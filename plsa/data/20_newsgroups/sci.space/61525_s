 one performance reason comes to mind: if you jettison the ssme's, you
 don't have to drag them with you when you perform your circularization
 burn(s).  on-orbit, ssme's are just dead weight, since we don't have an
 ssme h2/o2 pressurization mechanism which works in zero-g.  this means
 that you can't use them for re-boost or anything else.  dead weight has
 a couple of advantages, but more disadvantages.
 
 throw-away ssme's might let us use some of the old ssme's which are not-
 quite-man-ratable.  but i doubt we'd do that; the cost of a launch
 failure is too high.
