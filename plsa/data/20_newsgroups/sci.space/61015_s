 the proton has been used in 2, 3, and 4 stage versions.  the two stage version
 was used for the first 3 launches, while the 3 and 4 stage versions are used
 today.  the four stage version is used mostly for escape (and geosynchronous?)
 orbits, while the 3 stage version is used for low earth orbits.  since this is
 the version that launched mir and the salyuts (and the add-on modules for mir),
 as long as centaur is smaller than mir (which i believe it is), it should fit
 under the shroud.
 
 i vaguely recall that the russians are developing a lh2/lox upper stage for the
 proton.
