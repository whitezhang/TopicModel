 peanut butter was definitely my favorite. i don't think i ever took a second bite
 of the strawberry.
 
 i recently joined nutri-system and their "chewy fudge bar" is very reminicent of
 the chocolate space food. this is the only thing i can find that even comes close
 the taste. it takes you back... your taste-buds are happy and your
 intestines are in knots... joy!
