 better idea for use of nasa shuttle astronauts and crew is have them be found
 lost in space after a accident with a worm hole or other space/time glitch..
 
 maybe age jemison a few years (makeup and such) and have her as the only
 survivour of a failed shuttle mission that got lost.. 
 
 heh of late, they way they have been having shuttle problems in the media,
 anything can happen.. 
 
 imagine a astronaut/crew member to find themselves in the 24th century as the
 object of interest of an alien civilization, maybe rescued or helped by the st
 enterprise...  i know vegr and such was okay, but this could be better..
