 when i was at the texas star party a few years ago, the sky was so dark
 that venus did, indeed, cause light pollution until it set.
 
 even if the billboard were dark it could cause a problem.  imagine observing an
 object and halfway through your run, your object was occulted!
 
 i would guess that most of the people stating positive opinions are not 
 fanatically serious observers.
 
 it is so typical that the rights of the minority are extinguished by the
 wants of the majority, no matter how ridiculous those wants might be.
