 when the lunar society's $500m estimate of the cost of a lunar colony was
 mentioned at making orbit, somebody asked jerry pournelle "have you talked
 to bill gates?".  the answer:  "yes.  he says that if he were going to
 sink that much money into it, he'd want to run it -- and he doesn't have
 the time."
 
 (somebody then asked him about perot.  answer:  "having ross perot on your
 board may be a bigger problem than not having the money.")
