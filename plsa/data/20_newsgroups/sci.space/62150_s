 if i may offer a constructive criticism, perhaps you should decide if you
 love vehicles or the use they are put to. i, myself, think the f-86 is
 a beautiful aircraft, but rest assured, i wouldn't even think of flying
 it in combat today. most of us want access to space and judge vehicles
 on how they perform.

 not to this degree.

 why?
 
 >dc-x will also have similar "zero-defects" issues (am i wrong?).  
 
 your wrong. the dc approach is very tollerent of failure. it also has
 the advantage of far greater reliability do to its reusable nature (shuttle
 isn't reusable, it's salvagable).

 the flip over happens at a very low speed, not supersonic. if the dc-x
 shows the flip over works, it will work unless the laws of physics change.
 
 >how much in dc-x is redundant?  that's the real question.
 
 the final dc-1 will have fully intact abort throughout the entire flight
 envelop. upon re-entry for example, it can loose about 80% of available
 thrust and still land safely.
 
 >everything we do in life has zero-defects issues at times (agree?).
 
 everything can suffer from catastrophic failure but that's not the same
 thing. shuttle simply isn't a fault tolerent design, ssto is.
 
 >as a doctor, i can not error in my diagnosis and treatment recommendations.  
 
 you don't put your patients in conditions where there is no way out. you
 wouldn't for example, give a patient a drug and not monitor them for
 harmful side effects would you?
 
 >while dc-x's r&d program makes good sense, i am less optimistic about dc-x 
 >as you (and apparently others) are.  
 
 you are very much in the minority. if the dc series fails to make orbit, it
 will still be a very worthwhile effort. it will show us exactly what we do
 need to do to build ssto.
 
 >but, dc-x will still have failures.  it is the nature of aerospace r&d.  
 
 again, refering to the dc-1, it will provide fully intact abort theroughout
 the flight envelop. shuttle doesn't. dc is fault tollerent, shuttle isn't.
 
 >it's successors are not slated to be passenger carrying.  
 
 not true. build a passenger pallet (a fairly easy thing to do) and it will
 carry passengers.

 i would suggest you talk to the dc-x crew themselves. their original
 schedule had an operational dc-1 flying in 96.

 your ignoring the dammage it does. mannes space has a reputation for being
 unreliable and hugely expensive. shuttle supporters only make it easy for
 opponents of manned space to kill it.
 
 >you could change my view on dc-x if you could prove the following:
 
 the only way to prove those things is to build it.
