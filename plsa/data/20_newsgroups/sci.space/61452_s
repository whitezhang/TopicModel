 i do not understand what you are saying here.  what is improved, what 
 is significant, and what does this have to do with carrying more 
 equipment on a servicing mission?  also, as implied by other posters, why 
 do you need to boost the orbit on this mission anyway?  maybe you have 
 something here, but could you please clarify it for us on the net?

 from what i've heard, the motors are fine - it is one of the two 
 sets of electronics that control the motors that needs a fix.  the 
 motors and electronics are separate pieces of hardware.  i expect 
 to be corrected if i'm wrong on this.
