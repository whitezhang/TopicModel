 i would just like to point out that it is much easier to place an
 object at orbital altitude than it is to place it with orbital
 velocity.  for a target 300 km above the surface of earth,
 you need a delta-v of 2.5 km/s.  assuming that rockets with specific
 impulses of 300 seconds are easy to produce, a rocket with a dry
 weight of 50 kg would require only about 65 kg of fuel+oxidizer.
 a small dispersal charge embedded in about 20 kg of sand or
 birdshot (depending on the nature of the structure) would be
 the payload.  i am sure the whole project is well within
 the capability of the amateur rocketry community.
 
 it sounds like a good science fair project--'reduction
 of light pollution through applied ballistics'.
 or, it could be part of the challenge prize being discussed
 here: $1 billion for the first person to spend 1 year
 on the moon, $1 million for the first erradication of
 an orbital eyesore/ccd burner.  i wouldpledge $1000
 for the first person to bring it down, and i am sure
 there are at least 999 other astronomers, nature lovers,
 or just plain people of good taste who would do likewise.
 
 of course, a  gerald bull solution might be simpler.
 (either the solution gerald bull would apply--the use
 of a large caliber gun; or the solution which was applied
 to gerald bull--the use of a small caliber gun.)
