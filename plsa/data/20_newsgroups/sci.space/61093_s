 doug-- actually, if memory serves, the atlas is an outgrowth of the old 
 titan icbm.  if so, there's probably quite a few old pads, albeit in need 
 of some serious reconditioning.  still, being able to buy the turf and 
 pad (and bunkers, including prep facility) at midwest farmland prices 
 strikes me as pretty damned cheap.
