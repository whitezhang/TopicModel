 in spite of my great respect for the people you speak of, i think their
 cost estimates are a bit over-optimistic. if nothing else, a working ssto
 is at least as complex as a large airliner and has a smaller experience
 base. it therefore seems that ssto development should cost at least as
 much as a typical airliner development. that puts it in the $3g to $5g
 range.

 true it and the contest would result in a much larger market. but i
 don't think it would be enough to attract the investors given the
 risks involved.
 
 if you could gurantee the ssto costs and gurantee that it captures
 100% of the available launch market, then i think you could
 do it.
