 we`ve had the the great western, the [ dunno ] and the great northern
 postulated as brunel`s masterpiece. keep boxing the compass chaps, you`ll
 get round to it eventually.
 
 the great western was a highly successful transatlantic mail ship,
 with hybrid sail and steam propulsion. the great eastern, which broke
 the 'little giant' financially and otherwise, was a revolutionary leap
 forward in ship design. a thirty thousand ton all steel vessel, with
 primary steam propulsion, it was at the time easily the biggest ocean
 going vessel ever built. brunel took advantage of the fact that cargo
 and / or fuel capacity rose with the cube of scale, while drag rose
 with the square, so a really big ship could steam thousands of miles
 without coaling.
 
 unfortunately, there was no real market for such a beast at the time,
 and it was eventually sold off at scrap values. as another poster
 said, it then went on to a successful career as a telegraph cable
 laying ship. it was in fact the only ship of its day capable of laying
 a transatlantic cable in one go, with the endurance and capacity to
 carry the huge reel all the way, and the manoeuverabilty to dredge for
 defective sections. see arthur c clarke`s book "how the world was one"
 [ i think that`s right ]
 
 if that`s how the shuttle goes down in history, as a technical triumph
 and a financial disaster for the builder, it would not be entirely
 ignoble, but i doubt if history will be so charitable.  its true the
 shuttle can do things no other launch system can do, but are they
 worth doing? with low cost access to space, you could have an
 affordable space station for doing shuttle-like extended manned
 missions. as it is, the shuttle is not so much a space-truck as a
 space-rv, ( only not so cheap to run :-( )
