 galileo's hga  is stuck.   
 
 the hga was left closed,  because galileo  had a venus flyby.
 
 if the hga were pointed att he sun,  near venus,  it would
 cook the foci elements.
 
 question:  why couldn't galileo's  course manuevers have been
 designed such that the hga  did not ever do a sun point.?
 
 after all,  it would normally be aimed at earth anyway?
 
 or would it be that an emergency situation i.e. spacecraft safing
 and seek might have caused an hga sun point?
