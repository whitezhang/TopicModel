 as an amateur radio operator (vhf 2metres) i like to keep up with what is 
 going up (and for that matter what is coming down too).
  
 in about 30 days i have learned alot about satellites current, future and 
 past all the way back to vanguard series and up to astro d observatory 
 (space).  i borrowed a book from the library called weater satellites (i 
 think, it has a photo of the earth with a tiros type satellite on it.)
  
 i would like to build a model or have a large color poster of one of the 
 tiros satellites i think there are places in the usa that sell them.
 itos is my favorite looking satellite, followed by amsat-oscar 13 
 (ao-13).
