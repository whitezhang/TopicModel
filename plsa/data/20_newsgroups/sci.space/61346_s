 the temperature of intergalactic space (or intercluster or 
 intersupercluster space) would be very, very close to the microwave 
 background temperature, 2.73 kelvins.  i recall that in interstellar 
 space in our neighborhood of the galaxy it's something like 4 k.
 
 is that what you were looking for?
