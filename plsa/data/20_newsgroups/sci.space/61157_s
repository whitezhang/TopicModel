                      magellan status report
                          april 23, 1993
 
 1.  the magellan spacecraft continues to operate normally, gathering
 gravity data to plot the density variations of venus in the
 mid-latitudes.  the solar panel offpoint was returned to zero degrees
 and spacecraft temperatures dropped 2-3 degrees c.
 
 2.  an end-to-end test of the delayed aerobraking data readout
 process was conducted this week in preparation for the transition
 experiment.  there was some difficulty locking up to the data frames,
 and engineers are presently checking whether the problem was in
 equipment at the tracking station.
 
 3.  magellan has completed 7277 orbits of venus and is now 32 days
 from the end of cycle 4 and the start of the transition experiment.
 
 4.  magellan scientists were participating in the brown-vernadsky
 microsymposium at brown university in providence, ri, this week.  this
 joint meeting of u.s. and russian venus researchers has been
 continuing for many years.
 
 5.  a three-day simulation of transition experiment aerobraking
 activities is planned for next week, including orbit trim maneuvers
 and starcal (star calibration) orbits.
