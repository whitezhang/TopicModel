 no. i estimate a 99 % probability the gehrels referred to
 is thomas gehrels of the spacewatch project, kitt peak observatory.
 
 maybe in the 24th century they could do gamma ray spectroscopy on
 distant asteroids with an orbiting observatory, but here in the
 primitive 20th we have to send a probe there to get gamma ray
 spectroscopy done.
