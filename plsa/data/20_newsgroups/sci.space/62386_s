 i like this statement, though for my own reasons.  cost comparisons depend
 a lot on whether the two options are similar, and *then* it becomes very
 revealing to consider what their differences are.  can soyuz launch the
 long exposure facility?  course not.  will the shuttle take my television 
 relay to leo by year's end?  almost certainly not, but the russians are
 pretty good about making space accessible on a tight schedule.
 
 comparing s and ss points up that there are two active space
 launcher-and-work-platform resources, with similarities and differences.
 where they are in direct competition, we may get to see some market
 economics come into play.
