 also in pure speculation:
 
 parity errors in memory or previously known conditions that were waivered.
    "yes that is an error, but we already knew about it"
 
 any problem where they decided a backup would handle it.
 
 any problem in an area that was not criticality 1,2,3..., that is, any
    problem in a system they decided they could do without.
