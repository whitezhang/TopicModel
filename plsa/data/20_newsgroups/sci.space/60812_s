 if anyone knows anyone else who would like to get sci.space,
 but doesn't have an internet feed (or has a cryptic internet
 feed), i would be willing to feed it to them.  i have a nice
 offline message reader/editor, an automated modem "mailer"
 program which will pick up mail bundles (quickly and easily),
 and an install.exe to set them up painlessly.  no charge for
 the sci.space feed, though you have to dial washington, d.c.
 this is not a bbs -- it's a store & forward system for mail
 bundles, with minimum connect times.  (i'm used to overseas
 calls.)  (this is not an offer for a free feed for any other
 particular newsgroups.)  speeds of up to 14400 (v32bis) are
 supported.  vip's might be offered other free services, such
 as internet address and other functionality.
 
 i get my feed from uunet and run a 4-line hub.  i've been
 hubbing for years -- i have an extremely reliable hub.
 
 the software i provide runs under ms-dos (and os/2 and windows
 as a dos box).  other, compatible software packages exist for
 the macintosh and unix.
 
 any responses should be private and go to:

 (by the way, to all, my apologies for the public traffic on my
 glib question.  i really didn't expect public replys.  but thanks
 to bill higgins for the interesting statistics and the lead.)
