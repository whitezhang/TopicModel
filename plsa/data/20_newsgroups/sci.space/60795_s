 in pure speculation, i would guess cautions based on hazardous
 pre-launch ops would qualify.  something like "caution:  srbs
 have just been armed."  
 
 it does raise an interesting question as to how hard it is to 
 pick out an expected error from an unexpected error in the heat
 of the moment.
