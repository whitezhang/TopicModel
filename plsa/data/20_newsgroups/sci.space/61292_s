 there are people who have adapted to high altitudes in the andes and in
 tibet. i suspect that it took them several generations to make the
 adaptation because europeans had difficulty making the adaptation. they
 had to send the women to a lower altitude when they were pregnant in order
 to insure sucessful childbirth.

 another factor you should consider is the x-ray opacity of the atmosphere 
 in case of stellar flares, the uv opacity is also important because uv 
 radiation can kill or damage microbes, plants, and animals.
