 first i've heard of it. offhand:
 
 griffin is no longer an "office" head, so that's bad.
 
 on the other hand:
 
 regress seemed to think: we can't fund anything by griffin, because
 that would mean (and we have the lies by the old hardliners about the
 $ 400 billion mars mission to prove it) that we would be buying into a
 mission to mars that would cost 400 billion. therefore there will be
 no artemis or 20 million dollar lunar orbiter et cetera...
 
 they were killing griffin's main program simply because some sycophants
 somewhere had congress beleivin that to do so would simply be to buy into
 the same old stuff. sorta like not giving aid to yeltsin because he's
 a communist hardliner.
 
 at least now the sort of reforms griffin was trying to bring forward
 won't be trapped in their own little easily contained and defunded
 ghetto. that griffin is staying in some capacity is very very very
 good. and if he brings something up, noone can say "why don't you go
 back to the ose where you belong" (and where he couldn't even get money
 for design studies).
