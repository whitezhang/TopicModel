 
 if gamma ray bursters are extragalactic, would absorption from the
 galaxy be expected?  how transparent is the galactic core to gamma
 rays?
 
 how much energy does a burster put out?  i know energy depends on
 distance, which is unknown.  an answer of the form _x_ ergs per
 megaparsec^2 is ok.
