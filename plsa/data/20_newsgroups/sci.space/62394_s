 gene miya says that henry will never go aloft in the shuttle; the
 payload bay isn't big enough for his chocolate chip cookies.
 
 when henry was here at dryden, he was looking pretty covetously at the
 sr-71s and the f-104s, even though they don't have much cookie space.
 i guess he figured that he could manage for a short flight....
