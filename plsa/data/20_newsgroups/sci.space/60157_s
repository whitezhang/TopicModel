 	try reading a bit.  the government does lots of multi year
 contracts with penalty for cancellation clauses.  they just like to be
 damn sure they know what they are doing before they sign a multi year
 contract.   the reason they aren't cutting defense spending as much
 as they would like is the reagan administration signed enough
 multi year contracts,  that it's now cheaper to just finish them out.
 
 look at ssf.  this years funding is 2.2 billion,  1.8 of which will
 cover penalty clauses, due to the re-design.
