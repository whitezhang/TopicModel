 too bad they didn't  give him a tour of the cgro data?
 
 i think he'd be fascinated by the gamma ray bursters.  the mind of
 hawking might even propose a mechanism.
 
 
 so what's a drag free satellite?   coated with wd-40?  carries an
 aluminum-gold  set of grateful dead albums?   inquiring minds
 want to know?
 
 and why would mo  carry any features for being drag free?  i thought
 aero-braking was a possible mo  experimental activity?
