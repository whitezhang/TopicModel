    if i read you right, you're saying in essence that, with a larger
    economy, nations will have more discretionary funds to *waste* on a
    lunar facility. that was certainly partially the case with apollo,
    but real lunar colonies will probably require a continuing
    military, scientific, or commercial reason for being rather than
    just a "we have the money, why not?" approach.
 
 ah, but the whole point is that money spent on a lunar base is not
 wasted on the moon. it's not like they'd be using $1000 (1000r?) bills
 to fuel their moon-dozers. the money to fund a lunar base would be
 spent in the country to which the base belonged. it's a way of funding
 high-tech research, just like darpa was a good excuse to fund various
 fields of research, under the pretense that it was crucial to the
 defense of the country, or like esprit is a good excuse for the ec to
 fund research, under the pretense that it's good for pan-european
 cooperation.
 
 now maybe you think that government-funded research is a waste of
 money (in fact, i'm pretty sure you do), but it does count as
 investment spending, which does boost the economy (and just look at
 the size of that multiplier :->).
