 only 10kw?

 ha!  "north america modular space station construction" :-)
 same apprach, same reasoning: "construction occurs under assembly
 line conditions, no random weather problems interupting site-work
 on your home - better quality control" -- sounds like first "-"
 point above :-)
 
 somehow i have a strange attraction for this idea (living in
 a modular home maybe has altered my mind).  the only thing
 that scares me is the part about simply strapping 3 ssme's and
 a nosecone on it and "just launching it."  i have this vision
 of something going terribly wrong with the launch resulting in the
 complete loss of the new modular space station (not just a peice of
 it as would be the case with staged in-orbit construction).
