 this all sounds like that indecent proposal movie.  wouldn't there be
 a lot of people that would try this with little hope of working just
 to get the dough?  if you have a 1:100 chance and it costs you $10mil,
 then you might pay some stooge a few grand to be your lucky hero.
 just send up a few dozen and 1 is bound to survive enough to make you
 rich.
