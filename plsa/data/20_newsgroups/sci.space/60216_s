 the naca came up with them before world war ii.  nasa is directly
 descended from the naca, with space added in.
 
 you'll notice that i didn't mention sweep wings even though the
 x-5, tested at what's now dryden, had them.  we did steal that one
 dirctly from the germans.  the difference is that swept wings don't
 change their angle of sweep, sweep wings do.  perhaps the similarity
 of names has caused some confusion?  747s have swept wings, f-111s
 have sweep wings.

 after nasa aerodynamicists proposed them and nasa test teams
 demonstrated them.  richard whitcomb and r.t. jones, at langley
 research center, were giants in the field.
 
 dryden was involved in the flight testing of winglets and area
 ruling (in the 70s and 50s, respectively).  it's true that we
 used military aircraft as the testbeds (kc-135 and yf-102) but
 that had more to do with availability and need than with military
 involvement.  the yf-102 was completely ours and the kc-135 was
 bailed to us.  the air force, of course, was interested in our
 results and supportive of our efforts.
 
 dryden flew the first digital fly by wire aircraft in the 70s. no
 mechnaical or analog backup, to show you how confident we were.
 general dynamics decided to make the f-16 flyby-wire when they saw how
 successful we were.  (mind you, the avro arrow and the x-15 were both
 fly-by-wire aircraft much earlier, but analog.)
 
 phil> egad! i'm disagreeing with mary shafer!  
 
 the nasa habit of acquiring second-hand military aircraft and using
 them for testbeds can make things kind of confusing.  on the other
 hand, all those second-hand navy planes give our test pilots a chance
 to fold the wings--something most pilots at edwards air force base
 can't do.
