 how could this possibly be "environmental vandalism" when there is no
 "environment" to vandalize up there?
 
 since the advertising "is just to help defray costs", it's certainly no
 surprise that "the taxpayers would bear most of the expense".  sounds
 like a good idea to me, since the taxpayers would bear _all_ of the
 expense if they didn't do the advertising.

 great idea, they should have done it long ago.

 i can't believe that a mile-long billboard would have any significant
 effect on the overall sky brightness.  venus is visible during the day,
 but nobody complains about that.  besides, it's in leo, so it would only
 be visible during twilight when the sky is already bright, and even if
 it would have some miniscule impact, it would be only for a short time
 as it goes zipping across the sky.
 
 >are protesting groups being organized in the states?
 
 no doubt.  people are always looking for something to protest about, so
 it would be no surprise.
 
 >really, really depressed.
 
 well, look on the, er, bright side.  imagine the looks on the faces of
 people in primitive tribes out in the middle of nowhere as they look up
 and see a can of budweiser flying across the sky... :-d
