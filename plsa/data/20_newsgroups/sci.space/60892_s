 you totally forgot the original post that you posted allen. in that post
 you stated that the "wrap" was on top of and in addition to any overhead.
 geez in this post you finally admit that this is not true.

 come your little ol buns down here and you will find out who is doing
 what and who is working on integration. this is simply an ad hominum
 attack and you know it.

 of course there is a fee. it is for administration. geez allen any
 organization has costs but there is a heck of a difference in  legitimate
 costs, such as libraries and other things that must be there to support
 a program and "wrap" as you originally stated it.you stated that wrap
 was on top of all of the overhead which a couple of sentences down you
 say is not true. which is it allen?

 as you have posted on this subject allen, you state that wrap is over and
 above overhead and is a seperate charge. you admit here that this is wrong.
 nasa has a line item budget every year. i have seen it allen. get some
 numbers from that detailed nasa budget and dig out the wrap numbers and then
 howl to high heaven about it. until you do that you are barking in the wind.

 integration could be done better at the centers. apollo integration was 
 done here at msfc and that did not turn out so bad. the philosophy of
 reston is totally wrong allen. there you have a bunch of people who are
 completely removed from the work that they are trying to oversee. there
 is no way that will ever work. it has never worked in any large scale project
 that it was ever tried on. could you imagine a reston like set up for 
 apollo?

 oh you are full of it allen on this one. i agree that jsc screwed up big.
 they should be responsible for that screw up and the people that caused it
 replaced. to make a stupid statement like that just shows how deep your
 bias goes. come to msfc for a couple of weeks and you will find out just
 how wrong you really are. maybe not, people like you believe exactly what
 they want to believe no matter  what the facts are contrary to it.

 i agree that integration is the single most important part of a  successful
 large scale effort. what i completly disagree with is seperating that
 integration function from  the people that are doing the work. it is called
 leadership allen. that is what made apollo work. final responsibility for
 the success of apollo was held by less than 50 people. that is leadership
 and responsibility. there is neither when you have any organization set up
 as reston is. you could take the same people and move them to jsc or msfc
 and they could do a much better job. why did it take a year for reston to
 finally say something about the problem? if they were on site and part of the
 process then the problem would have never gotten out of hand in the first place.
 
 there is one heck of a lot i do not know allen, but one thing i do know is that
 for a project to be successful you must have leadership. i remember all of the
 turn over at reston that kept ssf program in shambles for years do you? it is
 lack of responsibility and leadership that is the programs problem. lack of
 leadership from the white house, congress and at reston. nasa is only a
 symptom of a greater national problem. you are so narrowly focused in your
 efforts that you do not see this.

 no, i am saying that if they were located at jsc it never would have

 i have the time to reitereate one more timet that if the leadership that is
 at reston was on site at jsc the problem never would have happened, totally
 ignoring the lack of leadership of congress. this many headed hydra that
 has grown up at nasa is the true problem of the agency and to try to 
 change the question to suit you and your bias is only indicative of
 your position.
