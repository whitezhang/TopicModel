 well it rolled out two weeks ago. as we speak it is at white sands getting
 ready. i would have called my sources for the latest but they are all out
 of town (in nm).
 
 as for the future, there is at least $5m in next years budget for work
 on ssrt. they (sdio) have been looking for more funds and do seem to have
 some. however, sdio is not (i repeat, is not) going to fund an orbital
 prototype. the best we can hope from them is to 1) keep it alive for
 another year, and 2) fund a suborbital vehicle which might (with
 major modifications) just make orbit. there is also some money for a
 set of prototype tanks and projects to answer a few more open questions.
 
 better news comes from the new spacelifter effort. the usaf managers of
 this program are very open to ssto and will have about $50m next
 year for studies. this would be enough to bring dc-y to pdr.
 
 now not all of this money will go to dc but a good case could be made
 for spending half on dc.
 
 public support is still critical. meet with your congressperson (i'll
 help you do it) and get his/her support. also call your local media
 ans get them to cover the flight tests.
