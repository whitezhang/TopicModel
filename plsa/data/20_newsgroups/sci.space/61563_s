 the "artist renderings" that i've seen of the hst reboost still have
 the arrays fully extended, with a cradle holding hst at a ~30 degree
 angle to the shuttle.  i think the rendering was conceived before the
 array replacemnet was approved, so i'm not sure if the current reboost
 will occur with the arrays deployed or not.  however, it doesn't 
 appear that an array retraction was necessary for reboost.

 thanks for the input on gro's s/a design constraints.  that would 
 explain the similar design on uars.

 heck, the mms project used to design _missions_ with servicing in mind.
 the xte spacecraft was originally designed as an on-orbit replacement
 for the instrument module on euve.  that way, you get two instruments
 for the price of one spacecraft bus (the explorer platform).  a 
 second on-orbit replacement was also considered, with the fuse telescope.
