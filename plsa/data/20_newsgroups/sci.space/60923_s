    announce that a reward of $1 billion would go to the first corporation

 and with $1b on offer, the problem of "keeping them alive" is highly
 likely to involve more than just the lunar environment!

 all died.  how sad.  gosh, that leaves us as the oldest residents."
 
 "quick boss, the slime from yoyodyne are back, and this time they've

 (i'm kidding, btw, although the problem of winner-takes-all prizes is
 that it encourages all sorts of undesirable behaviour - witness
 military procurement programs.  and $1b is probably far too small a
 reward to encourage what would be a very expensive and high risk
 proposition.)
