 one thing to recall.  putting a satellite as high as possible is one thing. 
 coming back to not only that altitude, but matching the position of it in 
 its orbit on a subsequent mission is another thing.  any misalignment of the 
 plane of the orbit during launch or being ahead or behind the target will 
 require more fuel to adjust.  this was considered in the original deployment. 
 
 i agree though that the demands on the crew and complexity are stupendous.  
 one has to admire how much they are trying to do.
