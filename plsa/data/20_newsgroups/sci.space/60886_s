 i've just read richard langley's latest "navstar gps constellation status".
 
 it states that the latest satellite was placed in orbit plane position c-3.
 there is already one satellite in that position. i know that it's almost
 ten years since that satellite was launched but it's still in operation so
 why not use it until it goes off?
 
 why not instead place the new satellite at b-4 since that position is empty
 and by this measure have an almost complete gps-constellation
 (23 out of 24)?
