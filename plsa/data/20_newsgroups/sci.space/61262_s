         all of this is very valid and very true.  but to add to this
 explaniation, each individual detector also has a built in fail-safe, just so
 the detector does not read the background radiation(i.e. cosmic rays), 
 if i remember right, the detectors go off about 3 to 5 sigma above the 
 background.  this is so they don't catch particularly energetic cosmic rays
 that would normally set it off. even with this buffer, they still have to throw
 out something like 1/2 of the bursts that they do get, because of the earth's
 van allen belts, the south atlantic anomaly, the sun,  if i remember right,
 there is either a radar station, or a radio station in australia, and there are
 a couple other sources as well.
