 the problem is, you can't raise adequate amounts of money that way.
 the viking fund tried.  they did succeed, in a way, but only because
 of the political impact of their fundraising.  the actual amount of
 money they raised was fairly inconsequential; it would not have kept
 the viking lander going by itself.
