 
 sorry for asking a question that's not entirely based on the
 technical aspects of space, but i couldn't find the
 answer on the faqs !
 
 i'm currently in the uk, which makes seeing a space shuttle
 launch a little difficult.....
 
 however, i have been selected to be an exchange student
 at louisiana state uni. from august, and i am absolutely
 determined to get to see a space shuttle launch sometime
 during the year at which i will be in america.
 
 i hear there's a bit of a long mailing list, so if someone
 can tell me how to get tickets and where to get them from, then
 please e-mail me !
 
 thanks very much for your patience....
 
 (and if anyone else wants to know, tell me and i'll summarize
 for you - just to save all those poor people who have to
 pay for their links !)
