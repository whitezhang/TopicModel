 well, i guess i'm left wondering just who all the 'light fascists'
 think *they* are.  yes, i understand the issues.  i don't even
 particularly care for the idea.  but am i the only one that finds the
 sort of overreaction above just a *little* questionable?  you must
 find things like the moon *really* obnoxious in their pollution.
 
 a few questions for those frothing at the mouth to ask themselves:
 
 	1) how long is this thing supposed to stay up?  sounds like it
 would have a *huge* drag area, not a lot of mass, and be in a fairly
 low orbit.
 
 	2) just what orbital parameters are we talking about here?
 what real impact are we talking about, really?  how many optical
 astronomers are *really* going to be impacted?
 
 	3) which is more important; adding a few extra days of
 'seeing' for (very few) optical astronomers or getting the data the
 sensors are supposed to return along with the data for large
 inflatables (and the potential there for an inflatable space station)?
 the choice would seem to be one or the other, since the advertising is
 being used to help fund this thing.
 
 	4) if your answer to 3) above was "the astronomers", then feel
 free to come up with some other way to fund the (to my mind) more
 important research data that would be gained by this without spending
 any more of my money to do it.  in other words, put up or shut up.

 probably so.  i'm just not sure we agree about who the 'stupid' are.
