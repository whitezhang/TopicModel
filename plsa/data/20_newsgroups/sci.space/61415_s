 	i don't know where you got this idea from, jpl's history dates back to 
 	to the 1930s when a caltech professor named von karman conducted  
 	experiments in rocket propulsion with a group of graduate students
 	on the present site of the jet propulsion laboratory.   the army started
 	funding the laboratory and had jurisdiction untill the late 1950s when
 	nasa took over. the early research conducted at the laboratory
 	led to many applications the first being jet-assisted takeoff rockets
 	for aircraft.  i think this should explain where jpl got it's name, i
 	should know, i worked there for five wonderful years.
