 i know someone had long talks about solar sails early this year and late last
 year..also about solar sailing. not sure who captured it if possible..
 
 i think it was one of the regulars who had most or all the data?
 
 i think i started the latest round or the late last year round.. but the topic
 has been around here, off and on for a year or two..
