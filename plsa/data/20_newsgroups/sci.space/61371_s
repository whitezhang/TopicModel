 ron miller is a space artist with a long and distinguished career.  
 i've admired both his paintings (remember the usps solar system
 exploration stamps last year?) and his writings on the history of
 spaceflight.  for several years he's been working on a *big* project
 which is almost ready to hit the streets.  a brochure from his
 publisher has landed in my mailbox, and i thought it was cool enough
 to type in part of it (it's rather long).  especially given the net's
 strong interest in vaporware spacecraft...

 this text is a history of the spaceship as both a cultural and a
 technological phenomenon.  the idea of a vehicle for traversing the
 space betwen worlds did not spring full-blown into existence in the
 tlatter half of theis century.  the need preceded the ability ot make
 such a device by several hundred years.  as soon as it was realized
 that there were other worlds than this one, human beings wanted to
 reach them.   
 
 tracing the history of the many imaginative, and often prescient,
 attempts to solve this problem also reflects the history of
 technology, science, astronomy, and engineering.  once space travel
 became feasible, there were many more spacecraft concepts developed
 than ever got off the drawing board-- or off the ground, for that
 matter.  these also are described in theis book, for the same reason
 as the pre-space-age and pre-flight ideas are:  they are all accurate
 reflections of their particular era's dreams, abilities, and
 knowledge.  virtually every spaceship concept invented since 1500, as
 well as selected events important in developing the idea of
 extraterrestrial travel, is listed chronologically.  the chronological
 entries allow comparisons between actual astronautical events and
 speculative ventures.  they also allow comparisons between
 simultaneous events taking place in different countries.  they reveal
 connections, influences, and evolutions hitherto unsuspected.  every
 entry is accompanied by at least one illustration.  nearly every
 spacecraft concept is illustrated with a schematic drawing.  this
 allows accurate comparisons to be made between designss, to visualize
 differences, similarities, and influences.
 
 this text will be of interest to students of astronautical history,
 and also to model builders who would be interested in the schematic
 diagrams.   science fiction fans as well as aviation history buffs and
 historians of science will also find this book to be fascinating.  the
 unique collection of illustrations makes it a visually attractive and
 very interesting history of the spaceship.
