 back in january and february there were several articles (wash post, time...)
 saying that nasa was "considering" the option just as it is now "considering"
 a followup mission 6-12 months after the servicing mission.  however, the
 down time was estimated to be a year+ (servicing, checkout, sceheduling
 and training another shuttle, orbit verification...) and to be quite
 expensive.  i think it may have been more a mental exercise than a
 real plan.  don't know.
