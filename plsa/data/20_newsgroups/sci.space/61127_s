 if i'm not mistaken, this is the usual sort of precaution against loss of
 communications.  that timer is counting down continuously; if it ever hits
 zero, that means galileo hasn't heard from earth in a suspiciously long
 time and it may be galileo's fault... so it's time to go into a fallback
 mode that minimizes chances of spacecraft damage and maximizes chances
 of restoring contact.  i don't know exactly what-all galileo does in such
 a situation, but a common example is to switch receivers, on the theory
 that maybe the one you're listening with has died.
