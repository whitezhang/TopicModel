 will someone tell an ignorant physicist where the term "level 5" comes
 from? it sounds like the risks digest  equivalent of large, extra
 large, jumbo... or maybe it's like "defcon 5..."
 
 i gather it means that shuttle software was developed with extreme
 care to have reliablility and safety, and almost everything else in
 the computing world is level 1, or cheesy dime-store software.  not
 surprising.  but who is it that invents this standard, and how come
 everyone but me seems to be familiar with it?
