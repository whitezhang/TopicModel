 the hga isn't all that reflective in the wavelengths that might "cook the
 focal elements", nor is its figure good on those scales--the problem is
 that the antenna _itself_ could not be exposed to venus-level sunlight,
 lest like icarus' wings it melt.  (i think it was glues and such, as well
 as electronics, that they were worried about.)  thus it had to remain
 furled and the axis _always_ pointed near the sun, so that the small
 sunshade at the tip of the antenna mast would shadow the folded hga.
 (a larger sunshade beneath the antenna shielded the spacecraft bus.)
