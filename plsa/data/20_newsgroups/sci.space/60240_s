 i think you would lose your money. julius was actually rather tall
 for a roman. he did go on record as favouring small soldiers though.
 thought they were tougher and had more guts. he was probably right
 if you think about it. as for napoleon remember that the french
 avergae was just about 5 feet and that height is relative! did he
 really have a complex?
 
 obspace :  we have all seen the burning candle from high school that goes
 out and relights. if there is a large hot body placed in space but in an
 atmosphere, exactly how does it heat the surroundings? diffusion only?
