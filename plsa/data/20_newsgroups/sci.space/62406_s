 this is one of those "yes, but" things. it's true that a hydraulically
 pressurized tube can be somewhat more rigid than an unpressurized tube,
 but even at 2000 psi levels a hydraulic hose will bend rather easily,
 though it's straight-on compressive strength is high, and it's torsional 
 resistance increase is practically nil. on the other grasping member, 
 there's no doubt that hydraulic "leverage" exists in nature. tree roots 
 are an example. given time they can shatter concrete as osmotic pressure
 increases.

 kangaroos 3-limbed? i don't think so. if you take the view that the
 tail is a limb, then monkeys and kangaroos are 5-limbed. i think the
 tail is a different kind of structure, grossly enlarged in the case
 of the kangaroo, but primarily still an instrument of balance rather
 than locomotion. i don't know much about panda "thumbs", so i'll ask
 is it opposable?

 well i won't say flat out that they can't be intelligent, but i'll
 bring a couple of lines of argument to bear to try to show why i
 don't think it's likely. first let me say that when i say "intelligent"
 i mean complex behaviors in response to novel situations on a level
 with, or greater than, human tool use and tool building. ie assuming
 suitable manipulators are present on the creature to allow it to alter 
 it's enviroment in a planned way, it will do so. that's certainly not
 a universal or complete definition of intelligence, but it will suffice
 for a putative technological alien.
 
 now no one knows exactly what makes a brain capable of thought, but
 it's generally accepted that one of the criteria is a certain level
 of complexity. this is generally determined by the number of neuron
 cells, and their interconnections. so a creature the size of a lemur
 wouldn't have enough neurons to support complex thought. this argument
 is considerably less clear in the case of the dinosaur. there's room
 for a large brain, though no indication that one ever developed. one
 reason this may be true is neuronic speed. the electrochemical messages 
 that trigger neurons require time to propagate. this makes it difficult
 for a highly complex central brain to coordinate the movements of very
 large creatures. so there's little selection pressure for such brains.
 instead, a simpler distributed network evolves. this doesn't rule out
 intelligent dinosaurs, but it points in that direction.
 
 then there are the thermodynamic arguments. a tiny creature like the
 lemur needs to eat frequently because it's internal heat is rapidly
 lost due to it's high surface to volume ratio. i contend that a creature
 that must spend most of it's time and energy feeding won't have the time
 to develop and exercise intelligence. that argument may be somewhat weak.
 the dinosaur's problem is the reverse, it must moderate it's heat production 
 because it's high volume to surface ratio makes it tend to retain waste heat. 
 i'm assuming that a certain temperature range is optimal for chemical
 reactivity reasons for productive neuron function. so creatures would
 tend to need to maintain a regulated temperature in a range near that
 of humans if they are carbon based. that tends to rule out cold blooded
 creatures as potential homes of intelligence. some people contend that
 some of the dinosaurs may have been warm blooded. but for a creature
 the size of a brontosaur, it's activity levels would have to be restrained
 or it would be prone to generate an internal steam explosion from the
 waste heat. whales are similar size, but they can reject heat to the
 ocean, a much more efficient sink than air. i suspect that for intelligence
 to manifest itself, a certain degree of activity in interacting with the
 environment is necessary. ie monkey curiousity. i doubt a large dinosaur
 would be capable of that much activity.
