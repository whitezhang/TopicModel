 it's public because it belongs to everybody.  it's vandalism because many people -- power companies -- do maliciously waste light.  if they can sell you
 or your city or your state an unshielded light that wastes 30 to 50 percent
 of its light, they make more _money_.  never mind that your money is wasted.
 never mind that taxpaper's money is wasted.  never mind that the sky is ruined.
