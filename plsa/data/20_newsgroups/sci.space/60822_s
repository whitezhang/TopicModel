 reported yesterday in the washington post (kathy sawyer, writer):
 
 the article plays down the russian role in us space.
 
 gibbons (science advisor to clinton) sent goldin a letter indicating
 nasa should not limit redesign options to those compatible with mir
 orbit.
 
 the white house thinks expectations for russian cooperation have been
 raised too high.
 
 the article reports that some think the spending and schedule limits
 for space station are so stringent that the redesign is nearly
 impossible.  that's why some think goldin has begun looking at 
 russian hardware.
 
 goldin states nasa will present all options to the administration 
 which will then have decision making power.
 
 goldin and the white house have totally ruled out using energia to
 boost the station.
