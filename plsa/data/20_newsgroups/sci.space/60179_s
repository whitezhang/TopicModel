 unfortunately, things have been boding ill (is that a legitimate conjugation?)
 for a while.  while the office of exploration had some great ideas, they never
 got much money.  i've heard good things about griffin, but it's hard to want
 him back in a job where he couldn't do anything.

 the group examining the freedom-based space station redesign proposals is 
 headed by michael griffin, "nasa's cheif engineer" in the words of space news.
 i believe this is him.
