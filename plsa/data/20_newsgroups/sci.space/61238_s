 actually, the idea, like most good ideas, comes from jules verne, not
 _the gods must be crazy._  in one of his lesser known books (i can't
 remember which one right now), the protagonists are in a balloon gondola,
 travelling over africa on their way around the world in the balloon, when
 one of them drops a fob watch.  they then speculate about the reaction
 of the natives to finding such a thing, dropped straight down from heaven.
 but the notion is not pursued further than that.
