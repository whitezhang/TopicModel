 you mean like: seconds, minutes, hours, days, months, years. . .  :-)
 
 remember,  the fahrenheit temperature scale is also a centigrade scale.  some
 revisionists tell the history something like this:  the coldest point in a
 particular russian winter was marked on the thermometer as was the body
 temperature of a volunteer (turns out he was sick, but you can't win 'em all).
 then the space in between the marks on the thermometer was then divided into
 hundredths.
