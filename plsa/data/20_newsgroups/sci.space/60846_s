 does anyone have any russian contacts (space or other) or contacts in the old
 ussr/su or eastern europe?
 
 post them here so we all can talk to them and ask questions..
 i think the cost of email is high, so we would have to  keep the content to
 specific topics and such..
 
 basically if we want to save russia and such, then we need to make contacts,
 contacts are a form of info, so lets get informing.
