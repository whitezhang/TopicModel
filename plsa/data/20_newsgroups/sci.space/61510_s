 i don't buy it.  if the things had no value at all, people wouldn't
 spend money to make them. so their lack of value is just your
 opinion, not an actual fact, which is neither a philisophical or
 legal basis for prohibiting them.
 
 on the other hand, i lived in oakbrook il for a while, where zoning
 laws prohibit billboards, as you mention above.  i think it was a
 fine law, despite it's contradictory basis.
 
 i would guess that the best legal and moral basis for protest would
 be violation of private property.  "i bought this house, out in
 the boondocks, specifically to enjoy my hobby, amateur astronomy.  now
 this billboard has made that investment worthless, so i want the
 price of the property, in damages."  it wouldn't take too many
 succesful cases like that to make bill-sats prohibitively expensive.
