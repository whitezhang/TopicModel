 vlbi project meets with international space agencies
 
 by ed mcnevin
      members of jpl's space very long baseline interferometry
 (vlbi) project team recently concluded a week-long series of
 meetings with officials from russia and japan.
      the meetings were part of "space vlbi week" held at jpl in
 early march and were intended to maintain cooperation between
 international space agencies participating in the development of
 the u.s. space vlbi project, a recently approved jpl flight
 project set for launch in 1995.
      u.s. space vlbi will utilize two earth-orbiting spacecraft
 -- the japanese vsop (vlbi space observing program) satellite
 with its 8-meter radio telescope, and a russian radioastron
 10-meter satellite. both spacecraft will team up with
 ground-based radio telescopes located around the world to create
 a radio telescope network that astronomers hope will expand radio
 telescope observing power by a factor of 10.
      japan's vsop satellite will use a limited six-hour orbit to
 conduct imaging science, while the russian radioastron spacecraft
 will exploit a larger, 28-hour earth orbit to conduct exploratory
 radio astronomy. each satellite will point at a source target for
 roughly 24 hours, while approximately 20 ground-based radio
 telescopes will simultaneously point at the same source object
 while within view on earth.
      according to dr. joel smith, jpl's project manager for the
 u.s. space vlbi, meetings like those held at jpl will permit
 japan and russia, who have little previous experience in radio
 interferometry, to establish working relationships with the radio
 astronomy communities that will be vital during the complex
 observations required by the space vlbi project.
      "one of our main activities is developing the methodology
 for international coordination, because the two spacecraft
 simultaneously rely on the corresponding tracking stations while
 using the ground-based radio telescopes to observe the same
 celestial objects," said smith.
      three new tracking antennas are being built at dsn
 facilities and other three other tracking facilities located in
 japan, russia and green bank, w.va. this global network of
 ground-based radio telescopes will use precision clocks and
 high-speed recorders to collect observation data and forward the
 information to a correlator located at the national radio
 astronomy observatory in socorro, n.m. the correlator will
 combine and process data, then make it available to mission
 investigators in moscow, tokyo, and jpl via electronic mail.
      smith is optimistic that the massive radio telescope created
 by the space vlbi network will provide radio astronomers with
 better resolution than has ever been achieved before by
 ground-based radio telescopes, allowing astronomers to take a
 closer look at distant objects in space.
      "there is a long history of radio astronomy using
 ground-based telescopes," said smith. "what we intend to do is to
 extend radio astronomy into earth orbit. our goal is to look
 deeper into the cores of galactic nuclei, quasars and other
 active radio sources to understand what drives those things we
 have seen so far with radio astronomy."
      smith noted that if one examines "the active galactic
 nuclei, you'll find jets appearing to spew at speeds greater than
 light, and at energy levels that are millions of times greater
 than you would expect."
      he said some astronomers believe that black holes may be
 located in the cores of these galaxies, and that they may fuel
 the jets. smith hopes that "by using space vlbi to look further
 into the cores, this theory may be supported or disproved."
      russian space-flight hardware, including transponders and
 transmitters, are now being tested in the united states, and
 japanese hardware is scheduled to arrive for testing later this
 year. analysis of this hardware will permit u.s. scientists and
 engineers to understand how to modify the high-speed vlba
 correlator operating at the nrao in order to accommodate the odd
 data patterns that will originate from the more than 20
 ground-based radio telescopes involved in space vlbi.
      smith is particularly pleased that meetings with the
 japanese and russian space agency officials -- like those held at
 jpl in march -- have proceeded smoothly. yet he knows that the
 political uncertainty in russia could jeopardize that country's
 participation in the project.
      "nothing is ever smooth," he said, "but the russians have
 been incredibly open with us. we always anticipated some
 likelihood that we will not succeed because of political factors
 beyond our control, yet there tends to be a way of keeping these
 things going, because scientists on both sides are trying hard,
 and people recognize the value of cooperation at this level."
      smith points out that the japanese space agency has more at
 stake than just fulfilling an international commitment to a
 science mission.
      "the japanese have been extremely cooperative, since
 international cooperation is essential to their science mission,"
 he said.
      but smith also noted that japanese space agency officials
 look at the u.s. space vlbi mission as an opportunity to showcase
 the technology involved with vsop spacecraft, and their highly
 regarded mach v launch vehicle.
      yet regardless of the risks involved in undertaking such an
 ambitious project, jpl's smith is satisfied that planning for the
 space vlbi project is beyond the significant financial and
 political hurdles that otherwise might threaten the project.
      "fortunately, we have the virtue of having two partners, and
 if either falls out, we would still have something with the
 other. by themselves, both spacecraft are independent,
 scientifically exciting missions."
