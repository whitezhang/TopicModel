                             april 16, 1993
 
 1.  the magellan mission at venus continues normally, gathering gravity
 data which provides measurement of density variations in the upper
 mantle which can be correlated to surface topography.  spacecraft
 performance is nominal.
 
 2.  magellan has completed 7225 orbits of venus and is now 39 days from
 the end of cycle-4 and the start of the transition experiment.
 
 3.  no significant activities are expected next week, as preparations
 for aerobraking continue on schedule.
 
 4.  on monday morning, april 19, the moon will occult venus and
 interrupt the tracking of magellan for about 68 minutes.
