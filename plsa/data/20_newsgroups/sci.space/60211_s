 could you use some sort of mechanical chest compression as an aid.
 sorta like the portable iron lung?   put some sort of flex tubing
 around the 'aquanauts' chest.  cyclically compress it  and it will
 push enough on the chest wall to support breathing?????
 
 you'd have to trust your breather,  but in space, you have to trust
 your suit anyway.
