 tell that to the people who run the 10-meter keck telescope, or the 
 astronomers and engineers working on the gemini twin 8-meter telescope
 project.  it took 7 years to build keck i and now they are building
 keck ii.  according to the december 1992 sky & telescope, "this
 second 10-meter eye will convert the facility into a binocular telescope
 with double the light-gathering power and the ability to resolve
 the headlights of a car some 25,000 kilometers away."   japan's 8.3-meter
 subaru telescope will soon join keck on mauna kea.  all these telescopes
 will work in the infrared, yes, but they are _visible light_ telescopes!
 
 and haven't you heard anything about adaptive optics?  a lot of research
 was done with "star wars" funding, and some is now being shared with
 astronomers.  this shows great promise.  soon, probably within a few
 years, even the largest telescopes will be able to resolve to their 
 theoretical limit _despite_ the distortions of the atmosphere.
 
 to say that "visible light astronomy is already a dying field" is 
 pure hokum.  to use the "logic" that things are already bad, so it doesn't
 matter if it gets worse is absurd.  maybe common sense and logic
 are the dying fields.
