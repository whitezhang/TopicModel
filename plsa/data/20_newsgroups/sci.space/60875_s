 exactly. some of the space:1999 effects remain first-rate even today.

 later on, the andersons tried to shed their reputation as creators of some
 of the worst pseudo-scientific shows in tv history by flying "into infinity."
 this was a one-off thing done as part of bbc's "educational sf" series "the
 day after tomorrow." the anderson episode dealt with a spaceship capable of
 reaching the speed of light ("lightship altares"), the four-man crew eventually 
 journeyed into a black hole and ended up on the far side of the galaxy (i
 think). i saw this as a 9-year-old back in 1976 and liked it very much, but
 then again i was a fan of space:1999 so i guess i was easily satisfied in those
 days:-)

 does anyone know if "into infinity" has been released on video? i have some
 space:1999 shows on vhs and know that thunderbirds etc. also are available in
 england.
