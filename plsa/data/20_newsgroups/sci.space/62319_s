 often shuttle lifts satellites with upper stages. yet we still consider it
 payload. ten saturn flights over about 4 years delivered to leo roughly the
 same as 50 shuttle flights over 10 years.

 they where pretty much the same in terms of cost/pound. a resurected
 saturn would cost only $2,000 per pound (if development costs are ignored)
 which is five times cheaper than shuttle.
