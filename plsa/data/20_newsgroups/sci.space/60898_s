    my understanding is that the 'expected errors' are basically
    known bugs in the warning system software - things are checked
    that don't have the right values in yet because they aren't
    set till after launch, and suchlike. rather than fix the code
    and possibly introduce new bugs, they just tell the crew
    'ok, if you see a warning no. 213 before liftoff, ignore it'.
 
 good grief. and i thought the shuttle software was known for being
 well-engineered. if this is actually the case, every member of the
 programming team should be taken out and shot.
 
 (given that i've heard the shuttle software rated as level 5 in
 maturity, i strongly doubt that this is the case).
