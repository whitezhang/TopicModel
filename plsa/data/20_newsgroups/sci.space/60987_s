 hmm.  $1 billion, lesse... i can probably launch 100 tons to leo at
 $200 million, in five years, which gives about 20 tons to the lunar
 surface one-way.  say five tons of that is a return vehicle and its
 fuel, a bigger mercury or something (might get that as low as two
 tons), leaving fifteen tons for a one-man habitat and a year's supplies?
 gee, with that sort of mass margins i can build the systems off
 the shelf for about another hundred million tops.  that leaves
 about $700 million profit.  i like this idea 8-)  let's see
 if you guys can push someone to make it happen 8-) 8-)
