 contacting nasa, esa, and other space agencies/companies
 
 many space activities center around large government or international
 bureaucracies.	in the us that means nasa.  if you have basic information
 requests: (e.g., general pr info, research grants, data, limited tours, and
 especially summer employment (typically resumes should be ready by jan.  1),
 etc.), consider contacting the nearest nasa center to answer your questions.
 
 email typically will not get you any where, computers are used by
 investigators, not pr people. the typical volume of mail per center is a
 multiple of 10,000 letters a day. seek the public information office at one
 of the below, this is their job:
 
 nasa (the national aeronautics and space administration) is the
 civilian space agency of of the united states federal government.
 it reports directly to the white house and is not a cabinet
 post such as the military department of defense.  its 20k+ employees
 are civil servants and hence us citizens.  another 100k+ contractors
 also work for nasa.
 
 nasa centers
 
     nasa headquarters (nasa hq)

     (818)-354-5011
 
 	the "heavies" in planetary research probes and other unmanned
 	projects (they also had a lot to do with iras). they run voyager,
 	magellan, galileo, and will run cassini, craf, etc. etc.. for
 	images, probe navigation, and other info about unmanned exploration,
 	this is the place to go.
 
 	jpl is run under contract for nasa by the nearby california
 	institute of technology, unlike the nasa centers above. this
 	distinction is subtle but critical. jpl has different requirements
 	for unsolicited research proposals and summer hires. for instance in
 	the latter, an sf 171 is useless. employees are caltech employees,
 	contractors, and for the most part have similar responsibilities.
 	they offer an alternative to funding after other nasa centers.
 
 	a fact sheet and description of jpl is available by anonymous
 	ftp in

     specific requests for software must go thru cosmic at the univ. of
     georgia, nasa's contracted software redistribution service. you can
     reach them at cosmic@uga.bitnet.
 
     note: foreign nationals requesting information must go through their
     embassies in washington dc. these are facilities of the us government
     and are regarded with some degree of economic sensitivity. centers
     cannot directly return information without high center approval. allow
     at least 1 month for clearance. this includes cosmic.
 
 the us air force space command can be contacted thru the pentagon along with
     other department of defense offices. they have unacknowledged offices in
     los angeles, sunnyvale, colorado springs, and other locations. they have
     a budget which rivals nasa in size.
