 actually, hiten wasn't originally intended to go into lunar orbit at all,
 so it indeed didn't have much fuel on hand.  the lunar-orbit mission was
 an afterthought, after hagoromo (a tiny subsatellite deployed by hiten
 during a lunar flyby) had a transmitter failure and its proper insertion
 into lunar orbit couldn't be positively confirmed.
 
 it should be noted that the technique does have disadvantages.  it takes
 a long time, and you end up with a relatively inconvenient lunar orbit.
 if you want something useful like a low circular polar orbit, you do have
 to plan to expend a certain amount of fuel, although it is reduced from
 what you'd need for the brute-force approach.
