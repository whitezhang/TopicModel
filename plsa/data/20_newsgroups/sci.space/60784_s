                      mission director status report
                              post-launch
                          april 9 - 15, 1993
 
 spacecraft
 
 1.  on april 9, real-time commands were sent, as planned, to reacquire
 celestial reference after completion of the low gain antenna (lga-2)
 swing/dual drive actuator (dda) hammer activities.
 
 2.  on april 9, the ej-1 (earth-jupiter #1) sequence memory load was uplinked
 to the spacecraft without incident.  this sequence covers spacecraft activity
 from april 12, 1993 to june 14, 1993 and includes a window for the radio relay
 antenna (rra) slew test on april 28, 1993.  the command loss timer was set to
 11 days as a part of this sequence memory load.
 
 3.  on april 12 and 15, a no-op command was sent to reset the command loss
 timer to 264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.
 
 4.  on april 12, cruise science memory readouts (mros) were performed for the
 extreme ultraviolet spectrometer (euv), dust detector (dds), and magnetometer
 (mag) instruments.  preliminary analysis indicates the data was received
 properly.
 
 5.  on april 12, an ultra-stable oscillator (uso) test was performed to verify
 the health status of the uso and to collect gravitational red shift experiment
 data; long term trend analysis is continuing.
 
 6.  on april 14, a 40bps modulation index test was performed to determine the
 optimal signal-to-noise ratio (snr) when transmitting at 40bps.  preliminary
 analysis of the data suggests that the present pre-launch selected modulation
 index is near the optimal level.
 
 7.  on april 15, cruise science memory readouts (mros) were performed for the
 extreme ultraviolet spectrometer (euv) and magnetometer (mag) instrument.
 preliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly.
 
 8.  on april 15, a periodic rpm (retro-propulsion module) 10-newton thruster
 flushing maintenance activity was performed; all 12 thrusters were flushed
 during the activity.  thruster performance throughout the activity was nominal.
 
 9.  the ac/dc bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significant
 changes (greater than 25 dn) throughout this period.  the ac measurement reads
 19 dn (4.3 volts).  the dc measurement reads 111 dn (12.9 volts).  these
 measurements are consistent with the model developed by the ac/dc special
 anomaly team.
 
 10. the spacecraft status as of april 15, 1993, is as follows:
 
        a)  system power margin -  60 watts
        b)  spin configuration - dual-spin
        c)  spin rate/sensor - 3.15rpm/star scanner
        d)  spacecraft attitude is approximately 18 degrees
            off-sun (lagging) and 6 degrees off-earth (leading)
        e)  downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps(coded)/lga-1
        f)  general thermal control - all temperatures within
            acceptable range
        g)  rpm tank pressures - all within acceptable range
        h)  orbiter science- instruments powered on are the pws,
            euv, uvs, epd, mag, hic, and dds
        i)  probe/rrh - powered off, temperatures within
            acceptable range
        j)  cmd loss timer setting - 264 hours
            time to initiation - 260 hours
 
 
 gds (ground data systems):
 
 1.  galileo participated in a second dsn (deep space network) acceptance test
 for the dsn telemetry phase 3 upgrade on april 13, 1993, using cta-21
 (compatibility test area 21).  the purpose of this test was to verify
 the flow of galileo telemetry data through the new telemetry group controller
 (tgc) and the telemetry channel assembly (tca).  the tgc/tca is the replacement
 for the current telemetry processing assembly (tpa).  seven different telemetry
 rates were run for this test; all ran well on both the mts (mccc telemetry
 subsystem) and the ammos mgds v18.0 gif with the exception of 10bps.  the
 10bps rate had some trouble staying in lock; it appears the tgc/tca was
 not metering the data correctly.  further comparisons between the mgds and mts
 data from this test are being conducted. mvt (mission verification test) of
 the tgc/tca system is expected to begin may 16, 1993.
 
 
 trajectory
 
      as of noon thursday, april 15, 1993, the galileo spacecraft trajectory
 status was as follows:
 
 	distance from earth         152,606,000 km (1.02 au)
 	distance from sun           277,519,800 km (1.86 au)
 	heliocentric speed          93,400 km per hour
 	distance from jupiter       543,973,900 km
 	round trip light time       17 minutes, 4 seconds
 
 
 special topic
 
 1.  as of april 15, 1993, a total of 70184 real-time commands have been
 transmitted to galileo since launch.  of these, 65076  were initiated in the
 sequence design process and 5108 initiated in the real-time command process.
 in the past week, 7 real time commands were transmitted: 6 were initiated in
 the sequence design process and one initiated in the real time command process.
 major command activities included commands to reacquire celestial reference,
 uplink the ej-1 sequence memory load, and reset the command loss timer.
