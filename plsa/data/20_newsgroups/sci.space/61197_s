 
 
 somebody mentioned  a re-boost of hst during this mission,  meaning
 that weight is a very tight  margin on this  mission.
 
 how will said re-boost be done?
 
 grapple, hst,  stow it in cargo bay,  do oms burn to high altitude,  
 
 unstow  hst,   repair  gyros,  costar install,  fix solar arrays,
 
 then return to earth?
 
 my guess is  why  bother with  usingthe shuttle to reboost?
 
 why not  grapple,  do all said fixes,   bolt a small  liquid  fueled
 thruster module  to  hst,   then let it make the re-boost.  it has to be
 cheaper on mass then usingthe shuttle as a tug.   that way, now that
 they are going to need at least 5  spacewalks,  then they can carry
 an edo pallet,  and  sit on station and even  maybe do the  solar array
 tilt  motor  fix.
