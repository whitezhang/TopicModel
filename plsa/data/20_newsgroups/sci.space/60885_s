 with the continuin talk about the "end of the space age" and complaints 
 by government over the large cost, why not try something i read about 
 that might just work.
 
 announce that a reward of $1 billion would go to the first corporation 
 who successfully keeps at least 1 person alive on the moon for a year. 
 then you'd see some of the inexpensive but not popular technologies begin 
 to be developed. there'd be a different kind of space race then!
