 i attended a colloquium at goddard last fall where the head of the 
 operations section of nasa was talking about what future missions
 were going to be funded.  i don't remember his name or title off hand
 and i have discarded the colloquia announcement. in any case, he was 
 asked about that very matter: "why can't we spend a few million more
 to keep instruments that we already have in place going?"
 
 his responce was that there are only so many $ available to him and
 the lead time on an instrument like a cobe, magellan, hubble, etc
 is 5-10 years minumum.  if he spent all that could be spent on using
 current instruments in the current budget enviroment he would have
 very little to nothing for future projects.  if he did that, sure
 in the short run the science would be wonderful and he would be popular,
 however starting a few years after he had retired he would become
 one of the greatest villans ever seen in the space community for not
 funding the early stages of the next generation of instruments.  just
 as he had benefited from his predicessor's funding choices, he owed it
 to whoever his sucessor would eventually be to keep developing new
 missions, even at the expense of cutting off some instruments before
 the last drop of possible science has been wrung out of them.
