 i'll vote for anything where they don't feel constrained to use stupid
 and ugly pc phrases to replace words like 'manned'.  if they think
 they need to do that, they're more than likely engaging in 'politics
 and public relations as usual' rather than seriously wanting to
 actually get into space.  so that eliminates option "a" from the
 running.  what do they call a manned station in option "c"?
 
 [i'm actually about half serious about that.  people should be more
 concerned with grammatical correctness and actually getting a working
 station than they are with 'political correctness' of terminology.]
