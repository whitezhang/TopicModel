 all consipiracy theories aside, (they are watching though :-)), will nasa 
 try to image the cydonia region of mars where the "face
 " is? if they can image it with the high resolution camera, it would 
 settle the face question once and for all. i mean, with a camera that 
 will have a pixel resolution of about 6 feet, we'd know whether all this 
 stuff is real or imagination. 
 
 come on jpl and nasa folks, try to image it and settle this thing.
