 from the pluto fast flyby instrument definition research anouncemnet,
 the instrument payload constraints are:
     mass allocation -  7 kilograms (15.4 lbs)
     power allocation - 6 watts
     required instruments:
 	visible imaging system (1024x1024 ccd, 750 mm fl, f/10 optics)
 	ir mapping spectrometer (256x256 hgcdte array, 0.3% energy resolution)
 	uv spectrometer (55-200 nm, 0.5 nm resolution)
 	radio science (ultrastable oscilator incorporated in telecom system)
 		ultrastable means 10^-14.
 
 this doesn't leave much room for payloads which are totally unrelated
 to the  mission of the spacecraft.  in addition, the power will come
 from a radioisotope thermal generator, and the whole space craft will
 be about 2 feet in diameter, with no booms, which means there will be
 strong gamma-lines from pu-239 and associated schmutz in the
 background, which tends to reduce sensitivity somewhat.
 
 it would still be nice, and our group here at goddard is looking
 in to it.
