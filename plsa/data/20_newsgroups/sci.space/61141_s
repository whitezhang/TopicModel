 cosmologist stephen hawking tours lab

      some 15 years after his first visit to jpl, prof. stephen
 hawking, lucasian professor of mathematics at cambridge
 university and author of "a brief history of time," returned to
 the lab april 5.
      on a tour hosted by jpl chief scientist dr. moustafa chahine
 and merle mckenzie, manager of the international affairs office,
 hawking visited a variety of facilities, met with lab director
 dr. edward stone and various project scientists and managers, and
 felt "like royalty," he said. hawking, whose theories attempt to
 explain the origin of distant galaxies, black holes and alternate
 dimensions, wanted to re-visit jpl, he explained, "because while
 i'm most interested in those things in space that are farther
 away, i know that here is where the first steps are taken."
      hawking, who was accompanied by his family, two graduate
 students and his aides, began the tour in von karman auditorium,
 as david evans, deputy assistant lab director in the office of
 flight projects, and dr. arden albee, mars observer's project
 scientist, briefed him on current and past flight projects.
      voyager was pointed out to him, with special attention paid
 to a gold plate with a series of engraved images. should
 extraterrestrial life stumble upon the spacecraft, evans noted,
 they would find a variety of images that would explain something
 of earth. the professor asked if we were still communicating with
 the spacecraft, and evans affirmed that we are.
      using a model of mars observer, albee spent several minutes
 describing the project and the spacecraft's features. in answer
 to a question from hawking, chahine described a proposed
 drag-free satellite, but confirmed that at this point, "it's only
 a concept." chahine, who had met hawking at caltech about five
 years before, described the professor as "a living miracle of the
 power of the brain. he's miraculous, and he has such a good sense
 of humor."
      the next stop, a demonstration on scientific data
 visualization in section 384's digital image animation lab,
 entertained and delighted the group, as everyone donned goggles
 to view 3-d images of mars. project scientist dr. eric de jong
 showed off the latest data -- a comet that had only recently been
 discovered in orbit close to jupiter. hawking was curious about
 its composition, and as he was shown how images are developed, he
 asked several questions on their interpretation.
      norman haynes, ald, office of telecommunications and data
 acquisition, briefed the professor on the space flight operations
 facility, and then hawking spoke with stone.
      the day ended with two technical discussions of particular
 interest to the professor. technical group leader dr. frank
 estabrook and senior research scientist hugo wahlquist described
 a three-spacecraft gravity wave experiment, currently under way.
 then planetary astronomer dr. richard terrile explained the
 philosophy and plans for extra solar system planetary detection.
      the hawking party, which had been visiting southern
 california for five weeks, was headquartered at caltech, and
 planned to leave for england within a few weeks after the lab
 tour. upon departing, the cambridge-based scientist promised
 chahine that he would return to jpl for another visit.
