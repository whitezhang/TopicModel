                      mission director status report
                                post-launch
                            april 16 - 22, 1993
 
 
 spacecraft
 
 1.  on april 19, cruise science memory readouts (mros) were performed for the
 extreme ultraviolet spectrometer (euv), dust detector (dds), and magnetometer
 (mag) instruments.  preliminary analysis indicates the data was received
 properly.
 
 2.  on april 19, a command detector unit signal-to-noise ratio (cdusnr) test
 and a radio frequency subsystem automatic gain control (rfsagc) test were
 performed using the lga-1 (low gain antenna #1) over dss-63 (madrid 70 meter
 antenna) and dss-61 (madrid 34 meter antenna), respectively.  data analysis
 is in process.  these tests are periodically performed to provide detailed
 information relative to the telecom command hardware integrity.
 
 3.  on april 19, a no-op command was sent to reset the command loss timer to
 264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.
 
 4.  on april 21, the first of two suppressed carrier/dsn (deep space network)
 advanced receiver characterization tests was performed over dss-14 (goldstone
 70 meter antenna).  the spacecraft modulation index was varied from 43 degrees
 to 90 degrees for a range of ground receiver bandwidth settings.
 
 5.  the ac bus imbalance measurement has not exhibited significant change
 (greater than 25 dn) throughout this period but the dc bus imbalance
 measurement has.  the ac measurement reads 20 dn (4.5 volts).  the dc
 measurement has ranged from 43 dn (4.6 volts) to 138 dn (16.2 volts) and
 currently reads 138 dn (16.2 volts).  these measurements are consistent with
 the model developed by the ac/dc special anomaly team.
 
 6.  the spacecraft status as of april 22, 1993, is as follows:
 
        a)  system power margin -  68 watts
        b)  spin configuration - dual-spin
        c)  spin rate/sensor - 3.15rpm/star scanner
        d)  spacecraft attitude is approximately 21 degrees
            off-sun (lagging) and 5 degrees off-earth (leading)
        e)  downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps(coded)/lga-1
        f)  general thermal control - all temperatures within
            acceptable range
        g)  rpm tank pressures - all within acceptable range
        h)  orbiter science- instruments powered on are the pws,
            euv, uvs, epd, mag, hic, and dds
        i)  probe/rrh - powered off, temperatures within
            acceptable range
        j)  cmd loss timer setting - 264 hours
            time to initiation - 184 hours
 
 
 trajectory
 
      as of noon thursday, april 22, 1993, the galileo spacecraft trajectory
 status was as follows:
 
 	distance from earth         169,747,800 km (1.14 au)
 	distance from sun           286,967,900 km (1.92 au)
 	heliocentric speed          91,200 km per hour
 	distance from jupiter       532,735,900 km
 	round trip light time       18 minutes, 58 seconds
 
 
 special topic
 
 1.  as of april 22, 1993, a total of 70185 real-time commands have been
 transmitted to galileo since launch.  of these, 65077  were initiated in the
 sequence design process and 5108 initiated in the real-time command process.
 in the past week, one real time command was transmitted: one was initiated in
 the sequence design process and none initiated in the real time command
 process. the only command activity was a command to reset the command loss
 timer.
