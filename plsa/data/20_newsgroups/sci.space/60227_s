 if comet shoemaker-levy 1993e is in jovian orbit, and if the comet
 is still hanging around when galileo arrives, then i'm sure it will
 be added to the list of targets.  we'll have by then over two years
 of earth-based observations to help narrow down the positions of the
 pieces of the comet. it probably won't be too much different than
 what was done with gaspra.

 galileo did not image toutatis.  that came from earth-based radar.
