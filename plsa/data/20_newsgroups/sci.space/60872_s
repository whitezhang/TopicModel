 if i read you right, you're saying in essence that, with a larger
 economy, nations will have more discretionary funds to *waste*
 on a lunar facility. that was certainly partially the case with apollo, 
 but real lunar colonies will probably require a continuing military,
 scientific, or commercial reason for being rather than just a "we have 
 the money, why not?" approach.
 
 it's conceivable that luna will have a military purpose, it's possible
 that luna will have a commercial purpose, but it's most likely that
 luna will only have a scientific purpose for the next several hundred
 years at least. therefore, lunar bases should be predicated on funding
 levels little different from those found for antarctic bases. can you
 put a 200 person base on the moon for $30 million a year? even if you
 use grad students?
