 yes, the phobos mission did return some useful data including images of phobos
 itself. the best i've seen had a surface resolution of about 40 meters. by
 the way, the new book entitled "mars" (kieffer et al, 1992, university of
 arizona press) has a great chapter on spacecraft exploration of the planet.
 the chapter is co-authored by v.i. moroz of the space research institute in
 moscow, and includes details never before published in the west. don't
 know of any ftp sites with images though.
