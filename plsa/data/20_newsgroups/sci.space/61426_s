 "the forever war", one of my favorite scifi books, had a passage devoted to 
 breathing fluids. the idea was to protect people from the high accelerations 
 required for interstellar travel by emersing the passengers in dry-cleaning 
 fluid saturated with oxygen. plenty of very imaginative ideas is this book.
 i would certainly recommend it (won the hugo and the nebula awards).
