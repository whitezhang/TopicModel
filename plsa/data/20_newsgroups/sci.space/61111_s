 i aint talking the large or even the "mining companies" i am talking the small
 miners, the people who have themselves and a few employees (if at all).the
 people who go out every year and set up thier sluice box, and such and do
 mining the semi-old fashion way.. (okay they use modern methods toa point).
 
 i am talking the guy who coem to nome evry year, sets up his tent on the beach
 (the beach was washed away last year) and sets up his/her sluice box and goes
 at it "mining".
 i know the large corps, such as alaska gold company, might complain to..
 
 my opinions are what i learn at the local bs table..
 
 my original thing/idea was that the way to get space mining was to allow the
 eco-freaks thier way.. as they have done with other mineral development.
 you can't in many places can't go to the bathroom in the woods without some
 form of regulation covering it..
