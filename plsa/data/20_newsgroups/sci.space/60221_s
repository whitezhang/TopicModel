 how is it ever going to be an off- the shelf technology if someone doesn't
 do it?  maybe we should do this as part of the ssf design goals. ;-)
 
 gee fred.  after your bitter defense of 20 khz power as a basic technology
 for ssf, id think you would support a minor research program like this.
 
 and does anyone who knows more particle physics then me,  know if the ipns
 could prove this technology?

 it may also help there is political gridlock on the entire
 nuclear technical agenda.  there were big political opponenents to
 fast breeder technologies.  wipp is being fought to death in courts.
 even if you could make a nuclear incinerator, do you really think
 even deaf smith county nevada would accept it?  nimby'ism rules
 nuclear power concerns.  only the medical community has been
 able to overrule  nuclear  technology opposition.
