 so how much mass is saved by not burning the oms?  that's the critical question.
 my data shows that the oms engines hold 10,900 kg of propellant.  of that, a 
 substantial fraction is going to be used for the first oms burn, the reentry
 burn and the reserve.  so pat, tell us how much fuel the altitude change is
 going to take, and how much the edo pallet, bus-1 and extra parts are going
 mass.  if you can make the numbers work out, _then_ i'll be interested.  after
 you show us that it can be done, then tell us how much the edo pallet, bus-1
 and extra equipment is going to cost.

 first, while astronauts certainly have done evas with minimal planning, that was
 because they _had_ to.  they don't like to do that as a general rule.
 
 second, remember why they had to improvise during intelsat 6?  they were trying
 to attach a motor to a piece of hardware that wasn't designed to do that.  
 trying to shortcut the training is only going to make a repeat more likely.
 
 third, they don't have eight months.  they have however much time is left 
 after someone comes up with a plan, shows it can work and gets it approved.
 you may think i have a pessimistic attitude.  i think it's realistic.  i'm not
 saying that the engineering task is impossible (few engineering tasks are).  
 what i'm saying is that this is neither cost effective nor feasible under nasa
 management.

 "all they have to do is soup it up?"  just what does that mean?

 the second servicing mission is a contingency.  you have neither shown that it
 would be necessary without your plan nor that it would be unnecessary with your
 plan.

 no, pat, i haven't forgotten.

 no pat.  that's $500 million minus the cost of the new hardware, minus the cost
 of the extra struff you want to bring along, minus development and mangement 
 costs, minus extra operating costs.  tanstaafl.

 i'm sure that if you reread this you'll see that your argument is falacious.

 pat, not only is this messy and less reliable than a device that's _made_ to 
 perform this task, it also ignores the point.  there is a desire to have 
 astronauts available so that if the door fails to open, something can be done
 about it.  unless you can provide a very reliable way of reopening the door,
 you haven't solved the problem.
