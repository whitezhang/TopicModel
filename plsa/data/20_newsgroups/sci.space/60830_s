 > there is no such thing as a stable lunar orbit
 
 is it right??? that is new stuff for me. so it means that  you just can 
 not put a sattellite around around the moon for too long because its 
 orbit will be unstable??? if so, what is the reason??? is that because 
 the combined gravitacional atraction of the sun,moon and earth 
 that does not provide a stable  orbit around the moon???
