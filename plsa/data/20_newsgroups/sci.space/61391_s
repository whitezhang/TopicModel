 i'm not sure if this is a big issue, but it seems to me like it
 might be -- up till now, all >1g forces applied to the mirror and
 its mounting (and nearly all =1g forces) have been applied along the
 telescope's optical axis, and against the mirror's base.  reentry
 would apply forces along roughly the same axis, but tending to pull
 the mirror away from the mount, and the landing would apply on-edge
 forces to both the mirror and mount.  it could be that one or both
 of these would not survive.
