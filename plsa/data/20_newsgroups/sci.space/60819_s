 >  now where did i leave those pliers?
     when workers at the kennedy space center disassembled the sts-56
  solid rocket boosters they were surprised to find a pair of pliers
  lodged into the outside base of the right hand srb.  the tool survived
  the trip from the launch pad up to approximately a 250,000 foot
  altitude, then down to splashdown and towing back to ksc.
 
     nasa spokesperson lisa malone told the media,
 
     "it's been a long time since something like this happened.  we've
  lost washers and bolts (before) but never a tool like this."
 
     the initial investigation into the incident has shown that a
  thiokol corp. technician noticed and reported his pliers as missing on
  april 2nd.  unfortunately, the worker's supervisor did not act on the
  report and discovery was launched with its "extra payload".  nasa
  officials were never told of the missing tool before the april 8th
  launch date.
 
     the free-flying pliers were supposed to be tethered to the srb
  technician.  when the tool was found in an aft section of the booster,
  its 18-inch long rope was still attached.  the pliers were found in a
  part of the booster which is not easily visible from the launch pad.

     a spokesperson for the lockheed space operations company said that
  the shuttle processor will take "appropriate action".  thiokol is a
  subcontractor to lsoc for work to prepare shuttle hardware for launch.
