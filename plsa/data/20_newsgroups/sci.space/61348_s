 i don't think touting contributions is a good idea.  world war ii produced
 many many beneficial spinoffs.  eg. radar, jet aeroplanes, rocket technology.
 i don't think anyone would argue that world war ii was, in and of itself,
 a good thing.
 
 if you want people to back the space program it must be a good thing in
 and of itself.
