 well, if you're going to get upset with this, you might as well direct
 some of this moral outrage towards glavcosmos as well.  they pioneered
 this capitalist application of booster adverts long before nasa.

 this sounds like something lowell wood would think of.  does anyone
 know if he's involved?

 this may be the purpose for the university of colorado people.  my
 guess is that the purpose for the livermore people is to learn how to
 build large, inflatable space structures.

 if this is true, i think it's a great idea.
 
 learning how to build to build structures in space in an essential
 step towards space development, and given that freedom appears to be
 shrinking towards the vanishing point, i question whether nasa's space
 station is going to provide much, if any, knowledge in this area.
 (especially if a design such as faget's wingless orbiter is chosen...)
 if such a project also monitors ozone depletion and demonstrates
 creative use of (partial) private sector funding in the process -- so
 much the better.
 
 >is nasa really supporting this junk?
 
 and does anyone have any more details other than what was in the wn
 news blip?  how serious is this project?  is this just in the "wild
 idea" stage or does it have real funding?
 
 >are protesting groups being organized in the states?
 
 not yet.  though, if this project goes through, i suppose the return
 of jeremy rifkin is inevitable...
