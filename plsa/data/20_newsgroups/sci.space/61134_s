 lot's of these small miners  are no longer miners.  they are people living
 rent free on federal land,  under the claim of being a miner.  the facts are
 many of these people do not sustaint heir income from mining,  do not
 often even live their full time,  and do fotentimes do a fair bit
 of environmental damage.
 
 these minign statutes were created inthe 1830's-1870's  when the west was
 uninhabited  and were designed to bring people into the frontier.  times change
 people change.  deal.  you don't have a constitutional right to live off
 the same industry forever.  anyone who claims the have a right to their
 job in particular,  is spouting nonsense.   this has been a long term
 federal welfare program,  that has outlived it's usefulness.
