 |nope.  the decisive triumph of the area rule was when convair's yf-102 --
 |contractually commmitted to being a mach 1.5 fighter and actually found
 |to be incapable of going supersonic in level flight -- was turned into
 |the area-ruled yf-102a which met the specs.  this was well before either
 |the 727 or the fb-111; the 102 flew in late 1953, and convair spent most
 |of the first half of 1954 figuring out what went wrong and most of the
 |second half building the first 102a.

 good thing i stuck in a couple of question marks up there.
 
 i seem to recall, somebody built  or at least proposed a wasp waisetd
 passenger civil transport.  i thought it was a 727,  but maybe it
 was a dc- 8,9???   sure it had a funny passenger compartment,
 but on the other hand  it seemed to save fuel.
 
 i thought area rules  applied even before transonic speeds,  just
 not as badly.
