 i just posted the gif files out for anonymous ftp on server ics.uci.edu.
 you can retrieve them from:

   ics.uci.edu:incoming/geodea.gif
   ics.uci.edu:incoming/geodeb.gif
 
 the last two are scanned color photos; the others are scanned briefing
 charts.
 
 these will be deleted by the ics.uci.edu system manager in a few days,
 so now's the time to grab them if you're interested.  sorry it took
 me so long to get these out, but i was trying for the ames server,
 but it's out of space.
