 try doing a keyword search under gopher using veronica or accessing a 
 world wide web server. also finger yanoff@csd4.csd.uwm.edu for a list
 of internet resources which includes 2-3 sites with space-specific 
 information. i am sure ron baalke will have told you about what is
 available at jpl etc..
