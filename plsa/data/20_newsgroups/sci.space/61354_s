 you can do a whole hell of a lot better than 2 or 3 degrees with
 the differential timing measurements from the interplanetary network.
 ignore the directional information from batse; just look at the time
 of arrival.  with three detectors properly arranged, one can often
 get positions down to ~arc minutes.
 
 btw, about oort cloud sources: shouldn't this be testable in the
 fairly near future?  some of the grbs have very short rise times (< 1
 ms).  we could detect the curvature of the burst wavefront out to a
 distance of on the order of b^2/(t c) where b is the detector spacing
 and t the time resolution.  for t = 1 ms and b = 2 au, this is on the
 order of 16 light years.  i understand statistics will reduce this
 number considerably, as would geometry if the burst is coming from the
 wrong direction.
