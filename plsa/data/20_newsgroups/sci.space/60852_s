 we are not at the end of the space age, but only at the end of its
 beginning.
 
 that space exploration is no longer a driver for technical innovation,
 or a focus of american cultural attention is certainly debatable; however,
 technical developments in other quarters will always be examined for
 possible applications in the space area and we can look forward to
 many innovations that might enhance the capabilities and lower the
 cost of future space operations. 
 
 the dream is alive and well.
