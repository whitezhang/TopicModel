 i am afraid you are mis-directed. nextstep is an operating system as opposed to 
 a package. i have read a little about it but since steve jobs does not seem to 
 have the marketing capabilities of bill gates my info. is limited. probably why
 the far inferior windows nt is going to be more widely distributed (but that
 is another flame-ridden story). some of the innovative features of nextstep are
 binary compatibility across platforms (eg you can just copy your program from
 a sparc to a pc and it would run, as opposed to buying the version of the package
 ported to a pc), graphical object-oriented design (its all wsiwig postscript), 
 supports parallel hetrogeneous processing, and best of all it is based around 
 the mach micro-kernel so you can make it look like unix with x, or dos, or nt or 
 even vms if you feel the need. no package out there comes even close. i hope 
 people will subscribe to the hyperknowledge project and nextstep finally
 takes off in my lifetime :-)
