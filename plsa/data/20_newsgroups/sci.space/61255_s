 actually, both numbers are correct.  the difference is in the direction
 of the acceleration.  for pilots, accelerations tend to be transverse to
 the direction you're facing (pulling out from a steep dive, the
 acceleration will force blood toward your feet, for instance).  in this
 case, you can only put up with about 8 g's even with a pressure suit.  
 
 the record for acceleration, though, is measured along "the direction
 you're facing" (for lack of a better term).  as i recall, this record
 was set in rocket sleds back in the 60's -- and was about 40 g's or so.
