 this was known as *journey to the far side of the sun* in the united
 states and as *doppelganger* in the u.k.  it was produced by the great
 team of gerry and sylvia anderson (whose science was usually a bit
 better than this).  it may have been their first production using live
 actors-- they were better known for their technophilic puppet shows,
 such as *supercar*, *stingray*, and *thunderbirds*.  later, they went
 on to do more live-action sf series: *ufo* and *space: 1999*.
 
 the astronomy was lousy, but the lifting-body spacecraft, vtol
 airliners, and mighty portugese launch complex were *wonderful* to
 look at.
