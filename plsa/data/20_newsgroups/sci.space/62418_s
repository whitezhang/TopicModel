 1. please take this out of sci.space.
 
 2. ayn rand was not only born in russia, but educated there. a lot
 of her philosophy reflects not only a european education but a 
 reaction against certian events in russia while she lived there.
 i've heard that to the extent there is a division of modern philosophy
 between the "continental" and british/american schools, rand belongs in
 the former in terms of methodology et al, even though she was trying to
 say things that would belong in the latter school.
 
 i.e. she was trapped in the language of kant and hegel, even though
 she was trying to say (at times) much different things.
