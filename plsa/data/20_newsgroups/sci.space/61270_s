 _five weeks in a balloon_. not a good idea unless you have helium.
 verne's protagonists didn't. they just got increadibly lucky.
 
 and yes, i knew the title of the movie too, just didn't want to start
 talking about it. except to bring up the image of a team of s. african
 bushmen showing up at a launch site with spears and flint knives
 to stop the launch (anyone want to bet on their success in doing so?
 especially since they could probably stop a shuttle launch by sneezing
 too hard within a couple miles of the launch site).
