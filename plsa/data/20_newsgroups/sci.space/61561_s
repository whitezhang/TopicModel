 well, no, during the original deployment mission the hst aperture door was
 not opened until after the shuttle had landed.  
 
 i presume that during a re-boost mission hst would be berthed in the orbiter
 with the orbiter bay doors shut; but still there would be lots of contamination
 worries.  i understand that the eva suits are one of the hardest things to 
 keep clean.
 
 but i still don't know where the idea is coming from that hst _needs_ a
 re-boost.  we have many problems but our orbit is the least of them.  there
 is certainly no plan to change the orbit in the first servicing mission in
 december.
