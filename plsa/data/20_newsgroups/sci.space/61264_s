 lets hear it for dan goldin...now if he can only convince the rest of
 our federal government that the space program is a worth while
 investment!
 
 i hope that i will live to see the day we walk on mars, but
 we need to address the technical hurdles first!  if there's sufficient
 interest, maybe we should consider starting a sci.space group 
 devoted to the technical analysis of long-duration human spaceflight.
 most of you regulars know that i'm interested in starting this analysis
 as soon as possible.
