 	i am puzzled by the term "concept." drag free may already have
 been flown. it was the idea behind putting up a spacecraft that would
 more accurately respond to motions from the earth's gravity field and
 ignore drag. it was proposed many years ago and involved a ball
 floating between sensors whose job it was to signal to little
 adjustment jets to keep the ball away from them. the ball itself would
 then be in a drag free condition and respond only to gravity
 anisotropies, whereas the spacecraft itself would be continuously
 adjusting its position to compensate for drag.
