     this notice will be posted weekly in sci.space, sci.astro, and
 sci.space.shuttle.
 
     the frequently asked questions (faq) list for sci.space and sci.astro is
 posted approximately monthly. it also covers many questions that come up on
 sci.space.shuttle (for shuttle launch dates, see below).
 
     the faq is posted with a long expiration date, so a copy may be in your
 news spool directory (look at old articles in sci.space). if not, here are
 two ways to get a copy without waiting for the next posting:
 
     (1) if your machine is on the internet, it can be obtained by anonymous
 ftp from the space archive at ames.arc.nasa.gov (128.102.18.3) in directory
 pub/space/faq.
 
     (2) otherwise, send email to 'archive-server@ames.arc.nasa.gov'
 containing the single line:
 
 help
 
     the archive server will return directions on how to use it. to get an
 index of files in the faq directory, send email containing the lines:
 
 send space faq/index
 send space faq/faq1
 
     use these files as a guide to which other files to retrieve to answer
 your questions.
 
     shuttle launch dates are posted by ken hollis periodically in
 sci.space.shuttle. a copy of his manifest is now available in the ames
 archive in pub/space/faq/manifest and may be requested from the email
 archive-server with 'send space faq/manifest'. please get this document
 instead of posting requests for information on launches and landings.
