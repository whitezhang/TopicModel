    problem with 3he (aside from the difficulty in making any fusion
    reactor work) is that its concentration in lunar regolith is just so
    small -- on the order of 5 ppb or so, on average (more in some
 
    this thread reminds me of wingo's claims some time ago about the moon
    as a source of titanium for use on earth.  as i recall, wingo wasn't
  ...
    even 1% of the basalts are 5% tio2, this is trillions of tons of tio2
    at concentrations only a factor of 2-3 less than in lunar high-ti
    basalts.  it is difficult to see how the disadvantages of the moon
    could be overcome by such a small increase the concentration of the
    ore (never mind the richer, but less common, terrestrial ores being
    mined today).
 
 why paul, it's obvious.
 once chlorine chemistry has been banned on earth,
 as is being advocated by some groups, ti prices will
 sharply increase (we are of course not allowed to
 assume any developments in ti processing).
 lunar ti will then be eminently competitive for
 the trendy jewelry market and certain applications
 of national importance 
 
 :-) :-) :-) 
 
 
 (oops, this is sci.space... wrong rules of debate ;-)
 
 
 seriously, i'd say there is a flaw in gary's analysis
 in that he assumes an export oriented economy, maybe
 the lunatics will just want some native ti for local
 use... as to why lunar natives are cost effective, 
 analysis has shown they will be critical in providing
 a sheltered manufacturing base, technological innovation,
 critical materials and manpower in the war between
 the allies and central powers in about two hundred years...
