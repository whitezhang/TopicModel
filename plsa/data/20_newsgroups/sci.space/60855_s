 kerry-- i'm guessing a little at this, because it's been a few years 
 since i saw the info, but you will probably want to look at air defense 
 artillery as a specialty, or possibly signals.  the kind of thing you're 
 looking for is sdi-type assignments, but it'll be pretty prosaic stuff.
 things like hard-kill atbm missiles, some of the cobra rigs -- that kind 
 of thing.  
 
 hope that gives you some ideas on where to look, though.
