 the nasm photo archives are open to the public.  all (or almost all)
 still pictures in the collection are available for viewing, but i
 don't know about films.  at least it might be worth a try.  i'm not
 sure if appointments are necessary, but i think not.
 
 good luck, and let us know what you find.
