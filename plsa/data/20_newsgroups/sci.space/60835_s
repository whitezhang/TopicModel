 an excellent reference for non-technical readers on the orion system is
 "the starflight handbook", by eugene mallove and gregory matloff, isbn
 0-471-61912-4. the relevant chapter is 4: nuclear pulse propulsion.
 
 the book also contains lots of technical references for the more academically
 inclined. 
 
 enjoy!
