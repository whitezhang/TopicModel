 
 some time ago i sent the following message:
    every once in a while i design an orbital space colony.  i'm gearing up to
    do another one.  i'd some info from you. if you were to move
    onto a space colony to live permanently, how big would the colony have
    to be for you to view a permanent move as desirable?  specifically,
 
    how many people do you want to share the colony with?
  
 
    what physical dimensions does the living are need to have?  
 
 
    assume 1g living (the colony will rotate).  assume that you can leave
    from time to time for vacations and business trips.  if you're young
    enough, assume that you'll raise your children there.
 
 i didn't get a lot of responses, and they were all over the block.
 thanx muchly to all those who responded, it is good food for thought.
 
 
 
 
 here's the (edited) responses i got:
 
 
    how many people do you want to share the colony with?
  
 100
 
    what physical dimensions does the living are need to have?  
 
 cylinder 200m diameter x 1 km long

 100 square kms surface, divided into city, towns, villages and
 countryside.  must have lakes, rivers amd mountains.

 1000.  1000 people really isn't that large a number;
 everyone will know everyone else within the space of a year, and will probably
 be sick of everyone else within another year.

 hm.  i am not all that great at figuring it out.  but i would maximize the
 percentage of colony-space that is accessible to humans.  esecially if there
 were to be children, since they will figure out how to go everywhere anyways.
 and everyone, especially me, likes to "go exploring"...i would want to be able
 to go for a walk and see something different each time...

 for population, i think i would want a substantial town -- big enough
 to have strangers in it.  this helps get away from the small-town
 "everybody knows everything" syndrome, which some people like but
 i don't.  call it several thousand people.
 
 for physical dimensions, a somewhat similar criterion:  big enough
 to contain surprises, at least until you spent considerable time
 getting to know it.  as a more specific rule of thumb, big enough
 for there to be places at least an hour away on foot.  call that
 5km, which means a 10km circumference if we're talking a sphere.

 my desires, for permanent move to a space colony, assuming easy communication
 and travel:
 
 size:  about a small-town size, say 9 sq. km.  'course, bigger is better :-)
 population:  about 100/sq km or less.  so, ~1000 for 9sqkm.  less is
 better for elbow room, more for interest and sanity, so say max 3000, min 300.
