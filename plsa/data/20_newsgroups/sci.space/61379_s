 i too am a jules verne collector, and can tell you that though tough 
 to find, it *is* out there.  i keep my eyes open all the time for his
 books at various bay area used book stores, and every once in a while
 get *very* lucky.  you just need diligence.  i don't know if the book
 store situation near jsc is as good as the bay area, but good luck.
 i have also had excellent luck at the antiquarian book fair which comes
 to sf every other year, though the prices are more in the $100-$200 range
 than the $50 you want to spend.  my guess is that *if* you find it,
 you won't need to spend even that much, since most people don't care 
 about it.  i think i paid about $15 for my dust-jacket-less but otherwise
 good condition copy, which i found one day at a small bookshop that happened
 to have just bought a lot of random books at an estate sale.  
 
 of course, if you re willing to buy blind, you can put a $2 advertisement
 in the antiquarian bookseller's newsletter (the exact title of which escapes
 me at the moment.)  _five weeks in a balloon_ is not the rarest of jules
 verne books.  someone has it for sale somewhere, and the ab is the way to 
 find it.  in fact, i would be surprised if you didn't get multiple offers
 of sale.  of course, that takes the fun out of hunting for it yourself...
 
 good luck.
