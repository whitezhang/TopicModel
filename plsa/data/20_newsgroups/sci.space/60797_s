 i heard a similar statement in our local news (utah) tonight. they referred
 to the tool as "...the pliers that took a ride into space...". they also
 said that a thiokol (sp?) employee had reported missing a tool of some kind
 during assembly of one srb. no more info as to the location in the srb.
 i agree, pretty weird.
