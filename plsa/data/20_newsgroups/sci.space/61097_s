 no.  the idea was suggested around here during discussions of possible
 near-term commercial space activities.  one of the folks involved in those
 discussions, a
 spacecraft engineer named preston carter, passed the suggestion on to 
 some entreprenurial types, and mike lawson is apparently going ahead with
 it.  preston is now at llnl, and is working with space marketing on 
 the sensors that might be carried.

 actually, that sounds unlikely.  i don't know what the launch vehicle
 would be, but i would expect it to go on a commercial launcher --
 certainly not on the shuttle -- and the fraction of the cost paid to nasa
 for, e.g.,  launch support would probably 
 cover nasa's incremental costs pretty well.

 no, as noted, llnl is involved in lightweight sensor design, per 
 clementine and related programs.  i'm sure folks around here would like to 
 see a demonstration of a modern inflatable structure, but after all, 
 the u.s. did the echo satellites long ago, and an advertising structure
 would not be much closer to an inflatable space station than echo was
 (or a parade balloon, for that matter).

 while i happen to personally dislike the idea, mostly because i've got
 a background in astronomy, it's hardly vandalism -- it would be a short-lived
 intrusion on the night sky, doing no permanent damage and actually hurting
 only a small subset of astronomers.  on the other hand, it would certainly
 draw attention to space.

 which, unfortunately, this is not likely to contribute much to.

 as far as i know, it's a purely commercial venture.

 i gather it is being very seriously discussed with possible advertisers.
 commercial projects, however, generally don't get "funding" -- they
 get "customers" -- whether it will have customers remains to be seen.

 nahh.  he's too busy watching for mutant bacteria to notice anything in
