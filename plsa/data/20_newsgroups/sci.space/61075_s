 the balloons were in sufficiently low orbit that they experienced
 some air resistance.  when they were finally punctured, this 
 preasure (and the internal preasure that was needed to maintain
 a spherical shape against this resistance) caused them to
 catastrophically deflated.  the large silvered shards
 that remained were easily visible for some time before
 reentry, though no longer useful as a passive transponder.
 
 the billboard should pop like a dime store balloon.
