 well, pardon me for trying to continue the discussion rather than just
 tugging my forelock in dismay at having not considered actually trying
 to recover the energy from this process (which is at least trying to
 go the 'right' way on the energy curve).  now, where *did* i put those
 sackcloth and ashes?

 note that i didn't say it was perpetual motion, or even that it
 sounded like perpetual motion; the phrase was "sounds almost like
 perpetual motion", which i, at least, consider a somewhat different
 propposition than the one you elect to criticize.  perhaps i should
 beg your pardon for being *too* precise in my use of language?

 i will believe that this process comes even close to approaching
 technological and economic feasibility (given the mixed nature of the
 trash that will have to be run through it as opposed to the costs of
 separating things first and having a different 'run' for each
 actinide) when i see them dump a few tons in one end and pull
 (relatively) clean material out the other.  once the costs,
 technological risks, etc., are taken into account i still class this
 one with the idea of throwing waste into the sun.  sure, it's possible
 and the physics are well understood, but is it really a reasonable
 approach? 
 
 and i still wonder at what sort of 'burning' rate you could get with
 something like this, as opposed to what kind of energy you would
 really recover as opposed to what it would cost to build and power
 with and without the energy recovery.  are we talking ounces, pounds,
 or tons (grams, kilograms, or metric tons, for you si fans) of
 material and are we talking days, weeks, months, or years (days,
 weeks, months or years, for you si fans -- hmmm, still using a
 non-decimated time scale, i see  ;-))?
