 i am a newbie to the net, and i am trying to get some information for a paper
 i am working on to get back into college.  if anyone can send me data on
 solar coronal holes and recurrant aurora  for the past thirty years it would be
 a big help.  or, if you have information on more esoteric things like telluric
 current, surge bafflers power companies use, or other effects sporatic aurora
 have on the earth's magnetic field, i'd be eternally gratefull.  please send 
 anything interesting to me at
