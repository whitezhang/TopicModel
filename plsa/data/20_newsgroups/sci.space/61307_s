    i didn't want to quote all the stuff that's been said recently, i
 just wanted to add a point.
 
    the whole question of "a right to a dark sky" revolves around the
 definition of a right.  moral rights and natural rights are all well and
 good, but as far as i can see, a right is whatever you or someone
 representing you can enforce.  in most civilizations, the government or
 the church (or both) defines what the rights of the citizens are, and
 then enforces those rights for them.  here in the u.s., the constitution
 provides a "bill of rights" from which most if not all legal rights are
 considered to derive.  i'm sure that most other countries have
 comparable documents.  if you can persuade a court that you have a right
 to a dark sky derived in some manner from the bill of rights (in the
 u.s.), you can prevent (maybe) these billboards from being launched.  to
 keep anyone in the world from launching then gets into international law
 and the international court of justice (correct name?) in the hague,
 something i know little about.
