    i saw in the newspaper last night that dr. mae jemison, the first
 black woman in space (she's a physician and chemical engineer who flew
 on endeavour last year) will appear as a transporter operator on the
 "star trek: the next generation" episode that airs the week of may 31.
 it's hardly space science, i know, but it's interesting.
