 dennis, i have worked on or written proposals worth tens of millions
 of $$. customers included government (including nasa), for profit and
 non-profit companies. all expected a wrap (usually called a fee). much
 of the work involved allocating and costing the work of subcontractors.
 the subcontractors where universities, for-profits, non-profits, and
 even some of the nasa centers for the commercialization of space. all
 charged fees as part of the work. down the street is one of the nasa
 commercialization centers; they charge a fee.
 
 now, i'm sure your a competent engineer dennis, but you clearly lack
 experience in several areas. your posts show that you don't understand
 the importance of integration in large projects. you also show a lack
 of understanding of costing efforts as shown by your belief that it
 is reasonable to charge incremental costs for everything. this isn't
 a flame, jsut a statement.
 
 your employer does charge a fee. you may not see it but you do.

 well there you are dennis. as i said, they simply include the fee in
 their overhead. many seoparate the fee since the fee structure can
 change depending on the customer.

 integration, dennis, isn't overhead.

 dennis, reston has been the only nasa agency working to reduce costs. when
 wp 02 was hemoraging out a billion $$, the centers you love so much where
 doing their best to cover it up and ignore the problem. reston was the
 only place you would find people actually interested in solving the
 problems and building a station.

 when you have a bit more experience dennis, you will realize that
 integration isn't overhead. it is the single most important part
 of a successful large scale effort.

 the story you refer to said that some nasa people blamed it on
 congress. suprise suprise. the fact remains that it is the centers
 you support so much who covered up the overheads and wouldn't address
 the problems until the press published the story.
 
 are you saying the reston managers where wrong to get nasa to address
 the overruns? you approve of what the centers did to cover up the overruns?

 you should know dennis that nasa doesn't include transport costs for
 resuply. that comes from the shuttle budget. what they where saying
 is that operational costs could be cut in half plus transport.

 i do hope you can find the time to tell us just why it was wrong of
 reston to ask that the problems with wp 02 be addressed.
