 wanted:  optical shaft encoders
 
 quantity 2
 single-ended
 incremental
 
 needed to encode the movements of a 16" cassegrain telescope.  the telescope
 is in the observatory of the univ. of mass. at boston.  the project is being
 managed by mr. george tucker, a graduate student at umb.  please call him, or
 email/call me, if you have one or two of the specified type of encoder.  of
 course, due to our low funding level we are looking for a price that is
 sufficiently lower than that given for new encoders.  :)
