 this isn't inherently bad.
 
 this isn't really light pollution since it will only
 be visible shortly before or after dusk (or during the
 day).
 
 (of course, if night only lasts 2 hours for you, you're probably going
 to be inconvienenced. but you're inconvienenced anyway in that case).
 
 finally: this isn't the bronze age, and most of us aren't indo
 european; those people speaking indo-eurpoean languages often have
 much non-indo-european ancestry and cultural background. so:
 please try to remember that there are more human activities than
 those practiced by the warrior caste, the farming caste, and the
 priesthood.
 
 and why act distressed that someone's found a way to do research
 that doesn't involve socialism?
 
 it certianly doesn't mean we deserve to die.
