 actually, there are people who will tell you that it *would* be enough
 to do ssto development, if done privately as a cut-rate operation.  of
 course, they may be over-optimistic.
 
 you can also assume that a working ssto would have other applications
 that would help pay for its development costs.
 
 i'd be inclined to make the prize somewhat larger, but $1g might be enough.
