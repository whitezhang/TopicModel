 > another legend with the name vulcan was the planet, much like earth,
 > in the same orbit
 
 there was a science fiction movie sometime ago (i do not remember its 
 name) about a planet in the same orbit of earth but hidden behind the 
 sun so it could never be visible from earth. turns out that that planet 
 was the exact mirror image of earth and all its inhabitants looked like 
 the earthings with the difference that their organs was in the opposite 
 side like the heart was in the right side instead in the left and they 
 would shake hands with the left hand and so on...
