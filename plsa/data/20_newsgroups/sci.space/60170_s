 suppose the soviets had managed to get their moon rocket working
 and had made it first.  they could have beaten us if either:
 
 * their rocket hadn't blown up on the pad thus setting them back,
 
 and/or
 
 * a saturn v went boom.
 
 if they had beaten us, i speculate that the us would have gone
 head and done some landings, but we also would have been more
 determined to set up a base (both in earth orbit and on the
 moon).  whether or not we would be on mars by now would depend
 upon whether the soviets tried to go.  setting up a lunar base
 would have stretched the budgets of both nations and i think
 that the military value of a lunar base would outweigh the value
 of going to mars (at least in the short run).  thus we would
 have concentrated on the moon.
