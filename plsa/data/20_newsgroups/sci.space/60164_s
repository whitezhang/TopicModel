 definitely! in one of the reports of an early test conducted by rocketdyne at 
 their santa susanna field lab ("the hill" above the san fernando and simi 
 valleys), the result of a hung start was described as "structural failure" of 
 the combustion chamber.  the inspection picture showed pumps with nothing below
 , the cc had vaporized!  this was described in a class i took as a "typical
 engineering understatement" :-)
