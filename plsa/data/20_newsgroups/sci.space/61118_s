 tom's right about this.  it's only a grantable right if the granter has
 the will and the ability to stop anyone from taking it away from you.
 never mind the legal status.

 nick's right about this.  it's always easier to obtain forgiveness than
 permission.  not many people remember that britain's king george iii
 expressly forbid his american subjects to cross the alleghany/appalachian
 mountains.  said subjects basically said, "stop us if you can."  he
 couldn't.

 that's how the usa started.  of course, that's also how the bolivarian
 republic started (ca. 1800-1820) in central america.  it didn't have
 quite the staying power of the usa.  i'm sure there are more examples of
 going far away and then ignoring authority, but none jump to mind right
 now.

 or do as some whaling nations do: define whatever activities you want to
 carry out as "scientific research" which just coincidentally requires
 the recovery of megatonnes of minerals (or whatever), then go at it.

 lute keyser had just this sort of arrangement with libya (i think) in
 the late '70's for his commercial space launch project (one of the very
 earliest).  it was killed by soviet propaganda about nato cruise
 missiles in africa, which made libya renege on the arrangement.
