 we've been progressing towards that goal for 30 years now.  we precede
 any orbiting mission with flyby missions.  of course, it gets harder to
 do as we work our way farther away from earth.  we're just starting to
 work out to the outer planets: galileo will orbit jupiter, and cassini around 
 saturn.

 well first things first. we'll do a flyby mission first since it is
 much easier and faster to do.  if the fast pluto flyby mission is approved then
 we'll launch a pluto mission before the end of the decade.  a pluto orbiter
 however requires a larger spacecraft and a longer cruise period.   orbit
 insertion requires more fuel has to be carried along and restricts the
 trajectory to a slower approach velocity to pluto.
 i'd imagine though that we would be doing a neptune orbiting
 mission before a pluto orbiting mission, unless the pluto flyby turns
 up something really interesting.
