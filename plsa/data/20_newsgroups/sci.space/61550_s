 
 why can't an aircraft be designed so that the pilot can always be 
 maintained in a upright position, perpendicular to the plane of
 acceleration?  with the visual helmets now being used that display
 some of the flight parameters and with a keyboard and manuvering
 equipment moving with the pilot, a pilot may be able to function at
 accelerations in excess of 12g.  is anyone currently pursuing this
 area or is there a reason why this is impossible at the present time?
