 the command loss timer is part of the fault protection scheme of the
 spacecraft.  if the command loss timer ever countdowns to zero, then the
 spacecraft assumes it has lost communications with earth and will go 
 through a set of predetermined steps to try to regain contact.  the
 command loss timer is set to 264 hours and reset about once a week during 
 the cruise phase, and is set to a lower value during an encounter phase.
