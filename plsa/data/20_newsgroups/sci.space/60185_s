 
 thanks ron and peter for some very nice maps.
 
 i have an advice though.  you wrote that the maps were reduced to 256
 colors.  as far ad i understand jpeg pictures gets much better (and
 the compressed files smaller) if you use the original 3 color 24 bit
 data when converting to jpeg.
 
 thanks again,
