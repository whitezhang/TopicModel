 whatabout, schools, universities, rich individuals (around 250 people 
 in the uk have more than 10 million dollars each). i reecieved mail
 from people who claimed they might get a person into space for $500
 per pound. send a skinny person into space and split the rest of the money
 among the ground crew!

 agreed. i volunteer for any uk attempts. but one clause: no launch methods
 which are clearly dangerous to the environment (ours or someone else's). no
 usage of materials from areas of planetary importance.
