   there was an interesting article in scientific american some time ago
 about breathing liquid. (it was a few months before _the abyss_ came out.)
 as far as i can remember, they mentioned three things that were difficult
 to do at once with a substitute breathing fluid:
   - low viscosity --- if it's too difficult to force the fluid in & out 
     of the lungs, you can't extract enough oxygen to power your own
     breathing effort (let alone anything else)
 
   - diffusion rate --- obviously, not all the air in your lungs is
     expelled when you breathe out; and the part that isn't expelled
     is the part that's nearest the walls of the alveoli. (alveolus?)
     so the trip from the blood vessels to the new air has to be done
     by diffusion of the gas through the fluid. apparently oxygen
     tends to diffuse more readily than co2, so even if you can get enough
     oxygen in, you might not be able to get enough co2 out.
 
   - oxygen/co2 capacity --- you have to be able to dissolve enough
     gas per unit volume. 
 
   oh, and of course, your new breathing fluid must not irritate the lungs
 or interfere with their healing or anything like that...
