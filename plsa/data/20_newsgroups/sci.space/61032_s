 hiya 
 
 i'm a very amuture astronomer in adelaide australia, and today, i heard some
 very interesting and exciting news from a local program on tv. as i couldn't
 find anything on it on the news server, i have posted this. however, if it is
 old information, tell me, and ill sue the tv station for saying they are 
 'up to date' ;-)
 
 (also, my news server could be slow. . so . . .!!!
 
 i only caught the end of the article, so all the information on the topic
 is not known to me at the moment.
 
 the news is of a small 'psudo' planet outside the orbit of pluto found in a 
 hawiian obsevatory, supposably 'recently' - acording to the report.
 it was meant to be about 150miles in diamater, and a faily large distance 
 from the plutos orbit.  (it had a computer drawing, and the orbit distance
 from pluto was about the same as neptune to pluto when they are furthest
 apart.  this is all i found out about it. oh it is called karna. (un-officially
 ).  
 can anyone give any more information to me on it???
 
 thanx.
