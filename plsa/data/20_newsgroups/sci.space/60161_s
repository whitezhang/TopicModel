 i am doing a political science paper on the funding of nasa and pork-barrel 
 politics.  i would be interested in information about funding practices and
 histories of some of the major programs (apollo, sts, ssf, etc) and the
 funding of ssto to contrast.  could someone please recommend some sources
 that would be useful?  thank you.
