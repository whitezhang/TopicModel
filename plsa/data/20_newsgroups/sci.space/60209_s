 i believe the reason is that the lung diaphram gets too tired to pump
 the liquid in and out and simply stops breathing after 2-3 minutes.
 so if your in the vehicle ready to go they better not put you on 
 hold, or else!! that's about it. remember a liquid is several more times
 as dense as a gas by its very nature. ~10 i think, depending on the gas
 and liquid comparision of course!
