     shuttle launchings and landings; schedules and how to see them
 
     shuttle operations are discussed in the usenet group sci.space.shuttle,
     and ken hollis (gandalf@pro-electric.cts.com) posts a compressed version
     of the shuttle manifest (launch dates and other information)
     periodically there. the manifest is also available from the ames space
     archive in space/faq/manifest. the portion of his manifest formerly
     included in this faq has been removed; please refer to his posting or
     the archived copy. for the most up to date information on upcoming
     missions, call (407) 867-info (867-4636) at kennedy space center.
 
     official nasa shuttle status reports are posted to sci.space.news
     frequently.
 
 
     why does the shuttle roll just after liftoff?
 
     the following answer and translation are provided by ken jenks
     (kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov).
 
     the "ascent guidance and flight control training manual," asc g&c 2102,
     says:
 
 	"during the vertical rise phase, the launch pad attitude is
 	commanded until an i-loaded v(rel) sufficient to assure launch tower
 	clearance is achieved. then, the tilt maneuver (roll program)
 	orients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate a
 	negative q-alpha, which in turn alleviates structural loading. other
 	advantages with this attitude are performance gain, decreased abort
 	maneuver complexity, improved s-band look angles, and crew view of
 	the horizon. the tilt maneuver is also required to start gaining
 	downrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff (meco) target
 	in second stage."
 
     this really is a good answer, but it's couched in nasa jargon. i'll try
     to interpret.
 
     1)	we wait until the shuttle clears the tower before rolling.
 
     2)	then, we roll the shuttle around so that the angle of attack
 	between the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere (the
 	"relative wind") and the chord of the wings (the imaginary line
 	between the leading edge and the trailing edge) is a slightly
 	negative angle ("a negative q-alpha").	this causes a little bit of
 	"downward" force (toward the belly of the orbiter, or the +z
 	direction) and this force "alleviates structural loading."
 	we have to be careful about those wings -- they're about the
 	most "delicate" part of the vehicle.
 
     3)	the new attitude (after the roll) also allows us to carry more
 	mass to orbit, or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass, or
 	to change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be
 	the case if we didn't roll ("performance gain").
 
     4)	the new attitude allows the crew to fly a less complicated
 	flight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abort
 	maneuvers, the return to launch site ("decreased abort maneuver
 	complexity").
 
     5)	the new attitude improves the ability for ground-based radio
 	antennae to have a good line-of-sight signal with the s-band radio
 	antennae on the orbiter ("improved s-band look angles").
 
     6)	the new attitude allows the crew to see the horizon, which is a
 	helpful (but not mandatory) part of piloting any flying machine.
 
     7)	the new attitude orients the shuttle so that the body is
 	more nearly parallel with the ground, and the nose to the east
 	(usually).  this allows the thrust from the engines to add velocity
 	in the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit.  remember:
 	velocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and direction.
 	the shuttle has to have a large horizontal component to its
 	velocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit.
 
     this all begs the question, "why isn't the launch pad oriented to give
     this nice attitude to begin with?  why does the shuttle need to roll to
     achieve that attitude?"  the answer is that the pads were leftovers
     from the apollo days.  the shuttle straddles two flame trenches -- one
     for the solid rocket motor exhaust, one for the space shuttle main
     engine exhaust.  (you can see the effects of this on any daytime
     launch.  the srm exhaust is dirty gray garbage, and the ssme exhaust is
     fluffy white steam.  watch for the difference between the "top"
     [orbiter side] and the "bottom" [external tank side] of the stack.) the
     access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented
     basically the same way they were for the saturn v's.  (a side note: the
     saturn v's also had a roll program.  don't ask me why -- i'm a shuttle
     guy.)
 
     i checked with a buddy in ascent dynamics.	he added that the "roll
     maneuver" is really a maneuver in all three axes: roll, pitch and yaw.
     the roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons
     stated.  the pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping
     the angle of attack (q-alpha) within a tight tolerance.  the yaw
     component is used to determine the orbital inclination.  the total
     maneuver is really expressed as a "quaternion," a grad-level-math
     concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one four-element
     array.
 
 
     how to receive the nasa tv channel, nasa select
 
     nasa select is broadcast by satellite. if you have access to a satellite
     dish, you can find select on satcom f2r, transponder 13, c-band, 72
     degrees west longitude, audio 6.8, frequency 3960 mhz. f2r is stationed
     over the atlantic, and is increasingly difficult to receive from
     california and points west. during events of special interest (e.g.
     shuttle missions), select is sometimes broadcast on a second satellite
     for these viewers.
 
     if you can't get a satellite feed, some cable operators carry select.
     it's worth asking if yours doesn't.
 
     the select schedule is found in the nasa headline news which is
     frequently posted to sci.space.news. generally it carries press
     conferences, briefings by nasa officials, and live coverage of shuttle
     missions and planetary encounters. select has recently begun carrying
     much more secondary material (associated with spacelink) when missions
     are not being covered.
 
 
     amateur radio frequencies for shuttle missions
 
     the following are believed to rebroadcast space shuttle mission audio:
 
 	w6fxn  - los angeles
 	k6mf   - ames research center, mountain view, california
 	wa3nan - goddard space flight center (gsfc), greenbelt, maryland.
 	w5rrr  - johnson space center (jsc), houston, texas
 	w6vio  - jet propulsion laboratory (jpl), pasadena, california.
 	w1aw voice bulletins
 
 	station    vhf	   10m	   15m	   20m	  40m	 80m
 	------	 ------  ------  ------  ------  -----	-----
 	w6fxn	 145.46
 	k6mf	 145.585			 7.165	3.840
 	wa3nan	 147.45  28.650  21.395  14.295  7.185	3.860

 	w1aw		 28.590  21.390  14.290  7.290	3.990
 
     w5rrr transmits mission audio on 146.64, a special event station on the
     other frequencies supplying keplerian elements and mission information.
 
     w1aw also transmits on 147.555, 18.160. no mission audio but they
     transmit voice bulletins at 0245 and 0545 utc.
 
     frequencies in the 10-20m bands require usb and frequencies in the 40
     and 80m bands lsb. use fm for the vhf frequencies.
