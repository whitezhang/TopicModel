 i'd hardly call the current pluto fast flyby proposal "too large" (if the
 new technology insertion currently taking place succeeds, the s/c mass will
 drop to 110-120 kg) or "too expensive" ($400 million [fy92 $] for two s/c),
 especially when compared to other nasa planetary missions.

 this proposal would work only if your various targets are relaively nearby and
 the require minimal delta-v from the mother ship.  a mission to the main belt
 might be one possibility for such a mission -- i recall a paper being presented
 at an aiaa deisgn conference in irvine in february where such a proposed
 spacecraft was designed by some grad students at ut austin (i think).  four
 mini-spacecraft would detatch from the main s/c, each visiting a seperate
 asteroid and then returning to the main s/c.  after analysis, the main s/c
 would then be targeted for the most "interesting" object for further study.
 
 now, if i could only *find* that paper...  =)
