 not to flame (really), but thats an abominable viewpoint (while were
 on the subject of abominations).  if we followed the "redistiribution
 of wealth" (and by the way, ist that what clinto and the democrats are
 trying to do...), everyone would starve in short order.  not only is
 it impossoble to organize a fair distribution that depends on every
 (wo)man's altruism (can you say black market under communisim
 anyone?), but the current methods of resource production are entirely
 energy dependant.  there are not enough sources of cheap capital
 (aside from human capital) to allow us to stop looking at space a an
 excellent source of materials and realestate.  more directly, perhaps
 you mioght consider the fact that billions are spent by tv companies,
 and their sponsors, (abc, nbc, cbs...) on the superbowl, the olympics,
 and even on monday night baseball games.  perhaps we should boycott
 those games?  if dc-x and company get finished, and there is a market
 for it, those "abominable" space will probably be much more cost
 effective for the companies, and those starving children.  more people
 buy products, the company hires more workers, end result fewer
 children die of starvation.
