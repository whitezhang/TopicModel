 
 i commend everybody to look at the ftp site 'ftp.cicb.fr'
 -> ethernet address 129.20.128.2 <-
 in the directory /pub/images/astro:
 there are lots of images (all of kinds in astronomy subject)
 especially in gif format and a new ! directory of some jpl animations
 
 for your comfort, readme files in all subdirectories give size and
 description of each image, and a 7 days' newer images' list is in readmenew
 
 note: you can connect it as 'anonymous' or 'ftp' user, then the quota
       for each is 8 users connected in the same time.
       so, if the server responds you "connection refused", be patient !
 
 2nd note: this site is reachable by gopher at 'roland.cicb.fr'
           -> ethernet address 129.20.128.27 <-
           in 'divers serveurs ftp/le serveur ftp du cri-cicb/images/astro'
 
 if you have any comments, suggestions, problems,
 then you can contact me at e-mail 'rousself@univ-rennes1.fr'
 
 hope you enjoy it !
