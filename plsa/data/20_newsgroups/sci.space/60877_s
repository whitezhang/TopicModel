                               by eddie mccreary
 
 introduction
 
 the image machine is a windows based image processing package for use with
 the cdroms distributed by the nssdc containing data from voyager and other
 spacecraft.  it it intended mainly for use with these disks and should not
 be considered a general imaging application.  future versions will correct
 this.
 
 features include:
 
              *  read compressed images directly from disk.  no preprocessing
                 required!
 
              *  basic image processing functions such as low and high pass
                 filtering, zoom, rotate, flip, and much, much more!
 
              *  complete customizable filter kernels.  write your own
                 filters if you don't like those provided with program.
 
              *  reseau mark removal.  get rid of unsightly reseau marks
                 with the click of a button.
 
              *  it's freeware!  give it to your best friend, give it to
                 your mother-in-law, give it to your dog, i just don't care!
 
 media
 
 the image machine has been tested with the following cdroms:
 
              *  voyagers to the outer planets, vol. 1 - 12
 
              *  mission to mars: viking orbiter images of mars, vol.  1 - 8
 
              *  mars mosaicked digital image model, vol. 1 - 6
 
              *  mission to jupiter: galileo images of venus, earth, & moon,
                 vol. 2 - 6
 
              *  magellan midr cdroms (tested with only select images)
 
 it should be compatible with most images stored in pds and vicar format,
 but unless the image belongs to one of the above sets, it hasn't been
 tested.
 
 requirements
 
              *  80386sx processor or above (20+mhz preferred)
 
              *  4 mb ram, the more the better.
 
              *  microsoft window 3.1+
 
 availability
 
 the image machine can be found on ames.arc.nasa.gov under pub/space/software
 as imach10.zip.  i've also submitted it to comp.binaries.ms-windows so
 if you don't have ftp access, wait a few days and it should appear at your
 site.
 
 disclaimer
 
 the image machine is a private project written by myself in my spare time.
 i am in no way associated with the national space science data center
 or nasa and this project should not be consider endorsed by them.
 
 thanks to peter yee for placing it on the ames archives.
