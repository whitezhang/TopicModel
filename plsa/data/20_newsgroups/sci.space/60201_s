 comet gehrels 3, which was discovered in 1977, was determined to have
 been in a temporary jovian orbit from 1970 to 1973.  comet shoemaker-levy 1993e
 may remain in orbit around jupiter long enough to allow galileo to
 make some closeup observations.  the orbital trajectory for comet
 shoemaker-levy is still being determined.
