 this reminds me... my fuzzy brain recalls that somebody was thinking
 of reviving the san marco launch platform off the coast of kenya,
 where the copernicus satellite was launched around 1972.  is this
 true, or am i imagining it?  possibly it's connected with one of the
 italian programs to revive the scout in a new version.
 
 that old platform must be getting pretty rusty, and there ain't a lot
 of infrastructure to go with it...
