 upcoming planetary probes - missions and schedules
 
     information on upcoming or currently active missions not mentioned below
     would be welcome. sources: nasa fact sheets, cassini mission design
     team, isas/nasda launch schedules, press kits.
 
 
     asuka (astro-d) - isas (japan) x-ray astronomy satellite, launched into
     earth orbit on 2/20/93. equipped with large-area wide-wavelength (1-20
     angstrom) x-ray telescope, x-ray ccd cameras, and imaging gas
     scintillation proportional counters.
 
 
     cassini - saturn orbiter and titan atmosphere probe. cassini is a joint
     nasa/esa project designed to accomplish an exploration of the saturnian
     system with its cassini saturn orbiter and huygens titan probe. cassini
     is scheduled for launch aboard a titan iv/centaur in october of 1997.
     after gravity assists of venus, earth and jupiter in a vvejga
     trajectory, the spacecraft will arrive at saturn in june of 2004. upon
     arrival, the cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an
     orbit around saturn. near the end of this initial orbit, the huygens
     probe separates from the orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of
     titan. the orbiter relays the probe data to earth for about 3 hours
     while the probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the
     surface. after the completion of the probe mission, the orbiter
     continues touring the saturnian system for three and a half years. titan
     synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about 35 flybys of titan and
     targeted flybys of iapetus, dione and enceladus. the objectives of the
     mission are threefold: conduct detailed studies of saturn's atmosphere,
     rings and magnetosphere; conduct close-up studies of saturn's
     satellites, and characterize titan's atmosphere and surface.
 
     one of the most intriguing aspects of titan is the possibility that its
     surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that
     result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere. these
     hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain
     down onto the surface. the cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to
     peer through titan's clouds and determine if there is liquid on the
     surface. experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will
     investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere.
 
     the cassini mission is named for jean dominique cassini (1625-1712), the
     first director of the paris observatory, who discovered several of
     saturn's satellites and the major division in its rings. the titan
     atmospheric entry probe is named for the dutch physicist christiaan
     huygens (1629-1695), who discovered titan and first described the true
     nature of saturn's rings.

     galileo - jupiter orbiter and atmosphere probe, in transit. has returned
     the first resolved images of an asteroid, gaspra, while in transit to
     jupiter. efforts to unfurl the stuck high-gain antenna (hga) have
     essentially been abandoned. jpl has developed a backup plan using data
     compression (jpeg-like for images, lossless compression for data from
     the other instruments) which should allow the mission to achieve
     approximately 70% of its original objectives.

     hiten - japanese (isas) lunar probe launched 1/24/90. has made
     multiple lunar flybys. released hagoromo, a smaller satellite,
     into lunar orbit. this mission made japan the third nation to
     orbit a satellite around the moon.
 
 
     magellan - venus radar mapping mission. has mapped almost the entire
     surface at high resolution. currently (4/93) collecting a global gravity
     map.
 
 
     mars observer - mars orbiter including 1.5 m/pixel resolution camera.
     launched 9/25/92 on a titan iii/tos booster. mo is currently (4/93) in
     transit to mars, arriving on 8/24/93. operations will start 11/93 for
     one martian year (687 days).
 
 
     topex/poseidon - joint us/french earth observing satellite, launched
     8/10/92 on an ariane 4 booster. the primary objective of the
     topex/poseidon project is to make precise and accurate global
     observations of the sea level for several years, substantially
     increasing understanding of global ocean dynamics. the satellite also
     will increase understanding of how heat is transported in the ocean.
 
 
     ulysses- european space agency probe to study the sun from an orbit over
     its poles. launched in late 1990, it carries particles-and-fields
     experiments (such as magnetometer, ion and electron collectors for
     various energy ranges, plasma wave radio receivers, etc.) but no camera.
 
     since no human-built rocket is hefty enough to send ulysses far out of
     the ecliptic plane, it went to jupiter instead, and stole energy from
     that planet by sliding over jupiter's north pole in a gravity-assist
     manuver in february 1992. this bent its path into a solar orbit tilted
     about 85 degrees to the ecliptic. it will pass over the sun's south pole
     in the summer of 1993. its aphelion is 5.2 au, and, surprisingly, its
     perihelion is about 1.5 au-- that's right, a solar-studies spacecraft
     that's always further from the sun than the earth is!
 
     while in jupiter's neigborhood, ulysses studied the magnetic and
     radiation environment. for a short summary of these results, see
     *science*, v. 257, p. 1487-1489 (11 september 1992). for gory technical
     detail, see the many articles in the same issue.
 
 
     other space science missions (note: this is based on a posting by ron
     baalke in 11/89, with isas/nasda information contributed by yoshiro
     yamada (yamada@yscvax.ysc.go.jp). i'm attempting to track changes based
     on updated shuttle manifests; corrections and updates are welcome.
 
     1993 missions
 	o alexis [spring, pegasus]
 	    alexis (array of low-energy x-ray imaging sensors) is to perform
 	    a wide-field sky survey in the "soft" (low-energy) x-ray
 	    spectrum. it will scan the entire sky every six months to search
 	    for variations in soft-x-ray emission from sources such as white
 	    dwarfs, cataclysmic variable stars and flare stars. it will also
 	    search nearby space for such exotic objects as isolated neutron
 	    stars and gamma-ray bursters. alexis is a project of los alamos
 	    national laboratory and is primarily a technology development
 	    mission that uses astrophysical sources to demonstrate the
 	    technology. contact project investigator jeffrey j bloch
 	    (jjb@beta.lanl.gov) for more information.

 	    components: the fire probe will journey into the sun, taking
 	    measurements of our star's upper atmosphere until it is
 	    vaporized by the intense heat. the ice probe will head out
 	    towards pluto, reaching the tiny world for study by 2016.
