 american, perhaps, but nothing military about it.  i learned (mostly)
 slugs when we talked english units in high school physics and while
 the teacher was an ex-navy fighter jock the book certainly wasn't
 produced by the military.
 
 [poundals were just too flinking small and made the math come out
 funny; sort of the same reason proponents of si give for using that.]
