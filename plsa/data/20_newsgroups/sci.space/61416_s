                                post-launch

 spacecraft
 
 1.  on april 22 and 23, delta differenced one-way range (dor) passes were
 performed over dss-14/63 (goldstone/madrid 70 meter antennas) and dss-14/43
 (goldstone/canberra 70 meter antennas), respectively.  initial results 
 indicate the delta dor pass on april 22 was unsuccessful due to ground
 station hardware problems but the one on april 23 was successfully performed.
 
 2.  on april 23, a cruise science memory readout (mro) was performed for the
 magnetometer (mag) instrument.  analysis indicates the data was received
 properly.
 
 3.  on april 23, the spare power relay contacts were commanded closed via the
 spacecraft stored sequence.  these relays were commanded closed by the cds
 (command data subsystem) prior to launch and were again commanded closed to
 preclude the possibility at jupiter of the pps relays/wiring being a
 source of internal electrostatic charge (iesd).
 
 4.  on april 26, cruise science memory readouts (mro) were performed for the
 extreme ultraviolet spectrometer (euv), dust detector (dds), and magnetometer
 (mag) instruments.  preliminary analysis indicates the data was received
 properly.
 
 5.  during the period from april 26 to april 27, a navigation cycle was
 performed.  this navigation cycle provided near-continuous acquisition of
 two-way doppler and ranging data during three consecutive passes of the
 spacecraft over dss-63, dss-14, and dss-43.
 
 6.  on april 26, real-time commands were sent to test slew the radio relay
 antenna (rra) in preparation for the mini-sequence slew test on april 28.
 the rra was slewed from approximately 3.5 degrees from stow to approximately
 20.3 degrees.  preliminary analysis indicated the antenna slewed to about 18
 degrees which was well within the predicted range.  the rra was commanded back
 to approximately 15.2 degrees from stow.  preliminary analysis indicated the
 antenna reached about 15.8 degrees also well within the predicted range.  the
 rra motor temperature was at 1 degree c at the start of the activity and had
 increased to 1.6 degrees c at its completion.
 
      after verifying proper rra slewing, the rra slew test mini-sequence was
 uplinked to the spacecraft for execution on april 28.  upon successful uplink,
 a delayed action command (dac) was sent which will reposition the stator on
 may 4 to its initial pre-test position.  also, a dac was sent to turn the
 two-way noncoherent (twnc) on april 28 prior to the start of the rra slew test
 mini-sequence.
 
 7.  on april 27, a no-op command was sent to reset the command loss timer to
 264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.
 
 8.  on april 28, the rra slew test executed nominally.  the spacecraft under
 stored sequence control performed six rra slews starting at about 16 degrees
 from stow and going to 53 degrees, back to 25 degrees, then to 51 degrees,
 back to 22 degrees, then to 48 degrees and then back to 21 degrees.  all of
 the slews were well within the predicted range.  the rra motor temperature was
 at 2.3 degrees c at the start of the activity and had increased to 4.4
 degrees c at its completion.  after completion of the rra slews, real-time
 commands were sent to reconfigure back to the pre-test configuration.
 
 9.  the ac/dc bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significant change
 (greater than 25 dn) throughout this period.  the ac measurement reads 17 dn
 (3.9 volts).  the dc measurement reads 134 dn (15.7 volts).  these
 measurements are consistent with the model developed by the ac/dc special
 anomaly team.
 
 10. the spacecraft status as of april 29, 1993, is as follows:
 
        a)  system power margin -  75 watts
        b)  spin configuration - dual-spin
        c)  spin rate/sensor - 3.15rpm/star scanner
        d)  spacecraft attitude is approximately 23 degrees
            off-sun (lagging) and 4 degrees off-earth (leading)
        e)  downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps(coded)/lga-1
        f)  general thermal control - all temperatures within
            acceptable range
        g)  rpm tank pressures - all within acceptable range
        h)  orbiter science- instruments powered on are the pws,
            euv, uvs, epd, mag, hic, and dds
        i)  probe/rrh - powered off, temperatures within
            acceptable range
        j)  cmd loss timer setting - 264 hours
            time to initiation - 203 hours
 
 
 gds (ground data systems):
 
 1.  the first galileo-gds test of the mgds v18.0 command system (cmd) took
 place april 27, 1993 with dss-61 (madrid 34 meter antenna).  the test went
 well and demonstrated that the new command system interfaced with the new dsn
 (deep space network) group 5 command processor assembly (cpa).  the test was
 successful and the next test for v18.0 cmd is scheduled for may 1, 1993 with
 dss-15 (goldstone 34 meter antenna).
 
 2.  the april system engineers monthly report(semr)/ground system development
 office (gsdo) mmr was conducted thursday, april 29.   a review of current
 project and institutional (dsn and moso) system status was conducted.  on-going
 cruise development plus the gsdo phase 1 and 2 delivery schedules, past months
 accomplishments  and potential problem areas were discussed.  no significant
 schedule changes or significant problems were reported.
 
 
 trajectory
 
      as of noon thursday, april 29, 1993, the galileo spacecraft trajectory
 status was as follows:
 
 	distance from earth         187,745,300 km (1.26 au)
 	distance from sun           296,335,800 km (1.98 au)
 	heliocentric speed          89,100 km per hour
 	distance from jupiter       522,015,800 km
 	round trip light time       20 minutes, 58 seconds
 
 special topic
 
 1.  as of april 29, 1993, a total of 70259 real-time commands have been
 transmitted to galileo since launch.  of these, 65150  were initiated in the
 sequence design process and 5109 initiated in the real-time command process.
 in the past week, 74 real time commands were transmitted: 73 were initiated
 in the sequence design process and one initiated in the real time command
 process.  major command activities included commands to perform the initial
 rra slew test, uplink the rra slew test mini-sequence, dacs to reposition the
 stator and turn the twnc on, reset the command loss timer, and execute the
 rra slew test.
