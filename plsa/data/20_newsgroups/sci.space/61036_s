 why must it be a us government space launch pad? directly i mean..
 i know of a few that could launch a small package into space.
 not including ariadne, and the russian sites.. i know "poker flats" here in
 alaska, thou used to be only sounding rockets for auroral borealous(sp and
 other northern atmospheric items, is at last i heard being upgraded to be able
 to put sattelites into orbit. 
 
 why must people in the us be fixed on using nasas direct resources (poker flats
 is runin part by nasa, but also by the univesity of alaska, and the geophysical
 institute). sounds like typical us cultural centralism and protectionism..
 and people wonder why we have the multi-trillion dollar deficite(sp).
 yes, i am working on a spell checker..
