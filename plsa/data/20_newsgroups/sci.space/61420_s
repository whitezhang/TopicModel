 are you talking about a single batse component, or
 the whole thing?
 
 you *could* propose a batse probe; launch two or three with ion
 drive on various planetary trajectories... your resolution increaces
 the more they're spaced apart. you could probably cheaply eject them
 from the solar system with enough flybys and patience.
 
 things would start out slow, then slowly get better and better
 resolution...
