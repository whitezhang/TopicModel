 supernovae put out 10^53 or 10^54 (i forget which, but it's only an
 order of magnitude...).  not in gamma rays, though.  you'd hafta get
 all of that into gammas if they were at 9 mpc, but if a decent fraction
 of the sn output was in gammas it could reasonably be extragalactic 
 (but closer than 9 mpc).  i dunno sn theory so well, but i can't think
 of how to get many gammas out.  maybe i should look it up.
 
 big radio galaxies can put out 10^46 erg/s *continually*.  that's just
 in the radio... there are a lot of gammas around them, too, but "bursts"?
 nah.
 
 neither of these should be taken as explanations... just trying to show
 that those energies *are* produced by things we know about.
