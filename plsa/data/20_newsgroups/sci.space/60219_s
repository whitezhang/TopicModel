 todays new york times just wrote about a pact being negotiated 
 between us and the russians  to develope  high temperature
 gas cooled fission reactors using re-cycled weapons grade plutonium
 from warhead stockpiles.   the fuel will be pelletized in ceramic
 for safety,  and then after depletion will be sufficiently
 contaminated with by-products to make extraction of the remaining
 plutonium hazardous enough to deter re-use.
 
 apparently the project will be led by general atomics of san diego
 with funding from the us government.  the pilot plant will be built
 and operated by the russians.
