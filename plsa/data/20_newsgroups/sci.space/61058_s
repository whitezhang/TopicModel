 voyager  has the unusual  luck to be on a stable trajectory out of the
 solar system.   all it's doing is collecting  fields  data,  and routinely
 squirting it down.  one of the mariners is also in stable
 solar orbit,  and still providing similiar  solar data.  
 
 something  in a planetary orbit,  is subject to much more complex forces.
 
 comsats, in "stable " geosynch  orbits,  require  almost daily
 stationkeeping operations.   
 
 for the occasional  deep space bird,  like pff  after pluto,  sure
 it could be left on  "auto-pilot".  but things like  galileo or
 magellan,  i'd suspect they need enough  housekeeping that
 even untended they'd  end up unusable after a while.
 
 the better question  should be.
 
 why not transfer  o&m of all birds to a separate agency with continous funding
 to support these kind of ongoing science missions.

 	when ongoing ops are mentioned,  it seems to  always quote  operations
 and data analysis.  how much would it cost to collect the data
 and let it be analyzed  whenever.  kinda like all that landsat data
 that sat around for 15 years before someone analyzed it for the ozone hole.
