 ocean reconnaissance launch surprises west
 space news, april 5-11, 1993, p.2
 [excerpts]
      russia launched its first ocean reconnaissance satellite in 26 months 
 march 30, confounding western analysts who had proclaimed the program dead. 
      the itar-tass news agency announced the launch of cosmos 2238 from 
 plesetsk cosmodrome, but provided little description of the payload's mission. 
      however, based on the satellite's trajectory, western observers 
 identified it as a military spacecraft designed to monitor electronic 
 emissions from foreign naval ships in order to track their movement. 
      geoff perry of the kettering group in england... [said]  western 
 observers had concluded that no more would be launched. but days after the 
 last [such] satellite re-entered the earth's atmosphere, cosmos 2238 was 
 launched.
