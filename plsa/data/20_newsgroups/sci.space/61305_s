 the french spot is an example that comes to mind.  although the
 company (name escapes me at the moment) sells images world-wide, you
 can bet your last dollar (franc??) that the french gov't gets first
 dibs.
 
 i remember a few years ago (about the time spot was launched), i
 was speaking to my dad (an usaf officer) about this and that, and i
 happend to mention spot (i think we were talking about technology
 utilization).  he just about went ballistic.  he wanted to know how i
 knew about spot and just what i knew.  i guess that space surveillance
 is such a sensitive topic in the air force that he couldn't believe
 that i would read about such a system in the popular press (ie. av week).
