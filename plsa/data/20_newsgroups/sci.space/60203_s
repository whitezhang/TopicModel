 wasn't there a "plain" flavor too?  they looked more like some
 kind of extruded industrial product than food -- perfectly
 smooth cylinders with perfectly smooth ends.  kinda scary.

 an other post described it as like a "microwaved tootsie roll" --
 which captures the texture pretty well.  as for taste, they were
 like candy, only not very sweet -- does that make sense? i recall
 liking them for their texture, not taste. i guess i have well
 developed texture buds.

 it was obligatory to eat a few while watching "captain scarlet".
 does anybody else remember _that_, as long as we're off the
 topic of space?
