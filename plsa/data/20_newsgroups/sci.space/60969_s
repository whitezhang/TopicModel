    well, there already is a sulfate process for tio2 purification.  the
    chlorine process is cleaner, however, and for that reason is achieving
    dominance in the marketplace.
 
 darn, caught by the white hot heat of technological progress again...
 
    most ti is used in pigment, btw (as the oxide), where it replaced
    white lead pigment some decades ago.  very little is reduced to the
    metal.
 
 spoilsport. hence the need for increasing fashion
 emphasis on anodise ti jewelry...

    which merely evades the issue of why those lunatics are
    there at all (and, why their children would want to stay.)
 
 i did not evade the issue at all. i clearly stated that
 this would be from diabolical foresight in establishing
 a sheltered industrial base for the upcoming great war ;-)
 very cost effective if you use the right accounting method :-)
