 the cu people have been, and continue to be big ozone scientists. so 
 this is consistent. it is also consistent with the new "comercial 
 applications" that nasa and clinton are pushing so hard.

 did anyone catch the rocket that was launched with a movie advert 
 all over it? i think the rocket people got alot of $$ for painting 
 up the sides with the movie stuff. what about the coke/pepsi thing 
 a few years back? nasa has been trying to find ways to get other 
 people into the space funding business for some time. frankly, i've 
 thought about trying it too. when the funding gets tight, only the 
 innovative get funded. one of the things nasa is big on is co-funding. 
 if a pi can show co-funding for any proposal, that proposal has a significantly
 higher probability of being funded than a proposal with more merit but no 
 co-funding. once again, money talks!
