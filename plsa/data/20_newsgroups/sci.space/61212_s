 i like option c of the new space station design.. 
 it needs some work, but it is simple and elegant..
 
 its about time someone got into simple construction versus overly complex...
 
 basically just strap some rockets and a nose cone on the habitat and go for
 it..
 
 might be an idea for a moon/mars base to.. 
 
 where is captain eugenia(sp) when you need it (reference to russian heavy
 lifter, i think).
