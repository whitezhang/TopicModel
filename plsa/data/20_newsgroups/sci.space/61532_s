 
 well,  you better not get the shuttle as your launch vehicle.
 
 and most elv's have too  far of a backlog for political messages.
 
 if during the campaign season,  the candidates for president had
 launched one,  right around now we'd  be getting a launch
 for perot 92.
 
 and if they had used the shuttle,  we'd be seeing launches
 for nixon now more then ever.
