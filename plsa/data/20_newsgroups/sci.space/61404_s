 i'm not sure if this will help you, but the (local) interstellar
 radiation field has been measured and modeled by various groups.  if i
 remember things correctly, the models involved contributions from three
 different bb sources, so there's no obvious "temperature" of background
 radiation in our local area.  however, the following references give the
 interstellar radiation density as a function of wavelength, and you can
 integrate and average in an appropriate manner to get an "effective"
 temperature if you like:
 
 witt and johnson (1973) astrophys. j. 181, 363 - 368
 henry et al. (1980) astrophys. j. 239, 859 - 866
 mathis et al. (1983) astron. astrophys. 128, 212 - 229
 
 as you can see, the references are out of date, but they might get you
 started.
 
 hope this helps,
