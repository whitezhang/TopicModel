 the apollo fire was harsh, a saturn v explosion would have been
 hurtful but the soviets winning would have been crushing. that could have
 been *the* technological turning point for the us turning us
 from today's "we can do anything, we're *the* super power" to a much more
 reserved attitude like the soviet program today.
 
 kennedy was gone by 68\69, the war was still on is the east, i think
 the program would have stalled badly and the goal of the moon
 by 70 would have been dead with nasa trying to figure were they went wrong.

 i speulate that:
 +the saturn program would have been pushed into
 the 70s with cost over runs that would just be too evil. 
 nixon still wins.
 +the shuttle was never proposed and skylab never built.
 +by 73 the program stalled yet again under the fuel crisis.
 +a string of small launches mark the mid seventies.
 +by 76 the goal of a us man on the moon is dead and the us space program
 drifts till the present day.
