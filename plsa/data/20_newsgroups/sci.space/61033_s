 in fact, you can all direct your ire at the proper target by ingoring nasa 
 altogether.  the rocket is a commercial launch vechicle - a conestoga flying 
 a comet payload.  nasa is simply the primary customer.  i believe sdio has a
 small payload as well.  the advertising space was sold by the owners of the
 rocket, who can do whatever they darn well please with it.  in addition, these
 anonymous "observers" had no reason to be startled.  the deal made space news
 at least twice.

 i think its only fair to find that out before everyone starts having a hissy
 fit.  the fact that they bothered to use the conditional tense suggests that
 it has not yet been approved.
