 i note that you make no such case as you claim can be 'even more
 easily made'.  yes, the argument can (and has) been made that current
 government policy creates even larger market barriers than there were
 in the first place, but there is no such term as 'government failure',
 since the government can change policies whenever it pleases.  the
 market doesn't do that and is governed by (relatively) well-understood
 forces.  this libertopican bilge about 'moral arguments' about
 taxation, etc., is, at bottom, so much simplistic economic thinking.
 it can only be 'justified' by cliche derision of anyone who knows more
 about economics than the libertopian -- which is what invariably
 happens.  tripe a la tommy, the new libertopian dish.

 wherever do you get this inflated idea of your own importance?
