 
 can someone please remind me who said a well known quotation? 
 
 he was sitting atop a rocket awaiting liftoff and afterwards, in answer to
 the question what he had been thinking about, said (approximately) "half a
 million components, each has to work perfectly, each supplied by the lowest
 bidder....." 
 
 attribution and correction of the quote would be much appreciated.
