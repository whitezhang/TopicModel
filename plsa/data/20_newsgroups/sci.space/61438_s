 no, the thing is designed to be retrievable, in a pinch.  indeed, this
 dictated a rather odd design for the solar arrays, since they had to be
 retractable as well as extendable, and may thus have indirectly contributed
 to the array-flapping problems.
 
 the retrieval problems are exactly as stated:  it would be costly, would
 involve extensive downtime (and the worry of someone finding a reason not
 to re-launch it), and would unnecessarily expose the telescope to a lot
 of mechanical stresses and possibilities for contamination.
