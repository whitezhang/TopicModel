 well, there already is a sulfate process for tio2 purification.  the
 chlorine process is cleaner, however, and for that reason is achieving
 dominance in the marketplace.
 
 most ti is used in pigment, btw (as the oxide), where it replaced
 white lead pigment some decades ago.  very little is reduced to the
 metal.

 which merely evades the issue of why those lunatics are
 there at all (and, why their children would want to stay.)
