 getting wierd again?
 
 okay we have figure out that a mission specifically to pluto is to large and to
 expensive..
 
 okay what about launching one probe with multiple parts.. kind of liek the old
 mirv principle of old cold war days. 
 basically what i mean is design a mother ship that has piggy backed probes for
 different missions,namely different planets. each probe would be tied in with
 the mother ship (or earth as the case may be).. this is good when and if we go
 for mars (the mars mission can act as either mother ship or relay point for the
 probes.
 
 also the mother ship would be powered (if not the mars mission) by a normal
 propulsion, but also a solar sail (main reason for solar sail race is to see
 what can be done and autmoated?) the sail would get the probes to were they
 needed.. i know the asteroid/meteor clouds (and such) might get in the way of a 
 sail??
 
 main reasonf ro mother ship idea is to make it more economoical to send
 multiple probes/mission/satellites/exploreres to different places and cut
 costs..
 the probes could do fly bys or ?? we shall see...
