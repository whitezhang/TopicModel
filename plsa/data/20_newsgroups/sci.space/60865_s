 >please go just one step further:
 >how has the word "clementine" been associated with mining?
   
 old pioneer song from the 1850's or so goes as follows:
   
   "in a cavern, in a canyon,
    excavating for a mine,
    dwelt a miner, forty-niner,
    and his daughter, clementine"
   
 chorus:
   "oh my darling, oh my darling,
    oh my darling clementine.
    you are lost and gone forever,
    oh my darling clementine."
   
  i've also had it explained (but not confirmed from a reliable data
 source) that clementine is an acronym.  something like combined
 lunar elemental mapper experiment on extended non terrestrial
 intercept near earth.  personally, i think that acronym was made up
 to fit the name (if it really is an acronym).
