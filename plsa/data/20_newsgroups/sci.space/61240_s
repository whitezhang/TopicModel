 there are no mariner craft from which we are still receiving data.  i believe
 you are referring to one or more of pioneers 6 through 9 (launched from
 december 1965 through november 1968), which were put into solar orbits to study
 interplanetary space.  i recall reading that at least one of them was still
 functioning 25 years after launch.
