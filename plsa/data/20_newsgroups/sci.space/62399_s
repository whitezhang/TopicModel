 in the new york times on sunday may 9th in the week in review
 section there was a report of a group called "space marketing"
 in atlanta, georgia who is planning to put up a one mile wide
 reflective earth orbiting satelite which will appear as large
 and as bright as the moon and carry some sort of advertising.
 there was an editorial about this in the times the following
 tuesday.
 
 are others as upset about this as i am?  i feel that a global
 boycott of anyone involved with such a project would be a good
 idea.  perhaps it could be made illegal in various countries
 around the world?  do others agree?

 if you don't want to see space marketing put up orbiting billboards, write
 them, or call them, and tell them so.  you might also write your
 congresspeople.  space marketing can be reached at:

 space advertisement in low earth orbit is very short term -- on the
 order of a few years before the orbit decays.  (higher orbits last
 longer.)  advertisers will certainly be aware of the environmental
 aspects of their advertising.  fred's argument is roughly akin to
 saying that it's bad to cut down trees, so we shouldn't advertise in
 newspapers.  think that through, fred.
 
 picture this: our space billboard is a large inflatable structure,
 filled with "bio-degradable" foam instead of gas.  it scoops up space
 debris as it orbits, thus cleaning the space environment and bringing
 you the pause that refreshes at the same time.  because of the large
 drag coefficient, it will de-orbit -- safely burning up -- within a
 year.
 
 embedded in the foam structure is a small re-entry vehicle, which does
 not burn up during entry.  it contains the electronics and propulsion
 system (which may be refurbished and re-used) as well as space science
 experiments proposed and built by high school students in
 advertiser-sponsored science fairs.
 
 advertisers buy time on the billboard, whose surface is made up of
 tiny mirrors controlled by the avionics package.  the avionics can
 reconfigure the mirrors to reflect different messages at different
 parts of the globe.  clever programming allows different languages
 to every country.
 
 during orbital night, the mirrors turn perpendicular to the surface,
 and small lights are revealed.  the lights spell out messages for all
 to see.
