 i haven't seen any mention of this in a while, so here goes...
 
 when the hubble telescope was first deployed, one of its high gain antennas
 was not able to be moved across its full range of motion.  it was suspected
 that it had been snagged on a cable or something.  operational procedures
 were modified to work around the problem, and later problems have overshadowed
 the hga problem.
 
 is there any plan to look at the affected hga during the hst repair mission,
 to determine the cause of its limited range of motion?  is the affected hga
 still limited, or is it now capable of full range of motion?
