 acronym list for sci.astro, sci.space, and sci.space.shuttle:
 edition 8, 1992 dec 7
 last posted: 1992 aug 27
 
 this list is offered as a reference for translating commonly appearing
 acronyms in the space-related newsgroups.  if i forgot or botched your
 favorite acronym, please let me know!  also, if there's an acronym *not*
 on this list that confuses you, drop me a line, and if i can figure
 it out, i'll add it to the list.
 
 note that this is intended to be a reference for *frequently seen*
 acronyms, and is most emphatically *not* encyclopedic.  if i incorporated
 every acronym i ever saw, i'd soon run out of disk space!  :-)
 
 the list will be posted at regular intervals, every 30 days.  all
 comments regarding it are welcome; i'm reachable as bradfrd2@ncar.ucar.edu.
 
 note that this just tells what the acronyms stand for -- you're on your
 own for figuring out what they *mean*!  note also that the total number of
 acronyms in use far exceeds what i can list; special-purpose acronyms that
 are essentially always explained as they're introduced are omitted.
 further, some acronyms stand for more than one thing; as of edition 3 of
 the list, these acronyms appear on multiple lines, unless they're simply
 different ways of referring to the same thing.
 
 thanks to everybody who's sent suggestions since the first version of
 the list, and especially to garrett a. wollman (wollman@griffin.uvm.edu),
 who is maintaining an independent list, somewhat more verbose in
 character than mine, and to daniel fischer (dfi@specklec.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de),
 who is maintaining a truly huge list (535 at last count) of acronyms and
 terms, mostly in german (which i read, fortunately).
 
 special thanks this time to ken hollis at nasa, who sent me a copy of nasa
 reference publication 1059 revised: _space transportation system and
 associated payloads: glossary, acronyms, and abbreviations_, a truly
 mammoth tome -- almost 300 pages of tlas.
 
 special bonus!  at the end of this posting, you will find a perl program
 written by none other than larry wall, whose purpose is to scramble the
 acronym list in an entertaining fashion.  thanks, larry!
