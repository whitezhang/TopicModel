 dillon comments that space food sticks may have bad digestive properties.
 
 i don't think so.  i think  most nasa food products were designed to
 be low fiber 'zero-residue' products so as to minimize the difficulties
 of waste disposal.  i'd doubt they'd deploy anything that caused whole sale
 gi distress.  there aren't enough plastic baggies in the world for
 a bad case of gi disease.
