 i was assuming that there won't be a moon base unless it makes a
 profit, actually.  if it does, well, that gives a larger gnp which
 leads to being able to spend more money on your military, including
 gosh-wow space stuff.  (assuming it's profitable, rather than paying
 for itself.)

 you might be able to _run_ one for that; put it there, hardly.
 
 why do you think at least a couple centuries before there will
 be significant commerical activity on the moon?
