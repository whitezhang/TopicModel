 yes, weightlessness does feel like falling.  it may feel strange at first,
 but the body does adjust.  the feeling is not too different from that
 of sky diving.

 it is the body's reaction to a strange environment.  it appears to be induced
 partly to physical discomfort and part to mental distress.  some people are 
 more prone to it than others, like some people are more prone to get sick 
 on a roller coaster ride than others.  the mental part is usually induced by 
 a lack of clear indication of which way is up or down, ie: the shuttle is 
 normally oriented with its cargo bay pointed towards earth, so the earth 
 (or ground) is "above" the head of the astronauts.  about 50% of the astronauts 
 experience some form of motion sickness, and nasa has done numerous tests in 
 space to try to see how to keep the number of occurances down.
