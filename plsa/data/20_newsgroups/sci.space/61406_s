 i'm wondering if "vandalize" is the proper word to use in this situation.  my
 dictionary defines "vandalism" as "the willful or malicious destructuion of 
 public or private property, especially of anything beautiful or artisitc." i
 would agree the sky is beautiful, but not that it is public or private property.
 
 i personally prefer natural skies, far from city lights and sans aircraft.  
 however, there is also something to be said for being able to look up into the
 sky and see a satellite.  many people get a real kick out of it, especially if
 they haven't seen one before.
