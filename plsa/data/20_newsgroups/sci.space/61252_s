 i assume that can only be guessed at by the assumed energy of the
 event and the 1/r^2 law.  so, if the 1/r^2 law is incorrect (assume
 some unknown material [dark matter??] inhibits gamma ray propagation),
 could it be possible that we are actually seeing much less energetic
 events happening much closer to us?  the even distribution could
 be caused by the characteristic propagation distance of gamma rays 
 being shorter then 1/2 the thickness of the disk of the galaxy.
 
 just some idle babbling,
