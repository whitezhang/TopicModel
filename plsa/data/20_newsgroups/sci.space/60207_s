 every aircraft has flight constraints for speed/aoa/power.  when
 graphed, these define the 'flight envelope' of that aircraft,
 presumably so named because the graphed line encloses (envelopes) the
 area on the graph that represents conditions where the aircraft
 doesn't fall out of the sky.  hence, 'pushing the envelope' becomes
 'operating at (or beyond) the edge of the flight (or operational)
 envelope'. 
 
 note that the envelope isn't precisely known until someone actually
 flies the airplane in those regions -- up to that point, all there are
 are the theoretical predictions.  hence, one of the things test pilots
 do for a living is 'push the envelope' to find out how close the
 correspondence between the paper airplane and the metal one is -- in
 essence, 'pushing back' the edges of the theoretical envelope to where
 the airplane actually starts to fail to fly.  note, too, that this is
 done is a quite calculated and careful way; flight tests are generally
 carefully coreographed and just what is going to be 'pushed' and how
 far is precisely planned (despite occasional deviations from plans,
 such as the 'early' first flight of the f-16 during its high-speed
 taxi tests).
 
 i'm sure mary can tell you everything you ever wanted to know about
 this process (and then some).
