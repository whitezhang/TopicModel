 i've seen a film of it, my memory may be faulty, but as i
 remember it the vehicle was slightly over a meter long, with a
 thick baseplate 30-40 cm in diameter. i think the narrative said
 it was propelled by dynamite sticks. there were four detonations
 within about 2 s, the second coming after about 2 m of flight in.
 max altitude seemed to be on the order of 50 m, but that is hard 
 to judge.
