 any comments on the absorbtion of the office of exploration into the
 office of space sciences and the reassignment of griffin to the "chief
 engineer" position?  is this just a meaningless administrative
 shuffle, or does this bode ill for sei?
 
 in my opinion, this seems like a bad thing, at least on the surface.
 griffin seemed to be someone who was actually interested in getting
 things done, and who was willing to look an innovative approaches to
 getting things done faster, better, and cheaper.  it's unclear to me
 whether he will be able to do this at his new position.
 
 does anyone know what his new duties will be?
