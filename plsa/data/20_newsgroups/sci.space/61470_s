 
 
 we are interested in constructing a reentry vehicle to be deployed from a
 tether attached to an orbiting platform.  this will be a follow on to our
 succesful deployment of a 20 kilometer tether on the march 29 flight of
 seds (small expendable deployment system), which released an instrumented
 payload that reentered the earth's atmosphere and burned up over the west
 coast of mexico.  this time we want to make a payload that can be recovered.
 we want to build it from "off the shelf" technology so as to do this as
 quickly and inexpensively as possible.  we want to be able to track the
 payload after it has deployed its parachute.  an idea we have is to put the
 same kind of radio beacon on it that is used with sarsats (search and rescue
 satellites).  it would turn on with the opening of the parachute and aid in
 tracking.  these beacons are known in the marine industry as epirbs
 (emergency position indicating radio beacon).  they are rugged (they have to
 be to survive a ship wreck!) and cheap.  we have several questions:
 
 1.  what is the world authority regulating the use of sarsat beacons.  are
 there multiple authorites, i.e. military and civilian?
 
 2.  what are the regulations regarding the use of sarsat signals.  can they
 be used for one of a kind situations with a long lead time of warning the
 relevant authorities, or are they strictly reserved for life threatening
 emergencies?
 
 3.  what is the coverage of sarsats?  are they in leo with only intermittant
 coverage of a fixed position on the earth, or are they in geosynchronous
 orbit?
 
 4.  is there an industry organization governing the use and manufacture of
 these transponders?
