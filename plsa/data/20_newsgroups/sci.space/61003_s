 all of this talk about a commercial space race (i.e. $1g to the first 1-year 
 moon base) is intriguing. similar prizes have influenced aerospace 
 development before. the $25k orteig prize helped lindbergh sell his spirit of 
 saint louis venture to his financial backers.
 
 if memory serves, the $25k prize would not have been enough to totally 
 reimburse some of the more expensive transatlantic projects (such as 
 fokker's, nungesser and other multi-engine projects). however lindbergh 
 ultimately kept his total costs below that amount.
 
 but i strongly suspect that his saint louis backers had the foresight to 
 realize that much more was at stake than $25,000.
 
 could it work with the moon? who are the far-sighted financial backers of 
 today?
