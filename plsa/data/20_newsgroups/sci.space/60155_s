 i hate to pour cold water on this, but currently seawater extracted
 uranium, even using the new, improved fiber absorbers from japan, is
 about 20 times more expensive than uranium on the spot market.
 uranium is *very* cheap right now, around $10/lb.  right now, there
 are mines closing because they can't compete with places like cigar
 lake in canada (where the ore is so rich they present safety hazards
 to the mines, who work in shielded vehicles).  plenty of other sources
 (for example, uranium from phosphate processing) would come on line before
 uranium reached $200/lb.
 
 "demand and supply balance will collapse" is nonsense.  supply and
 demand always balance; what changes is the price.  is uranium going
 to increase in price by a factor of 20 by the end of the century?
 not bloody likely.  new nuclear reactors are not being built
 at a sufficient rate.
 
 uranium from seawater is interesting, but it's a long term project, or
 a project that the japanese might justify on grounds of
 self-sufficiency.
