 
 here is a potentially dumb question: what prevents the martian landers
 themselves from "polluting" the martian environment with earth based
 critters? is the long trip in cold radiation bathed space enough to
 completely sterilize the landers?
 
 i could imagine that a few teeny microbes could manage to get all the
 way there unharmed, and then possibly thrive given the right
 circumstances.
