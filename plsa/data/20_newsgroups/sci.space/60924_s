 a good summary has been posted (thanks), but i wanted to add another comment.
 i remeber reading the comment that general dynamics was tied into this, in 
 connection with their proposal for an early manned landing.  sorry i don't 
 rember where i heard this, but i'm fairly sure it was somewhere reputable. 
 anyone else know anything on this angle?
 
 hrumph.  they didn't send _me_ anything :(
