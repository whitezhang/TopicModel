 ahh, perhaps that's why we've (astronomers) have just built *2* 10-meter
 ground-based scopes and are studying designs for larger ones.
 seriously, though, you're never going to get a 10-meter scope into orbit
 as cheaply as you can build one on the ground, and with adaptive optics
 and a good site, the difference in quality is narrowed quite a bit
 anyway.  also, scopes in low orbit (like hubble) can only observe things
 continuously for ~45 minutes at a time, which can be a serious
 limitation.

 i sure as hell does if the 'point of light' is half a degree in extent
 and as bright as the moon.  have you ever noticed how much brighter the
 night sky is on a moonlit night?

 existing satellites *are* points of light, but an advertising sign that
 appeared as a point would be useless, so i rather think these will
 appear larger than a 'typical' satellite.  also, satellite tracks *are*
 ruining lots of plates in the current palomar sky survey.

 what deparment are you in anyway, philosophy?  you obviously are not
 qualified to speak about astronomy...
