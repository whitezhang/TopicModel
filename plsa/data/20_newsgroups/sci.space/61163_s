 is there a few grasp pictures of space related items, namely space station
 designs, so you can see the "finished" revolt around..
 
 if you don't know what a grasp prograsm is.. check out some adult entertainment
 files and see what i mean.. or maybe geta few gif files and create a "slide
 shows" (i think cshow can do this).. 
 
 i liek to be able to see a space shuttle design in a autocad program or to see
 it revolt around and look at it.
