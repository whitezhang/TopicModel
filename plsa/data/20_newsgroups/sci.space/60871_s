   i found it very interesting that atlas depended on pressure to
 maintain tank geometry....leads me to the question: ? have any 
 of the ssto concepts explored pressurized tankage such that the
 launch configuration would be significantly different from the
 reentry one?  i have long been facinated by pnumatic structures
 as conceived and built by frei otto and others, a "ballon" tank
 ssto sounds very clever.
