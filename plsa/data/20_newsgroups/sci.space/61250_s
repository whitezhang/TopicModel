 the name is rather descriptive.  it's a command to the spacecraft that tells
 it "if you don't hear from earth after 264 hours, assume something is wrong
 with your (the spacecraft) attitude, and go into a preprogrammed search mode
 in an attempt to reacquire the signal from earth."
 
 the spacecraft and earth are not in constant communication with each other.
 earth monitors the telemetry from the spacecraft, and if everything is fine,
 there's no reason to send it any new information.  but from the spacecraft's
 point of view, no information from earth could mean either everything is
 fine, or that the spacecraft has lost signal acquisition.  just how long
 should the spacecraft wait before it decides that something is wrong and
 begins to take corrective action?  that "how long" is the command loss timer.
 during relatively inactive cruise phases, the command loss timer can be set
 to rather long values.  in this case, earth is telling galileo "expect to
 hear back from us sometime within the next 264 hours".
