 
 given that what i described for the hst  seemed to be the smt,   and given
 the mass amrgins on the discovery mission  is tight enough that  spacewalking
 has to be carefully constrained.....  no edo pallets,  no spare suits,
 no extra mmu's.   
 
 why not do this?
 
 	quick test  goldins philosophjy  of faster cheaper, better.
 
 build a real fast space tug,  to handle the re-boost  of the hst  using
 clean cryo fuels,  and get it ready before the  hst mission.
 
 if nasa  could build mercury in 13 months,  they should be able to make
 an smt in 9.   
 
 how much would it need?
 
 guidance package.  use a  voyager spare.   
 
 thruster gear,  use h2o2,  or lox/lh.
 
 bus  use a commsat.
 
 grapple fixture.   use a stripped down canadarm.
 
 comms package.   spare  x-band  omni  gear.
