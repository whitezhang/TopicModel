 well, i'll avoid your question for now (got some learnin' to do) with a
 promise to come back with more info when i can find it.  i _do_ know that
 batse is the primary instrument in the development of the all-sky map of
 long-term sources.  given that fact, and the spacecraft attitude knowledge
 of approx. 2 arcmin, we might be able to figure out how well batse can
 determine the location (rotational) of a gamma ray burster from knowledge
 of the all-sky map's accuracy.  pr material for the other three instruments
 give accuracies on the order of "fractions of a degree", if that's 
 any help.
 
 speaking of gro, the net-world probably was happy to see that the preps
 for orbit adjust appear to be going well.  our branch guy who's helping
 out says that things have gone smoothly with the iso-valve preps and the
 burns will take place in mid-june.
 
 anyway, i'm off to find out more.  'be back when i get some info.
