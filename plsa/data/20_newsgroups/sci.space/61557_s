 i don't know.  does anyone in nasa land know how much fuel is
 budgeted for the altitude change?
 
 henry,  any figures on the mass  (full)  for the edo pallet  plus
 it's dry weight?  how about for the dry mass of bus-1?  it was
 being de-classified as i checked last.
 
 also, i need.
 
 1)  current orbital parameters of hst 
 
 2)  projected  orbital parameters after re-boost.
 
 3)  discovery's  dry weight
 
 4) hst's dry weight.

 so how long do they need to train?  a year?  2 years?  somehow
 i think 2-3 moths should be adequate.

 also because they significantly lacked on-orbit eva experience.  
 the hst is designed for on-orbit servicing.  it should be a lot easier.

 there comes a time in every project, to kill the management.
 
 they can if neccessary, re-schedule the  hst mission.  december is
 not a drop dead date, unlike say the ldef retrieval mission.

 i suspect, the bus-1, may not have enough basic thrust for the hst
 re-boost.  it mayu need bigger tanks,  or bigger thrusters.
 
 
 my understanding is the second hst servicing mission is not
 a contingency.  my understanding is the mission  needs both
 a new foc  and work on the electrical system,  plus
 another re-boost.

 somehow, i think the cost of an expendable smt will be less then
 $500 million.
 
 and the extra stuff is real cheap.  nasa has lots of suits,  mmu's,
 and the edo pallets are re-usable.  oh, one double magnum of champagne,
 now there's a couple hundred bucks.

 that door has cycled, x times already.  once after massive g loading.
 i somehow think they can work ou;reliability  methods to ensure the
 door works.
 
 also,  please tell me how some sort of sublimated  material  like
 co2, or h2o  would manage to contaminate the mirror,  anything
 that goes to vapor state, shouldn't adhere to the mirror.
 
 somehow, the door,  problem can be worked.  maybe they can put a one
 time spring on it.
 
 what do they do now, if the door hangs up.  that door is part
 of a intrument safing mechanism.  if it hangs up tomorrow,  it'll
 be 8 months until someone gets up there witha crowbar to fix it.
