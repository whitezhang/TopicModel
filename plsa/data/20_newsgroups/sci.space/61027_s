 according to a software engineering professor here, what was actually rated
 level five was an ibm unit which produced part of the software for the shuttle,
 by not means all of it. 
 
 interesting note: 90% of the software development groups surveyed were at
 level 1. the ibm shuttle groups was the *only* one at level 5!
