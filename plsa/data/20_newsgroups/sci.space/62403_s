 well, we already suffer from street hoardings.  if you don't
 watch tv, you are free of commercials there, but if you want
 to go from a to b you cannot escape beer ads.

 i think the right time to stop this proposal is now.
 
 if this idea goes through, it's the thin end of the wedge.  soon
 companies will be doing larger, and more permanant, billboards in the
 sky.  i wouldn't want a world a few decades from now when the sky
 looks like las vegas.  that would _really_ make me sad.
 
 coca cola company will want to paint the moon red and white.  (well,
 if not this moon, then a moon of jupiter).  microscum will want to
 name a galaxy `microscum galaxy'.  where do we draw the line?
 historically mankind is not very good at drawing fine lines.
 
 i'm normally extremely enthusiastic about all forms of resource
 allocation for space research; i think it's the most important
 investment possible for mankind in the long run.  but this is not
 the way to get the money.
 
         -ans.
