 do you know of the world-wide-web?  this is a global hypertext (well, 
 hypermedia) network running on the internet.  one of the nice things
 about it is that is understands and incorporates virtually all of the
 other systems being used, like wais, gopher, ftp, archie, etc.  it
 is usually quite easy to add existing resources to the web.
 
 if you'd like to explore, i'd suggest getting the xmosaic program,
 written at the ncsa.  it's an x-windows web browser, and is pretty
 slick.  it can understand and cope with more than text: gif, jpeg, mpeg,
 audio, etc.  there are other browsers, including a text-mode browser
 for people stuck on a text terminal, but i'm most familliar with mosaic.
 
 under the page "the world-wide web virtual library: subject catalogue"
 (this is available under the documents menu in mosaic, or by any
 browser via the url 
 http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/datasources/bysubject/overview.html )
 there is a subject "space science."  currently this points to a
 page under construction, with only the nasa jpl ftp archive.  i've
 volunteered to take over this page, and in fact i have a replacement
 with all sorts of information pointers (mostly gleaned from the
 sci.space faq).  as soon as the overworked "subject catalogue" 
 maintainer switches the "space science" pointer, it'll be visible.
 
 i'll post a short note when this happens.
