 i am familiar with the project.  it is the onboard shuttle flight
 software project.  this software controls the space shuttle during
 all dynamic phases as well as on-orbit.
 it has ultra-high reliability and extremely
 low error rates.  there have been several papers published on the
 subject and i'll collect some references.  there may be an
 article in the ibm systems journal late '93, early '94.
 
 there is no magic formula.  we did it with dedicated and disciplined
 folks who worked to put together a process that finds and removes errors
 and is corrected based on errors that "escape".  we present a
 one day overview of our process periodically to interested folks.
 the next one is may 19th in washington, d.c.  i can fax specifics
 to those who are interested.
