         batse alone isn't always used to determine position.  when a
 particularly bright burst occurs, there are a couple of other detectors that
 catch it going off.  pioneer 10 or 11 is the one i'm getting at here.  this
 puppy is far enough away, that if a bright burst happens nearby, the huge
 annulus created by it will hopefully intersect the line or general circle given
 by batse, and we can get a moderately accurate position. say oh, 2 or 3
 degrees. that is the closest anyone has ever gotten with it.  
         actually, my advisor, another classmate of mine, and me were talking
 the other day about putting just one detector on one of the pluto satellites. 
 then we realized that the satellite alone is only carrying something like 200
 pounds of eq.  well, a batse detector needs lead shielding to protect it, and 1
 alone weighs about 200 pounds itself.
 
         we decided against it.
