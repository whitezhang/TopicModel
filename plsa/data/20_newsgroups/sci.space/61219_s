 george.
 
 	it's called a democracy.  the majority rules.  sorry.
 if ytou don't like it, i suggest you modify the constitution to include
 a constitutional right to dark skies.   the theory of government
 here is that the majority rules,  except in the nature of fundamental
 civil rights.   if you really are annoyed,   get some legislation
 to create a dark sky zone,  where in all light emissions are protected
 in the zone.  kind of like the national radio quiet zone.  did you
 know about that?  near teh radio telescope  observatory in west virginia,
 they have a 90?????? mile emcon zone.  theoretically they can prevent
 you from running light ac motors, like air conditioners and vacuums.
 in practice, they use it mostly to  control  large radio users.
