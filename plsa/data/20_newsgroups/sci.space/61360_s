   i apologize, i haven't published my astro ftp list since march.
   now i haven't tested all the sites included into the list.  i
   would notified all the people, you have stored some older issues
   of my, there are now lots of changes.  many sites have gone away:
   they either do not exist any more or all the astro stuff have
   removed.
  
   the job keep this list is very hard, so all the notes and informat-
   ion of changes, new sites, new contents etc. is welcome.
 
   i would thank all the net people who give me information for the
   newest version.
