 the problem with commercial titan is that mm has made little or no attempt
 to market it.  they're basically happy with their government business and
 don't want to have to learn how to sell commercially.
 
 a secondary problem is that it is a bit big.  they'd need to go after
 multi-satellite launches, a la ariane, and that complicates the marketing
 task quite significantly.
 
 they also had some problems with launch facilities at just the wrong time
 to get them started properly.  if memory serves, the pad used for the mars
 observer launch had just come out of heavy refurbishment work that had
 prevented launches from it for a year or so.
 
 there have been a few ct launches.  mars observer was one of them.  so
 was that stranded intelsat, and at least one of its brothers that reached
 orbit properly.
