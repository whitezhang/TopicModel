                      mars observer status report
                            april 28, 1993

 flight sequence c9 is active as of 00:11 am, tuesday, april 27.  with
 activities beginning at shortly before 5:00 am yesterday, c9 commanded
 the spacecraft to execute a series of slews and rolls to provide the mag
 (magnetometer) team data points in varying spacecraft attitudes and
 orientations for the purpose of better characterizing the
 spacecraft-generated magnetic field and its effect on their instrument.
 
 the spacecraft was commanded back to sun star init state at 9:07 am to
 re-establish inertial reference.  transition back to array normal spin
 began at 11:17 am, after which the sequence powered on the on-board
 transmitter at 11:18 am.  telemetry reacquisition occurred at
 approximately 11:30 am at the 4 kbs science and engineering downlink
 data rate on the high gain antenna.  subsystem engineers report that all
 systems appear to be nominal.  the command to terminate using the low
 gain antenna for uplink was sent at 12:31 pm.  uplink and downlink are
 currently via the hga.
 
 mag calibration data has been recorded on digital tape recorders 2 and 3.
 playback of dtr 2 is scheduled to take place tomorrow morning between
 8:11 am and 12:42 pm.  playback of dtr 3 is scheduled to take place
 tomorrow evening beginning at 11:57 pm and ending at 4:28 am on friday.
 dtr playback will be performed via the high gain antenna at 42,667 bits
 per second.  upon verification of successful dtr playbacks, downlink will
 be maintained at the 4k s & e rate.
 
 the mag cal activity timeline ends at shortly before 5:00 am on friday
 morning.
