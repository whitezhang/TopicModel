 climbers regard 8000 metres and up as "the death zone".  even on 100% oxygen,
 you are slowly dying.  at 8848m (everest), most climbers spend only a short
 period of time before descending.  i've been above 8000 once.  descending as
 little as 300m feels like walking into a jungle, the air is so thick.  everest
 in winter without oxygen, no support party (alpine style).  that is the
 "ultimate challenge" (or is it solo?)
