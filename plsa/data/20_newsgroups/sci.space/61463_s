 if you're doing large-scale satellite servicing, being able to do it in
 a pressurized hangar makes considerable sense.  the question is whether
 anyone is going to be doing large-scale satellite servicing in the near
 future, to the point of justifying development of such a thing.

 you'd almost certainly use air.  given that you have to pressurize with
 *something*, safety considerations strongly suggest making it breathable
 (even if the servicing crew is using oxygen masks for normal breathing,
 to avoid needing a ventilation system, it's nice if the hangar atmosphere
 is breathable in a pinch -- it makes mask functioning much less critical).
