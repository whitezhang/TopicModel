 well, i agree.  i hope others chime in with suggestions on specific
 technologies which could be applied towards the maintenance of an
 earth like atmosphere on a long-duration spacecraft.
 
 tim et al:
 i think we should try looking at atmosphere first.
 this seems to be the single most fundamental issue in keeping anyone alive.
 we're all taught that when supporting a patient
 you look for maintaining airway. so, in keeping with my trauma training
 (and keeping my emergency medicine professor happy), i suggest that
 we look at the issues surrounding a regenerable atmospheric circuit.
 
 howz that tim?
