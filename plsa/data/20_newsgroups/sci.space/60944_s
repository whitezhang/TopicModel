 the gravity data is collected in real-time and it not recorded to the tape
 recorder.  however, you only need to collect the gravity every 3rd or 4th
 orbit, so there is no real data loss if the moon blocks transmission for
 a short while.

 the aerobraking starts may 25 and is expected last about 70 days.  if the
 funding is provided (8 million dollars) to extend the mission for the
 high resolution gravity data, then the mission will last through october 1994.
 otherwise, the mission will end this coming july.
