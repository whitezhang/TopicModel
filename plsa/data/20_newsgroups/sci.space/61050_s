 the current mining regulations and fees were set in the 1800's!
 what the so-called "eco-freaks" want to do is to simply bring those
 fees in line with current economic reality.  currently, mining companies
 can get access to minerals on public lands for ridiculously low prices --
 something like $50!  the mining lobby has for decades managed to block
 any reform of these outdated fees.  in fact, the latest attempt to reform
 them was again blocked -- president clinton "compromised" by taking the
 mining fee reforms out of his '94 budget, and plans to draft separate
 legislation to fight that battle.
 if you want to discuss this further, i suggest you take this to talk.environment.
