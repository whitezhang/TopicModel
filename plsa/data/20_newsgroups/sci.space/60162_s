 i believe that this was the thought behind the industrial space facility.  i
 don't remember all the details, but i think space services (?) wanted nasa to 
 sign an anchor tenancy deal in order to help secure some venture capital but 
 nasa didn't like the deal.  (i'm sure i'll hear about it if i'm wrong!)
