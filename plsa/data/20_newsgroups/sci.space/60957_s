 it may be that they just didn't mention it, or that they actually haven't 
 thought about it.  i got the vague impression from their mission proposal
 that they weren't taking a very holistic aproach to the whole thing.  they
 seemed to want to land people on the moon by the end of the decade without 
 explaining why, or what they would do once they got there.  the only application
 i remember from the av week article was placing a telescope on the moon.  that's
 great, but they don't explain why it can't be done robotically.
