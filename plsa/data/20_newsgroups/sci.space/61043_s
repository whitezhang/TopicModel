 piper lived in my town (williamsport, pa) when he killed himself.  it
 was in the early '60's.  he had had more than a few books published by
 that time, but he was down on his luck financially.  rumor was that he
 was hunting urban pigeons with birdshot for food.  he viewed himself as
 a resourceful man, and (imo) decided to check out gracefully if he
 couldn't support himself.  the worst part is that john campbell, the
 long-time editor of astounding/analog sf magazine had cut a check for
 piper's most recent story, and said check was in the mail.  if campbell
 had known piper's straits, i'm sure he would have phoned to say hang on.
 campbell was like that.
 
 i wish it had happened differently.  i always enjoyed piper's stuff.
