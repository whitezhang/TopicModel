 ok, so those scientists can get around the atmosphere with fancy
 computer algorythims, but have you looked ad the hubble results, the
 defects of the mirror are partially correctable with software (see
 those jupiter pictures for results), but is the effects are completely
 reversable, why is there going to be a shuttle mission to fix it?
 
 the way i see it (and please, astromomers give me a swift net-kick in
 the butt if i'm out of the ball park), the astromers are making the
 best of limited possiblities, there's only one hubble, and the shuttle
 makes another in the near future a non-thought.  perhaps those self
 same billboards could have small optical receptors of a limited kind
 mounted on the reverse sides of the mirror's (if that is what is used)
 and then the whole thing becomes a giant array telescope...
