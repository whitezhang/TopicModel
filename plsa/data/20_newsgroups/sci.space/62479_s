 hello netters,
 
    i'm new to this board and i thought this might be the best place
 for my post.  i have a question regarding satellite technology seen
 in the movie patriot games.  in the movies, the cia utilizes its
 orbitting sats to pinpoint a specific terrorist camp in n africa.
 the photos taken by the sats are stunning!  i know that sats are
 capable of photographing the license plates of vehicles.  my
 question is this:  the camp in question was taken out by the
 british sas.  and while the sas was in action, the cia team was
 watching in the warroom back in langley, va.  the action of the sas
 was clear and appeared to be relayed via a sat.  the action was at
 night and the photography appeared to be an x-ray type.  that is,
 one could see the action within the tents/structures of the camp.
 does such techology exist and what is it's nature?  i.e., uv, ir,
 x-ray, etc.
 
 ps  who wrote the book patriot games?
