 i would have to say that the "greatest philosopher" title would have to
 go to plato since the whole enterprise of philosophy was essentially
 defined by him.  although he got most of his answers wrong, he did 
 definitively identify what the important questions are.  i think it
 was descartes who said that "all philosophy is just a footnote to plato."
 
 if i were to choose which philosopher made the most important advances
 in human knowledge over his lifetime, that's simple...it is aristotle.
 this is so much the case that many simply refer to him as "the philosopher".
 
 regarding nietzsche, he's one of the most entertaining, although since his
 ideas were so fragmented (and since his life was cut short) it is doubtful
 that his influence as a philosopher is likely to be very extensive 500 years
 from now.  they'll probably still be reading him in 500 years though.
 
 as for "modern" philosophers, i would have to say that kant was the most
 influential since he had such a strong influence on almost everyone who
 came after him (and unfortunately, they maintained his errors and 
 amplified them over time).
 
 i would say that the most influential "american" philosopher would have to
 be dewey.
 
 but as to the question of what philosopher will be most highly regarded in
 500 years, it may very well be ayn rand (who in every important respect
 was "american", but was born in russia).  but i guess that remains to be seen.
