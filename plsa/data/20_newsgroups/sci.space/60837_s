 any lunar satellite needs fuel to do regular orbit corrections, and when
 its fuel runs out it will crash within months.  the orbits of the apollo
 motherships changed noticeably during lunar missions lasting only a few
 days.  it is *possible* that there are stable orbits here and there --
 the moon's gravitational field is poorly mapped -- but we know of none.
 
 perturbations from sun and earth are relatively minor issues at low
 altitudes.  the big problem is that the moon's own gravitational field
 is quite lumpy due to the irregular distribution of mass within the moon.
