 hi folks,
 
               last year america bought two  "hall generators" which are
 used as thrusters for space vehicles from former ussr,if i could recall
 correctly these devices were sent to jpl,pasadena labs for testing and
 evaluation.
      
               i am just curious to know  how these devices work and what
 what principle is involved .what became of them.there was also some
 controversy that the russian actually cheated,sold inferior devices and
 not the one they use in there space vehicles.
 
 any info will be appreciated...
   ok   {                         thank{ in advance...
