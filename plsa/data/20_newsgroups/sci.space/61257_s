 apart from the fact that you get g in the pull-out, not the dive, that
 figure is about right for sustained g, no protection.
 the duration of g, it's rate of onset, body position and support aids are
 all critical parts of the equation. i remember one note about instrumented
 gridiron players recording peaks about 200g. stapp, the aviation doctor,
 either by accident or design, took a short-period 80g in a rocket-sled
 decelleration, eye-balls-out against a standard (1950's) harness. it had
 to be short, calculate the stopping time, even from 500 - 600mph at that
 g. a bang-seat can get up to about 60 g, and you'd better be sitting
 straight. find the book by martin-bakers human guinea pig to hear how bad
 it can get if the rate of onset is too high. a reclining position and a
 good g-suit can keep a pilot functioning at around 12g.
 
 a flotation tank should be a good bet, since you can treat the body as a
 fluid, and high-pressure situations are not new. anyone have any figures?
