 no, the sky does not, at this time, belong to anyone.  ownership is necessary
 to the definition because someone has to have the authority to decide if the
 action was good or bad.  if neither you or i own a brick wall, then i can't
 unilaterally declare that spraypainting my name on it is right, and you don't
 have the authority to declare that it is wrong.  the owner may find it artistic
 or she may be call the police.
 
 (this applies to the argument on bright satellites more than street lights)
 
 it's vandalism because many people -- power companies -- do maliciously waste light. 
 
 "maliciously" implies evil intent.  the lighting companies aren't going out
 of their way to spoil the sky.  they just don't care.

 it is the responsibility of the customer to choose the most efficient hardware.
 if that's what your city will buy, that's what the lighting company will sell.
 write a letter to city hall.
 
 please note that i'm not defending light pollution.  the orignial focus of 
 this thread was space based light sources.
