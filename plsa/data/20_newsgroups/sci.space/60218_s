 what about positional uncertainties in s-l 1993e?   i assume we know where
 and what galileo is doing within a few meters.   but without the
 hga,  don't we have to have some pretty good ideas, of where to look
 before imaging?  if the hga was working,  they could slew around
 in near real time (less speed of light delay).  but when they were
 imaging toutatis????  didn't someone have to get lucky on a guess to
 find the first images?   
 
 also, i imagine s-l 1993e will be mostly a visual image.  so how will
 that affect the other imaging missions.  with the lga,  there is a real
 tight allocation of bandwidth.   it may be premature to hope for answers,
 but i thought i'd throw it on the floor.
