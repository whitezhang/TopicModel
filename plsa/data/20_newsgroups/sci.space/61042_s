 
 well thank you dennis for your as usual highly detailed and informative 
 posting.   
 
 the question i have about the proton, is  could it be  handled at
 one of ksc's spare pads, without major  malfunction,  or could it be
 handled at kourou  or vandenberg?   
 
 now if it uses storables,  then  how long would it take for the russians
 to equip something at cape york?
 
 if  proton were launched from a western site,  how would it compare to the
 t4/centaur?   as i see it, it should lift  very close to the t4.
