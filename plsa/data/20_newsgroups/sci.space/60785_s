      scientists at nasa's jet propulsion laboratory report the
 successful flight of a balloon carrying instruments designed to
 measure and study chemicals in the earth's ozone layer.
 
      the april 3 flight from california's barstow/daggett airport
 reached an altitude of 37 kilometers (121,000 feet) and took
 measurements as part of a program established to correlate data
 with the upper atmosphere research satellite (uars).  
 
      the data from the balloon flight will also be compared to
 readings from the atmospheric trace molecular spectroscopy
 (atmos) experiment which is currently flying onboard the shuttle
 discovery.
 
      "we launch these balloons several times a year as part of an
 ongoing ozone research program.  in fact, jpl is actively
 involved in the study of ozone and the atmosphere in three
 important ways," said dr. jim margitan, principal investigator on
 the balloon research campaign.  
 
      "there are two jpl instruments on the uars satellite," he
 continued.  "the atmos experiment is conducted by jpl scientists,
 and the jpl balloon research provides collaborative ground truth
 for those activities, as well as data that is useful in its own
 right."
 
      the measurements taken by the balloon payload will add more
 pieces to the complex puzzle of the atmosphere, specifically the
 mid-latitude stratosphere during winter and spring. 
 understanding the chemistry occurring in this region helps
 scientists construct more accurate computer models which are
 instrumental in predicting future ozone conditions.
 
      the scientific balloon payload consisted of three jpl
 instruments:  an ultraviolet ozone photometer which measures
 ozone as the balloon ascends and descends through the atmosphere;
 a submillimeterwave limb sounder which looks at microwave
 radiation emitted by molecules in the atmosphere; and a fourier
 transform infrared interferometer which monitors how the
 atmosphere absorbs sunlight. 
 
      launch occurred at about noontime, and following a three-
 hour ascent, the balloon floated eastward at approximately 130
 kilometers per hour (70 knots).  data was radioed to ground
 stations and recorded onboard.  the flight ended at 10 p.m.
 pacific time in eastern new mexico when the payload was commanded
 to separate from the balloon.
 
      "we needed to fly through sunset to make the infrared
 measurements," margitan explained, "and we also needed to fly in
 darkness to watch how quickly some of the molecules disappear."
 
      it will be several weeks before scientists will have the
 completed results of their experiments.  they will then forward
 their data to the uars central data facility at the goddard space
 flight center in greenbelt, maryland for use by the uars
 scientists.    
 
      the balloon was launched by the national scientific balloon
 facility, normally based in palestine, tex., operating under a
 contract from nasa's wallops flight facility.  the balloon was
 launched in california because of the west-to-east wind direction
 and the desire to keep the operation in the southwest.
 
      the balloons are made of 20-micron (0.8 mil, or less than
 one-thousandth of an inch) thick plastic, and are 790,000 cubic
 meters (28 million cubic feet) in volume when fully inflated with
 helium (120 meters (400 feet) in diameter).  the balloons weigh
 between 1,300 and 1,800 kilograms (3,000 and 4,000 pounds).  the
 scientific payload weighs about 1,300 kilograms (3,000) pounds
 and is 1.8 meters (six feet) square by 4.6 meters (15 feet) high.
 
      the jpl balloon research is sponsored by nasa's upper
 atmosphere research program and the uars correlative measurements
 program.
