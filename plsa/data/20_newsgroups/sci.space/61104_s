 you're assuming that the low-cost delivery system has to be a separate
 project.  but why?  if you are spending hundreds of millions of dollars
 in hopes of winning a billion-dollar prize, it is *cheaper* to develop
 your own launch system, charging its entire development cost against
 your contest entry, than to try to do it with existing launchers.  no
 other demand is necessary.

 you're assuming that it's going to take a decade to build a new launch
 system.  but why?  the saturn v took less than six years, depending on
 exactly when you date its start.  pegasus took about three from project
 start to first flight.  before sdio chickened out on orbital development,
 the target date for an orbital dc-y flight was 1996.  if you really want
 speed, consider that the first prototypes of the thor missile (still in
 service as the core of the delta launcher) shipped to the usaf less
 than 18 months after the development go-ahead.
 
 one of the most pernicious myths in this whole business is the belief
 that you can't build a launcher without taking ten years and spending
 billions of dollars.  it isn't true and never was.
