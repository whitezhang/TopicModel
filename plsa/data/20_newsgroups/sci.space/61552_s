 that's fine idea, but it only works if the lighting/power company even bothers to supply good light fixtures.  for instance, a power company in virginia 
 recently asked a state commission for permission to sell more lights of various
 type.  yet, all of the different fixture that they sold and wanted to sell
 were bad designs - one that wasted the light.  thus, you couldn't even buy
 a good light from them.  in most places, to get a good light, you have to
 either order it special at high cost or call a store in arizona.  at some
 point, society starts to make rules.  cars have to pass safety tests.  
 companies have to meet pollution standards, etc..  there are two ways to achieve this:  educate the public so that they demand good lighting or force code
 down the lighting companies backs.  history seems to suggest that the latter
 is more likely to work.

 agreed, so i won't respond again.  it's important for all you spacers out 
 there to realize that some people will object to various wild ideas that 
 have been presented.  just like congress, it would be best to consult
 the astronomers/lovers of the night sky before you try some pr stunt
 to boost public knowledge about space.
