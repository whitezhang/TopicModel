 wow.  i was beginning to think that i had made that up.  i remember that
 movie (it was about 1.5 hours long).  i don't think they ended up anywhere
 in the known universe.  
 
 i remember they got a message halfway out to proxima centauri, that earth
 transmitted a day after they launched, timed to catch up with them at the
 halfway point.  i thought it was neat, i think i was all of 10 at the time.

 space:1999 has just come out with 4 episodes released in american stores.
 i will look for the into infinity show, i never did know that was the
 name of it, i thought the show was called "the day after tomorrow", and
 that was it.
