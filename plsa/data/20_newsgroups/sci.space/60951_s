 actually i favor government funded research. it *is* a pump prime
 for a lot of basic technologies. i also understand the short term
 value of high tech welfare programs. but they can't substitute for
 long range wealth generation via commercial enterprise. that's what's
 needed to maintain a healthy economy *anywhere*, on earth or luna.
 i don't see that long term potential on luna due to a bunch of
 factors i outline in another post.
