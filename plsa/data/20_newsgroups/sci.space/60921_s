    well, first you work out how much cold gas you need, then make the
    tanks big enough.
 
 our sounding rocket payload, with telemetry, guidance, etc. etc. and a
 telescope cluster, weighs around 1100 pounds.  it uses freon jets for
 steering and a pulse-width-modulated controller for alignment (ie
 during our eight minutes in space, the jets are pretty much
 continuously firing on a ~10% duty cycle or so...).  the jets also
 need to kill residual angular momentum from the spin stabilization, and
 flip the payload around to look at the sun.
 
 we have two freon tanks, each holding ~5 liters of freon (i'm speaking
 only from memory of the last flight).  the ground crew at wsmr choose how
 much freon to use based on some black-magic algorithm.  they have
 extra tank modules that just bolt into the payload stack.
 
 this should give you an idea of the order of magnitude for cold gas 
 quantity.  if you really need to know, send me email and i'll try to get you
 in touch with our ground crew people.
 
 cheers,
 craig
