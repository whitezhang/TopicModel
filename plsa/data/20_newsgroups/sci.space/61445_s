 being wierd again, so be warned:
 
 is there a plan to put a satellite around each planet in the solar system to
 keep watch? i help it better to ask questions before i spout an opinion.
 
 how about a mission (unmanned) to pluto to stay in orbit and record things
 around and near and on pluto.. i know it is a strange idea, but why not??
 it could do some scanning of not only pluto, but also of the solar system,
 objects near and aaroundpluto, as well as seti and looking at the galaxy
 without having much of the solar system to worry about..
