       _the_ problem with oort cloud sources is that absolutely
       no plausible mechanism has been proposed. it would have
       to involve new physics as far as i can tell. closest to
       "conventional" oort sources is a model of b-field pinching
       by comets, it's got too many holes in it to count, but at
       least it was a good try...
 
    so you have a plausible model for grb's at astronomical distances?
 
 i don't have any plausible models for grbs at any distances ;-)
 
    recent observations have just about ruled out the merging neutron star
    hypothesis, which had a lot of problems, anyhow.  we have to look for
    implausible models and what is fundamentally allowed independent of
    models.
 
 hmm, the "superbowl" burst has been claimed in press releases
 to cast doubt on the merging ns hypothesis, from what i've read
 (and i haven't seen the papers, only the press) i'd say it is
 consistent with some of the merging ns models
 
    a paper on the possibility of grb's in the oort cloud just came
    through the astrophysics abstract service.  to get a copy of this
 
    here is the abstract of that paper.
 
  ...
       indicator to these events all possible sources which are
       isotropically distributed should remain under consideration. this is
       why the oort cloud of comets is kept on the list,
       although there is no known mechanism for generating \grbs
       from cometary nuclei. unlikely as it may seem, the possibility that \grbs
       originate in the solar cometary cloud
       cannot be excluded until it is disproved.
 
 this does not propose a _mechanism_ for grbs in the oort (and, no,
 anti-matter annihilation does not fit the spectra at least as far
 as i understand annihilation spectra...). big difference.
 that's ignoring the question of how you fit a distribution
 to the oort distribution when the oort distribution is not well
 known - in particular comet aphelia (which are not well known)
 are not a good measure of the oort cloud distribution...
