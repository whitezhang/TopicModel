 if you are really interested in these orbits and how they are obtained
 you should try and find the following paper:
 
      hiroshi yamakawa, jun'ichiro kawaguchi, nobuaki ishii, 
      and hiroki matsuo, "a numerical study of gravitational capture
      orbit in the earth-moon system," aas-92-186, aas/aiaa spaceflight
      mechanics meeting, colorado springs, colorado, 1992.
 
 the references included in this paper are quite interesting also and 
 include several that are specific to the hiten mission itself.
