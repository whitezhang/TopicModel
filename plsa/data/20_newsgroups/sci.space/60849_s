 
 is anybody out there willing to discuss with me careers in the army that deal
 with space?  after i graduate, i will have a commitment to serve in the army, 
 and i would like to spend it in a space-related field.  i saw a post a long
 time ago about the air force space command which made a fleeting reference to
 its army counter-part.  any more info on that would be appreciated.  i'm 
 looking for things like: do i branch intelligence, or signal, or other?  to
 whom do i voice my interest in space?  what qualifications are necessary?
 etc, etc.  btw, my major is computer science engineering.
 
 please reply to ktj@reef.cis.ufl.edu
 
 thanks for any info.
