 i don't care who told you this it is not generally true. i see every single
 line item on a contract and i have to sign it. there is no such thing as
 wrap at this university. i also asked around here. ther is no wrap at 
 marquette, university of wisconsin madison, utah state, weber state or
 embry riddle u. i am not saying that it doees not happen but in every instance
 that i have been able to track down it does not. also the president of our
 university who was provost at university of west virgina said that it did
 not happen there either and that this figure must be included in the overhead
 to be a legitimate charge.

 i did they never heard of it but suggest that, like our president did, that
 any percentage number like this is included in the overhead.

 no allen you did not. you merely repeated allegations made by an employee
 of the overhead capital of nasa. nothing that reston does could not be dont
 better or cheaper at the other nasa centers  where the work is going on.
 kinda funny isn't it that someone who talks about a problem like this is
 at a place where everything is overhead.

 why did the space news artice point out that it was the congressionally
 demanded change that caused the problems? methinks that you are being 
 selective with the facts again.

 if it takes four flights a year to resupply the station and you have a cost
 of 500 million a flight then you pay 2 billion a year. you stated that your
 "friend" at reston said that with the current station they could resupply it
 for a billion a year "if the wrap were gone". this merely points out a 
 blatent contridiction in your numbers that understandably you fail to see.

 sorry gang but i have a deadline for a satellite so someone else is going
 to have to do allen's math for him for a while. i will have little chance to
 do so.
