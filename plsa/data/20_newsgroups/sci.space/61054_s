 this sounds a bit high to me.  still higher accelerations have been endured
 *very briefly*, during violent deceleration.  if we're talking sustained
 acceleration, i think 30-odd gees has been demonstrated using water immersion.
 
 i doubt that any of this generalizes to another order of magnitude.
