 he also ignores a few other things.  while organics would become
 significantly more expensive were all the oil to disappear (and thus
 some things would no longer be economically feasible), oil is hardly
 an irreplaceable resource any more than most other consumables.  as
 supply decreases, prices rise and alternatives become more
 competetive.  he also needs to consider that there has been an
 estimated 30 years of reserves pretty much as long as anyone has cared
 about petroleum; whatever the current usage rate is, we always seem to
 have about a 30 year reserve that we know about.
 
 [i'm not sure that last figure is still true -- we tend not to look as
 hard when prices are comparatively cheap -- but it was certainly true
 during hte 'oil crisis' days of the 70's.]
