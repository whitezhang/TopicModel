 oh, and us with the big degrees don't got imagination, huh?
 
 the alleged dichotomy between imagination and knowledge is one of the most
 pernicious fallacys of the new age.  michael, thanks for the generous
 offer, but we have quite enough dreams of our own, thank you.
 
 you, on the other hand, are letting your own dreams go to waste by
 failing to get the maths/thermodynamics/chemistry/(your choices here)
 which would give your imagination wings.
 
 just to show this isn't a flame, i leave you with a quote from _invasion of 
 the body snatchers_:
 
 "become one of us; it's not so bad, you know"
