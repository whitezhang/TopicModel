 things could be worse. a lot worse! in the mid-eighties the
 teen/adult sci-fi comic 2000ad (fleetway) produced a short story
 featuring the award winning character "judge dredd". the story
 focussed on an advertising agency of the future who use high powered
 multi-coloured lasers/search lights pointed at the moon to paint
 images on the moon. needless to say, this use hacked off a load of lovers,
 romantics and werewolfs/crazies. the ad guys got chopped, the service
 discontinued. a cautionary tale indeed!
