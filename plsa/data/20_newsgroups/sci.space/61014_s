 one consideration to remember is that if you don't turn it off now,
 you may not be able to later.  this isn't a case of reaching over and
 flipping a switch; much of the spacecraft has to be working correctly
 to execute a "turn off" command successfully.  spacecraft do malfunction
 in their old age.  the big concern is not radio clutter from idle
 spacecraft, but radio clutter from malfunctioning spacecraft that can
 no longer be turned off.
