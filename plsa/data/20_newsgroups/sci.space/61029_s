 what i was getting at in my post is whether or not it might be
 possible to put enough brains on board future deep-space probes
 for them to automatically avoid such things as looking at the
 sun or going into an uncontrolled tumble.  
 
 i heard once that the voyagers had a failsafe routine built in
 that essentially says "if you never hear from earth again,
 here's what to do."  this was a back up in the event a receiver
 burnt out but the probe could still send data (limited, but
 still some data).

 since this would be a shutdown that may never be refunded for
 startup, if some type of cosmic bem took out the probe, it might
 not be such a big loss.  obviously you can't plan for
 everything, but the most obvious things can be considered.
