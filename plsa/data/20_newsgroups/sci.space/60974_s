 i don't know a whole lot on proton, but given that it is a multi stage
 rocket,  up to 4 stages, it may not really need the centaur,  plus
 it may end up seriously beating on said centaur.   
 
 also, the centaur is not small,  unless the proton has an oversize
 shroud you may not be able to get the centaur in under it.
 
 dennis,  you know much about this?
