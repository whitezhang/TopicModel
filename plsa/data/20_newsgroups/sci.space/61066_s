    as for advertising -- sure, why not?  a nasa friend and i spent one
    drunken night figuring out just exactly how much gold mylar we'd need
    to put the golden arches of a certain american fast food organization
    on the face of the moon.  fortunately, we sobered up in the morning.
 
 hmmm. it actually isn't all that much, is it? like about 2 million
 km^2 (if you think that sounds like a lot, it's only a few tens of m^2
 per burger that said organization sold last year). you'd be best off
 with a reflective substance that could be sprayed thinly by an
 unmanned craft in lunar orbit (or, rather, a large set of such craft).
 if you can get a reasonable albedo it would be visible even at new
 moon (since the moon itself is quite dark), and _bright_ at full moon.
 you might have to abandon the colour, though.
 
 buy a cheap launch system, design reusable moon -> lunar orbit
 unmanned spraying craft, build 50 said craft, establish a lunar base
 to extract tio2 (say: for colour you'd be better off with a sulphur
 compound, i suppose) and some sort of propellant, and bob's your
 uncle.  i'll do it for, say, 20 billion dollars (plus changes of
 identity for me and all my loved ones). delivery date 2010.
 
 can we get the fast-food chain bidding against the fizzy-drink
 vendors? who else might be interested?
 
 would they buy it, given that it's a _lot_ more expensive, and not
 much more impressive, than putting a large set of several-km
 inflatable billboards in leo (or in geo, visible 24 hours from your
 key growth market). i'll do _that_ for only $5bn (and the changes of
 identity).
