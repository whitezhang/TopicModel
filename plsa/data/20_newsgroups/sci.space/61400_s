 i disagree with what to tout, although i agree that the space program is
 inherently a good thing.  most people today only care about "what will it
 cost me?" and "what's in it for me?" and could care less about whether
 something is simply worthwhile in and of itself.  our society has become
 increasingly geared toward the short-term (which you could read as now!). 
 they couldn't care less about next week, much less next century.  they want
 something to show for the expenditure and they want it *now*.
 
 i think we *should* tell them about the things that they are using now that
 are spinoffs of the space program.  that is the only way you can *prove*
 its worth to *them* - and they vote and pay taxes too.  the continued
 existence of the space program relies upon that money.
 
 just my $.02
