 the hart trophy was orginally awarded in a time where people did not think
 in terms of who was the "best" player, rather in terms of who was the most
 valuable to the team.  and "valuable to his team" was not, and should not
 be, considered synonymous with "best".  we are talking about a time when
 honour and attitude, not measurable skills, were the most important assets
 a player brought to his team, his league and his sport.  this was before
 the onslaught of professionalism which has clearly denigrated what was 
 formerly the foremost peacetime pursuit of glory.
 
 the hart trophy is not a prize.  it is an honour.
