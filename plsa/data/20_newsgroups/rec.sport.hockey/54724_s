 	finns had to do their best last night when they played against norway
 in world champs. after two periods the score was still 0-0. this game was 
 quite much similar to the first game finland played  (against france).
 the norwegian goalie was very good and a bit lucky, too. in the third period
 juha riihij{rvi scored 1-0 from a rebound, the time was around 5 mins or so.
 the second goal was scored by kari harila, who shot straight from a faceoff
 behind the nowwegian goalie. saku koivu, the 18-year-old center got his first
 point of this tournament. saku koivu played very well througout the game and he
 was awarded the best player of the game- prize. despite the fact that he is
 quite small in size he handles the puck very well and is a fast skater. 
 i think that we will hear from this guy in the future.
