 
 well here it goes...my crazy predictions (which never come true, but hey..)
 
 adams
 	bos vs. buf - bos in 5 (cakewalk for the hot bruins)
 	que vs. mon - que in 6 (best series of the first round)
 
 patrick
 	pit vs. nyi - pit in 5 (nyi wins fourth game)
 	was vs. njd - njd in 7 (a grueling upset, possibly ot in game 7)
 
 norris
 	chi vs. stl - chi in 5 (stl is no match for keenan's krew)
 	det vs. tor - tor in 6 (clark steps it up in playoffs this year)
 
 smythe (who cares?)
 	van vs. win - win in 7 (so i'm caught up in teemu-mania, sue me!)
 	cal vs. lak - cal in 5 (la sucks!!!!!!!!! imo)
 
 division finals
 	bos vs. que - bos in 7 (killer games, watch for cam to shine)
 	pit vs. njd - pit in 6 (njd go insane, kill all on ice, but pit wins)
 	chi vs. tor - tor in 7 (tor defense finally get it together)
 	cal vs. win - cal in 6 (win too tired after 1st series)
 
 conference finals
 	pit vs. bos - bos in 6 (pit too beat up by njd to play (i hope))
 	cal vs. tor - tor in 6 (vernon turns into a sieve)
 
 stanley cup
 	bos vs. tor - tor in 7 (two totally different teams, who knows? dreams
 				can come true, pig might one day evolve wings)
 
 feel free to laugh at my predictions, i always do!
