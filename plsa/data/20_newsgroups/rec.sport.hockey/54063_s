 we must have been watching two different games.   the devil had one hand on
 mario's elbow and pulling the elbow caused mario to fall so the call was
 appropriate.
 
 using clueless people to substantiate your claims doesn't give me a lot of
 confidence in your call either.  next time consider getting a second opinion
 from a clueful observer.  or maybe all those available disagreed.
