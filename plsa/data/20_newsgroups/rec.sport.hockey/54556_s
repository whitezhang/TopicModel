    --minnesota definitely deserves an nhl franchise!!!  you'll see the
 minnesota whalers pretty soon, so fear not minnesota fans.  no norm green,
 'cept for the team color (sorry, bad pun!)
 
    --what a difference two years makes!  minnesota finished 29-37-14 in 1992
 and made the finals.  they finish with a better record at  38-38-10 thi year
 and move to dallas.  every team in the playoffs has a winning record!!!
 finally!!!  it's about time, nhl!!!
