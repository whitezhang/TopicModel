 i have one complaint for the cameramen doing the jersey-pitt series:  show
 the shots, not the hits.  on more than one occassion the camera zoomed in
 on a check along the boards while the puck was in the slot.  they panned
 back to show the rebound.  maybe mom's camera people were a little more 
 experienced.
