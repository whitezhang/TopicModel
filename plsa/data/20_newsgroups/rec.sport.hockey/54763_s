 and won't they have to change their name to the "steelers" or something.
 the only significant deposits of oil around hamilton are those caused by
 the tire fire a  few years back.
 
 then again if the nba can have the utah jazz or the l.a. lakers (think about
 it, what lakes are in l.a.) then i guess the nhl can have the hamilton oilers.
