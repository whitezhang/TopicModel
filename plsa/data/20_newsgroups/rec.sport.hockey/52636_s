 
     i was playing this golf game and something interesting happened.
 on the 7th hole, i drove the ball down the fairway, when the ball was
 in mid-flight, the game completely froze. a couple seconds later, the
 screen went completely black, with an error message in large "bubble"
 letters that said division by zero. i thought it was funny considering
 i am a computer programmer, and i had never seen an error like this on
 an actual video game system like sega or nintendo (or even atari or
 intellevision years ago). oh yeah, after the message, there was also
 what must have been an address, in hexadecimal. i forget the exact hex
 code that was given. has this happened to anyone else??? it must have,
 my game shouldn't have been the only one to do this.
 
 thanks
