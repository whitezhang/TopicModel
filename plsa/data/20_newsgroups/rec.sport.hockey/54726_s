 that's a good way to put it.  it's a quiet confidence.  i don't feel like
 i have to defend this team anymore. 
 
 the devils are a puzzle to me.  they have long been one of the few teams
 i always dreaded playing.  their d isn't quite what it used to be but they
 still usually play us pretty tough.  i just can't figure it out.  at least
 last night they mounted an attack.

 bernie nichols was interviewed after game 2 on the late news.  he was
 shaking his head in disbelief over barrasso, saying that tommy is like
 another defenseman out there and how difficult it is playing against him.
 then he got this far-away look on his face, his voice started trailing
 off and he said, "it just isn't right...it just isn't fair..." and he
 tried to muster a smile.

 as far as coaching goes, a pens/islanders match-up should be pretty good.
 
 one guy i feel sorry for in all of this so far is chris terreri.  i'm sure
 tom barrasso knows how he feels.  for so long tommy would look up and not
 have a teammate in sight.  terreri's teammates really left him out in the
 cold in the first two games.
