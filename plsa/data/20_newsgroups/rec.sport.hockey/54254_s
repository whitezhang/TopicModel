 i've sold one, but i still have 2 left for sale. i also realize that $45 is
 alot of money, especially if you don't normally collect cards. so if enough
 people are interested, i'll break up the set into team sets. i'm not sure
 how much for each. it would be nice to just sell them for $3 each, but then
 the people who get the whalers and devils (note, i'm not bagging on these teams
 its just that they don't have alot of good rookie cards in this set) would
 be subsidizing the people who want chicago or pittsburgh. so i'll have to make
 it varialble pricing. but most of them should be about $2 or $3 dollars.

 ok someone asked for this one, but he's from canada, if he can get me the
 money in us funds then its his, if not, the first person who writes in will
 be the alternate.
 
 also i would like to sell 2 upperdeck pavel bure rookie cards (note these
 are not in the ud low #'s set mentioned above). $16 each. they are $15 in
 the book, but the $1 goes for postage, packaging and insurance.
 
 and if there is something you want that you don't see, e-mail me, i may have
 it or may be able to get  it for you.
