 just some thoughts:
 
 i don't usually like to post simply to make fun of a player,
 but this time i couldn't resist.  during the pens-devils game
 last night, second period, i think kevin stevens was in the
 penalty box, nicholls punched kjell samuellson in the face,
 then raised his stick like a two handed sword to defend
 himself!  all kjell could do, at 8'7" and 355 pounds, was laugh!
 
 and speaking of swedish penguins defensemen, ulf is getting a
 little out of hand lately.  his cheap shots are getting more
 frequent and more violent.  as everybody in the meadowlands
 except for the officials could see last night, he rammed the
 butt of his stick down one of the devil's throat.  i've always
 supported the argument "he does his job by being irritating,"
 but he's starting to push it over the edge imho.  of course,
 holik's chop to barrasso's neck wasn't too sportsmanlike either.
 it seems that he was following the "the only way to beat the
 penguins is to injure them" philosophy.
 
 as my modern drama professor pointed out to me the other day,
 jagr was stoned pretty well tuesday night, and last night as
 well, although the 30 seconds he danced around the devils end
 was pretty exciting.
