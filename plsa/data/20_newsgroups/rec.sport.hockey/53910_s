 playoffs:
 ---------
 *stauber disturbed by third-man theme
 by rick sadowski, daily news
 
 barry melrose's decision to stick robb stauber in the stands rather than in the
 crease or even on the bench for the stanley cup playoffs does not sit well with
 the rookie goaltender.
 
 "i want to be a part of the team at the most crucial time of the year, the most
 fun time of the year, and i'm not,"  stauber said with some emotion monday.  "i
 think i have worked hard enough for that."
 
 stauber said he accepts melrose's choice of kelly hrudey as the teams top goalie
 in their playoff series with the calgary flames. hrudey made 21 saves in sundays
 6-3 opening victory.
 
 but stauber clearly is upset with his sudden status as the no. 3 man behind rick
 knickle.  stauber had a 4-1-2 record and 2.98 goals-against average down the
 stretch in the regular season and nearly wrestled the no. 1 job from hrudey.
 
 knickle?  he won 2 of 3 decisions but had a bloated 5.26 average, twice was 
 yanked from games (once for stomach cramps) and hasn't played since march 29.
 
 yet, when the series resumes wednesday, knickle will serve as hrudey's backup
 again and stauber will have to satisfy his playoff hunger by munching on olympic
 saddledome popcorn.
 
 "if i'm supposedly close to being the starter or could have been the starter...i
 dropped too. 3.  what happened to no. 2?"  stauber wondered.  "not that i'd be
 happy with no. 2, but i feel i should at least be a part of this team in the
 playoffs."
 
 perhaps stauber eventually will get his chance, but melrose apparently is not
 convinced the 25-year old is capable of handling playoff pressure.
 
 while insisting he is the kings' "goalie of the future," melrose said stauber
 flubbed all four of the big games he was asked to win this season.  they were,
 according to melrose: a 7-2 loss to san jose on dec. 26; an 8-3 loss to the new
 york rangers on jan. 23; a 6-6 tie with detroit on feb. 11; an 8-6 loss to 
 vancouver on thursday.
 
 "four times this season robb could have emerged as the elite goalie, he could
 have taken it away from kelly hrudey, and he didn't do it," melrose said.  "an
 elite goaltender has to carry the ball when you give it to him.  the mark of a
 great goalie is that he isn't satisfied to be a backup."
 
 "i'm not blaming robb for the losses, but if you're going to be no. 1, you've
 got to be able to walk your talk.  you've got to be able to play when everything
 is on the line.  robb stauber has a great deal of ability, but maybe i expect
 more from him than he does."
 
 ouch.  that remark stung stauber.  he began the season 9-0-1, struggled when the
 team hit a mid-season slump, didn't play for a month after knickle was signed
 off the san diego gulls roster, then came on at the end.
 
 "i expect more from myself than anybody, including barry melrose," said stauber,
 a three-year star at the university of minnesota who left school in 1989, only 
 to have his development hampered by a string of serious injuries.
 
 "what i've been through the last four years - two knee operations, a herniated
 disk in my back, shoulder surgery - what more can i go through?  i obviously do
 expect a lot from myself, otherwise i wouldn't be here."
 
 "anybody who would disagree with that doesn't know me.  i'm not saying barry 
 doesn't know me, but don't say i've been without expectations.  if anything, i'm
 a perfectionist."
 
 stauber acknowledged he played poorly in the four games melrose mentioned. "but 
 even though i didn't play well, i get knocked down from maybe on to three? it's 
 a bit of a jump," he said.  "you're almost no. 1, or if you play a good game 
 you're no. 1 and if you don't you're no. 3?  why does jack nicklaus shoot a 67 
 and then a 75?  can you explain that?  that's what barry wanted me to explain 
 to him, why i didn't come through when he counted on me.  i don't know. what i 
 do know is, it's a sport.  i'll be there."
 
 melrose's "goalie of the future" statement doesn't mean much to stauber. "before
 you know it, i'll be 30 and there will be no future," he said.
