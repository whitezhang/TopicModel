 there are several problems with the way the game is being presented to the
 fans.  i feel that geographical names would enhance regional loyalties
 more than names honouring personages.  and of course, they would not appear
 nearly as confusing to one approaching the sport for the first time.  
 another thing that bothers me is the points system.  percentages, as used in
 the other major sports are clearly more informative.  when i look at the
 nhl standings the first thing i have to do is make a quick calculation to
 account for games in hand (which is almost always the case).  some will
 object to percentages, claiming perhaps, that it is an "americanization"
 of the sport but i feel that using percentages is more informative and
 whether it is "american" or not is irrelevant.

 even if orr couldn't have contributed without the likes of norris, you would
 have to agree that norris couldn't have contributed without the likes of orr.
 and taking a poll of most fans would quickly tell you who the fans feel made
 the more meaningful contribution.

 it doesn't look as if the division names are going to hold up either does it?
