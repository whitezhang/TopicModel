 not to mention, mr. francis is an incredibly nice person.  over christmas
 break, a friend of mine had a little xmas gathering.  the two of us drove
 to ron's house.  while i stayed in the car out of shyness, my friend went
 to the door and rang the bell.  ron answered and my friend introduced
 himself.  he then proceeded to invite francis to the party.  ron declined
 because he "had to watch his daughter."  he then reached out and shook my
 friend's hand!  i know this isn't r.s.b., but i don't think barry bonds
 would be this polite in this situation.
