 unfortunately, that is the way the league is heading... you can't fight,
 so the only way to retaliate against someone is with a cheap shot when
 the ref isn't looking. ulf has brought this to a high level... players
 stuck in the past (like neely) who prefer fights to cheap shots
 are at a disadvantage in the new system.
 
 lets face it, a cheap shot (like high sticking) is a very effective
 method... it is easier to hide from the refs, has a better chance of
 causing injury, and you can draw people into fights that way. i don't
 like it, but that's the way the league is going.
 
 by the way, there was a rather good hit by ulf in the last penguin-devil
 game. managed to hit the nj player in the face with a stick. (must have been a
 legal hit... after all, ulf is a clean player and is allowed to do
 things like that.)
