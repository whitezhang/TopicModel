 well, i have compiled some statistics on the entries of my pool.  there
 are unofficially 52 entrants.  here are the stats on what teams were
 picked to win it all:
 
 pittsburgh:	34 (1 sweep, 14 in 5, 15 in 6, 4 in 7)
 boston:		6  (1 in 5, 5 in 6)
 detroit:	4  (3 in 6, 1 in 7)
 montreal:	2  (1 in 5, 1 in 7)
 toronto:	2  (1 in 6, 1 in 7)
    (no, this wasn't roger)
 calgary:	1  (in 6)
 quebec:		1  (in 6)
 vancouver:	1  (in 7)
 washington:	1  (in 6)
 
 why the hell hasn't anybody picked chicago???  nobody!  quebec got a pick,
 detroit got 4, but absolutely no chicago!  how odd.
 
 here are the "losers":
 
 detroit:	20
 chicago:	16	(so there they are!)
 pittsburgh:	6
 vancouver:	4
 boston:		2
 calgary:	2
 los angeles:	1	what?!?
 toronto:	1
 
 los angeles???????  are you out of your mind?!?!?  good luck to you,
 you'll need it!
 
 so pittsburgh is the consensus winner of the stanley cup.  they'll
 statistically beat detroit in 6 games.  haha  that's happening!  not!  as
 i said, every one of my picks will come true, and i picked chicago to lose
 to pittsburgh in the finals, so tough luck to all you who picket detroit.  
 well, tough luck to all of ya!  i am a genius!!!  ;-)
