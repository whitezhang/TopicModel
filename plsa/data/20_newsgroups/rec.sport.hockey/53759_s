 it looks like the edmonton oilers just decided to take a european
 vacation this spring...
 
 ranford, tugnutt, benning, manson, smith, buchberger, and corson
 are playing for canada.
 
 podein and weight are playing for the us.
 
 is kravchuk playing for the russians...i know he had nagging
 injuries late in the season.
 
 podein is an interesting case...because he was eligible to
 play in cape breton in the ahl playoffs like kovalev, zubov,
 and andersson...obviously sather and pocklington are not
 the total scrooges everyone makes them out to be...certainly
 in this case they've massively outclassed paramount and the
 new york rangers.
