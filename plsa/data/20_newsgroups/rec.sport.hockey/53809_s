  well, i'm a wings fan and i think the first thing that you should do is to
 get the opponent's line combinations correct before you try to match up anyone
 with them.  there is no yzerman-fedorov-probert line, except for maybe on a
 powerplay.  these three players usually play on three different lines.
 which would mean that toronto's checking line would have to pull a triple
 shift.
 the wings' lines usually look like this:
  
                       gallant-yzerman-ciccarelli
  
                       kozlov-fedorov-drake
  
                       kennedy-burr-probert
  
                       ysebaert-primeau-sheppard
  
 oh by the way:  start praying! : )
