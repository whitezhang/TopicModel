 owns the cap centre.  i know they don't sell out all of their 
 games, but they draw a lot more than the bullets.  if you
 had the situation that abe had, would you move if you were
 guaranteed that anyone who went to the games would have to 
 park at the stadium, because there has been nothing within
 a half mile, until the recent construction in
 the area.
    can they win a game in ot again.
