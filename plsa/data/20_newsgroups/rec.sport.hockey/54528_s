 nesn owns the rights to bruin telecasts.  i suspect that nesn was only
 going to sell one telecast to espn (remember, espn only owns exclusive
 rights to the finals, not the entire playoffs).  since espn bought the
 sca contract, there are less wrangles to untie with showing the devils
 and penguins.

 i think the same broadcast rights factor comes into it.  plus they
 have no way of fitting western game times into their current schedule
 unless the nhl was willing to make a western club move up their game.
 i think the nhl got as much as it could when it shuffled the deck for abc.

 same exact coverage as last week:  pit-nj game 4 in the east, chi-stl
 in the central, la-cgy in the mountains and west.
