 as i recall, the author of the _original_ article that started the thread
 claimed that he disliked the changing of the names for a variety of reasons. 
 roger, on one front you flamed him rather severely on the grounds that his
 was a "jingoistic rant", but you also supported the name-changing on the
 grounds that the current names are inappropriate because of the individuals
 they represent. fwiw, i do not think the flaming was warranted, nor do i 
 think you enhanced what credibility you have with it at all.  just an 
 observation...
 
 however, that aside, the real question is whether you like the idea of
 changing the names based on the reasons given for it (making it easier for
 the 'casual fan'), or whether you like the idea of unique divisional names
 based on individuals who do deserve the honour.  imo, the latter is a nice
 and unique touch that differs from other sports.  in addition, i do not
 think that changing divisional names will have an effect on the number of
 people that are interested in hockey, so it's a pointless exercise anyway.
 
 if the current names are inappropriate, then that is a separate issue, not 
 central to the original article.  something to consider additionally is
 whether or not players like orr who 'contributed to the glory of the sport'
 would have been able to do so _without_ an organized professional league to
 play in.  in this case, honouring builders of the _league_ as opposed to
 builders of the _sport_ becomes a chicken-and-egg type question. (although
 it was the chicken.....)

 dunno if the stein comparison is justifiable, since it doesn't look as though
 his 'unanimous acceptance' to the hall will hold up.
