 later on, in your posting, you make reference to "putting words
 into other people's mouths"...i would suggest that your last
 paragraph can only be interpreted in one way...namely, that i,
 along with greg, claim that gainey never made a technical
 mistake.  if you actually read what i've written, you will find
 that i make no such claim...soooo, if logic serves me well,
 you're contradicting yourself.

 roger, i'm not sure here, but i think "ignorance" is really a
 function of "a lack of knowledge" and not "formulating an
 opinion"...but hey, if you need to take a cheap shot, then by all
 means go ahead...that's if it makes you feel better.

 my word, such vehemence against poor ol' bob gainey.  why does
 he bother you so much...he was an effective player for his style
 of play.

 i'm really sorry roger, but you have lost me completely here. 
 why don't you ask me if i would rather have jesus christ,
 himself, in nets?
  
 now, if you were to compare, say for example, bob gainey with guy
 carbonneau, you would have a balanced comparison.

 i'm wrong again...hmmm, let's see...where was i wrong in the
 first place?  i'm only guessing here, rog, but i have a feeling
 that you've setup a "you're wrong again" macro key on your
 machine.
  
 i agree that my use of the word plugger is simplistic...but i
 think you know what i'm getting at.  i would also like to point
 out that gilmour's potential as a selke-winner was never part of
 the debate...are you asking me for an opinion?  if so, i think
 there are far too many other deserving players to include gilmour
 among the candidates.
  
 >>settle down?  if you think that i have likened the selke to the
 >>nobel prize then i suggest that you had best "settle down". 
 >>and if you are going to try to put words in my mouth, let me

 i would suggest that your comment: "and when the press runs out
 of things to say about  the stars on dynasties they start to hype
 the pluggers.  grant fuhr, essa tikkannen, butch goring, bob
 nystrom, bob gainey, doug jarvis, derek sanderson, wayne cashman,
 bob baun, bob pulford, ralph backstrom, henri richard, dick
 duff...and so on..." demonstrates a blanket disregard for these
 individuals as contributors to the game...so yes, settle
 down...nobody has claimed that they are hockey gods.

 c'mon...it has a nice ring to it...and admit it, you had a good
