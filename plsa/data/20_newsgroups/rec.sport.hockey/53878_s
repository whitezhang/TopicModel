 i don't know the exact coverage in the states.  in canada it is covered
 by tsn, so maybe espn will grab their coverage!  i don't know!
 
 as for the picks
 ottawa picks #1 which means it is almost 100% that alexander daigle will 
 go #1. he'll either stay or be traded in montreal or quebec.  imo i would
 take kariya.  he should alot of leadership in the ncaa and so far in
 the world championships.  daigle didn't show this for his junior team.
 
 san jose will then get kariya.
 
 tampa bay will either go for a russian kozlov (i think that's it) or a 
     defenseman rob niedemeyer (probably spelt the last name wrong)
 
 because of expansion i won't go further but i will name other of the
 blue chip prospects
 
    - chris gratton
    - chris pridham
    - a swedish player who i can't remember his name
 
 draft order
 -----------
 1) ottawa
 2) san jose
 3) tampa bay
 4) south florida or anahiem
 5) south florida or anahiem
 6) hartford
 7) edmonton
 8) dallas
 9) ny rangers
 10) philadelphia
 
 the 8th thru 10th picks could be wrong - i don't have the standings here
 and am guessing 
 
 (in my mind there are 8 top notch prospects in the draft, with kariya 
  leading the way but not going #1)
 
 shawn - go caps (two first round picks for the next three years - thanks
                  st.louis or should i say ron caron and scott stevens)
