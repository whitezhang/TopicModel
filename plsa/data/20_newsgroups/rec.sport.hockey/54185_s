 okay, here's the down side of the espn deal: no additional coverage.
 with a split contract, sca could have at least gotten at leftovers
 like canucks-jets, caps-whoever and red wings-leafs (or whoever else
 is playing).

 for our area (islanders-devils), it's likely to be the bruins, since
 the other adams series is montreal-quebec.  i'd prefer the latter
 myself ...
 
 i'm under the impression that the abc deal overrides the local deals,
 but if st. louis at chicago pops up we'll know ...
