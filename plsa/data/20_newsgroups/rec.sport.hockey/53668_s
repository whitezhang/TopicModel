 here are my predictions (try not to laugh hysterically)
 somebody save this so i can laugh when i win my own pool.
 i don't have prizes, but we all love bragging rights, so winner takes them.
 
 also.  if somebody has some sort of scoring system let me know.
 i was thinking 1 for 1st round victories, 2 for second, 3 for 3rd, 4 for 4th
 but we may get alot of ties.  any ideas?
