 #21	peter ahola		season: 2nd
 acquired:	'92-93, trade with pittsburgh for future considerations
 grade:		i (b)
 
 it is way too early to tell about ahola, who was acquired probably because the
 penguins figured that they would lose him in the expansion draft.  ahola had
 only played 50 games this season (i think it's actually less; the san jose
 mercury news may be in err here), 20 of them with the sharks.  in the games he
 has played, he appeared quite solid defensively, although he hasn't been
 spectacular, and his offense isn't anything to write home about (8 points);
 it's even possible that the trade may be for future considerations which turn
 out to be ... peter ahola.
 
 #24	doug wilson		season: 16th
 acquired:	'91-92, trade with chicago for rw kerry toporowski and
 		2nd round pick in '92 entry draft
 grade:		i (b)
 
 i have often been accused of overly down on wilson; i may have had too high
 expectations for him, but his legs, knees, et al., are giving out.
 nevertheless, when he was playing, he exhibited a strong shooting and
 playmaking abilities, even if he has lost a step on defense, which,
 unfortunately, he demonstrated this year as well, as at times he was slow to
 catch the opponent forwards, and his offensive output was only good enough for
 2nd place on the team (20 points in 42 games).  but next year, which may be
 wilson's last, if he can stay healthy, he can still be a contributor.
 
 #29	dean kolstad		season:	2nd
 acquired:	'91-92, from minnesota in dispersal draft
 grade:		i (c-/d+)
 
 it's probably somewhat unfair for me to judge kolstad on just a handful of
 games (forgetting exact number, but no more than 15), but at age 25 he's
 quickly running out of time if he wants to make it to the nhl.  in those games,
 he did not impress anyone; after generating 7 shots in the first period of
 the first game he played, he scored just 2 points in his tenure up here with
 the sharks, and was even less impressive defensively, as he appeared awkward
 with his movement and was prone to giveaways.  he needs to make a leap in
 his level of performance to have any chance of making the team.
 
 #38	pat macleod		season: 2nd
 acquired:	'91-92, from minnesota in dispersal draft
 grade:		i (?)
 
 macleod was on the roster a lot longer than kolstad, but it appears to my
 memory that he played less than kolstad, because the sharks were reluctant to
 use him, but were even more reluctant to send him to the minors, figuring that
 he wouldn't clear waivers; in fact, he has played the past 4-5 weeks with
 kansas city, but is still technically there on a rehabilitation assignment,
 a "rehab assignment" that will include him playing in the turner cup playoffs.
 since he has played so little, i can't even give a tentative grade on him, but
 he demonstrated last year excellent offensive skills but terrible defensive
 skills.
 
 #41	tom pederson		season: 1st
 acquired:	'91-92, from minnesota in dispersal draft
 grade:		i (b+)
 
 called up in the middle of the season when the defensive corps was decimated
 by injuries, pederson impressed many sharks fan here on net, including yours
 truly.  he demonstrated very good offensive skills, scoring 20 points in
 43 games.  however, his size (5' 9", 165 lbs.) is of concern, and soon after
 he began to shine offensive did teams begin to push him around physically,
 on both sides of the ice, although he had appeared fearless in his approach.
 but to be successful, he probably needs to bulk up to have a fighting chance
 on surviving against some of the bigger players in the league.
 
 #45	claudio scremin		season: 1st
 acquired:	'91-92, from minnesota in dispersal draft
 grade:		i (d+/d)
 
 he played all of ~5 games in the league this year, but was thoroughly
 umimpressive, just as he was at the end of last season; again, it may be a
 small sample, but just as in the case of kolstad, scremin, at age 25, is
 quickly running out of time.  he was not a contributor on either offense or
 defense in the games he played with the sharks.  the only notable thing that
 will go down in scremin's entry of league stats is probably the fact that he
 was once traded for now capitals goaltender don beaupre.
