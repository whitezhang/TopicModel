 well, as a hockey fan, i think it's terrible. it's one thing to say, "hey, 
 let's give a hockey team to cities that don't have one!" -- that's fine. it's
 entirely another to say, "okay, let's take a team from a thriving hockey town
 and move it!" 
 
 of course, none of us will ever know the real inside story, but
 from what i know, a group of minneapolis businessmen told green repeatedly that
 they would purchase the remaining 3600 (?) season tickets to get to the 10,000
 level that green wanted, yet he refused every time. it's pretty obvious that he
 was determined to get out of minneapolis at any cost and use the season tickets
 thing as an excuse. 
 
 i was fortunate enough to get to the penultimate game, and
 the fans were great! people were tailgating and playing roller hockey in the
 parking lot before the game, the attendance was so full as to have sro, and the
 whole atmosphere in the centre was terrific. minnesota is hockey, usa. how the
 nhl can so blithely let the major league team from there move away is beyond 
 me. i only hope they get a new team soon.
 
 just my $0.02.
