 grrrr, let's start a whole 'nother topic on show bad the sharks are doing on
 these things. i swear that all of my partial plan games were televised (i
 know, i'm exaggerating, but...).
 in order:
 -the new ticket prices suck
 -wait 'till people try to park at games next year. public transit? yeah
 right, i'd love to take caltrain for 3 hours to see a 3 hour game.
 
 shelling out hundreds of dollars for partial season plans for two years
 doesnt mean anything to the sharks, as i get to pick my seats after the dead
 rise from their graves to claim their seats! :-)
