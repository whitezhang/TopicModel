 how do you figure that??  when bryan murray took over the wings they were
 a pretty good team that was contending for the stanley cup but looked
 unlikely to win it.  now they are a pretty good team that is contending for
 the stanley cup but looks unlikely to win it.  a truly great gm would
 have been able to make the moves to push the team to the upper echelon
 of the nhl and maybe win the stanley cup.  a good gm (like murray) can
 maintain the team's success but can't push them to the next level.
 
 in the history of hockey there have been several better gm's than murray-
 way too many to name.  murray isn't even the best gm in the league today.
 he fails in comparison to sinden, sather, savard, caron, fletcher and
 quinn in my estimation.
 
 i can't imagine how bryan murray can be the best gm anyone has ever seen
 in hockey- unless they have seen very few gm's.
