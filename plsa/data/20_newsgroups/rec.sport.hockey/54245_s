 
 have you ever noticed that after a hockey player has been interviewed
 in between periods on a tv game. that they usually get a goal or
 an assist. can you explain this or is it that they usually talk 
 to stars more than regular players which explains the hight 
 percentage of results after.
 
 just wondering how everybody else thinks about this or if they dont 
 care about this trivial nonsense.
