 you obviously don't understand how tv scheduling works.  espn had
 prior contracts to baseball to show monday night games and had
 contracted all the other bs shows well in advance.  the nhl tv deal
 was very late in the scheduling process (you normally have to do this
 one-plus year out.  the nhl package was finished two weeks before the
 season started).  espn has shown tremendous commitment to the nhl by
 squeezing in extra telecasts when it could (like the last minnesota
 game) and putting stanley cup games as backup to their baseball
 telecasts (which by favorable circumstances they could pull off last
 night).
 
 but the bottom line is that espn cannot break contracts at will.  they
 must honor the previous deals they made.  $$$$ _does_ have something
 to do with it, especially if you risk a $$$$$$$$ lawsuit for breach of
 contract with baseball.
 
 so relax.  i'm happy.  (i don't get sportschannel anyway).
