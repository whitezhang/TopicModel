 speaking of roger, where is his comments from last nights game. you have
 to admit he can make a nothing game sound like it was game 7 of the
 stanley cup finals.
 roger pushes the leafs so much it even bothers me, a long time supporter
 but he does have a good overall idea of the game.
 wow i just gave r.m a compliment, guess i better stop it with the rye +
 water before i give him another..
