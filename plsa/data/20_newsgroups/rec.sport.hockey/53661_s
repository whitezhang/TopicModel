 here in nanaimo (on vancouver island, for you furriners out there) we
 got the abc coverage on komo.  it probably depends on your cable company.
 
 i started off switching between the cbc and abc broadcasts, but finally
 settled on abc.  i can't stand don whitman, and al michaels was doing a
 decent job.  he followed the play pretty well, knew all the players'
 names, and only made a couple of "rookie" mistakes that i noticed.
 one thing that surprised me is that they never once attempted to explain
 the offside rule.
 
 am-i-paranoid-or-is-this-really-happening department:
 there were no fights in the game, but there were a couple of occasions
 where it looked like a fight was about to start.  both times abc cut
 away to show a closeup of a coach or mcnall or something.  has abc
 decided to adopt the "spicer policy?"
