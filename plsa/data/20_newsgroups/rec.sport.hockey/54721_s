 how did the leafs turn it around??? 
 
 
 i couldn't get the leaf games on the weekend in ca.
 
 did the leaf defense wise up overnight?
 did the leafs get in the slot or 
 was it just "fluke" goals in a goalie duel? 
 did the wings turn off the jets or muscle?  
 what gives here?
 
 i caught game 1 on satellite.  i figured my leafs were washed.
 this is a _major_ turnaround.   very few predicted this. 
 how, how, how did it happen?   
 
 wing and leaf perspectives welcomed!
