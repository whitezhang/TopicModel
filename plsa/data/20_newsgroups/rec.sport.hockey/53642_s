 speaking of "die hard", that's what i did when i read this, died hard
 laughing!
 
 toronto, to the cup finals???
 
 first of all, has anyone on the planet heard of the team from detroit?  al
 morgani (or however you spell the idiot's name) must be from chicago,
 because on espn, he said "it's not even close--chicago will definatly win
 the norris division in the playoffs, no other team is close."  everyone is
 picking chicago!  i don't get it, he says it's an "easy choice"?
 god, chicago was 1-4-1 against the wings, and they won the division by a
 point or two, followed closely by toronto, who is also a good team!
 as for the leafs beating detroit--doubt it, but even if they do, they
 aren't going to get by chicago.  if (even more amazingly) they get past the
 hawks, they would probably face vancouver, and lose.
 as for the habs reaching the finals, forget it.  even i, as a devoted wings
 fan, will watch the penguins easily three-peat as cup winners.  lemieux,
 jagr, tocchet, stevens, and barrasso, its a done deal.  sorry detroit, wait
 til next year.
 but hey, these were paul's picks, and everyone has a right to their own
 opinnions, but the leafs to the finals??? yeah. if they make it there, i'll
 walk to toronto to get some tickets, and that's a 700 mile walk!

 detroit red wings--the forgotten team!  go wings!!  let's hope the penguins
 go out
 early!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
