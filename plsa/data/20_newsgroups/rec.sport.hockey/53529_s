 actually this stuff from mogilny doesn't surprise me all that much.  about 4
 or 5 weeks ago i read in the toronto sun a quote from alex; it went something
 like [sarcastically]:
 
 "yep, patty's the man.  he's responsible for the team's success...i'm a 
 nobody around here."
 
 i was going to post it at the time...i must have forgot since nobody else 
 was talking about him being a problem.

 yep, i'd beat the shit out of him too.  lafontaine really must be a team
 player...makes you wonder what the islander management was thinking.
 my question is what the hell is muckler doing?  whether he wishes to admit it
 or not, the team is his to coach, and if he can't do the job then maybe the
 job should be given to somebody who can.  
 
 gee, kinda like alex's spot on the team, isn't it?
