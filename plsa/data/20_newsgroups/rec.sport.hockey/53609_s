 yes, it's a shame that the nhl lost a fine team in one of the best
 hockey markets in the country.  being a north stars fan, it is sad to
 see all of the tradition of the last 26 years get thrown into oblivion
 at the hands of a truly crappy owner.
 
 hopefully the nhl will install an expansion franchise in the twin cities
 within the next five years.  even if this is the case, a lot has been
 lost in the north stars move...
