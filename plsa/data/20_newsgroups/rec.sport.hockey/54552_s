 gerald, the alberta election is slated fou 7 june, unless something re?ally goes 
 wrong this time!!  pocklington could end up being the embarassment of klein
 if he goes ahead with his 'ultimatum'.

 gerald,  people still have an axe to grind with this guy.  i cannot see him staying for long.

 gerald, don't blame sather.  this battle between the peole and pocklington
 started in 1986 and got worst when pocklington sold gretzky.  
 
 there were days when you can shake the hand of pocklington when he was
 respectalbe( i use to do so in 1982 - 1983 season) , but those days are goe!!
