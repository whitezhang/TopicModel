 with the recent demise of the chicago blawkhawks (much to my delight) i
 noticed their 8 (?) game playoff losing streak (4 to the pens last year, and
 now 4 to the blues) and i am wondering what the nhl record for consecutive
 losses is, if there even is one...
 
 i'm pretty sure that the hawks have at least a 9 game losing  streak, since
 they've had to have lost a series since their last championship (whenever that
 was)
 
 basically, i need something else to rag on my hawks-fan friend with :)
