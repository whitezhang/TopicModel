 the probability is that the oilers are not going anywhere.
 
 pocklington has chosen this moment to make his "last" stand is
 because he is at the moment of maximum advantage...the provincial
 government is months away from a provincial election...it is
 the moment when he has maximum power to convince northlands
 to give him a better arena deal or a better purchase price...
 and it is before the nhl's new collective agreement with
 the players which might involve some enhanced revenue-sharing.
 
 pocklington is many things...stupid is not one of them.
 
 he can dictate terms...because other cities will pay his
 price if edmonton doesn't.
 
 edmonton has already fucked up its international airport, and
 surrendered supremacy to calgary, and over the next few years
 edmonton is going to take a hard hit from government cutbacks.
 it will screw itself beyond recogniton if it manages to find
 a way to lose its hockey team too...because northlands wants
 to continue to use the oilers to subsidize horse racing.
 
 however, in this case, about the long-term financial
 viability of the oilers, the fact is that pocklington is basically 
 right, regardless of who owns the team, and it is right to provoke
 the crisis now, before the team accumulates millions of dollars
 in losses, or becomes habitually uncompetitive because of lack
 of money.
 
 sather has done his job...the oilers are poised to be competitive
 again very soon (al strachan, one of the most knowledgeble hockey
 writers in canada in a post-mortem of the oilers season in
 the globe and mail recently agrees with me.)
