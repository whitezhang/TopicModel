 well, suffice to say that it is a sport for those able to make the
 substantial investment in equipment, etc. but here's something, do 
 you think that the availability of in-line skates and road hockey
 could contribute to a rise in awareness of ice hockey? i would
 argue this is having an effect here. kids play ice hockey in the
 winter and road hockey in the summer with in-line skates.
