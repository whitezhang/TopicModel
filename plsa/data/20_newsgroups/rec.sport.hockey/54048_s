 hey man! -
 
 having spent the past season learning to skate and having played a
 couple of sessions of mock hockey, i'm ready to invest in hockey
 equipment (particularly since i will be taking summer 'hockey
 lessons').  however, i am completely and profoundly ignorant when it
 comes to hockey equipment.  i've checked out local stores and looked
 at catalogs, but i was hoping to solicit opinions/suggestions before
 actually plunking down any money.  having played football in high
 school and college i at least have that equipment as a basis for
 comparison.  but for example what are the advantages/disadvantages to
 different kinds of shoulder pads and pants/girdles?  are there any
 notoriously bad or unsafe brands or styles?  etc.  so any suggestions
 or comments would be greatly appreciated.
