 the worst thing is that this is exactly what i did last year.  i had the rangers
 on msg, and the two different games on scny and sca on at the same time.  yes,
 i'd rather have sc cover it, just for the amount of coverage.

 i think thorne earns his money.  the best part is that he is the same way when 
 he is earning his $$ from sportschannel as the devils announcer (i.e.,
 unbiased).  he goes orgasmic for goals, despite which team scores, and even more 
 excited (if possible) for great saves.  he did a good job of explaining certain 
 things to non-hockey types without offending those of us who follow the sport
 (unlike nbc's clowns for the asg).

       don't any of you pittsburgh fans tell me how mike lang(e) is better. 
       maybe if he were a little spontaneous, rather than reading rehearsed
       lines of b.s having nothing to do with hockey he would be better.
