 lori, the regular penguins poster here on rec.sport.hockey, indicated to me
 via e-mail that on the nights that pirates baseball and penguins playoff

 this is wjr in detroit and it's 760 am. however, as i neglected to mention in
 my earlier response to this thread,  on the nights when the tigers baseball
 games coincide with the wings' playoff games, the wings will be carried on
 wllz fm (98.7).
