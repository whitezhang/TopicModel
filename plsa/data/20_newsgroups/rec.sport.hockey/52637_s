 on the lindros "trade":  like ottawa would be stupid enough to get
 lindros.  why do you think quebec traded him?  lindros would go on
 personal strike again...maybe i should talk to ottawa mgmt. about
 arranging such a trade....  ;-)
 
 on that xenophobe:  thankfully nobody agreed with him publicly.  maybe we
 should look at baseball, the supposed "american" pasttime (sp?).  look at
 all the damn latin americans playing there!  they should all be deported! 
 they aren't american!  (add sarcasm to taste)
 
 to roger:  wow, for once we agree.  i hope this isn't a sign of things to
 come.... i'll become a ranting lunatic who talks about nothing but the
 leafs being the best in the campbell.  ;-)
 
 on the rangers:  i told someone that nothing that happened in the patrick
 would surprise me anymore.  i lied.  how the hell can a team go into
 washington, earn a shutout, then come back home and lose to pitiful
 hartford?  the absolute *pinnacle* of mediocrity.  i can't stand it.
 from what i've read, the goalie is to blame this time, as beezer played
 pretty poorly.  smith is talking about calling up corey hirsch from
 binghamton, everybody is pointing fingers... this is definitely not the
 same team which wanted to prove itself in washington.  *now* nothing that
 happens in the patrick will surprise me.  (yeah, right... ;-)
