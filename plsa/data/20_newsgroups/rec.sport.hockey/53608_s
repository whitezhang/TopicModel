 you know... after i finished laughing i thought:  this would be a great
 final.  two canadian teams with lots of tradition and all that don cherry
 nonsense behind them and a nail-biter finish.
 
 of course, i would prefer a vancouver--montreal final with vancouver
 scoring the final goal....
 
 pity neither will happen.
