 dallas helps hawks stay in moncton
 after announcing that they would pull their affiliation out
 of moncton, the winnipeg jets changed their mind. 
 
 the jets announced the move when they said that they would be slashing
 their minor league roster from 20-something to around a dozen; and they
 wanted to share with an existing ahl or ihl franchise.
 
 enter the dallas lone stars. dallas agreed to supply the remaining
 6 or 8 players to the moncton franchise. thus keeping the hawks
 in the new brunswick city.
 
 the deal is for one year and will be extended to three years if
 the season ticket base increases to over 3000. the hawks only sold
 1400 for this year.
