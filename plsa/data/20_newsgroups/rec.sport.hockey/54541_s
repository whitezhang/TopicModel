 gaetz won't be back. there's been rumors he was officially released right at
 the end of the season when his contract expired, but i haven't seen
 confirmation. it was clear from my talks with the sharks doctors that he
 wasn't going to make it for a while, and the sharks would have to sign him
 to a contract, which given his problems competing at the ihl level this
 spring, doesn't make sense.
