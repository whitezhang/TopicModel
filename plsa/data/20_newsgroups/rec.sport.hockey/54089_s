 fedorov, primeau, kozlov, lidstrom, sillinger, konstantinov, drake,
 kennedy, racine, and cheveldae were already in the pipeline due to
 devellano...murray inherited these guys...in addition to yzerman,
 probert, carson, chiasson, etc.

 no...quinn had far less...murray took over detroit at a time to 
 take advantage of all of devellano's good drafting...if devellano
 had not given in to demers request to make the oates trade, he might
 still be gm.
