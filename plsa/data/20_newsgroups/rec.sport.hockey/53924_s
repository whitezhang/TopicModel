 
 	on tuesday, when it was raining in chicago, espn provided 
 bonus hockey coverage.  now it seems as though some fans are ticked off
 that the ny-wash ot was replaced with the angels-?? game.  people must
 realize that there are more baseball fans instead of hockey fans in the u.s  
 the baseball game was scheduled to air and advertisers money was paid so
 they can't skip the baseball game.  why don't you people chill out
 and enjoy whatever coverage you can get.
