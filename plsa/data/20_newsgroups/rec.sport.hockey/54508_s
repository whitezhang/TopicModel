 well that's really great pat.  i guess since you've played a little you thereby 
 qualify as an expert.  especially since you watch all the games on t.v.  all 
 that qualifies you as is a armchair quarterback or a coach potato

 again just further evidence as to what kind of an expert you are.  truly a 
 stupid statement.  mario is definately one of the best players to play the game.
 i'm not saying he is the best to ever play the game, but he should come to
 mind when that question is asked.  let's face it, he just returns from 
 radiation therapy with around a dozen games left, overtakes lafontaine for the
 scoring lead and then buries him!!!!  no, i guess he just got lucky.
 speaking of lafontaine, now there's a guy who should be considered for the
 hart trophy as well, certainly one of the better players in the league this
 year.
