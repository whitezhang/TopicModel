 as far as cheveldae is concerned, he is a decent goalie.  the most logical
 trade in the offseason to me would be between detroit and ny rangers.  i'm sure
 if beezer would be traded he would enjoy the opportunity to go back to his
 roots in detroit.  he would be a valuable asset to the wings and perhaps the
 rangers could get a zombo in return?  beezer got a few good years in him and
 the opportunity to get a fresh start would energize his play.
