   game two of the detroit - toronto series will be a rougher game.  i believe
 that clark will be coming out hitting on all cylindars.  i believe that probert
 will take exception to this and a fight between clark and probert will result.
   i know this sounds kind of ridiculous, but i know game two toronto will come
 out hitting.
   any takers on this issue?
