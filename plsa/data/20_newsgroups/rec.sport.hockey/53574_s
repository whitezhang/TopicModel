 
 	here is an update on the goalie mask poll...
 	first, since so many people gave me their 3 best, i decided to
 give 3 pts for their favorite, 2 pts for 2nd, 1 for 3rd. if you e-mailed
 a response with only one, i gave it 3 pts. please feel free to send me
 your 2 other favorites, if you only sent one before. 
 	also, votes are still welcome! any mask you like will do, as i 
 have received votes for players not in the nhl. please mention what team
 they play for, though.
 	so here are the up-to-date results so far:
 
 player                 team              pts     votes
