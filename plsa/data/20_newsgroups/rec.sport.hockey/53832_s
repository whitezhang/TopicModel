 	yeah, the news is true...the leafs lost to the wings 6-3.
 wish i could say i'd seen the whole game but my husband wanted
 to watch "young guns ii" on another channel. sometime between
 the first time i tuned in and d saw the leafs tie and the next time
 i tuned in and heard the score was 5-1, something happened.
 	please no woofing from red wings fans.  they're my third
 favourite team, and if they make it past the leafs i'll wish them
 luck.  as for potvin...well, it was his fist playoff game.
