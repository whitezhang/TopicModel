 teemu selanne had 3 goals, keith tkachuk had one, and luciano borsato
 scored a rare jets shorthanded goal as the jets held on to beat the
 canucks 5-4, and close the series to 2-1.  trevor linden and pavel
 bure had two goals each for the canucks in a losing cause.
 
 selanne came out of a two game goal scoring slump, scoring two powerplay
 goals, and one on a nice breakaway pass from darrin shannon.
 
 hard work paid off tonight for the jets, and if the jets continue to
 exhibit this strong work effort, they can make a series of it. (i woofed
 last year when we were up 3-1...i ain't going to do that again.  i'll
 have to be quietly happy with a solid performance.  ;)
