 on the other hand, i'm hard pressed to think of any other real mistakes
 fereirra made.  imagine indeed, but then again we have the benefit of
 hindsight.
 
 let's say that in the view of the sharks' upper management, the attempt
 to trade kisio was a major factor in the decision to fire feirerra.
 i'm inclined to take exactly the opposite view:  they should have kept
 him...he's obviously the luckiest man in hockey!  (wonder what
 sacrifice he made to the muse of fax?  (his job, i guess.))
 
 have fun
