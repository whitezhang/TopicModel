   actually, what i think has become more evident, is that you are determined to
   flaunt your ignorance at all cost.  jagr did not have a better season than
   francis ... to suggest otherwise is an insult to those with a modicum of
   hockey knowledge.  save your almost maniacal devotion to the almighty
   plus/minus ... it is the most misleading hockey stat available.
 
   until the nhl publishes a more useful quantifiable statistic including ice
   time per game and some measure of its "quality" (i.e., is the player put out
   in key situations like protecting a lead late in the game; is he matched up
   against the other team's top one or two lines; short-handed, etc), i would
   much rather see the +/- disappear altogether instead of having its dubious
   merits trumpeted by those with little understanding of its implications.
