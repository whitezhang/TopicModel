 do you have a basis for this claim?  try these stats (taken from playboy magazine
 june 1989):
 
 percentage of pro football fans who have attended college:    39.7
 percentage of pro baseball fans who have attended college:    41.5
 percentage of pro basketball fans who have attended college:  39.9
 percentage of pro hockey fans who have attended college:      54.6
 
 percentage of pro football fans who earn more than $50k:      34.9
 percentage of pro baseball fans who make more than $50k:      22.7
 percentage of pro basketball fans who make more than $50k:    27.7
 percentage of pro hackey fans who make more than $50k:        44.0

 the biggest advantage that kids from boondock or weedville have is the
 availability of ice.  in the san jose area we have a population of 800,000
 and that population is served by 2 ice arenas.  in contrast, kamloops,
 british columbia has a population of about 50,000 and has 5 rinks!  there
 are also myriad ponds, pools, etc that freeze in the winter.  down here
 it's hard to find a kid without a bicycle; up there it's hard to find a kid
 without a pair of skates.  and before you say "what does he know? he's from
 california." let me say that i was born and raised in trail, british columbia,
 a town of about 8,000 with lots of ice in the winter.  my father did radio
 play by play for the local team, the trail smokeaters, who by  the way, were
 the last canadian team to win the world championship (back in 1961).  i was
 on skates almost as soon as i could walk, and have been playing recreational
 hockey for about 35 years.

 lack of ice is a big factor, but costs is a bigger factor.  both my kids play for
 the santa clara valley hockey association and this season, which just ended,
 cost me $75 per kid for membership in hockey usa, plus $750 per kid for club
 dues.  the hockey usa fees cover excess medical insurance, and the club dues
 cover ice time, officials, trophies, etc.  other areas have similar fees, unless
 the city government subsidises some of the costs, as stockton does.
 
 by the way; most ice arenas are located in what could be called the "inner city"
 areas.  eastridge and vallco are exceptions ... redwood city's rink is in an
 industrial area on bay rd, near 101, berkeley's is near ashby and martin luther
 king, stockton's is in oak park, sacramento's is in an older section of downtown
 (i forget the name of the street), fresno's is out on the edge of town, just west
 of 99.  santa rosa's is a nice rink, but it's in an older section of town.
 dublin's is outside of town, off 580.  most of the rinks are old, and expensive
 to run, with huge electric bills and insurance premiums.  if you want to buy ice
 time expect to pay around $100 per hour at any of these rinks.  some of them
 give you a 60 minute hour for your money; others give you a 50 minute hour and
 include the resurfacing time in the fee.
