 	well, druce pretty much sucked when he was with the caps. he had one
 good **playoffs** (not season). oh well. the caps are notorious for making
 stupid trades anyway, as can be seen with the cicarelli and hrivnak trades.
 sigh.
 	in another note... i'd have to say the caps biggest surprise was 
 cote, as many caps fans had been expecting a lot from bondra already.
