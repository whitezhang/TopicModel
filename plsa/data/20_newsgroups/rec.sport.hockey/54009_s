 bowman is in the hockey hall of fame as a coach already...and unlike
 gil stein...he didn't get their by stacking the board of directors! -)

 bowman is the genius...johnson isn't.  bowman is a great coach...johnson,
 a very good one.  however, bowman is really not a modern coach, and
 patrick's solution of having him only run the team on game days, and
 delegate most of the day-to-day responsibity to the assistants is
 a shrewd managerial decision on patrick's part.
