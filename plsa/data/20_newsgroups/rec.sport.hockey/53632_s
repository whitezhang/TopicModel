 	i think that you are incorrect, roger.  patrick,
 smythe and adams all played or coached in the league before becoming
 front office types.  hence, they did help build the league, although
 they were not great players themselves.  
 
 	i agree that a name is a name is a name, and if some people
 have trouble with names that are not easily processed by the fans,
 then changing them to names that are more easily processed seems like
 a reasonable idea.  if we can get people in the (arena) door by being
 uncomplicated, then let's do so.  once we have them, they will realize
 what a great game hockey is, and we can then teach them something
 abotu the history of the game.

 	no, i would not want to see a ballard division.  but to say
 that these owners are assholes, hence all nhl management people are
 assholes would be fallacious.  conn smythe, for example, was a classy
 individual (from what i have heard). 
 
 	also, isn't the point of "professional" hockey to make money
 for all those involved, which would include the players.  what i think
 you might be saying is that the players have not made as much money as
 should have been their due, and it is the players that are what make
 the game great not the people who put them on the ice, so naming
 division after management people rather than players is adding insult
 (in the form of lesser recognition) to injury (less money than was
 deserved).
