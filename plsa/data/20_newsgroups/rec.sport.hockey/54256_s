 
 here we are with the sabres up 2-0 to the bruins and the sabres' farm
 team, the rochester amerks, on their way to the calder cup (urp!) and
 what kind of hockey coverage are we getting? the same penguins/devils
 every other day crap that everyone else gets. what's worse, the
 sportschannel coverage of the islanders appears to be blocked out,
 since we got cba basketball last night, if you can believe it.  i
 assume the sabres are demanding the sc blackout, not espn, since we
 are, unbelievably, usually considered part of the islanders territory
 (msg coverage of the rangers is blacked out here). this despite being
 a solid seven hours plus from long island.
 
 does anyone know what grc is doing, besides putting their satellite
 dish up their ass and screwing my reception of channels 8, 10, and 13?
 did empire demand a fortune for the games? what about the games on
 fox37 (or whatever number it is there in buffalo)? has anyone phoned
 to complain (besides me)?
