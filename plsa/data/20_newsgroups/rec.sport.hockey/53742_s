 
 and now, i interrupt your regularly scheduled news reading to bring you 
 another message sponsored by the department of really mundane statistics:
 
 i passed the final individual player stats posted here the other day through
 a filter to average out games, goals, assists, points, and penalty minutes
 for the mythical average nhl pro who played in the league this season. (why?
 because it's monday and i didn't feel like writing any real code...)
 
 anyway, after i wiped out the 60-odd goalies in the list, i came up with:
 
 nhl average:		55 gp      11 g      19 a      30 pts      69 pim
 
 then i passed the list through a second time to come up with the players who
 had the smallest percentage difference in each of the categories.
 
 marty mcinnis (nyi)	56 gp (1%) 10 g (9%) 20 a (5%) 30 pts (0%) 24 pim (65%)
 igor kravchuk (edm)	55 gp (0%) 10 g (9%) 17 a (10%) 27 pts (9%) 27 pim (53%)
 
 these two are close in games, goals, assists, and points, but are too far off
 in pim. this leaves, as the most average player in the nhl:
 
 bobby carpenter (was)	65 gp (18%) 11 g (0%) 17 a (10%) 28 pts (6%) 63 pim (8%)
 
 what an honor.
 
 i also passed the list through with the goalies still included. kravchuk and
 carpenter were still in the top three, but rob dimaio came flying up from 
 behind to take the title:
 
 nhl average:		53 gp      10 g      17 a      27 pts      64 pim
 igor kravchuk (edm)     55 gp (3%) 10 g (0%) 17 a (0%) 27 pts (0%) 27 pim (50%)
 bobby carpenter (was)   65 gp (22%) 11 g (10%) 17 a (0%) 28 pts (3%) 63 pim (1%)
 rob dimaio (tb)		54 gp (1%) 9 g (9%) 15 a (11%) 24 pts (11%) 62 pim (3%)
 
 
 it's all really kind of underwhelming when you think about it.
