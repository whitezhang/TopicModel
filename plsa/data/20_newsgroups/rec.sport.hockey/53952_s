 that was clint malarchuk.  that was a very dangerous accident.  he could he
 died right there on the ice.  however, he has played since  
 but i don't know where he is now.  i think he is still playing but i'm
 not positive.  he was a sabre at the time.
 i don't know who skated into him though.

 i remember a couple of seasons before the malarchuk incident borje
 salming of toronto fell down in the crease and someone skated into
 his face.  that took a lot of stiches to fix.
