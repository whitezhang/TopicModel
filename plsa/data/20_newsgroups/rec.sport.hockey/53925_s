 quebec dominated habs for first 2 periods and only roy kept
 this one from being rout, although he did blow 2nd goal.
 canadians showed up in third but nords were playing dump &
 pull back most of the time. hextall made some good saves but
 really this one was lost in first period when nords scored 3
 & could have had 5, plus another 4 in 2nd. canadians are dead
 meat, they may take one or 2 but this one is over. tee it up
 jacques, next time you might rest players & forget about 1st
 place, welcome to the adams division.
