 i'm in edmonton, and while that's usually (or at least often) the case,
 here we were "treated" to the actual abc telecast of the kings/flames
 game.  i'm with whoever said it earlier - don witless (er, whitman) is
 a poor commentator, and not just for hockey.  normally, if the oilers
 were still playing (augh), i would turn off the sound and listen to 
 the radio broadcast to get decent play-by-play announcing.
