 	it's not really crap you know... only half crap ;-)   from what i 
 understand it's very expensive to play hockey south of the border... 
 (actually it's not that cheap up hear either... though once you have all the
 equipement it's not more than $300 a year... actually i haven' played in
 about 8 years so i could be off a bit... )  in the states, where ice time
 is considerably more expensive it can cost over a thousand a year... compare 
 this to baseball and you'll see that hockey is a sport for the well-to-do...
 and this brings up the fact that the well-to-do in the us are majority white...
 
 btw: what was the original question... i think it has to do with the hispanic
 communtiy and playing hockey.... 
 
 
 					cheers!
