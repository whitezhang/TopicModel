 yes, yes, i can see it now >>>> all those sabre fans finally taking
 their sabre sweaters out of the moth balls and proudly wearing them.
 after 9 years of playoff frustration and being up 3 games to nil
 i guess it is a pretty good bet.    but there has not been a team
 that has come back from an 0-3 deficit since 1975 - could this be
 the year.   (don't throw out the moth balls yet)
