 i'd like to add that i think canadian hockey fans like don because his kind of hockey (the hockey he promotes in his tv appearances) is the kind that they think used to get played in the old 6 team nhl. so there's a kind of nostagia for the old days, before expansion, the soviet series, gretzky and even bobby orr, when guys weren't afraid to take a hit, nobody floated and defensemen played defence. who cares that that probably never really existed, the myth is still around in canada and all the european in
 
 
 
 fluence on the game has diminished it in some people's eyes.
 
 personally, i'd like to add before i get flamed, i love the fast-paced "european" game and think don cherry is a bit of an idiot. i have to say that i missed him when i was living in the states, though. he is entertaining, even if you end up throwing your popcorn at the screen when he's on.
