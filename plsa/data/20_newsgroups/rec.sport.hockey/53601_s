 it seemed pretty conclusive to me.  the puck clearly hit the crossbar
 and then came down on the line.  and the announcers, admittedly homers,
 kept harping about how they "must have had a different view upstairs"
 because it was obvious to them, and, i would have thought, to anyone who
 saw the replay, that the puck didn't go in.  the referee originally 
 signalled no goal but the video replay "judges" initiated contact with
 the referee to claim that a goal was in fact scored.  this, to me, is
 unheard of.  seeing stuff like this happen gives me a bad feeling about
 the leaf chances this year.
 
 cordially, as always,
