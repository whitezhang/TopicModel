 local to the joe louis arena? you mean local to olympia stadium, where
 red wings games were played until fairly recently (early 80s comes to
 mind). as far as i know, the rest of the post is basically correct. if
 what you meant by local was simply detroit and i'm being incredibly
 picky, okay, sorry about that.
