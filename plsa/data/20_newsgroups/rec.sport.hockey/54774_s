 the top 11 teams of this tournament will play in the olympics next year.
 the last team of this tournament, top two of pool b (great britain and 
 poland) and the winner of pool c (latvia) will play for the last olympic 
 spot next fall.
   however, if next year's hosts norway were to finish 12th (which would be 
 no surprise), then it's the 11th team of pool a that will have to play in 
 the qualification tournament.
