 well, partly because i, as an ardent fan of both sports, would rather
 see game 3 of the nhl playoffs than game 3 of 162 of the mlb
 season (even if the bb game involves the red sox).	
 
 espn may have had contractual obligations. i understand that part.
 but it's a bit inaccurate to call us "selfish" just because we want
 to watch the watch the game we love. am i, as a baseball fan, "selfish"
 when i get pissed a cbs for showing approximately one game per month?
 i don't think so.
 
 while, espn may have contractual obligations, we, as their consumers,
 have a right to voice our displeasure with how they are serving us.
 there's certainly nothing wrong with that.
