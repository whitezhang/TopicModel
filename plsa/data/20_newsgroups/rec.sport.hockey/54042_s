 it is indeed nice to have fans that are concerned about the dearth of
 disputatious dissertation linked to my hiatus.  have simply been too
 damned busy lately to keep you lads and lassies entertained.  you can
 be sure, however, that i will somehow manage to find time to woof if 
 the leafs give just cause. 
 
 and let's all try to keep people's names (especially mine) out of the
 subject headers.  i, for one, neither seek nor enjoy such a cheap form
 of notoriety.
 
 one thing you can be assured of, however, is this: the leafs are the
 best of all the teams in the league that have allowed 12 goals in 2 
 games.
