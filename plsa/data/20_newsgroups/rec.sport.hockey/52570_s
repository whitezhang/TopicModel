 agreed here...i'll never forget dan kelly calling the play-by-play in the '87
 canada cup.  he was masterful!
 
 and danny gallivan will _never_ be replaced; even now when i watch hnic i
 remember his voice...when i see an al macinnis or al iafrate (hey, what's with
 these guys named al who can shoot??) shot from the point i still think
 "blistering blast"...thn had a tribute to gallivan in the issue following his
 death; in the story they included a quote from one of the games he did.  it
 went: 
 
 "it appears risebrough has pugnaciously construed that check," he said, "and 
 will undoubtedly make a visitation to the box of punition."
 
 classic, vintage gallivan!  he's sorely missed.  so here's to two of the best
 there was and best that ever will be.
