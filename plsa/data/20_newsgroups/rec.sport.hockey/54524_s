 i think joe kocus should play every night.   he is a big physical guy, and  
 he gets the fans into the game with some big hits.  (both checks and  
 fists)  its a big advantage to get the crowd going.  plus, he helps  
 protect the other players.  notice there are very few fights when kocur is  
 on the ice unless he is it.  i have seen people start to go after essa  
 tikkanen, only to go slinking away when kocur steps in.  i think he is big  
 asset, but should be third line, and special situation only play.
