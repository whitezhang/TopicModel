 at least last night there was some excitement. the pens 
 didn't have it wrapped up before the game was half over like 
 the previous two games. i'm not sure if nj just rose up and 
 played better or if the penguins just started to play down 
 somewhat. probably it was somewhere in between. new jersey 
 seemed much more aggressive last night in the pens end. they 
 did much more swarming around, which at least kept an 
 element of suspense in the game. no question that billington 
 helped make it more interesting also. claude lemieux didn't 
 help the cause any though, with his ejection early in the 
 game. so, who's going to start in the devils goal for the 
 "final" game sunday? ;-) sorry. i couldn't help myself.
