  gr> over the jets last night.  i know the score, but that rarely describes
  gr> the game. could someone please post a brief sonapsis (sp?) of waht
  gr> happened.  how well did each team play?  were the cannucks deserving of
  gr> the victory? 
  gr> also, could some kind soul please email me the end of season,
  gr> individual player stats?

  gr> -- vancouver for the cup (in a virtual reality)--
 
 
 
             i am sorry to tell you this greg, but in all
             reality, we cannot see vancouver winning the
             cup.  they have a rrally good chance to come
             out of the smythe division, and a chance to make 
             it to the finals, but no one is capable this year
             of beating the penguins, they have too many
             scoring threats. i would love to be proven wrong, but
             i must conclude that the pens will win cup 3 this year.
