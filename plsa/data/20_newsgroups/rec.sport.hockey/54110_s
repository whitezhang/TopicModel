 generally i agree with you. however, (1) last night espn cut away to baseball
 tonite, which looks like sportscenter tailored to baseball, and they cut
 away at 7:40 pacific. that's quite a contract they have there. (2) if
 espn couldn't deliver, they should have had a transistion plan to
 let sportschannel pick up the slack.
 
 nonetheless, it is ultimately the fault of the us-american public that regular
 season baseball has precedence over playoff hockey in the u.s.
 support your team; support your game.
 
 somebody in r.s.h. had an excellent idea that we should write chrysler
 to thank them for supporting hockey with their ads and that we would
 consider their products. here's an equally excellent idea, watch
 baseball for 10 minutes (i know i'm asking a lot, but that's what spew
 bags are for), write down who is advertising, and write them letters
 complaining that they are supporting baseball to your displeasure and
 that you won't consider buying their products because of it.
