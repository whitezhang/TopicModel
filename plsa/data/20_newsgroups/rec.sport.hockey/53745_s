 what is the policy regarding players and the minor league playoffs versus wc?
 i know that the rangers are holding back kovalev, zubov, and andersson for
 binghamton, but i also know that the whalers wanted michael nylander to play
 for springfield, while nylander wanted to play for sweden. the whalers allowed
 the nhl to decide, and the nhl chose the wcs. how does this differ from the
 rangers and oilers? did the whalers have to go through the league, or could
 they have forced nylander to play in springfield?
