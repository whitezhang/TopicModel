 support a team in miami is crazy; espaecially when you have really deserving 
 cities without a team such as san diego & milwaukee. i wish the panthers or
 whatever their name is well but if they can't sell to hispanics, they're in
 deep doo-doo. already, there are rumors that tampa may move to milwaukee.
