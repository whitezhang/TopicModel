  bill ranford stopped 36 shots to lead canada to a 4-1 victory in a very well
  played game.
 
  the first period started with a give away from a canadian defenseman and
  rundqvist came in alone on ranford but couldn't put the puck over a sliding
  ranford. later on, kevin dineen had a great opportunity but soderstrom 
  played very well too. stefan nilsson had a couple of great dekes and set up
  jan larsson but again ranford came up big. period ended scoreless but the edge
  to sweden in creating more opportunities.
  second period action saw tommy soderstrom making a great save. mark recchi
  made a backhanded cross ice pass to lindros, eric one timed the puck but
  soderstrom was there to make a glove hand save. at the 7-minute mark, canada
  started applying pressure on the swedes. sanderson-dineen-brind'amour worked
  hard and kept the puck in the swedes' zone. dineen gave the puck to sanderson
  who skated around a screened swedish defenseman, came in on soderstrom and
  made a wrist shot that went it by soderstrom's far post, 1-0 canada.
  the swedes picked up their game after that, and peter forsberg had a shot
  that hit ranford's post (the inside), went parallel to the goal line and out.
  then gartner got a penalty and the swedes a power play. jan larsson took
  a shot from the slot, ranford gave a rebound to larsson who saw juhlin by
  the far post, passed the puck and ranford was beat, 1-1.
  third period started as the other periods, swedes having most of the pressure
  but the canadians always dangerous once they were close to the swede goal.
  at 5:54, canada created some great chances and arto blomsten was forced to
  cover the puck in the swede goal crease since soderstrom lost sight of it.
  that resulted in a penalty shot, since a defenseman can't cover the puck in 
  the goal crease. geoff sanderson took the penalty shot (his first ever, he
  explained afterwards), and he put it low on soderstrom's stick side, close
  to the post. excellent penalty shot to give canada a go ahead goal.
  canada increased the lead on a very suspect offside, gartner volleyed a
  bouncing puck past soderstrom to make it 3-1. the swedes ran out of gas
  then and couldn't produce as good scoring chances as they had for 2,5 periods.
  the 4-1 goal came with only 1 second left, rod brind'amour scoring on a
  rebound from soderstrom, where the swedish defense already had their minds
  in the dressing room.
 
  a very good game (the best in the wc so far?), with both goalies playing
  great. soderstrom best player in sweden, but ranford even played better
  than soderstrom, that tells you something about ranford. probably the best
  goalie in the world, were some comments after the game.
  canada played a very disciplined defense, ranford pointed out that it is
  easy to play well with a good defense. lindros played a lot and played well,
  sanderson naturally game hero with two goals.
 
  the forsberg-naslund-bergqvist line sweden's best along with larsson-juhlin-
  nilsson. swedish defense played well, 197 cm 104 kg peter popovic had the
  task of neutralizing 192 cm 107 kg eric lindros, and managed this very well.
  ranger defenseman peter andersson finally got to go to the wc, and considering
  that he landed in germany just a few hours before the game, he played very
  well. swedish coach curt lundmark was irritated after the game, partly because
  of the swedes inability to score, and partly because of the linesman's mistake
  on the 1-3 goal.

  the czechs were clearly better than the germans, and the german crowd
  showed their discontent by throwing in stuff on the ice after a while.

  finland - usa  1-1 (0-0,1-0,0-1)

  attendance: 2,800
 
  i hope some finns can provide information from this game (i didn't see the
  whole game). the finns took the lead on a jarkko varvio slap shot from the
  blue line, and a soft goal for an unscreened mike richter.
  as far as the play in the second period goes, the finns seemed to have the
  most control, so a 1-0 lead was warranted as i saw it.
