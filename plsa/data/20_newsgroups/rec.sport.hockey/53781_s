 apparently, part 2 (defensemen numbered 2 through 19) was lost when i posted
 it; to make things worse, i lost my own copy.  i have asked on the sharks
 mailing list, on which it did get out, to see if someone can mail me a copy
 back.  if someone responds, i will repost it when i get it; otherwise, i will
 re-write it in a day or two and post it.  sorry about that.
 
 #8	larry depalma		season:	3rd
 acquired:	'91-92, free agent from minnesota
 grade:		i (c-/d+)
 
 no netter/fan watching the sharks, including me, knows where depalma was at
 the end of the season; the sharks appeared to still have his rights, but he
 wasn't in san jose, he wasn't in kansas city, and his name hasn't appeared on
 the waiver wire.  and that kind of invisibility was prevalent for the most part
 for depalma.  after being called up october 30 against the tampa bay lightning,
 depalma had an excellent week, scoring 5 points in 3 games while playing good
 defense.  unfortunately, the 27-year-old depalma then disappeared the rest of
 the way, getting just 3 more points in 15 more games, and generally looked
 lethargic and uninterested on both ends of the ice.  he then was sent down to
 kansas city, walked out from there, and was suspended and later reinstated
 when it was revealed that he was injured; he then promptly disappeared from
 the watching eyes of shark bytes (as the mailing list is now known to sharks
 officials) faithful, and neither the sharks nor we miss him.
 
 #10	johan garpenlov		season: 3rd
 acquired:	'91-92, trade with detroit for d bob mcgill and 8th round
 		pick in '92 entry draft from vancouver
 grade:		a/a-
 
 after an early slump, garpenlov was nothing short of inspirational the rest
 of the way, finishing with 66 points in 79 games, second highest total on the
 team, as he clicked well with team mvp kelly kisio and right wing rob
 gaudreau.  kisio got most of the credit, but garpenlov, finishing second in
 the mvp voting, clearly demonstrated his playmaking and scoring skills, as he
 was seen making excellent centering passes as well as finishing passes to him
 by putting the puck past opposing goaltenders, getting a club-high 14 power-
 play goals.  contrary to his previous rep, garpenlov also showed that despite
 his small size (5' 11", 183 lbs.), he was willing to throw himself around
 when necessary, albeit not very successful yet.  he also still needs to work
 on his defense, although he improved tremendously throughout the season, and
 was actually quite a good penalty killer by the end of the season.  he will
 be a major key to the offense next year.
 
 #15	david bruce		season: 5th
 acquired:	'91-92, from st. louis in expansion draft
 grade:		i (?)
 
 after a banner '91-92, when he led the team in power-play goals (10) and
 was third in total scoring (38 points in 60 games), bruce was bothered
 virtually all of this season with a groin injury, which kept him out of the
 lineup for all by 17 games this season.  of course, it is difficult to
 speculate how well he would have done this season had he not been affected by
 the injury, but the 28-year-old bruce was effective with a man up or a man
 short in the sharks' first season, and was expected to be a strong offensive
 leader this season as well.  the injury appears serious, which is a shame,
 because otherwise he may have a much brighter future for now; instead, his
 future with the sharks next season appears clouded.
 
 #18	mark pederson		season:	3rd
 acquired:	'92-93, trade with philadelphia for c/lw dave snuggerud
 grade:		i (b)
 
 it is difficult for me to understand the flyers' decision to unload pederson,
 after a very good offensive season last season (40 points in 58 games), but
 after riding the pine early in the season, pederson was summarily sent to the
 sharks in exchange of the defensive-minded snuggerud, and he finished with
 41 games combined with the flyers and the sharks.  he was also limited by
 injuries this season, and this limited his production (17 points).  but when
 healthy, pederson appears impressive, with a good scoring touch, good size
 (and the willingness to throw it around, although he's not considered a
 physical forward), and good speed.  he also does not appear to be a liability
 on defense, but the sharks probably have to wait until next season to see how
 much, exactly, pederson can do.
 
 #20	john carter		season: 4th
 acquired:	'91-92, free agent from boston
 grade:		i (b+/b)
 
 carter was definitely one of the hardest workers on the team, and the hard
 work worked wonders, as at times he looked great on ice.  however, although he
 did look great at times, the fact that he received just 16 points (in 55
 games) for his efforts is a sign that there is only so much his hard work can
 do, and the sharks confirmed that by sending him to kansas city with about
 20 games left in the season.  carter, who will turn 30 on may 6, always
 hussled, but as a result, was sometimes trapped too deep within the offensive
 zone while forechecking, but he was generally a credit on the defensive end,
 but he is probably of limited utility in that capacity, and he did not impress
 offensively, although he was one of the best sharks at drawing penalties.  he
 is very unlikely to be back next season.
 
 #28	jean-francois quintin	season: 1st
 acquired:	'91-92, from minnesota in dispersal draft
 grade:		i (b+/b)
 
 i don't understand why the sharks didn't let quintin play any more than the
 14 games he played this season.  he was generally hard-working and creating
 opportunities offensively, and appeared, at age 23, ready for regular nhl
 duty, at least for a team like the sharks, finishing with 7 points in those
 14 games while not being a defensive liability.  shoulder injury in training
 camp before the '91-92 season limited quintin, the team's leading scorer in
 exhibition games despite sitting out the final two, to just 29 games with the
 sharks and the blades that season, but he looked impressive.  he should be a
 solid contender for regular duty next season.
 
 #41	mark beaufait		season: 1st
 acquired:	2nd round pick in 1991 supplemental draft
 grade:		i (?)
 
 after a all-star season at kansas city, beaufait got a cup of coffey with the
 sharks late in the season when the blades knocked down a playoff spot and the
 sharks decimated with injuries, playing 5 games and scoring a goal for his only
 nhl point thus far.  despite small size (5' 9", 165 lbs.), beaufait was not shy
 to throw himself around when necessary, and looked pretty good at times,
 although it's too early to judge him based on 5 nhl games, in which he played
 mostly left wing, away from his center position at northern michigan and
 kansas city.
 
 #42	jaroslav otevrel	season: 1st
 acquired:	8th round pick in 1991 entry draft
 grade:		i (?)
 
 like beaufait, otevrel also played away from his normal position when he was
 up for his cup of tea (7 games) midway through the season.  he was generally
 very much of a defensive liability, and did not show much offensively either,
 although that may be more indicative of the lack of ice time he got in those
 7 games.  he may need another season to work on his defense, but once his
 defense is acceptable, he should be ready.
 
 #44	michel picard		season: 1st
 acquired:	'92-93, trade with hartford for lw yvon corriveau
 grade:		i (b-/c+)
 
 the 23-year-old picard, although he perennially tore up the minors, seems to
 be close to being out of chances, for some reason, after being acquired by the
 sharks but failing to impress the management in 25 games, scoring 4 goals for
 his only points, and he spent most of the rest of the way in kansas city.
 he was not particularly strong defensively, and despite his offensive
 brilliance in the minors, he has failed thus far to score in the nhl, although
 he has been given limited opportunities.  he may be the sharks' bait in the
 expansion draft.
 
 #45	dody wood		season: 1st
 acquired:	3rd round pick in 1991 entry draft
 grade:		i (d+/d, although perhaps i shouldn't give a grade at all)
 
 i have been accused of knocking on wood too much. :-)  then, it is probably
 no surprise to you that i am thoroughly unimpressed by wood thus far, although
 13 games is a small example.  he was generally a nonfactor on offense, was
 not particularly good defensively, and took too many silly penalties, losing
 many fights in the process and gathering 69 penalty minutes in those 13 games,
 projecting to to 446(!) in an 84-game season.  he's not ready, and needs at
 least another season at kc, where he can work on his fighting skills, if
 nothing else.  his relatively small size (5' 11", 181 lbs.) does not give much
 possibility that he can survive, at this stage, as an enforcer.
