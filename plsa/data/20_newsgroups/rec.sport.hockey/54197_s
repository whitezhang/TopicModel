 never was?  probably.  is not now?  debatable.  what other valid test can
 you think of besides the final standings or divisional playoff winner?  what
 do you propose, a worthless vote like they do in college football?  what a
 joke!

 if i remember right, brad park was also involved in that trade.  he wasn't
 all that bad a hockey player.
 
 but let's look at some of sinden's trades over the years:
 
 ??? for rick middleton (rangers).  i don't know who sinden gave up for middle-
 ton, so i'll call this one a +.
 
 barry pederson for cam neely (canucks).  +++.  any questions?
 
 greg hawgood for vladimir ruzicka (oilers). ++.  didja see that one rosie
 roofed against roy in last year's playoffs?
 
 courtnall/ranford for andy moog (oilers).  a wash.  moog is a good goaltender,
 ranford burned boston in the finals in his first year, and courtnall always
 seems to get his points.  anyone in vancouver care to comment on courtnall
 as a defensive liability?
 
 ken linseman for dave poulin (flyers) ++.  any more questions?
 
 janney/quintal for adam oates (blues).  ++.  janney is an enormous talent and
 a personable guy, the the bruins play in adam's division.  enough said?
 
 so,even if you count the esposito/vadnais/ratelle/park/i don't remember who 
 else (joe zanussi?) trade as a double minus, harry the horse trader comes
 out on top.  i submit that the bruins are always good because of harry, not
 in spite of him.
 
 btw, do you really think the habs will bounce back next season.  i'll bet 
 they finish fourth or fifth in the conference, behind any of the following:
 pittsburgh, quebec, boston, washington, islanders.  someone correct me if
 these five teams will not be in montreal's conference.
 
 in summary, things look bleak for the habs, at least in the near future.  i
 suspect that the next team from la belle province to win the cup will be
 that team that lindros didn't want to play for.

 my two favorite hockey teams:  1) the boston bruins
                                2) whoever's playing pittsburgh
