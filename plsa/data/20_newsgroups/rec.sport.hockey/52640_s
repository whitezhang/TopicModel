 please.  have a care with phil.  we liked him a lot in pittsburgh.  he
 didn't score a lot if you look at his stats last year but he worked his
 butt off.  it was his speed that created opportunities in the offensive
 zone that allowed the pens to utilize his potential.  i haven't been
 paying attention to him this year so i can't say i know what you're 
 objecting to.  he has been out with injuries though, hasn't he?  and
 if the offense isn't there, there's not much his speed will do for you.
 like i said, he created opportunities but he didn't score much.  i thought
 the money offered from the rangers was a little high, and so did the pens,
 i guess.
