 perhaps it was trottier.  it happened behind the habs goal if i recall.
 gainey simply didn't have his head up as he was picking up the puck.

 if gilmour was taken completely by surprise, as gainey was, then yeah,
 i would have to say that doug wasn't playing "technically" smart 
 hockey.  in any case, to claim as greg did, that gainey *never* made 
 a technical mistake is absolutely ludicrous.

 good for you.  you'd only be displaying your ignorance of course, but to 
 each his own...
 
 >i think gainey would be honoured to know that you've included him
 
 i think gainey should feel honoured to know that he is remembered at 
 all.

 certainly pluggers are an integral part of any team.  and that is
 simply because there are not enough solid two-way players to go 
 around.  who would you rather have as your "checking" centre?  doug
 gilmour or doug jarvis?  for that matter i would take either gretzky
 or mario as my "checking" centres.  do you think gretzky could cover
 bob gainey?

 you're wrong again.  the selke is awarded to the forward that does the
 best job defensively and this may or may not be the best plugger.  if 
 gilmour does the best defensive job in the league i don't see why he 
 should be out of the running simply because he also contributes offen-
 sively.
 
 settle down?  if you think that i have likened the selke to the nobel
 prize then i suggest that you had best "settle down".  and if you are
 going to try to put words in my mouth, let me suggest that you "settle 
 down" before you bother following up on my postings.

 you might consider developing your own style.  after all, imitation is 
 the sincerest form of flattery and i am quite sure that flattery is not 
 your intention.
