 yes, he does.  but, the goalie sure as hell doesn't want him there!  when
 i played roller hockey (boy do i miss those days) as a goalie, i would
 scream at my defense to clear guys out of the slot.  i don't care if he's
 in the crease or not, get him the hell away from me so i can see the ball!
 (yes, roller hockey, remember)  and if there was nobody around to clear
 the slot, then i'd do it myself by pushing the offending player--*hard*. 
 i *hate* people in my way when i'm the goalie, and i am sure felix does
 too.  i should say that i didn't see the incident, so if potvin really
 swung the stick big time, then that's not right, but he can move people
 out of the way.  he's a player on the ice too, you know.  :-)
