 that would be clint malarchuck.  it was speculated at the time, that
 the injury was so serious that had he been playing at the other end
 of the rink at the time (he was playing in the same end as the
 ambulence is parked), he never would have survived.  ditto, if he
 were playing anything other than a league with an ambulance on 
 standby.
 
 if you've seen video tape of the incident, it is amazing how much blood
 there was.  it was literally spurting out all over the ice, as clint
 grabbed his neck and watched the puddle in horror.  
 
 amazingly enough, he made a full recovery, and played again in the
 nhl.  he was getting on in years at the time of the incident anyway,
 and didn't play for too long afterward.  some people speculated that
 he just couldn't get himself back together after the incident, and i
 think he had a bunch of other personal problems dogging him afterward.
 he did eventually get back to form, and played another year or so after
 that, and then i believe he retired.
 
 anyone else?
