 not only have i not heard of the western business school, or the university
 of western ontario, i've never even wondered if there was a western
 ontario.  and judging by the quality of the posts coming from there, i'm
 still not sure that the place exists.
 
 perhaps i should be impressed, though, since it appears that grade school
 children in that area have access to the internet.
