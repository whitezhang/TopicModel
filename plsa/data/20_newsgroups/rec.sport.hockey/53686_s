 well, the tentative rules, anyway.  and, of course, since the season is
 not entirely over, tentative entry form.  but who cares?  the real hockey
 season is starting!!!!!
 
 here's the deal:  you email (preferably) or post your predictions, and the
 number of games you think each series will go.  each round will be
 weighted, so that the stanley cup finals will be very important, but the
 early rounds will still be important.  here is the scoring:
 
 pick 1st round winner, way off on games:  2 points
 pick 1st round winner, within one game:   3 points
 pick 1st round winner, pick # of games:   5 points
 
 pick 2nd round winner, way off on games:  3 points
 pick 2nd round winner, within one game:   4 points
 pick 2nd round winner, pick # of games:   6 points
 
 pick conference champ, way off on games:  5 points
 pick conference champ, within one game:   6 points
 pick conference champ, pick # of games:   9 points
 
 pick stanley cup champ, way off on games: 8 points
 pick stanley cup champ, within one game:  10 points
 pick stanley cup champ, pick # of games:  14 points
 pick loser in 7, series goes 7:           2 points
 pick loser in 7, series decided in game 7, ot: 4 points
 (these last two are sympathy points, probably won't happen anyway)
 
 obviously, picking the stanley cup champion is important.  i will do some
 tests to see if the format is fair, but probably i will be too lazy to
 modify it, so the scoring will probably be like this.  as for entry forms,
 well, this post is getting too long, so see next post.
