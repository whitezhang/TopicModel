 well, it seems that the habs have been much talked-about of late, so here's my
 $0.02.  these guys have absolutely no concept of how to play in front of the
 damn net!!!  watch them in the offensive zone, especially on the powerplay. 
 damphousse or lebeau will skate all over the bloody zone, maybe pass to the
 point, get it back, skate some more, pass it around....but where's the shot??!
 answer: the shot is totally useless because they lack a forward who stands
 in front of the net a la` neely, shanahan, tocchet, etc etc.  too bad 
 demers won't put dipietro or leclair on the powerplay more often.  dammit,
 even ewen would at least cause some disruptions.  montreal desperately needs
 a power forward with some talent, imo.
 
 then watch them in their own zone. patrick roy is screened on everything. say
 what you want about his performance; imnsho he cannot stop what he cannot see. 
 and montreal's defence does a miserable job of clearing the front of the net. 
 last night against washington roy played a *great* game.  the first goal came
 on the most ridiculous goalmouth scramble i've seen in a long time, and he
 didn't have a hope in hell of stopping the shot.  the second goal came on a
 deflection of a shot he only partially saw anyway.  pathetic defence.  the
 third goal was en.
 
 no wonder he gets pissed off at his defencemen.
