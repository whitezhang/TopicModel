 i think that grant fuhr deserves more credit than that!
 while it's true that the entire sabres team played very well, i
 still believe that if it wasn't for grant fuhr, the series would
 now be tied 2-2. he virtually stole games 1 and 3 for the sabres.
 in both of these games, fuhr stood on his head to give the sabres
 the chance to win. especially in game 3, fuhr made a series of
 huge stops in the third period when the score was tied 2-2. 
 even in game 2 when the sabres won 4-0, the score seemed to
 indicate that the sabres dominated. however, if it hadn't been
 for fuhr, the sabres wouldn't have been up (2-0 i think it was)
 through the 2nd period and the bruins wouldn't have had to open
 up the game (thereby allowing mogilny to score the third goal on
 a breakaway to salt away the game).  there
 is no doubt in my mind that fuhr was the critical factor in the
 victory. 
 
 in my opinion, neely, oates and juneau played as well as
 lafontaine, mogilny and hawerchuk. the sabres did get
 extraordinary efforts from hannan, sweeney, wood, and khmylev
 (compared to that of the bruins checkers). however, the bruins defense
 , imo, played better than the sabres defense (the sabres have ken sutton
 playing a regular shift afterall ;-)
 the difference in the series was fuhr, who outplayed andy moog. 
 
 gary
 
 go sabres!
