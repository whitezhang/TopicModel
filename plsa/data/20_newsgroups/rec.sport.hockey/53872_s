 bowman tended to overplay francis at times because he is a bowman-style
 player.  he plays hard at all times, doesn't disregard his defensive
 responsibilities and is a good leader.  bowman rewarded him be increasing his
 ice time.
 
 jagr can be very arrogant and juvenile and display a "me first" attitude.
 this rubbed bowman the wrong way and caused him to lose some ice time.
 
 throughout the year, francis consistently recieved more ice time than
 jagr.  althouhg i have never seen stats on this subject, i am pretty
 sure that jagr had more points per minute played that francis.  when
 you add to that jagr's better +/- rating, i think it becomes evident
 that jagr had a better season- not that francis had a bad one.
