 no.
 
 in what still, imho, ranks as the all-time greatest pr blunder (not to
 mention on-ice blunder) the whalers ever committed, gm eddie johnston and
 coach rick ley 'decided' that francis was incapable as a leader and stripped
 him of the captain's "c" in december of 1990. the whole organization (read:
 ej and ley, and by default owner richard gordon because he was too much of
 a dupe to know how much he was being blind-sided by ej) dumped on francis all
 season, starting with refusing to sign him to a new contract, publicly 
 humiliating him, stripping him of the "c", and then trading him that spring
 to the penguins. classy guy, that ej.
 
 the loss of francis (and too a lesser extent, ulf), was one of a series of
 decimating player moves by ej which stripped the personality and fan-awareness
 from the team that has put them in the precarious position they are in today.
 
 [gratuitous good ej note...he did preside over the organization when it
 acquired verbeek, cassels, sanderson, poulin, nylander, etc. he stripped the
 roster but he did lay a foundation.]
