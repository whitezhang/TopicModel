 
 well, it's not that bad. but i am still pretty pissed of at the
 local abc coverage. they cut off the first half hour of coverage by playing
 david brinkley at 12:30 instead of an earlier time slot. i don't
 even understand their problem. if they didnt think enough people would
 
 not watch the game why would they decide to show most of the game? and
 if they showed the remaining 2.5 hours of the game, would it hurt to play
 david brinkley at its regular time? they dont have any decent programming
 before noon anyway. i called the sports dept and blasted them on their
 machine. i called gain and someone picked it up. when i asked him why they
 premepted the first half hour of the stanley cup playoffs, he seemed a bit
 confused. when i explained a bit more in detail, he then said that's upto
 to our programming dept. call back on  monday. weel, i understand that the
 sports dept is not responsible for this preemption. but i can't understand
 how someone in the sports dept. can't even recognise the name of playoffs
 shown on the very same station he works for.
 
 anyway, i am going to call them tomorrow and blast them on the phone again.
 i urge all atlanta hockey fans to call wsb 2 and ask them not to do the
 same thing for the next 4 weeks.
