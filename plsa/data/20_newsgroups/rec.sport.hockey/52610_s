 i'll have to disagree with you on this one. i think vancouver will go as
 bure goes, and if he continues on his goal scoring slump, then they
 won't even make it out of the first round. i think the kings will make
 it out of the first round, regardless of who they play. they seem to be
 doing pretty well, even with that bad game against minnesota on
 saturday. i think it'll be either calgary or los angeles to win the
 smythe (i.e. go on to the conference finals).

 still have to disagree with you here. i think it'll be pittsburg to
 get the hat trick in stanley cups. they just look
 toooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo good.
