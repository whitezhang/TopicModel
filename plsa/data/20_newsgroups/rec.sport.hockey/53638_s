 well, i could become a fan ... (-;
 
 seriously, this news coming since thursday has effectively robbed the
 islanders and the devils of any airtime on sports talk shows almost
 everywhere that i've sampled ... in fact, the playoffs almost don't
 exist now. )-; ranger fans calling in to wfan or to new york one's
 midnight sports talk were in a mix of fury over this season and near-
 orgasm over keenan's hiring.  (summarizing: keenan is a winner and
 will give the broadway bums 'da business' in pursuing the next cup
 chase ...)

 this will be an interesting combination to watch ... keenan has been
 paid enough money to put up and shut up and just be a coach, but his
 advice on any player moves will be listened to closely.  a lot of big
 player moves will happen --- remember that keenan got rid of denis
 savard.  the country club days are over ...

 if paramount had given smith an earlier sign of support and offered
 keenan the big money to put-up-and-shut-up back in january, the
 rangers might not be heading for golf now ...

 one of keenan's first statements was a reaffirmation that mark messier
 will be the team's captain.

 by then, smith might have some bargains on keenan's advice ... like
 maybe unloading phil bourque for tie domi ... (-;
