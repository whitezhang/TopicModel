 i disagree.  mcnall has demonstrated with gretzky that a star brings out the
 crowds whether or not the team is expected to do well.  very few fans real-
 istically expect the kings to do well this year (although i do) and yet they
 still go out to see gretzky.  this is the marketing strategy - selling the
 game by selling the stars - that is employed by baseball and, notably, the
 nba and this is the attitude that the new bettman/mcnall leadership is 
 bringing to the league.  they have gone on record as stating that they are
 trying to sell the game on its stars.  timo salami and brett hull are perfect 
 examples of players that real fans know aren't worth a damn and yet, being
 benificiaries of marketing-oriented coaching strategies, have goal totals
 that would indicate to the casual observer, the very fans the nhl wants to
 attract, that these players are indeed superstars.

 it ain't nearly so simple as this.  the casual fan doesn't think about much 
 at all.  can you actually find an adult with a 3 digit iq who believes that
 mcdonalds makes good hamburgers?

 yes but apparently the rocket has not lived up to his marketing responsi-
 bilities has he?  he was hyped, initially, as a superstar, but outside of
 one grey cup game he has done very little to maintain/enhance that assess-
 ment of his talents.  most argo fans probably feel the team would be better
 off without him. 
 
 cordially, as always,
