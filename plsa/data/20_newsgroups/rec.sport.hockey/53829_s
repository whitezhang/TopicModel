 i don't buy this at all. roy was the reason the game was tied... and that
 would *not* have been the case had dionne kept his cool. 
 hextall gave up 2 very questionable goals himself ...
 both dionne's and bellows' shots were misplayed by hextall, but just because
 his gaffes were early in the game, no one seems to care. roy stood on his head 
 for the first 15 minutes of the game when the nords were rushing from 
 end-to-end. kamensky's mini-break after the tying goal and the first shot by 
 young in ot were both excellent chances stopped by roy. roy outplayed hextall 
 for most of the game, but roy becomes the villain and hextall the hero 
 because roy's team didn't make full use of their opportunities.
 
 hextall, on the other hand, had a lot of lucky bounces ... he played very 
 well, but the haller shot off the post in ot, the rebound bouncing over 
 bellows' stick, the brunet breakaway, the 3 chances for leclair ... all 
 those opportunities were *not* finished off by montreal, and it cost them.
 hextall wasn't particularly brilliant on those plays ...

 sure, no excuse ... but it was just the 1 goal. the timing stank, but against
 an explosive team like quebec, they gave them 1 opportunity too many with
 a powerplay that was totally unnecessary.

 i disagree. roy played well because he wasn't screened the whole night. 
 the defense, for the 1st time this season, played remarkably, keeping sakic,
 nolan, and sundin  out of the slot most of the night.

 this most certainly was a team loss... leclair missed his opportunities,
 as did bellows and brunet. dionne took a bad penalty. damphousse and lebeau
 were *silent*. carbonneau and savard were a step behind all night. roy gave
 up the bad goal. roy, by no means, can be singled out for this loss.

 and hextall didn't on dionne's goal? please. roy is paid big money because
 that is his value compared to other goalies ... and he still is in the top 5,
 when you consider the defense, or lack of one, that played in front of him
 for most of the season.

 the montreal media is the quickest to heap praise and then hurl derogatory
 comments against the habs. they are no better than uninformed fans. why should
 they read the papers? they played 58 minutes of "burnsian" hockey to shut
 down quebec. all they need tonight, and for the rest of the series is the 
 extra 2.
 
 red light to face quebec...rubbish. that's a guaranteed way to end the
 series 4-0. who would be taught a lesson by this ?
 the fans, the media, and racicot, perhaps. certainly not the rest of the team.

 if you mean the goal should never have gone in, because there should never
 have been an ot, then i agree. but the goal itself was a great piece of work
 by young. roy had both the near and far posts covered, but young flipped the
 puck up under roy's arm as he wrapped-around the net ... not a bad goal at all.
