 stretch to preserve the blues lead.
 
 the hawks came out strong in the first period, outshooting the blues 6-1 and
 taking a 1-0 lead on noonan's first goal. right after an interference penalty
 on rick zombo had expired, keith brown intercepted a clearing attempt at the
 blue line and passed the puck to steve larmer in the right circle. larmer fired
 a long slap shot, and noonan deflected the puck between joseph's pads. after
 the goal, the blues picked up the intensity and went on to outshoot the hawks
 10-9 in the first period.
 
 jeff brown tied the game 1-1 at 3:12 of the second. nelson emerson broke in on
 the left side, got by craig muni and pushed the puck across the slot. belfour
 came out to play the pass and shoveled it to the right boards, where brown
 collected it and slapped it in before belfour could get back to the goal.
 
 two minutes later on a hawks power play, belfour stopped rich sutter on a
 short-handed break-in. chris chelios picked up the puck and passed it to jeremy
 roenick who carried it on right wing and found an open noonan with a nice pass
 across the slot. noonan fired it past joseph at 5:30 for the 2-1 lead.
 
 noonan completed his hat trick 3:11 later to increase the hawks' lead to 3-1.
 stephane matteau made a nice pass from the right boards to noonan who beat
 stephane quintal by driving to the net. joseph had no chance as noonan
 deflected the puck in the net.
 
 denny felsner reduced the blues deficit to 3-1 at 12:49 after picking up the
 rebound of basil mcrae's slap shot from the slot. janney set up mcrae for
 the shot, and the puck sailed wide of the net and bounced off the end boards
 to felsner. felsner sticked the rebound into the partially open net. the blues
 outshot the hawks 10-5 in the second period.
 
 with the blackhawks leading 3-2 at 9:56 of the third, stephane matteau picked
 up a high sticking penalty. just 53 seconds into the power play, steve smith
 was called for slashing, giving the blues a 5-on-3 advantage for 1:07.
 
 the blues didn't waste time as brendan shanahan scored just 23 seconds into
 the two-man advantage to tie the game 3-3. janney found hull in the slot,
 and hull fired a rocket at belfour. jeff brown collected the rebound and
 passed it to shanahan in the left circle. shanahan beat belfour from a sharp
 angle.
 
 just 17 seconds later, hull scored the game winner for the blues. nelson
 emerson broke in on right wing, carried the puck behind the net along with
 two hawks defensemen. emerson made a nice pass to an unchecked hull in the
 slot, and hull beat belfour to put the blues up 4-3.
 
 the hawks had several chances to tie the game in the final minutes, but joseph
 made some brilliant saves to prevent the hawks from scoring. he stopped troy
 murray point blank from just right of the crease with 2:30 left in the game.
 the blues killed off a late hawks power play, with rich sutter clearing the
 puck with his hand as it was trickling along the goal line. the blues held
 on to win the game. the hawks oushot the blues 13-7 in the third period,
 totaling 27 shots on goal for each team. the blues special teams were excellent
