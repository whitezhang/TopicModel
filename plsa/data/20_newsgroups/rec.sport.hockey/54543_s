 espn has been trying various things to get away from the
 follow-the-puck concept of televising hockey games.  one of the main
 problems with hockey is that it is very difficult to show everything
 that is going on -- more happens away from the puck than in any other
 sport except maybe football and they can do iso's on football players
 to be shown between plays.
 
 the problem of course is that sometimes you get something worthwhile,
 other times you get burned.
