 true, coach matikainen is ready to keep a spot for teemu all the way
 until the medal games. he wants teppo numminen, too. and kurri, but for
 them the spots cannot be left open for too long. esa tikkanen we have
 already. 
 
 even without these players i think we have pretty good team. young,
 hungry, talented guys, no old players that have got everything (except
 the gold). yesterday's practise game, swe-fin 6-6, shows that the two
 world's best hockey teams ;) are in prime shape.  the finn line
 riihijarvi(slightly injured)-saarikoski-viitakoski shined. i bet these
 two teams are the best in the nhl, too. roger, roger?
 
 what do you people think about team canada with lindros, brind'amour,
 burke, ranford, recchi, dineen...? can they beat the finns:?
