 
 hi.  according to my always questionable newspaper, there's a silver
 dollar being minted in canada, the back of which commemorates the
 anniversary of the stanley cup.  now, i know full well what coins are
 used every day in canada.  i can easily fish a few out of my pocket
 change right now, in fact.  my question is, since the loon is the only
 dollar coin that i know is legal tender, is this just a commemorative
 coin with no monetary exchange value, or what?  is it the sort of
 thing that only hockey buffs and coin collectors might covet, with no
 chance of it being circulated?  if it is an uncirculated coin, what's
 the current cost and what's its potential value?  just curious.  if no
 one knows, i'll take this to soc.culture.canada and rec.collecting (or
 whatever it is).  thanks again
