 why not? i believe both the devils and islanders got 87 points.
 say for example, another team had this record : 20-37-47;
 they had 20*2+47*1+37*0=87 which is the same as their points total.
 (the islanders' and devils' records are both 40-37-7.
 
 it is simple arithmetics and involve no calculus.
