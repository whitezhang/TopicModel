 like many others i too was watching the caps/isles game when the went
 to the baseball game.  i too was pissed.  how could they interupt such
 an important game.  i understand about contracts, but you would think they
 would have a clause in the contract concerning important games!
 anyway,  us blues (and hawks) fans got shafted worse!  while everyone
 in the u.s. and watched the game on abc.  however those of us who live in
 the central illinois area were subjected to watching the arthritus(?)
 telethon.  the area that was most affected by the telecast did not get
 to see the game except through hawk vision.  this game, had it been
 televised, would have been the first home hawks game shown in the area
 since 1980.  this television bull*&%$ has got to stop.  we are not only
 being deprived of seeing games, due to skyrocketing ticket prices, but
 we are also being deprived of watching them on tv.
  peace,
  hammer
