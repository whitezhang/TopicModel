 3 or 4 messages already on the issue of nhl telecats over the last few weeks.
 but, hey. i am pretty desperate. what i am interested is not just a
 sportsbar with multiple screens so thast i can watch the game on one
 of those silent screens. are there any hockey oriented bars in this area.
 or does some patrick division or adams division fan have a satellite dish?
 i don't mind paying an admission fee, if necessary.
