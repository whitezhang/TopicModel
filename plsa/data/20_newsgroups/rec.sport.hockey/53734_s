 what, did you leave the room each of the 100 or so times they said that
 there were no other night baseball games? every break they took back at
 the studio mentioned it, followed by 'so...we're gonna show you hockey
 instead.' my wife and i are hoping for rain at every baseball game they
 have a feed for tommorrow night...
 
 point is, be glad they showed hockey, but if baseball was available
 anywhere else you can bet you would've watched baseball last night.
