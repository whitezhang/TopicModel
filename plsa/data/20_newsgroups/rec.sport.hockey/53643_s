 in the mist of the rangers soap box (i.e. captain nemesis-ier/ex-coach 
 roger nebula bad blood bath) and with high hopes turned to new coach 
 mr. klean (commissar keenan)... i would like to know what procedures 
 hockey teams use to select their captains (including a's). are they 
 selected by the coaching staff, do the players vote for a captain, or 
 are they appointed by management?
 
 and, while we are on the subject, has a captain ever been traded, 
 resigned, or been striped of his title during the season? any other 
 team captain trivia would be appreciated.
