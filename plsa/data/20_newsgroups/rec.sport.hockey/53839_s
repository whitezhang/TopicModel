 yes, a point well-taken ... however, even in areas that finally got
 some games, there's something nagging in the back of your skull when
 the network that has the national rights in its pocket says on its
 sports news, "there's an awesome overtime going on in quebec city,
 and we'll *try* to get you an update through the show ..." when you
 know that it's on a satellite's feedhorn somewhere up there ...

 from today's times, abc got great ratings in chicago and st. louis (a
 4.2), and the kings-flames got a 2.9 on the west coast, but only a 2.2
 in metro new york (i.e., the devils squandered their newfound support
 from a year ago when they played the rangers )-;).  in comparison,
 seniors golf did better ...
 
 >next week, there will be far fewer abc affiliates with hockey.
 
 i fear that the overall national numbers will not be so great ...
 i can't tell if abc did any advance marketing or not, 'cos i don't
 watch much tv ... the nhl should have made sure that it was solid
 on cable before going on the air.  even espn could've sold second
 rights to third party systems (i.e., non-sportschannel) since they
 are not making any extra money by sitting on the games ... hockey
 fans will not necessarily be watching pre-season beach volleyball
 if playoffs games aren't being shown somewhere ...
