 it was clint malarchuk's neck cut by uwe krupp's skate.  i know it happened in
 buffalo, but i can't tell you against whom.
 
 krupp was defending an opposing attacker charging the net.
 
 malarchuk became the fourth goalie (behind hasek, puppa and draper) after
 suffering from obsessive-compulsive disorder.  he's been playing in san diego
 for former sabre coach rick dudley.
 
 krupp is now playing for the islanders after the lafontaine/turgeon trade.
 
 what do i win?  =)
