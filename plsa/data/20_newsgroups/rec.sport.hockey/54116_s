 espn is pathetic, i have been watching everybody complain about espn's coverage
 and i agree with all of you.  might i suggest that we are getting all worked up
 over nothing.  we all knew that espn's coverage was going to suck.  i mean have
 you ever watched during the regular season sportscenter coverage of hockey? it
 sucks, i mean really sucks!!!  espn does not know hockey if it shot them in the
 ass.  i was really pissed of about last night, coverage.  i go to school in ohio
 i *know* the indians suck, so why show them?  if i were bill clement i would
 shoot myself.
 
 anyway after i calmed down after i realized that they were not going to show
 overtime of the caps isles game i thought to myself i knew that this was going
 to happen, in fact i remerbed myself praying that at least they would keep even
 the boring devils game.
 
 overall i think espn does not care if they show hockey or not and i firmly
 belive that they have know respect for the fans. ie *because of contract       
 obligations*, screw you espn.
 
 praise be to all hockey fans who put up with this shit!
 
 go hawks!!!
