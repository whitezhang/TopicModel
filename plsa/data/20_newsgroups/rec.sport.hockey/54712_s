 okay, the caps again are about to break out the golf clubs but before they
 do, does anyone have the history of the washington capitals' futility
 record in the playoffs? i remember that terry's first year was the first
 year that the caps finally made it to the third round but before under
 brian, i noticed that every other year the caps got to the second round
 and the years in between they didn't make it past the first round. is this
 trend continuning? 
 the admiral, a hopeless caps fan.
 p.s. we still remember that 3 ot loss to the islanders! aurggghhhhhhhhh!
