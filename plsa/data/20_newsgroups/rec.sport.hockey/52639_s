 i think that nhlpa' 93 is the best video game available now.
 of course many things could be done better, but i really appreciate that
 the names of players are the real ones, no matter if it lacks some logos...
 i am still playing it since november leading different teams to the finals
 and making scorers from the same team compete for the top scoring:
 yesterday i won the title using toronto against hartford (4 games to two),
 i played the playoffs in a 7 games fashion (5 minutes for each period) and
 the best scorer and shooter was gilmour (116 shots if i remember well)
