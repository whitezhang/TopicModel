 in detroit, the octopus is a symbol from the old days of the league. in
 the era of the original 6, four teams made the playoffs.  to win the cup,
 a team had to win two seven-game series - in other words it took 8
 playoff wins to win the cup.  the octopus (8 legs) has become a common
 detroit symbol.  every year around playoff time people start sneaking
 octopus (octopi?) into the joe louis arena and throwing them onto the ice.
