 i think jagr did he probably had a better point per minute ice time- stats
 don't exist to properly analyze this and he had a substancially better +/-.

 +/- is a useful statistic.  if a player is on the ice when his team scores a
 lot of goals and only allows a few goals, he must be doing something right.
 it is especially useful to compare between teammates- as they play for the
 same team and should have roughly similar +/- ratings if they are equally
 good players.  it can be adjusted- with varying degrees of success to compare
 between players on different teams.
 
 i agree it would be nice for the nhl to keep more statistics- but how useful
 are the ones that you suggest??  total ice time would be very useful- it is
 a missing stat in jagr vs francis arguments from before.  somehow measuring
 the quality of ice time as you suggest would be useless.  it would be a
 better stat for evaluating coaching- ie are the players given quality ice
 time actually their talented ones?  a very good player could be given low
 amounts of quality ice time because of team depth or a stupid coach who
 doesn't recognize his talent and a very bad player could be given lots of
 quality ice time because of a lack of team depth or a stupid coach that
 thinks he is an effective player.  this stat would be much more flawed than
 +/- and almost no conclusions could be drawn regarding player talent.
 
 +/- is a useful stat.  it is quite useful in evaluating player talent.
 you are the one displaying ignorance because of your unwillingness to see
 that being on the ice when goals are scored but not when they are allowed
 is a very positive thing- and should be evaluated as such.
