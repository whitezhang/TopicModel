 sorry to disappoint you but the red wings earned the victory...easily.
 
 i watched most of the game on espn (as soon as i realized that they
 were televising the game which was at the beginning of the second).
 the maple leafs were flat.  very flat.  meanwhile, the red wings were
 skating very freely and dictating the pace of the game.  i didn't
 detect any bad penalty calls (van hellemond did his usual good job).
 toronto looked like how i expected them to for their first playoff
 game in a few years -- nervous.
 
 for the leafs sake, i hope they can rid themselves of the butterflies
 for game 2.  if game 1 is indicative of the series, it's gonna go
 quick.
