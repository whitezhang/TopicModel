 abc ratings were very good. i was schocked to hear that abc's telecast
 was the fifth most watched sporting event over the weekend. national
 rating came out to a very respectable 3.3. top-29 nielsen markets were
 at 2.9. in boston,the game scored lower at 2.4 but it had some competion
 from local sports teams.
 quite frankly, i expected abc's ratings to be under 2.0. but i'm happy
 to be proven wrong!
 
 well,well...sometimes it pays off clicking away on your cable-tv remote
 control.:-) and if you happen to be a hockey fan,you could just stumble
 upon a playoff hockey game...
 
 espn picked up detroit-toronto game on monday night because the only
 night game in mlb was being rained out in chicago. you have to give
 espn credit for switching to detroit's fox-50 coverage and having bill
 clement at a pittsburgh's tv station(wate?) for intermission analysis.
 maybe,espn people were giddy over perliminary over-night abc ratings
 for sunday's telecast and thought it was a good idea to feature the
 norris division showdown rather than a monster truck competion.
 good move,espn!
