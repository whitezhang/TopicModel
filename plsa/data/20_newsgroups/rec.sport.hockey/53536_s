 what?! white, yes. well off, definitely not. hockey season ticket owners have
 the lowest average income of any of the four major north american sports.
 
 and think of where the majority of hockey players come from. from a farm out
 in boondock, saskatchewan or weedville, alberta.

 the inner city isn't the only place that is poor.
 i think the biggest barrier to hockey in the inner city is... no ice to play on.
