 i got back from my trip to discover that my email spool file got blown
 away.  i am missing all the playoff pool entries sent between april 5
 and april 17.  it looks like about 200 entries got lost.  *sigh*.
 
 therefore, i would like to ask each person that sent me a team to resend
 it asap.  i am relying on your honesty to not make changes after the
 deadline today.
 
 thanks in advance, and i apologize for the problem.
