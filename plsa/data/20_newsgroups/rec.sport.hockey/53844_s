 this is a general question for us readers:
 
 how extensive is the playoff coverage down there?  in canada, it is almost
 impossible not to watch a series on tv (ie the only two series i have not had
 an opportunity to watch this year are wash-nyi and chi-stl, the latter because
 i'm in the wrong time zone!).  we (in canada) are basically swamped with 
 coverage, and i wonder how many series/games are televised nationally or even
 locally in the us and how much precedence they take over, say, local news if
 the games go into double-ot.
 
 email me so as not to waste bandwidth, please.  my news feed is kind of slow
 anyways.
