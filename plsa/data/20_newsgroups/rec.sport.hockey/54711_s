 devorski unfortunately helped to taint an otherwise brilliant display
 by maclean.  the canucks tied up the jets so tightly that i thought that
 they were mailing them.
 
 btw, greg...next time, don't fall asleep in geography class, it's pretty
 sad when a fellow in norway can spell winnipeg properly and a guy in
 north america can't.
 
 one more thing...how long has vancouver been in the nhl?  how many
 championships do they have?  
 
 oh yeah...and i can go to the arena and see not one, not two, but
 *six* championship banners hanging from the rafters.  3 stanley cup
 banners, and 3 avco cup banners.  my nhl guide says that vancouver has
 won the cup once (as many times as the rockin' town of kenora has won it!)
