 re eric: true, but fortunately we didn't get to find out what they would be
 like without recchi for 30 games.
 
 soderstrom: absolutely. 4 shutouts in 39 games for a rookie without a lot
 of defense in front of him. runnerups to galley and fedyk who are scoring
 a ton over their career best. but galley thinks he's paul coffey (puts scoring
 ahead of defending) and fedyk has tailed off big time.
 
 eklund: was a big question mark this year and was coming off injuries. 42
 points in 49 games is not bad at all, and recently he's been a huge factor
 in the wins they've gotten. eklund has never had a point a game season in
 his career, his production is very typical for him. how does he qualify as
 a disappointment? if anything he's a surprise.
 
 my choice would be roussel if i went strictly by what was expected of players,
 but i never thought that he had what it takes to be a #1 goalie. my biggest
 disappointment is bill dineen. i thought that he was going to be the perfect
 coach for this young team, instead he's made too many bad moves and imho
 has cost them enough games to keep them out of the playoffs this year. any
 coach that thinks putting eric lindros at the point on power plays is a
 bright idea needs to go back to coaching school.
