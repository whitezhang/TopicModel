 no matter ow bad they are. that's bullshit. anyone who would follow the
 pens or the pirates in parts of the early eighties on a devoted basis are
 losers. it's ok to follow and be concerned about your home team. but
 to  give them respect even when it is clear the management and the players suck
 should not be required of a true fan.a  true fan would follow the team in
 troubled times to the extent that they could discuss how to improve the team.
 
 when i visit pittsburgh, i'll refuse to go to a pirates game since i think
 the management has given pittsburgh a team which could have been much better
 even if they couldn't sign barry bonds. lert's say the pens start doing to
 their own team what the oilers have done this year and what the whalers have
 done in recent years, i would be hard pressed to show much enthusiasm for the
 team. i'll still follow it and bitch about it. but i won't waste my
 money on mediocre teams.
