      depends on what you mean by classy. from what i've heard about
 him, he was about as classy as harold ballard.  only difference was
 that back then almost all the owners were like that, so he seemed okay
 by comparison.  read the book "net worth" for one view of what smythe
 (and norris and adams and campbell) were like.

      even more specifically, i think what roger was saying (and i said
 it previously too) is that these are not the people who made the
 league great, so why should divisions, conferences etc. be named after
 them instead of morenz, vezina, howe, orr etc., the people who did
 make it great.  instead, the nhl has chosen to immortalize the men who
 got rich off of the men who made the game great.
