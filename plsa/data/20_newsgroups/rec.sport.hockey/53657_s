 who gets back his all-star form (roy or hextall) can win the series

 eposode summary
 ---------------
 this episode took place rinkside. don was holding a hot dog that
 he bought from the concession stand.
 
 ron maclean started out by showing a cartoon which appeared in the
 toronto sun. it featured a picture of don, who just saw his shadow
 and proclaimed "will you look at dat, eh? means another 6 weeks
 of me. beauty."
 
 next, don talked about the hot dog he was holding. according to
 him, the hot dogs at the quebec stadium are the best food in all
 the arenas in the nhl.
 
 from there, don commented on the quebec-montreal game. the game
 had great flow, because referee paul stewart calls the best game
 in the nhl. in contrast, the calgary-la game was terrible... all
 stop-and-go, over 50 minutes of penalties called against calgary
 by dan marouelli. its getting so that the ref who calls the most
 penalties gets to ref in the finals.
 
 next, ron showed an old picture of don, when he was playing for
 the rochester americans of the ahl. don recalled some of the
 wins that he had in the quebec arena... during the memorial cup
 and the ahl championships.
 
 finally, don and ron discussed keenan becoming coach of the
 rangers. the rangers were a talented team who underachieved.
 don feels sorry for temporary coach ron smith, who had
 several key injuries (to leetch and patrick) and goalies who
 went cold.
 
 don had some criticism for the rangers team... the party's over,
 adolf (keenan) is there. the rangers organization will no longer
 be a 'country club'.... "ny should be achamed of themselves... if
 they go in the tank with adolf there, they'll be hanging from the
 yardarm by their thumbs."
 
 
 rating
 ------
 nothing too special in this episode.
 
 i'll give it a 5.5 out of 10.
