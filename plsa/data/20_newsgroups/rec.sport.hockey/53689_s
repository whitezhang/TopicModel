 first,happy birthday,val. second, espn's affinity with patrick has probably
 more to do with the travel/production costs for a once a week nhn(national hockey
 night) affair.(espn-abc owner,capital cities, is a company known for being
 quite thrifty with minimal overhead costs. it's quite possible that jim
 schoenfeld may be working for doughnuts :-).
 
 gary thorne and bill clement are both nj-based and the rest of espn crew
 resides in the suburban ct with a very close proximity to tri-state area.
 plus,it makes sense in terms of solid hockey following in the northeast
 corridor(pa-ny-nj-dc/maryland). whereas,in the adams you have only
 3-american based teams, out of which 2(buffalo and hartford) are not
 in top-20  us tv-markets.
