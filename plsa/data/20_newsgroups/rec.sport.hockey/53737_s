    boy - everyone has been ripping on espn's hockey coverage (or is it just
 pittsburgher's who are thrilled with lange & steigy?)  for all of you
 who are unaware -> espn bought the air time from abc and did all the 
 production, advertising sales, commentating, etc -> and even 
 reaped any $ made...
