 papp on hard wired bbs (434-7996). 
 -due date for entries is the first day of regular season play. after that,
 no more entries will be accepted (unless it is just slightly late. if that is
 the case, there will be a small penalty applied to the team).
 -internet users can send email to dpapp@muskwa.ucs.ualberta.ca
  
 prizes:
  
 prizes have not yet been considered. they could range from nothing to free
 time on hard wired bbs or even something else (if you have any suggestions...
 please feel free to put your two cents worth in).
  one idea is to get whoever is willing to to submit an equal amount of
 money, and that will go to be the prize money.  the prize money will
 go to the top team who has submitted to the prize pool.  a list
 of all people who submit money will be posted, as well as those who
 didnt - if it is done this way. 
 cost:
  
 the cost... absolutely nothing!!! there is absolutely no fee for this pool.
  
 note:
  
 -if you have any questions, please feel free to send them to denis papp or
 myself (chris stoochnoff). the players positions (ie. brett hull is right
 wing) will be decided by the year book i will be using. so, if you do not
 know a certain players position, or you are not completely sure what position
 he plays, then ask me and i'll tell you.
  
 -and for a great time, call the hard wired bbs at (403)-434-7996 (this will be
 the location where the pool standings will be displayed).
  
 internet users:
  
 -to contact denis papp, just email (dpapp@muskwa.ucs.ualberta.ca). standings
 will be distributed by email as well.
