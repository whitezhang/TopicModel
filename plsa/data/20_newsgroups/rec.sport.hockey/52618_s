    well, here it is, nhl in the year 2000.
 i got these from a very reliable source in a dream some years ago and 
 although i initially thought i had just been taking too many too strong 
 drugs now it seems the realization has really begun...  you can see the 
 league has already started to move to this direction.
 
    *the walt disney conference*
 anaheim mighty chipmunks    -franchise name to be changed after each new 
 la kings                      hockey movie         
 la flames                   -we've seen some of that
 san jose sharks
 san diego bruins
 tijuana red wings   -detroit's hockey team will follow its car industry...
 dallas stars           
 houston oilers
 texas rangers
 seattle canucks
 
    *the norm green conference*
 alabama white hawks
 biloxi blues
 tampa bay lightning
 miami blades
 helsinki jets        -you've heard them starting getting used to the anthem
 montreal quebecois (sp?)                 -there will be no 'canada'
 atlanta devils
 orlando penquins
 key west islanders
 hartford whalers                        the whalers will never move, huh?
 palm beach capitals
 
   now that the anahaim team is becomming real i'm really beginning to believe
 the rest of the 'message'.  i'm sure the future will turn you into believers 
 too.  after 2000 the nhl will abandond ice-rinks.  it's so expensive to cool 
 down the rinks in the subtropics and the locals hardly know what ice is 
 anyway.  nhl will become a roller skating hockey league.  that way it can 
 create more public interest in the game when local supporteres can play the 
 game in their back yards !
 
          i hope i'm just out of my mind.
         there won't really be a disney team in anaheim, will there?
         the stars aren't really moving...
