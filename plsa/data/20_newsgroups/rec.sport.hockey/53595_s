 i recently bought a pack of prospect hockey cards which had various
 players that were coming into the nhl. i got this particular card of
 a russian named viktor kozlov. it says "many scouts believe he will
 be the #1 pick in 1993". another guy is quoted as saying "he's as 
 good as mario lemieux". anyone know who this guy is?????
