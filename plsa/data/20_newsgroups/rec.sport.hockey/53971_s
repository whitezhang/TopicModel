 it is a long standing good luck redwing's tradition to throw an octopus 
 on the ice during a stanley cup game. they say it dates back to '52
 at the olympia when the wings became the 1st team (i think) to sweep 
 the cup in 8 games. a lot hardet to throw one from joe louis seats
 than from the old olympia balcony, though.
 
 funniest i ever saw was when some tiger fans threw one on the field
 during a detroit/toronto baseball game ...  i was living in california
 and the folks i was watching with had never heard of hockey and were 
 incredulous when i recognized the octopus before the camera closeup !!
