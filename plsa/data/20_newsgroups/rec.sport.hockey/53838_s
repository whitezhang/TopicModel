 no problem, no offence taken ...

 it is sad, just as a lover of the sport, that this team can be in
 the metro new york area for over a decade and still exist as just
 a non-entity ...
 
 >how is espn's coverage anyways??? i think it starts tonight.
 
 we're getting the sabres-bruins as the replacement game (and probably
 so are you) while the devils-penguins game is played on scny and the
 islanders-caps are the overflow game on the sca (scny plus).  if the
 sabres-bruins ends early then we'll go to the devils-penguins game
 (assuming that espn follows their previous patterns; we got the last
 minute of the islanders-rangers and all of the overtime two weeks
 ago).  espn's coverage started last night, by accident, but as one
 or more other writers have pointed out, they could've gone to wild
 hog wrestling for the evening instead ...
