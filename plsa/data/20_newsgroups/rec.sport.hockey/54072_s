 all of these czechs (kadlec, dolezal not anymore) are very good hockey
 players. it is a big surprise that hlinka selected dolezal. 
 "dole" had a bad season in jypht and that's why they didn't make
 a new contract. the other czech we had, jiri jonak, got fired also.
 
 there are lots of czechs playing in finland. darius rusnak, igor liba,
 sejba, svoboda, ...
