 as i've mentioned in the rules posting, i will be out of town until the
 day before the entry deadline, so i won't be able to respond to your
 messages until april 18.
 
 i would be grateful if someone could repost the rules and instructions for
 the playoff pool sometime next week, for the benefit of those who missed the
 first two postings.
 
 thanks.
