 
 i heard a story on the local sports news broadcast in edmonton.
 oiler owner peter pocklington will be holding a press conference
 next week. while the exact details are not known, it is believed
 to concern the oiler's future.
 
 rumour has it that pocklington signed a tentative lease arrangement
 with copps collesium in hamilton. during the press conference,
 pocklington may announce the deal. it is quite possible that
 the deal may simply be a way to force edmonton northlands to
 renegotiate the oiler lease on the stadium.
 
 northlands has offered to buy the oilers for $65 million earlier,
 but the offer was rejected immediately by pocklington.
 
 as for me, my opinion is divided... edmonton has been fairly
 supportive of the oilers. even though they're a small market
 team, they had many sellouts in the 80s. even with the problems
 that the team had this year, they still brought in more fans
 than many teams in larger cities did. on the other hand, if
 the team does move, there is no place more deserving than
 hamilton. of course, how would that affect the grand
 realignment scheme of bettman?
