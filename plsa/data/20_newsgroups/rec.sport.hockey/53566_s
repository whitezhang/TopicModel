 i was at a cincinnati cyclones game a year ago when the local country
 station sponsored a kazoo giveaway.  after a particularly bad call by the
 underexperienced echl ref, it was kazoostorm time down on the ice.  i
 thought this was a pathetic display by the fans, but they were rightfully
 unhappy.
