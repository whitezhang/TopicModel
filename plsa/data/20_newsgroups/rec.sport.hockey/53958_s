 i too think that joseph has had a great year and should be considered for the
 vezina.  i think barrasso and joseph should be the two strongest candidates
 this year.  i don't believe all of the hype that roy, belfour and now potvin
 receive for their goaltending.  i do think that they are great in the nets,
 but i would rather have curtis, tommy or fuhr in the nets during this years
 playoffs.  the big name tenders always seem to have a strong defense in front
 of them and the goaltenders get the most credit.  i would rather face 25 shots
 a game, than have to rely on joseph saving 35, but if the goalie is going to
 face 35 shots, i would rather have joseph or barrasso facing them.

 ps go quebec!!!  and i know that mclean and several others should be mentioned
 as candidates for this years vezina, but i am partial to joseph and barrasso
 this season.
