 so what's the deal with bill wirtz? apparently, the blackhawks - st.
 louis game was a standing room only sell out as usual, but the hawks
 reported the attendace as 16,199. gee, i wonder if wirtz is planning to
 use this as justification for continuing to keep home games off of tv?
 what a schmuck.
 
 in other tv news, the penguins announced yesterday that they will have 3
 fewer broadcast tv games, and will have 22(!) games on some sort of
 subscription / pay-per-view system. yuck.
