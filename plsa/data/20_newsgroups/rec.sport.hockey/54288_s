 hey american hockey fans,
 
 as a hockey fan i can sympathize with thefrustration that you feel.  the
 problem is that other americans don't give a shit about hockey.  they view
 it as a bunch of canadians with bad accents and missing teeth beating the
 shit out of each other on a patch of ice when it is too warm now in
 two-thirds of the us to see the stuff naturally.  on the other hand
 baseball is the *gasp**swoon**sigh* "national pasttime".  baseball is so
 romanticized in the us that you are supposed to forget that other sport
 exist after april 1 and before november 1.  i feel that since espn shows 5+
 baseball games a week they should be able to show an ot hockey game instead
 of the opening innings of a baseball game.  hell, the game is going to last
 2hrs 45mins, so what if you miss the first 1 1/2 hrs?  and i am an indians
 fan!  show the end of what you started, then switch!  but then, i'm a
 hockey fan, what do i know?  baseball is the all mighty sport.
