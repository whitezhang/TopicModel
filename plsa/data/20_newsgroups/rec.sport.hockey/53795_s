 i should have guessed. it's time for the annual pittsburgh penguins
 whine-a-thon. bowman was complaning about cheap shots by the devils in
 game 1. i'm sorry, mr. bowman, you're a great coach, but those "cheap
 shots" were nothing compared to what's going to come. also, i guess you
 were only able to notice the cheap shots made by the guys not in white.
 it's amazing what those black and gold colored glasses will do. 
 
 ps - nice dive on that high stick mario. everyone knew it was a high
 stick, you could have stayed on your feet and saved your diving talent
 for later.
 
 just stirring it up a bit,
