 heard last night that paul kuryia will be playing for the canadian world
 hockey team this year.  he was on a local radio station when a friend of
 the familty called to congratulate him on the invitation.  meekly paul told
 the host that he didn't think they wanted it out yet.  this morning i heard
 that he is destined to play on a line with lindros and recci{unsure of this
 one}.  if he plays well in this arena, he could go #1 or 2 in the draft.
