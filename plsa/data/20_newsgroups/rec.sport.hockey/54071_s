 personality means something to me.  that is exactly why i like clement
 (and emrick).  on the other hand, jd is a pompous, bull-headed, arrogant
 know-it-all.  he's a real turn-off (which is exactly what i do when he's
 on).  one complaint i do have about clement is that he sometimes talks
 too much.  if i wanted that i'd listen to tim mcgarver doing a baseball
 game.
