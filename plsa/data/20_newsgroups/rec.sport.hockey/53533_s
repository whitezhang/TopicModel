 just a quick note about manon's immediate future: rumor has it(usa today's spor
 ts page) that she will be playing with tampa bay's affiliate in the echl(i thin
 k. it's been a couple of days. :)) she will supposedly be competing for the num
 ber 2 goaltender spot.  i think, after her performance, which was damn good for
  someone who hasn't played squat all year, that we'll be seeing a lot more of h
 er in atlanta in the years to come.
