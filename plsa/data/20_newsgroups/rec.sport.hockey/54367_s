 of any kind of posts about the recent pens massacre of the devils. actually,
 i am  bit puzzled too and a bit relieved. however, i am going to put an end
 to non-pittsburghers' relief with a bit of praise for the pens. man, they
 are killing those devils worse than i thought. jagr just showed you why
 he is much better than his regular season stats. he is also a lot
 fo fun to watch in the playoffs. bowman should let jagr have a lot of
 fun in the next couple of games since the pens are going to beat the pulp out of jersey anyway. i was very disappointed not to see the islanders lose the final
 regular season game.          pens rule!!!
