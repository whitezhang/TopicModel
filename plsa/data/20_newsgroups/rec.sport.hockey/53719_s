                rules to the acme hockey playoff pool 
  
 critierias
  pick 9 forwards  ( as long as they are forwards lw=rw=c is okay)

  -----------------------------------------------------------------        
                  
  calculation of points: 
   ( except for designated scorer and playmaker)
    1 assist  = 1 pt   ixi  1 goal = 1 pt  ii 
    ( for players in line 1, their pt totals will be *2 )
           line 1 = pts * 2
           line 2 = pts * 1.5
           line 3 = pts * 1
    1 win     = 2 pt  ( for goalies)
    
    the team that wins the cup = 10 pts
    
 for the designated playmaker         designated
 calculation will be as follows       scorer:goal    = 3 pts
 every goal scored = 0.5 points             assists = 0.5 pts
 every assists     = 2 points
    
   in the event of a tie, the tie will be broken by unmodified 
   goal totals and then by game winning goals
   ----sample-------------------------------------
    eg designated scorer = jeremy roenick
       actual: g=12, a=10, pts=22  modified g=(12*3) + a=(10*0.5) = 41
    .    
        designated playmaker = steve smith
       actual: g=1,  a=11, pts=12  modified g=(1*0.5)  + a=(11*2) = 22.5
    .
    line 1 = j murphy(24)- g courtnall(14)- m messier(14)
                    dave manson(12)-  iafrate(7)
        total points = 142 points for that line!
