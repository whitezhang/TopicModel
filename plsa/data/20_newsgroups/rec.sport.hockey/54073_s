 i watched the game germany-czechs in wc today...and i was astonished about
 the behaviour of the german audience!
 the german team got a few penalties in the last period and the crowd went
 grazy! they threw coins, extra pucks and other trash into the rink...is
 that stupid or what?? i guess the canadian referee (one of the
 isostar-bros ;) gave the german team a penalty for that, but it didn't help
 much.
 i guess the germans just are proud over their nazi-kill-'em-all-everyone-
 but-us-germans-sucks attitude...they just seem to have that kind of attitude
 in every possible sport (remember the european champs in stockholm in soccer)
 it really pisses me off!
 i do not mean that every single german has this attitude that sucks, but 
 most of them seem to do...
