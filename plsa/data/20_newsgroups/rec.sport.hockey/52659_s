 yes, yl|nen is a draft choice of the jets.  (assuming, of course, this
 is the same yl|nen that played for kiekko-espoo in 1990-91.)  he was a
 5th round, 91st overall pick of the jets in the 1991 entry draft.
 
 i noticed in the summaries that yl|nen had really begun to play well in
 the playoffs.
