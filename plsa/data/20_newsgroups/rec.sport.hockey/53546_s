 well now that the hawks have won the division the road is a little
 easier for the playoffs. let toronto and detroit beat the hell out of
 each other while chicago sweeps st.louis. that just makes it easier in
 the second round with all the rest they will get and tor/det getting
 none. for the conf. champ they will have a hard time versus the division
 but that div. will be pretty battered also so the advantage goes to the
 hawks again. then bring pitt. and sure the hawks will probably lose but
 its better to get that far and lose than to not go.
