 	ah, so now we're into european player bashing?  what next?  
 no more french canadiens?  yeah, there's an idea!  let them french-
 speaking canadiens have their own hockey league!  we don't want them!
 	are you _crazy_?  the nhl is one of the true international
 leagues, and yes, there _are_ many europeans who deserve to play in
 the nhl and are better than some north americans, look at teemu!!!
 i, for one, am glad to see europeans in the nhl and i hope the
 nhl soon expands to europe.  its nice to see all these different
 people come together to form the (soon to be) 26 hockey teams.
