 
 
 could someone post the flyers record with and without eric lindros in
 the lineup
 
 
 i have a guy that is trying to compare the quebec/flyers trade to the 
 
 dallas/minnesota trade in the nfl(hershel walker)
 
 i just need the stat to back up my point that eric will be one of the next
 
 great players
 
 thanks
 
 john
