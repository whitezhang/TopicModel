   did anyone see the montreal - quebec game yesterday?  it was tight right down
 to the last second of the third period.  in the overtime roy and hextall played
 like they were gods.
   ok, so montreal won!  they deserved it after getting their first goal in
 overtime waved off because the puck was hit in with a high stick.  their second
 goal in overtime was also replayed, but i could not tell if it was the montreal
 player who kicked it in.  the puck definitely was not directed in by a stick.
 anyways, montreal is back into the series.
