 here is a review of some of the off-ice things that have
 affected the ahl this year.
 
 
 st john's maple leafs problems
 the st john's maple leafs sophomore season has been plagued by
 problems. on-ice, the leafs won the atlantic division title but
 off ice was less happy. a strike by public workers has forced the
 leafs out of the newfoundland city for much of the last half of
 the seaosn (since mid-jan). they have played "home" games in places
 like montreal, cornwall and charlottetown. their playoff "home"
 games will be played in the metro center in halifax, ns. one
 demostration got violent. workers attacked a leafs' bus and
 rocked it and broke windows in the st john's memorial stadium.
 despite the problems, toronto officials insist that the leafs
 will return to st john's once the strike ends.
 ===================================================
 senators sold
 the new haven senators have been sold by peter shipman to
 the ottawa senators nhl organization. they are the only canadian
 nhl team with an american ahl affiliate, and have made it clear
 they intend to move the team to somewhere in the canadian atlantic
 provinces. this sale and move has yet to be approved by the ahl
 head office, but is expected to pass easily at the general meeting
 in may. the quote in the story from jack butterfield made it 
 clear the league was more interested in the stability of the 
 ahl franchise accompanied by nhl ownership, rather than maintaining
 the 56-year history of the ahl in new haven. 
 
 the senators are currently in serious negotiations with charlottetown
 new brunswick and are expected to move there.
 ==================================================
 dallas helps hawks stay in moncton
 after announcing that they would pull their affiliation out
 of moncton, the winnipeg jets changed their mind. 
 
 the jets announced the move when they said that they would be slashing
 their minor league roster from 20-something to around a dozen; and they
 wanted to share with an existing ahl or ihl franchise.
 
 enter the dallas lone stars. dallas agreed to supply the remaining
 6 or 8 players to the moncton franchise. thus keeping the hawks
 in the new brunswick city.
 
 the deal is for one year and will be extended to three years if
 the season ticket base increases to over 3000. the hawks only sold
 1400 for this year.
 ============================================================
 saint john flames official
 the calgary flames have officially signed a deal with the city of
 saint john, nb. the saint john blue flames will play in the 6200
 exhibition center. the flames still have to apply for an expansion
 frnachise from the ahl but are expected to have no trouble.
 =========================================================
 caps follow jacks to maine
 despite rumors to the contrary, the capitals will follow the baltimore
 skipjacks to maine. the caps' current farm team, the baltimore skipjacks,
 announced that they would move to maine and become the portland pirates.
 there was much doubt as to if the caps would follow but they announced
 a limited deal with portland. they would supply a dozen or so players
 including 2 goalies. they become the third team to announce a limited
 farm team along with moncton and the capital district islanders.
 ======================================================
 ahl game of the week
 in early january, the ahl started a game of the week. the game, produced
 by, i believe, pyman productions, was televised across the canadian
 maritimes and northeastern us. the first few weeks saw two games of
 the week, one in canada and another in the us but since then, there
 has been only one. sunday afternoon and night games were covered and
 shown on sportschannel ny and ne in the us and, i believe, atlantic
 sports network in canada (but i'm not sure about that). i am not
 sure if playoff games will be covered.
 =====================================================
 utica gone? syracuse added?
 there were heavy rumors that the utica devils will not be around next
 season. there were rumors that they might be headed to a midwestern
 city and that the city of syracuse is trying to lure them.
 =====================================================
