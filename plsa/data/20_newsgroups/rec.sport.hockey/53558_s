   derian hatcher's game-misconduct penalty was rescinded by the nhl, 
 allowing the minnesota defenseman to play in the north stars' last two 
 regular-season games.  hatcher was given the penalty during a fight at 
 the end of a loss at st. louis on sunday, april 11.  but the league 
 didn't rescind the game-misconduct penalty shane churla received.  the 
 stars recalled center cal mcgowan from their top minor league club in 
 kalamazoo, mich., to replace churla.
