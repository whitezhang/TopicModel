 wood played most of his junior career in seattle.  he was one
 of the leading scorers on a mediocre team when he was traded away in
 1992.  he rarely lost a fight and was one of the toughest players in
 the whl.
 
 however, i was extremely surprised when he was drafted, especially in
 the third round.  he certainly didn't look like nhl material...
