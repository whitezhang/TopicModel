 you think that's bad?  i'm in bowling green, oh, and we get abc from
 toledo.  well, the cable co. decided to totally pre-empt the game (no tape
 delay, no nothing) for a stupid telethon!  hockey is very big around here,
 too.  i had to listen to "my" penguins win on my car radio out in the
 parking lot.  i can just be thankful for a strong radio because being 230
 miles from pittsburgh, the reception usually isn't good at all.  i can't
 believe i picked it up during the middle of the day.
