 so this year you had a game on scny, a game on sca, a game on espn,
 and if the rangers hadn't crashed and burned, you would have had a
 game on msg.  what are you complaining about?
 
 i seem to recall last year everyone complaining about sc coverage.  i
 even remember orioles' games being shown in the dc area instead of
 hockey.  and what about when sc failed to show the conclusion of other
 games because its feature game was over?  sound familiar?
 
 this year i'm getting twice the coverage.  i can see all the caps
 games *plus* the games espn shows.  i think it's great that hockey is
 back on espn.  imho, they're doing a great job especially considering
 the baseball contract they have to work around.
