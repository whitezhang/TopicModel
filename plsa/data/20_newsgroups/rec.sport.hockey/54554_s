 the first time i heard this piece of news was on the post game radio
 interview here in jyvaskyla. that was the bronze medal game in the 
 sm-liiga which tichonov's team porin assat (the aces of town pori:)
 lost.  vasili, the son of victor tichonov (the famous soviet coach),
 said that for a long time the sharks have been persuading him to
 take the assistant coach post. but he wants to be the head coach where
 ever he goes. he definitely won't be coaching assat anymore (after
 three? seasons). i don't know why.
 
 vasili is a good coach i believe. assat was a good team, produced many
 players to our national team. assat wasn't a skilled team (imho) but
 they had the fighting spirit. after all, they butchered jokerit in the
 playoffs and gave hard time to tps, the champs. but assat wasn't
 consistent, only when they were in the right mood they could beat any
 team in the sm-liiga.
 
 i am not 100% sure about the deal with the sharks. as i said, he wants
 to be the head coach. but he and the sharks are going to negotiate and
 decide during the wc. i doubt that he will be the head coach but
 maybe they'll do some compromise.
 
 could somebody post more information about vasili? i know he was coaching
 in the former soviet league; teams, results? his character as a coach?
