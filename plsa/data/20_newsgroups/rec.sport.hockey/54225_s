 note that this ominous prospect is fueled by the fact that various sc
 and prime outlets are wholly or partly owned by local nhl owners.
 when/if cablevision vp chuck dolan's purchase of the islanders goes
 through, the islanders will be back solidly in the scny fold (their
 original owners were, and they've remained due to a lucrative tv
 contract).  the flyer snyders own the philadelphia sc as well as the
 prism pay channel.  there are six teams affiliated with regional sc's,
 another half dozen affiliated with prime outlets, and other locals
 like hts and nesn who have barter arrangements.  with all this
 cross-ownership, i was surprised that espn got the deal this 
 season!!
