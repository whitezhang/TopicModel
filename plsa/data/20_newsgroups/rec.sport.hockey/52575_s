 actually, this part was really interesting.  it turns out that the mask is
 custom-fit to the goalie's face.  the goalie puts his/her face through a
 piece of wood (or was it plastic?) with a hole in it that allows only the face
 and forehead to show.  hair is covered by a cap, eyes are covered by a plastic
 wrap-type material, and vaseline is put on the goaltender's face.  then, a
 plaster is spread on their cheeks, forehead, and chin which takes about 12
 minutes to dry sufficiently.  when it dries, it is effectively a mold of the
 goalie's face.  this is used as the basis of the mask (the rest involves
 padding the inside, hardening the exterior, fitting the cage, etc. etc.  
 john blue of the bruins actually demonstrated the procedure on the show.

 yeah, essensa's mask looked really good.

 actually, i thought i heard him say that it _was_ potvin's for certain.  i
 would bet money on it either way...and it did look awesome!
