 as i promised, i would give you the name of the panther's president.
 after huizenga announced the team name, he announced that bill
 torrey is named the first president of the panthers.
 
 a little bio from _sun-sentinel_
 torrey, the architect of four consecutive stanley cup champions as 
 persident and general manager of the new york islanders.
 throughout his 27 years in the nhl, bill torrey's bow ties have become
 as much of a signature as andre agassi's hair.
 
 the panthers will introduce a uniform, insignia, and ticket-price 
 information in early next month.  in the meantime, huizenga leaves the
 day-to-day operation in the hands of torrey and bob clarke, the vp and
 gm.
 
 the florida panthers was chosen as the name of south florida's nhl team
 to focus attention on an endangered species.  there are 30 to 50 florida
 panthers in the everglades national park, the big cypress national 
 preserve and other parts of southwestern florida.
 
 "the panther is the quickest-striking of all cats," torrey said.  
 "hopefully that's the way we'll play on ice."
 
 more bio:
 in torrey, huizenga has the first man hired by the expansion islanders
 in 1972 and the one most responsible for guiding the islanders to four
 consecutive stanley cup championships (their first after only eight
 seasons) and 14 consecutive winning seasons.  as executive vice president
 of the california golden seals, torrey watched the seals go to the play-
 offs in 1968, only their second nhl season.
 
 "i guess this completes my own personal hat trick", said torrey, 58, a
 native of montreal but a resident of bear lakes country club in palm
 beach.
