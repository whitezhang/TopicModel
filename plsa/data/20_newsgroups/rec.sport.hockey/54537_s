 i'm not bored either.  most people i know say that winning the second cup
 was better than the first but to me nothing will ever top that first one.
 but i'm every bit as excited this year and i am experiencing that inner calm
 to which susan originally referred.  inner calm is not boredom.
 
 as far as the arena in general being boring, well richard's got that right.
 it's been that way all season.  i attribute it to a lot of new fans who
 just don't have the same spirit and knowledge as long-time fans.  at
 last tuesday's game, i overheard a man express surprise that a
 goaltender can get an
 assist.
 
 anyone who follows sports with regularity knows that anything can happen
 at any time.  i'm confident in the pens but i'm also not stupid enough to
 think for one minute that it's impossible for new jersey to blow them out
 of this series.  i doubt that will happen but it's possible.  bored?  uh-uh.
 spoiled?  not in the least.  forgot what excitement is like?  living through
 that amazing streak wasn't exciting?!  i don't take a darned thing for
 granted.  god, look at chicago...
 
 and i see no problem with quietly savoring all of this anyway.  it isn't gonna
 last forever and i intend to enjoy it while i can.  
 
 mom.
