 my apologies for the typo - i meant the wings had 5 power plays in the
 first period and the leafs none.  
 
 as well, my point isn't that the refs were biased, just that they were
 calling a lot of penalties, which works to the benefit of the wings.
 
 having the ref call a whole bunch of penalties against one team then
 calling a bunch against the other to "make up for it" takes a lot away
 from what could have been a great game.
