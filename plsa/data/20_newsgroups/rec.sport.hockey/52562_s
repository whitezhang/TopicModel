 first of all, the penguins will win the cup again.  who is going to stop them?
 definitely not the canucks! 
 
 my predictions:
 
 patrick division winner:  pittsburgh
 adams division winner:  quebec or montreal
 norris division winner:  detroit
 smythe division winner:  winnipeg
 
 wales conference champ:  pittsburgh
 campbell conference champ:  detroit
 
 stanley cup champions(again):  pittsburgh
 
 canucks suck.  they'll lose in the first round, compliments of winnipeg
 and teemu selanne.  
 
 the pens are almost unstoppable with mario lemieux.
