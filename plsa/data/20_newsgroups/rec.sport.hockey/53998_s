 the overhead replay pretty clearly showed that it was the quebec 
 defender who deflected the puck.  the re-play officials did not 
 take nearly as much time to make this call as they did for the first 
 non-goal, so it seemed pretty non-controversial.
 
 i agree that it was a great game; good to see roy and damphousse back
 into form.  hopefully the sign of good things to come...
