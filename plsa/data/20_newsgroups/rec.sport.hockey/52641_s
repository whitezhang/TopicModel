 major league baseball has told the blue jays and the expos not to
 sign oscar linares (i think that is his name)
 ...canada does not have the restrictions against
 cubans that the us has and other major league teams have told the
 canadian teams that they would be very unhappy if the expos or the
 blue jays would do this.  cubans players would not have to defect
 to play in canada and could play the 81 home games for the expos
 and blue jays without any trouble.
