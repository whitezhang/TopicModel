 first, i enjoyed reading your post.  second, i disagree with the pen's weak
 spot being defense and goaltending - for a couple of reasons.  barrasso has
 had a spectacular year - no slow start, consistently sharp, gaa < 3.0, and 
 leads the league in wins.  tommy deserves the vezina.  given the lack of 
 respect he commands, though, i doubt he will win it.  the other reason 
 concerns the pens' team defense.  they are hovering around 3rd or 4th in the
 fewest goals allowed.  that is a big improvement for them, and it indicates
 that they are playing better team defense.
