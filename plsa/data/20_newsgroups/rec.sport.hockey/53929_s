 
 	being a proud bu alumnus, i'd like to get a list of bu players in 
 the nhl so i can keep an eye on their progress. a lot of terriers are
 graduating this year so i hope to see them soon in the nhl. if somebody
 could post or send me a list, i'd appreciate it. please note if the player
 graduated from here or not.
