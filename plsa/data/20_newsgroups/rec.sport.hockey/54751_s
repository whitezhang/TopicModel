 attention penguins fans once again, apparently 99.999% of you understand that
 this was just a joke (hence the :-) next to it) but one idiot on here doesn't
 as he got pissed at me and sent me two hate e-mails telling me that this is
 wrong.  i have no intentions of sending e-mail to anyone should the pens win
 tonight, and i really do not expect/do not intend to lead any of you to send
 this poster e-mail either.  it was not a serious request.  if you didn't know
 that (which you probably did) then don't do it.  thanks.
