  markus had a good season in modo in the swedish elite league, scoring
  22 goals, 17 assists, 39 points and 67 pim in 39 games.
 
  as daryl points out, markus won't be joining the pens for this year's
  playoffs, since the world championships starts april 18th.
 
  but there is a good chance that markus will join the pens before next
  season. modo, though, naturally wants to keep their superstars forsberg
  and naslund, so the latest news on this is that modo is looking for
  personal sponsors for forsberg and naslund in order to match the kind
  of money they would receive in nhl.

  actually, swedish coach curt lundmark is thinking about leaving two
  spots open for additions from eliminated nhlers. it is mats sundin and
  calle johansson that curt hopes can join the team, although in a late
  stage of the tournament. technically, i seem to recall that you can leave
  spots open until 24 hrs before the wc final.
