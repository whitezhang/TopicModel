 ok, but have you seen tabaracci play yet?  in his two starts and
 his relief effort for beaupre, he has looked mighty sharp - don't
 forget the shutout.  i think he's let in just four goals over eight
 periods of play.  i like hrivnak, but we might actually have to give
 some credit to david poile for a change after this trade.
 
 hopefully if tabaracci starts against the isles tonight, i haven't
 jinxed him.
