 on the first hartford goal, gord hynes misplayed the puck at the flyers blue
 line and nylander stripped him and took off.
 
 the recchi goal was a 2 on 1 with lindros.
 
 the bowen goal was just a puck he threw at the net, got a good carom and it
 ended up behind the goalie.
 
 on the second nylander goal he got three whacks at the puck before it went in.
 this is the most frustrating part of the flyers defense. take the body, and if
 they get one shot and beat you fine. don't give them another chance. carkner,
 galley and mcgill are all terrible about this, i'll bet money at least one of
 them was the closest flyer to the play.
 
 that's all i have, my radio got bad after that and i was lucky to know who it
 was that scored, much less how.
 
 from what i heard, roussel had a very strong game. after the game, gene hart
 asked bobby taylor to pick the three stars of the season rather than of the
 game. it was garry galley #3 for his career high point total (i'm surprised
 that a former goalie wouldn't look closer at his defensive play), tommy 
 soderstrom #2 for his team record tying 5 shutouts in only about 1/2 a season
 and, mark recchi #1 for his all time high team single season scoring mark.
 but here's the odd part. he couldn't decide between lindros and recchi for
 number 1. if he picks recchi as #1 after he had a hard time choosing between
 him and lindros, doesn't that make lindros #2????
 
 what? you wanna know my three stars of the season? well, since you asked...
 
 #1 eric lindros. eric dominates a game simply by stepping out onto the ice.
 the difference between the team's record with him and without him is no
 accident. i believe that the team could have been almost as successful without
 recchi. there is no question that this team is significantly better with eric
 lindros on it, and i think that he will deservedly wear the 'c' on his jersey
 next season.
 
 #2 tommy soderstrom. 5 shutouts was second in the league to only ed belfour,
 and tommy didn't have a chris chelios (booo) in front of him. he also didn't
 play a complete season due to heart problems (sentimental edge here, my family
 has a history of heart problems). there's no question in my mind that tommy
 soderstrom is this teams goalie of the future, and if roussel complains again
 about being number 2 look for him to be traded within 2 years.
 
 #3 mark recchi. again, you can't argue with an all-time team high single season
 scoring mark. there are an awful lot of teams that didn't have a single player
 get as many points. plus, mark is the only flyer to play the entire season.
 not a tough choice.
 
 honorable mentions: rod brind'amour topped his single season high point total
 which he set last year. the difference was that he wasn't on the top line
 this year and didn't get as much playing time. then again, he didn't get the
 defensive attention that he got last year from the other team either.
 
 dimtri yushkevich was the teams most consistent defenseman. yes, he made rookie
 mistakes, but he was usually fast enough to make up for them. i have a feeling
 that with his shot he'll score a few more points next year without giving up
 anything in his own zone, and i suspect that he'll be the teams top defenseman
 in years to come.
 
 garry galley was the team's point leader from defensemen. again, there are some
 things you just can't argue with. and he battled with chronic fatigue syndrome,
 he certainly deserves kudos for only missing one game, and that was against his
 wishes under doctors orders. but his defensive play often negates his offensive
 contribution. a little more caution, and a little bit smarter in his own end
 will make him a much more important part of the team next year.
 
 brent fedyk was the leagues biggest improvement over last years point total.
 but consistency became a problem for him.

 the flyers end the season 1 game below .500 in 5th place, their best winning
 percentage since going .500 in 1988-89. 14-20-3 within the division (4th in
 patrick), 23-14-5 at home. they finished 17th overall, will draft 10th in
 next years entry draft (quebec had the 1st rounder, though). they scored as
 many goals as they allowed, 319.
 
 the 8 straight wins is the most since they won 13 in a row in 1985.
 
 i will be sending out final stats as soon as i get the issue of the hockey
 news that contains them, since there are no more games for me to go to i have
 no other way of getting them.
 
 i hope you've all enjoyed this years hockey season as much as i have. knowing
 the future that we have coming to us made missing the playoffs one more time
 almost bearable.
