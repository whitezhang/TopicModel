 if life were so simple!  savard has not played in three of the last 
 four games and they are still playing like crap.  montreal's problems
 run deeper than savard (and mouton) unfortunately; i hope they can
 get their act together before the playoffs.
 
 the line-up in their game coming up against pittsburgh is said to be
 the one they're likely to use for the playoffs.  let's hope they can
 forget about the nice weather we're having and play hockey.
