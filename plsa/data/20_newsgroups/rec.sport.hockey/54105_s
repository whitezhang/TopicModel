 whoa.  what you are effectively doing is implying that if a player plays
 really well, he 'stores up' mistakes that can be used at a later time.  ths
 is not so.  roy is the 'villain', as you so succinctly put it, because he
 allowed a very cheap goal.  if you think roy outplayed hextall, perhaps you
 should get a tape of the game and watch the first 7-8 minutes of the third
 period.  nhl goaltenders _make_ some great saves.  if they did not, they
 would not be in the nhl in the first place.  i do not expect any particular
 goalie to be able to make the great saves all of the time, even though they
 are occasionally required.  however, when it comes to a routine shot like
 sakic's, especially at such a crucial time in a game, i don't think there 
 are any legitimate excuses.

 i am not arguing that hextall was brilliant.  i am arguing is that a
 relatively weak wrist shot from the outside of the circle shold not result 
 in a goal.

 in a one-goal game with less than a minute to go there is no such thing as
 'just the 1 goal'.  i have not defended dionne for taking the penalty
 either...in fact i think it was a boneheaded move.  but it led to _one_ goal
 only, and montreal had a _two_ goal lead.  my main concern is the second 
 goal.

 what you say about the skaters is absolutely true.  but realize that the 
 game was effectively *won*.  you could watch any hockey game (in fact, you
 could watch any sporting event period) and spend hours discussing the 'what
 if's' w.r.t. missed opportunities.  they are not important when the final
 result is decided.  if i get the time soon, i'll watch the game again and
 email you a list of lucky montreal bounces and a list of quebec offensive
 screwups.  montreal was _leading_ with a minute to go.  the goalie
 is the last line of defence, and i will grant that extra attention is
 focussed on him, sometimes without justification.  but roy gave up a *lousy*
 goal, and a team cannot afford such a goal.
 
 >>roy looked like a player in an industrial league on sakic's shot.
 
 >and hextall didn't on dionne's goal? please. 
 
 who cares?  of what value is it to justify one lousy play with a totally
 unrelated lousy play?  i could do a hextall critique if you'd like.  but if
 you're going to assess his performance, keep in mind that he made the key
 saves at the key times.
 
 >roy is paid big money because
 >that is his value compared to other goalies ... and he still is in the top 5
 
 for the record, i did not say that roy was not one of the top goaltenders in
 the league.  in fact, i agree that he is.
 
 >the montreal media is the quickest to heap praise and then hurl derogatory
 >comments against the habs. they are no better than uninformed fans.
                             
 i assume you are referring to me.  however, i have pointed out that i think
 the loss can be blamed on roy.  i have not said he sucks, nor do i think i've
 made any other 'derogatory comments'.  if you regard objective
 (and informed, fyi) observations as derogatory, i really can't help you.
