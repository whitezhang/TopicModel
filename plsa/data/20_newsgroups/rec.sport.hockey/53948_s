 looks like bob errey's ring really sparkles in that locker room, and everyone
 else wants one, too! :-)  correct me if i'm wrong though, (just through
 the net, not through e-mail, i don't need 100 rl's in my e-mail!) but wasn't
 boston down 2-0 vs. buffalo last year?boston lost 1 and 2 at home and won
 3 and 4 in buffalo.  whoever wins game 3 will advance.  simple as that!!! :-)
