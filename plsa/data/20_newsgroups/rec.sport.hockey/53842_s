 oh to be back in the good old days when i lived in florida (florida for
 petes sake!!) and could watch hockey every night as espn and usa alternated
 coverage nights. oh well i guess it would be too simple for the home office
 to look back into their past to solve a problem in the present...
 
 of course i shouldn't complain. at least i'm getting to watch the playoffs
 for a change. (hooray!!) now if the espn schedulers will realise there are
 other teams except pittsberg in the patrick. (sounds like a dr suess book
 =)

 lets go caps!!
