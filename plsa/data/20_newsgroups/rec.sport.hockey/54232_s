 i have to agree wholeheartedly with this view.  i don't like to see stickwork,
 but you have to clear players away from in front.  my personal favorite move
 (i'm a goalie too) is to give the offeding player a good whack on the back
 of their skates when the ref isn't looking.  makes 'em go down like a ton of
 bricks, but doesn't cause injuries unless they don't know how to fall (i'm 
 talking about hitting the blades here, not the foot).  it also makes the 
 player you hit and anyone who sees really mad and apt to take a stupid
 retaliation penalty.  unfortunately, it also leaves your blocker out of 
 position for a short time...i don't do this if a shot is likely on the short
 side.  hmm....maybe i should mail potvin this method (in french and with
 helpful diagrams, of course).  it sure would be nice to see ciccerelli (who
 i have a great deal of respect for, btw, he's not a big guy, but he plays
 huge!) fall on his back a few times!  :-)
