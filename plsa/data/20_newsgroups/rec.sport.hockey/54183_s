 you can't be serious!  i and many of my colleagues have not received any
 bad e-mails from roger, in fact, roger happens to have answered most if not
 all of my hockey questions and curiosities, so before you start flaming
 at me or roger, better re-consider your nasty attitude towards roger and the
 like!
