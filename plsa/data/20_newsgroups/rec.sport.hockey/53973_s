      actually, what i think has become more evident, is that you are determined to
      flaunt your ignorance at all cost.  jagr did not have a better season than
      francis ... to suggest otherwise is an insult to those with a modicum of
      hockey knowledge.  save your almost maniacal devotion to the almighty
      plus/minus ... it is the most misleading hockey stat available.
 
      until the nhl publishes a more useful quantifiable statistic including ice
      time per game and some measure of its "quality" (i.e., is the player put out
      in key situations like protecting a lead late in the game; is he matched up
      against the other team's top one or two lines; short-handed, etc), i would
      much rather see the +/- disappear altogether instead of having its dubious
      merits trumpeted by those with little understanding of its implications.
 
 thank you for posting this.  as the person who first brought up the
 fact that jagr has a much higher +/- than francis, i can assure you
 that i brought it up as an example of the absurdity of +/-
 comparisons, even on the same team.  i never, ever thought that anyone
 would argue that jagr's higher +/- actually reflected better two-way
 play.
 
 in my opinion, francis's low +/- is purely a result of him being asked
 to play against opponents top scorers at all times; the fact that he
 can chip in 100 points while neutralizing the other team's top center
 is a testament to how valuable he is, even if his +/- suffers.  on the
 other hand, jagr, for how big, fast and skilled he is, can't even get
 90 points, no matter how inflated his +/- is.
 
 (by the way, don't get me wrong -- i like jagr.  he may be a lazy
 floater, but he turns it on at exactly the right times -- like
 overtime of playoff games).
