 i believe that phil esposito was the first to wear #77 when he played
 with the rangers in the '70s.  this was the season that they put the
 rangers crest and "modern-style" numbers on the jerseys instead of the
 "new york" or "rangers" block letters and two-colour numbers.  he took #77
 because the rangers already had a #7.
 
 (hockey night in canada made a big thing out of it, saying it was the
 biggest uniform style change in a long time.  this was before pittsburgh
 and vancouver changed their colours.)
