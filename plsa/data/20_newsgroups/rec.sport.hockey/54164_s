 about 25 is correct for numminen and lumme.

 no, kurri's points are too low. 27 for kurri and 28 for sel{nne.

 that's true. game is so different here in europe compared to nhl. north-ame-
 ricans are better in small rinks and europeans in large rinks. an average
 european player from sweden, finland, russian or tsech/slovakia is a better 
 skater and  puckhandler than his nhl colleague. especially defenders in nhl
 are mainly slow and clumsy. sel{nne has also said that in the finnish sm-league
 game is more based on skill than in nhl. in finland he couldn't get so many 
 breakaways because defenders here are an average much better skaters than in
 nhl. also alpo suhonen said that in nhl sel{nne's speed accentuates because
 of clumsy defensemen.
 
 i have to admit that the best players come from canada, but those regulars
 aren't as skilful as regulars in the best european leagues. also top europeans
 are in the same level as the best north-americans.(except lemieux is in the
 class of his own).
