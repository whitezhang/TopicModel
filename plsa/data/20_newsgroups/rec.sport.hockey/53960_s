 let's start over.  i'm not arguing about who is the better goaltender.  i'd
 take soderstrom right now.  what i am saying is that roussel can be a #1
 netminder.  the gaa difference is less than half a goal per game (less than
 that after last night), their save percentages are close, and their records
 are similar.  and with that, i just don't see how you can label roussel as
 the most disappointing player on the flyers this season.
 
 you say soderstrom played against better competition.  that may very well
 be, but there is no way of knowing how roussel would have performed in
 those games.  besides, against the better scoring teams like pittsburgh,
 the defense is more keyed up than they are against san jose.

 but i'm not just judging roussel on that game alone.  i've seen him play
 for the past two seasons in philly and before that in hershey.  it's just
 my opinion, but i think he's got what it takes.  of course, i thought that
 about mark laforest, too.  but i never did about wendell young.  so i'm
 batting .500 in judging hershey talent since the hextall-era.
 
 as for the rangers game, you can say he was saved by a mistake by the
 offensive player if you like.  but rou had his leg in position to make the
 save.  if he didn't, it wouldn't have mattered if the rangers player didn't
 get the puck up or not.  it would have been a goal.  on a breakaway that's
 what the goalie wants to do, take away as much as possible and force the
 shooter to beat him.

 i seem to remember roussel doing an excellent job against pittsurgh on
 opening night to give the flyers a tie against the two-time defending
 champs.  and not to take anything away from soderstrom because he was
 senational in that game agains the habs.  but you can't tell me that a
 montreal player had an open net to shoot at some point during that game
 and just flat out missed it.  mistakes, both on offense and defense are
 part of the game.  or there'd never be shutouts.
 
 anyway, i'm happy the flyers have both soderstrom and roussel and
 i'm not going to argue about it anymore.  besides, with the current
 7-game winning streak and expectations soaring for next year, i
 don't want to piss you off to the point that you don't sell me any
 tickets next season:-).
