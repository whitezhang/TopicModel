 from where i come from in canada, borshevsky sounds more canadian than
 smith! -)
 
 anyways, crawl back into the hole you crawled out of...the nba doesn't
 care where they get basketball players from, major league baseball
 doesn't give a damn where they get baseball players from (except cuba,
 that is).
 
 canada is in no imminent danger of being overtaken as the primary 
 supplier of players...sweden, finland, the czech republic, and slovakia
 are all relatively small countries, and cannot really produce players
 at a greater rate than they are already producing them, and the
 potential influx from the former soviet union is severely blunted
 because the system has been raided and is starved for finances and
 will take a decade or two, to recover and become a real threat, and
 the us will just maintain its slow increase.  canada should continue
 to supply 60% plus of the top hockey players in the world for the
 forseeable future.
 
 besides we need the european hockey market if hockey is to take
 its rightful place besides soccer as the two predominant world
 sports...and since soccer is essentially boring, unlike hockey.

 canadians are under no threat...the european numbers will soon saturate,
 if they haven't already...and by the time russia comes online again,
 the nhl should be a world league, and there will be many more teams
 to stock and many more jobs for canadian hockey players.  in the near
 team, the percentage of canadians will mostly decline because of 
 americans, not because of europeans.
