 i don't think primeau is necessarily a bad pick...i'm was just trying
 to locate the beginning of murray's decisions...he slowness in trading
 carson has delayed primeau's development...and you have to wait longer
 for big players often...and primeau can be a very good player without
 being a point-a-game-player, especially on a team that has yzerman and
 fedorov...if primeau becomes joel otto, and gets 20 goals a season,
 and plays mean...it will have been an extremely good pick.
