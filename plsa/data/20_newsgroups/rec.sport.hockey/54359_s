 in four of the five games finns have played, the goalie has been chosen
 the best player of the opposing team. (in the fifth, the finnish goalie, 
 ketterer was elected the best finn) has this to do with the goalies 
 having good days in these games, or are the finnish players just lousy
 scorers???
 
 anyway, quite few goals have been scored in these games in generally
 (the exception of course being canada vs. italy).  it looks like the
 goalies are getting too good.  is this due to their equipment getting
 bigger, so they cover more (their gloves, e.g. seem to be much bigger
 now than they were some years ago).
 
 anybody know if the rules on goalie equipment has changed this way????
