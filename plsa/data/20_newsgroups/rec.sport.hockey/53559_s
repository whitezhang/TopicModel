 it is no matter what you call the teams, jokerit and tps, or helsinki tornado
 and turku typhoon, the best palyers in finland would eventually end up in
 those teams anyway, if they were in the "big" league.

 unrealistic for now. maybe we should first just expand finnish league to
 allow teams from baltic countries to entry!  then others will get interested
 in the idea, that maybe one should settle something bigger. the ultimate 
 goal, as you want it, would be european division in nhl. btw. does that 
 make a final with an europan team against norht american?
