 
 so if potvin can pound on dino, what happens when dino pounds 
 on him?  if dino gets his legs slashed, can he slash potvin
 in return?  this year at a um-lssu hockey game, a um player
 was called for a slash when he hit the goalie's glove with
 his stick.  is that slashing, while hitting someone's ankles
 isn't?  how do the refs know what to call?  do the goalies
 get more liberties than other players?
