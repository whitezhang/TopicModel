 from his topps "rookie" year (as coach) card (74-75):
 "for the past couple of seasons, don has been the highly-successful
  coach of the rochester americans of the ahl, but he is getting his
  first shot at an nhl job with the bruins.  named coach of the year
  in the ahl the last two years, and he aims to make the bruins a
  rough team again, as they were a couple of years back.  although
  he played 16 seasons of professional hockey, don never played a
  regular-season nhl game.  he did appear in one playoff game for
  boston in 1956-57.  don's brother, dick, played two seasons in the
  nhl with boston and philadelphia."
