 ok, here's the solution to your problem.  move to canada.  yesterday i was able
 to watch four games...the nj-pitt at 1:00 on abc, la-cal at 3:00 (cbc), 
 buff-bos at 7:00 (tsn and fox), and mon-que at 7:30 (cbc).  i think that if
 each series goes its max i could be watching hockey playoffs for 40-some odd
 consecutive nights (i haven't counted so that's a pure guess).
 
 i have two tv's in my house, and i set them up side-by-side to watch mon-que
 and keep an eye on bos-buff at the same time.  i did the same for the two
 afternoon games.
 
 btw, those abc commentaters were great!  i was quite impressed; they seemed
 to know that their audience wasn't likely to be well-schooled in hockey lore
 and they did an excellent job.  they were quite impartial also, imo.
