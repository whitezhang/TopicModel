 then allow me to enlighten you, rex. you see, there's a thing called a tie. 
 a tie is worth one point (i know, i know. you're not good at math. but bear
 with me). a win is worth two points. so, getting two ties is the same as 
 getting one win. if your team played two games, won one and lost one, you'd
 have two points. if my team played two games and tied them both, we'd also
 have two points. we'd be tied in the standings even though our records are
 different.
 
 perhaps you should learn something about hockey before posting again. (i am
 starting to sound like roger or what?)
