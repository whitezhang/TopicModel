 
 ok guys, i need a list of the teams who have been hot or cold during the
 last 25 games.  doesn't need to be accurate, a rough guess will do.  i'm
 about to enter a playoff pool and i want to know who is hot going into
 the playoffs.  don't need to mention pittsburgh.  they can't get any hotter
 than they are now.
 
 
 p.s. i need this by sunday
