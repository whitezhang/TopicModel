 francis got 101 in 89-90, his last full season with hartford.
 
 in agreement with your previous post, i think francis is a tremendous and
 generally underrated complete player.  i would love to have him here in a
 capitals uniform where he would certainly be the #1 center (even though
 pivonka is also a very good complete player who is generally underrated).
 francis impresses me in many ways as an "ethical dale hunter".  tons of
 heart and can-do attitude with a lot of different skills, but none of
 the cheap shots and few penalty minutes.  not to mention nearly always
 coming through when it's important.
