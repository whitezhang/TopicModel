 
 the hawks won the norris div, and sealed their fate.  it's bad luck
 to win the norris.  the hawks will sweep the blues in their dreams but will
 lose in 6 in reality.  i predict that in the 6 game with the blues belfour
 will go down on his knees 7000 time s and will spend the rest of the time 
 looking behind him self.  butcher will pound roenick and the warthawks have
 no one tough enough to prevent it
 
 bye bye wart hawks
