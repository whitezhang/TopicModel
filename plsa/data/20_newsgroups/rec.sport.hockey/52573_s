 i've had, and still have a few aluminum sticks.  i got my first when i was 15
 (a christian), and broke the shaft halfway through the season, two years 
 later.  i bought another (a canadian) at the beginning of the next season, 
 and i still have it.  i also have an easton, that a friend was getting rid 
 off, after giving up the game.  i find that easton blades are easier to get, 
 but all brands of blades are pretty well interchangeable.  watch out for 
 dried up bits of firewood, that some stores pass off as blades.  in my 
 experiences, the blades of an aluminum break more often than regular sticks, 
 but i've only ever broken one aluminum shaft.
 
 i like aluminum sticks.  the blades are quickly changed, even on the bench 
 if you have to.  on the downside, the shaft won't break if you decide to 
 impale yourself on it :-)
