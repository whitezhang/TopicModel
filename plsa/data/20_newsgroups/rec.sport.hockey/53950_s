 
 while watching the penguins/devils game last night, i saw the "slash" that
 barrasso took on the neck.  this brought to mind the goaltender who had his
 jugular vein cut by a skate.  i think he was a sabre, but i'm not positive.
 does anyone remember/know his name?  what has happened to him since?  what
 about the player whose skate cut the goalie?  name?  info?  has this ever
 happened before in a hockey game?   
 
 thanks,
 
 carol
 go pens!
