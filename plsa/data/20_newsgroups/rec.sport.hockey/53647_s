 picture if you will, the habs going into the last couple minutes of the
 game, leading 2-0.  the nords get a power play, pull hextall, and get
 a goal.  bout a minute later, they get another one.  then they win in
 overtime......
 
 a bad dream?.......
 
 how's that red hot chili peppers song go...
 "give it away,give it away, give it away now...."
 
 oh well.  suppose i can always watch the leafs win tomorrow night....
    (smilies.....)
