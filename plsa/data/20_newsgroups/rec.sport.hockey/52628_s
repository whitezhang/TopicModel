 i've been watching & playing hockey for a good long time now, and
 i've seen players with questionable tactics, but never have i seen
 what ray did on sunday. this guy gets my all time loser award. it's
 one thing to repeatedly cross check someone to the back of the neck
 when they are down, it's another thing to have a fist fight with
 someones balls. ray should be thrown out of the league, what an
 a**hole.
