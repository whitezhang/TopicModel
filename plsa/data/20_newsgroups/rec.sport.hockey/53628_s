 there are always scalpers with tickets outside the arena.  you might have
 to pay a few bucks extra, but you can always find them.  look on the
 street under the message board, or out on the street in front of the hyatt,
 or even around gate 1.  the later you buy them, the less money you'll pay,
 and during the regular season you could usually find some for near face
 value or below if you wait until game time.  might be better to pick them
 up earlier now, though.
