 : finland:  
 : 
 : d-jyrki lumme.......20
 : d-teppo numminen....20
 : d-peter ahola.......13
 : 
 well well, they don't like our defenders (mainly lumme and numminen)...
 
 : c-jari kurri........25
 : c-christian ruuttu..16
 : 
 now, do you think that ruuttu is only worth 16 ? i think it might be 20.
 
 : r-teemu selanne.....27
 : 
 compared to kurri, selanne's points are too high, lets make it 25 or 26.
 
 
 : well in the canada cup and world championships largely due to the efforts of
 : markus ketterer (the goalie), 3-4 or the players listed above and luck. there's
 : presumably a lot of decent players in finland that wouldn't be superstars at
 : the highest level but still valuable role players, however. my guess would be
 : that the finnish canada cup team would be a .500 team in the nhl.
 
 wow, now, it looks like you don't like our players? what about guys like:
 nieminen, jutila, riihijarvi, varvio, laukkanen, makela, keskinen and (even
 if he is aging) ruotsalainen? the main difference between finnish and north-
 american players is, that our players tend to be better in the larger rink.
 the canadian defenders are usually slower that defenders in europe. 
 and i think that there was more in our success than ketterer and luck (though
 they helped). i think that the main reason was, that the team worked well
 together.
