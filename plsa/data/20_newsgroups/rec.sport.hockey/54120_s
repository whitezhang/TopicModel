 on wabc, the whalers on wtic and the red wings on wjr. this of course is in
 addition to the bruins who are currently on weei but may move to whdh because
 the fools at weei are owned by the celtics and thus will show them over the
 bruins every time there is a conflict. you can also get wbal baltimore but
 i don't think they have hockey. btw, i once got a station from indiana that
 had fort wayne comets games.
