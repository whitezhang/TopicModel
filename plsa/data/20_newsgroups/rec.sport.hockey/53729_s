 the new name is florida panthers.  
 the panther is an endangered species, mostly located in the everglades.
 a couple of years ago, there were license plates made with panthers on
 them (part of the revenue were to go to some protection fund).
 
 the name of the new president of the panthers should be announced today.
 
 as of yesterday's paper, huizenga's new hockey team will take the ice at
 the miami arena this fall.  the team has a guaranteed two-year lease with
 the arena, with four one-year options that could run through 1999.
 
 "it's not our choice", james blosser, a lawyer and huizenga aid said
 about ruling out the arena as a long term option.  "the nhl told us we 
 can't stay there.  it's not economically feasible."
 
 one reason is because the miami heat basketball team controls skybox
 and advertising revenue at the arena, reducing the hockey team's profit
 potential.
 
 the hockey team is attracting arena site proposals from broward, dade, 
 and palm beach counties.
 
 a leading site is vacant land near joe robbie stadium, where residents
 10 days ago agreed to drop their opposition to a hockey arena, ending
 an eight-year battle of wills.
