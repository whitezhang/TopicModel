 golly, i love stupid people. :-)
 listen, rex, this is hockey.  the nhl, to be precise.  and in the nhl,
 there exist these things called "ties".  a tie occurs when a game ends
 with the score for each team equal.  each team gets one point for a tie. 
 there also exits these things called "wins".  a win is when one team has a
 higher score than the opponent.  (oh yeah, only two teams play each other
 at a time, so i can say "the opponent".)  a team gets two points for a
 win.  so, let's say that a team has a record of 38 wins, 36 losses, and 10
 ties.  another team has a record of 40 wins, 38 losses and 6 ties.  the
 first team has (38*2)+10 = 86 points.  the second team has (40*2)+6 = 86
 points.  wow!  they *both* have the same number of points, but the number
 of wins is different!  how did they do that??!?!?!?!  that's amazing.  so,
 rex, when people talk about wins being the first tiebreaker, well, then
 that's what it means.  in our example, the second team would win the
 tiebreaker and therefore have the "better" record, even though both teams
 had the same number of points.  if you didn't understand this post, rex,
 maybe you should go back and read it again, very slowly.
