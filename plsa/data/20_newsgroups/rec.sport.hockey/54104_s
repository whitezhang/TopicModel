 i would argue gerald, that bowman is the first "modern" coach.
 bowman's canadiens were the first nhl team to have a weight-room
 in the 70s.  he is the first coach i have seen, that manipulates
 the press into spreading false game plan rumours.  (during important games
 listen to the pre-game interview will bowman and compare that to
 what is on the ice!)  i agree bowman is a master of the lineups. 
 remember last year in the sc when he benched jagr only to set him free 
 in ot.  when jagr banged in the winning goal i thought this was
 trademark bowman and also a sign of a modern coach!
 
 i am left asking "what is a modern coach if not bowman?"
