 i dunno about hat. i have friends up there on genie who are now saying that
 ottawa's gone soft on daigle and is thinking hard about pronger. daigle has
 shown an attitude the latter part of this season many folks havne't liked,
 and after coming back from his (second) multi-game suspension for being
 stupid, he's really tanked in his performance. his stock is dropping like a
 rock. 
 
 also remember that a lot of teh "draft 1st" stuff comes from the assumption
 he'll be traded to quebec for lots of prospects. it's not clear that 
 quebec would really be willing to pay a lot for him given his current
 status. he's still first round, but i don't consider him a first pick lock
 by any means at this point.
 
 it's also possible that the senators are posturing to try to bring down his
 signing price, since daigle has been taking some lindros lessons during thos
 suspensions.

 no. kariya won't go in the first three, for a very simple reason: he's not
 leaving college, and i don't believe any of the expansion teams are going to
 use a first for someone who won't be around for another year or two, not
 when there is equally good (or almost as good) stuff available that can make
 an immediate impact. san jose seems to be leaning heavily towards
 niedermayer for that reason. kariya could go 6th or 7th, unless a team can
 convince him to leave school early (which i doubt).
 
 
 my cut on things as they stand today:

 >1) ottawa (60% daigle, if not, 40% pronger)
 >2) san jose 80% niedermayer, unless ottawa skips daigle. then it's open.
 	(it depends on if the sharks can get a deal for him. i don't
 	believe they draft him to keep him).
 >3) tampa bay (whoever ottawa doesn't take, or maybe koslov)
