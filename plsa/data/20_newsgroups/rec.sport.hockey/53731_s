 according to this morning's post-gazette:
 
 the pens will be carried by kdka-radio(1020 am), unless the pirates
 are playing.  when the pirates play, the games will be carried by 
 wdve(102.5 fm).  wdve will carry 12 games, starting with tonight's
 game.
 
 in fact, after this season, kdka will no longer be the flagship
 station for the pens.  the penguins and kbl have struck a new 
 deal regarding the tv and radio rights to the games.  it seems
 more than likely that wdve will be the flagship radio station next 
 season.  kbl will carry 62 games on tv,  with 17 of the games to be 
 simulcast on kdka-tv.  the remaining 22 games, as well as some of the 
 early round playoff games, will be available by "subscription tv" only.
 to receive the games, you'll have to pay a one time hook up fee, and
 then a monthly fee of $11-12 dollars.
 
 also, under the new deal, there will no longer be radio/tv 
 simulcasts.  there will be a tv broadcast team, and a radio
 broadcast team.  
 
 no word on who the announcers will be.  mike lange and paul steigerwald
 are both under contract with kdka, but their contracts expire at the
 end of this season.  kbl president bill craig said he'd like to hire
 lange and steigerwald.
