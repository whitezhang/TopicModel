 it's over - the sabres came back to beat the bruins in ot 6-5 tonight
 to sweep the series. a beautiful goal by brad may (lafontaine set him
 up while lying down on the ice) ended it. fuhr left the game game with
 an injured shoulder and lafontaine was banged up as well; however, the
 sabres will get a week's rest so injuries should not be a problem.
 
 montreal edged quebec 3-2 to square their series, which seems to be
 headed for game 7. the habs dominated the first two periods and were
 unlucky to only have a 2-2 tie after 40 minutes. however, an early
 goal by brunet in the 3rd won it.
 
 the islanders won their 3rd ot game of the series on a goal by ray
 ferraro 4-3; the caps simply collapsed after taking a 3-0 lead in the
 2nd. the isles' all-time playoff ot record is now 28-7.
