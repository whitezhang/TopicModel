 but ultimately their hockey philosophies are like night and day...
 keenan believes in pressuring the opposition and taking the
 initiative (within the limits of his system)...while roger
 has a reactive hockey philosophy...which is why messier will
 be able to and has played for keenan, but thought roger's way
 was a sure loser.

 roger is a great assistant coach...but considering what must be bad
 blood between nielson and messier, it would be a mistake to bring
 him back even in that role.
