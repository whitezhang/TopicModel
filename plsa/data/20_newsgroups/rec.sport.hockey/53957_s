 i don't know if anyone has posted a message like this yet, but i'm
 getting really sick of espn showing the last minute of a hockey
 game, in which the score was just tied, and then cutting out and saying
 "sorry we can't show you this we have to show baseball tonight" (not
 even a game. a friggin highlight show).
 gee, sure would have been nice to see the isles/caps in overtime.
 i live in pittsburgh (yes i'm a pens fan) where hockey gets a lot
 of coverage.  i can only imagine how a caps fan residing in texas
 must feel.
