 the hawks win!!  jermey roenick scored his 50 th goal and the hawks put the
 leafs in their place, the losers column.  if the leafs can not even beat the
 hawks in a match that had little or no meaning i will hate to see them against
 the wings.  
 
 oh btw i laugh at rm, that jerky!!!
 
 go hawks!!!
