 messier was not invited due to his nagging injuries.  while the press
 made an issue of it, and attempted to link it to the rangers' internal
 political woes, mike keenan repeated that to messier personally during
 the msg press conference.  it makes sense ... messier would probably
 have not declined the invitation if it were made for publicity ...
