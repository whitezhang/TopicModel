 sorry, nelson, but you forgot to ask me. if you check the thn stats for
 kansas city, you'll find that larry has been playing for the games, having
 played in 8 games in the period covered in the stats between 3/26 and the
 4/16 issue (1-3-4 with 13 pim). not exactly invisible.

 well, having gotten to a chance to talk to him a few times, this isn't quite
 accurate. he injured his back (a disk injury) and did one stupid thing,
 which was to hide it from the sharks and he tried to play through it because
 he knew he was on the bubble. the sharks then sent him to k.c., at which
 point he disclosed the injury. since he didn't disclose it, the sharks and
 he disagreed about the responsibility and he was suspended for not
 reporting. that was eventually worked out, the sharks re-instated him as
 injured and put him into therapy, and when he was able to play then shipped
 him down to k.c. he fully expects to play in the nhl again, although clearly
 not with the sharks (hiding injuries is a stupid no-no, beyond just a
 no-no).
 
 very nice guy. always hustled his butt off. he disappeared because he was
 hurt. i expect he'll surface with another team at some point (probably
 another expansion team), but is likely to be a bubble player for the rest of
 his career. has a good work ethic and is good at getting other players
 motivated. unfortunately, he played himself out of the sharks future with a
 bad judgement call.

 always gave 110%, best work ethic on the club (except maybe kisio), but
 hustle isn't always enough. his future with the sharks was made clear to me
 one night against the flames when he went behind the crease and tried to
 hold joel otto against the board. he literally had one arm around otto's
 neck and another wrapped around otto's stick arm. otto casually turned
 around and fed the puck in front of the crease for a goal, as though carter
 wasn't there. hustle can only cover size so far.
 
 the sharks have told me, point blank, that he's gone for good (ditto hubie
 mcdonough). he was one of the favorites of the staff, but as one said to me
 "you have to make room for the kids". carter, in fact, refused to report to
 k.c. and has been suspended by the sharks. that might be a defacto
 retirement, but i haven't heard anything official. his only hope in hockey
 now is the gulls.

 because, at least from the games i saw him in, he was outmatched and looked
 fairly lost on the ice. i think he shows potential, but i didn't think he
 was quite ready to make the jump to the nhl.
 
 > he should be a solid contender for regular duty next season.
 
 agreed (btw, i still think a lot of your grades are more based on how you
 wish they'd performed than how they actually performed. i wonder whether you
 can really judge talent from radio and television, nelson? i know i have
 trouble, since you don't see the off-puck action. your views from home and
 my views from the ice differ in numerous ways)

 you? nah... 
 
 he was seriously unimpressive, even as a tough guy (his rep). however, as
 few games as he had in a season that was at that point meaningless, i hate
 to judge the talent too quickly. butn in dody's case, i"m tempted to make an
 exception.
 
 but i won't.
