 well i think it in 1969 the montreal canadians finished 1st (although
 there was no president's cup in those days) and missed the playoffs 
 in 1970. i do recall that the 1970 playoff picture wasn't decided until
 the final day, when the ny rangers defeated the redwings. the tie-breaker was
 the number of goals for (if i remember correctly), so the rangers played
 with an empty net for the entire game. some hab loyalists accused 
 the wings of 'throwing' the game to keep them out, but as i recall, 
 gordie and delvecchio had the flu, so coach sid abel sat them out,
 and the rangers swarmed the redwings most of the night.
