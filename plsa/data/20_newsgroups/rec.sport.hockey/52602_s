 i disagree.  i think the nhl should feature the best hockey talent in
 the world -- regardless of nationality.  i have to admit that when i 
 see players like gretzky and messier traded off to the us because the
 canadian teams can't afford them, i have been know to say (only half-
 seriously) that we'd probably be better off if we had our own canadian
 hockey league for canadian players! ;-)

 again, it doesn't matter to me -- russian, finnish, mexican, albertan,
 new yorker, black, white, korean, martian, plutoneon, ... it doesn't
 matter.
  
 any of them can put a leafs' jersey on if they can put the puck in!
