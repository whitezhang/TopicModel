 (detroit, april 19)
 
 in a development that shocked most knowledgable observers, the detroit redwings
 scored no less than six goals against the best goaltender in the world en
 route to a 6-3 win over the best team in the nhl, the toronto maple leafs. 
 
 the leafs could not be faulted, as they completely dominated the inferior
 detroit squad and clearly deserved to win. only the biased officiating of
 andy van hellemond and the idiots that insisted upon throwing an octopus on
 the ice at every stoppage in an obvious attempt to distract the superior 
 visiting side prevented an all-out massacre of the wings by the league's best 
 team.
