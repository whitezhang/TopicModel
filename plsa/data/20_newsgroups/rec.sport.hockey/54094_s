 it was great to hear that umass is bringing back hockey!  it reminded me that a
 couple of years ago there was talk that both bimidgi (sp?) and mankato state
 trying to upgrade their programs to div. 1 status.  i also seem to remember
 that they had some trouble with new ncaa rule about just who was allowed to
 compete at the div. 1 level.  was that ever resolved?  also, i was just
 wondering if there is any college hockey east of colorado (alaska excepted).
 with the new popularity of hockey on the west coast, i would expect there to
 be some interest building at the collegiate levels too. anyone heard anything?
