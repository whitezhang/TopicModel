 what did happen to the swiss team ? last year they reached the semi-final
 and now after 3 matches no points and even no goals !!
 after the 0:1 against italy it seems they lost any hope and were
 overrun 0:6 by the russian team.
 now it seems that they have to work hard not to be relegated to the
 b-level. does anybody know if this wc is the qualification tournement for
 the olympic games '94 in lillehammer or are some teams already
 qualified for them.
 
 hopp schwiiz
