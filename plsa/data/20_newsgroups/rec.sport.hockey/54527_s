     espn never committed (and i never saw advertised) to a particular
 thursday game.  they had originally scheduled bos-buf, and that was
 somehow leaked on this net, but to my knowledge espn never publicly
 released a schedule until monday when they announced pitt-nj thursday
 and boston-buffalo saturday.
