 why!!! dc/baltimore is one of the top media markets (=the only thing the nhl
 seems to care about these days), they've been doing far better than the nba
 bullets at the gate for the last five years. the team has been a perennial
 contender and fan support has been good to excellent . . . why should pollin
 move to city that's five times smaller but has as many teams in other pro
 sports. i don't get it...
