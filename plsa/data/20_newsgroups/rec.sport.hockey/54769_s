 i used to work for the stars.  minnesota supported the team to an
 extent.  when i was there, we had quite afew sellouts (this was the
 season after the cup run and during the finals).  norm's main bitch was
 that there wasn't enough luxury suites.  and, the ones he had were not
 always full.  he wanted more boxes and wanted them full.  he was just
 asking for too much from people that could go and see other hockey games
 at high schools for $5 or college for about $10 that would probably be
 better.
