 
 	i loved the abc coverage. the production was excellent. the appearance
 was excellent. it had a sleek modern look. this was the first time i heard
 thorne & clement & i thought they were great. my only request is to leave
 al micheals out of this. he annoys me. 
 	i'm hoping this leads to a regular-season contract. my guess would
 be is that it will be roughly a weekly game from feb.-april and then the 
 playoffs. i envy you canadians with your tsn & cbc. maybe i'll get a dish
 to pick up canadian tv. how much are those things, btw?
