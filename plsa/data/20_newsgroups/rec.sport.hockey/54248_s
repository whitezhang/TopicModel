 hey,guess what's coming to espn for a change? a playoff which doesn't
 involve the pens. not that there is anything wrong with that...
 
 espn games :
 
 thursday  game3 pens at devils at 7:30(gary thorne and bill clement)
 saturday  game4 caps at ny isles at 7:30(tom mees and john davidson)
 
 abc game :
 
 sunday    game4 pens at devils at 1:00 (gary thorne and bill clement)
 
 espn named its #2 broadcast team on tuesday. it paired tom mees(play by
 play) with john davidson(analyst).
