 these new rule changes are great!  however, i think that your rules are
 much too complicated.  how will the normal average fan be able to count
 how many fouls a player has?  and then we would even have to remember the
 names of the players, in order to determine who drew the foul!  and, of
 course, there will have to be new "sub-positions", like the power center
 who just sits in the slot until the (blue, of course) puck comes near him,
 and the "shooting defenseman" and the "point defenseman".  finally, we'll
 be able to keep stats on the best and the worst penalty-shot takers. 
 since almost everyone on the ice will be getting fouled, we'll be able to
 see ulf samuellson (sp?) and tie domi miss penalty shots like crazy.
