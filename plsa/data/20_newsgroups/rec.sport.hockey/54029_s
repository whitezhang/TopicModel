 my sig has nothing to do with cockiness.  what you put in your sig has nothing
 to do with your article, as i learned back in the fall, the hard way.

 two points, one what does r.s.b.c. have to do with hockey?  secondly, umass
 beat my quakers???  hello!!!  earth here, are you responding???  we're not in

 sides involved in a playoff game.  never never never!)
