 i re-read what i wrote and it didn't say exactly what i thought.  
 
 sure the pens are a better team.  they've got size and the best skill players
 in the league.  they've also got the best clutch goaltending.  they're the 
 best team in the league.
 
 but, my point was the caps have not played to their ability level vs the
 pens since last year's choke.  and that's the mental problem (the one they've
 had for a number of years) i tried to point out.  spirit, mental preparedness,
 will to win, whatever you want to call it, it's missing when the caps play the
 pens.  actually, you're right - it won't make any difference.
