 	was the abc coverage of the kings/flames game supposed to be the
 way it was shown in bc with cbc overriding the abc coverage?  when i flipped
 to abc, it was the same commentators, same commercials even.  my question
 is:  was this the real abc coverage or did cbc just "black out" the 
 abc coverage for its own?
 
 
 	comment:
 
 	cbc had a great chance for some double headers:  toronto/detroit
 and vancouver/winnipeg, but today they said that the east gets the leafs
 and the west get the vancouver game.  i thought that they would show them
 both.
