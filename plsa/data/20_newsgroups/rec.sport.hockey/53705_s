 well, actually now that you mention it, a few weeks ago the cbc ran a
 documentary on "ice hockey in harlem".  the canadian club of new york
 (something like that) sponsors a league for kids in harlem and based on
 the tv report they all seemed to be having a lot of fun.  all playing
 with regular equipment, jerseys, etc etc, on a proper outdoor rink.  it
 looked just like kids playing hockey anywhere else.
 
 some of the kids were even fortunate to get a trip to a hockey camp in alberta.
