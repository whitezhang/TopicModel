  first of all i think when espn covers the game they do a wonderful job, but
  last night i felt the same way. i really hate watching devils/pens game. 
  everyone knows that devils are going to get their ass kicked, why even 
  bother showing them. i was so bored and these espn people don't seem to have
  any brain. after the sundays and last night games, they are still going to 
  show devils/pens on thu and sun. what the hell are they thinking about? i 
  think if they keep it up like this nhl will never get a major network contract.
  i'd rather see caps/isls game which is more exciting. 
 
  now i just hope all baseball games are rained out on espn so atleast
  we can get diffrent hockey games.
