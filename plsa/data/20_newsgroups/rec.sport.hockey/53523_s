  i agree with rick that ulf's cross check wasn't illegal. it was the kind
  of check you see a dozen times during a game without being called. slo-mos
  sometimes have a tendency to make things look worse than they really are.
  besides, if messier can't take the heat, he should stay out of the kitchen.

  well matt, mattias timmander hasn't been playing with the modo elite league
  team yet (just the modo junior team), so i predict he needs a few more years
  here before he can join the b's. i saw him play in the swedish championship
  game for junior players this year, and he played very well, a physical game,
  but not the kind of rough stuff that ulfie does (i suspect you would like to
  have a ulf type-of-player on the b's team too? :)
  as for mariusz czerkawski, he has had a *great* season for hammarby in
  division 1. he scored -if i remember correctly- 93 points this season,
  and then we have to keep in mind that a 50+ point season in sweden is
  considered *very good* due to the limited number of games. mariusz is
  djurgarden property (he was just on loan to hammarby), so he will play
  in elitserien next season, unless the b's can get him of course.
  i would say that mariusz has to be one of the most exciting player to
  watch in swedish hockey this season.
