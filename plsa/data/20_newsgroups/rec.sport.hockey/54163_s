 
 so all us hockey/automobile racing fans all know exactly where we stand
 	espn delays the martinsville race by a day for the nfl draft
 	espn shows baseball instead of the overtime of a nhl playoff game
 
 	gimme a break, guys
 
 =>  >>does anyone know why this race is tape delay? especially until monday???
 =>  >is this the weekend for the nfl draft?
 =>  >if so, postponing the race for a day is
 =>  >a real slap in the face for racing fans.
 =>  i'm afraid you're right (as usual). as i recall they've been doing this
 =>  ever since they started covering the draft live. i wish they could work
 =>  out some kind of a deal with somebody else such as tnn to get the race
 =>  on live, but i guess espn isn't much into sharing. it also clarifies
 =>  where auto racing stands on their priority list (as if we didn't already
 =>  know ;-)
