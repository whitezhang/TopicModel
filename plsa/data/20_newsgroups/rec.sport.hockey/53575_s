 yes, but as has been mentioned many times before, the islanders play at
 the talent level of their opponent.  since hartford is pitiful, the
 islanders played pitiful.  since pittsburgh is great, the isles will most
 likely play great.  this is most likely due to inexperience and very poor
 shooting.  to greg: yes, i have noticed that the islanders couldn't hit
 the broad side of a barn with the puck if they were two feet in front of
 it.  does anyone have shooting percentages?  i don't know if that would
 help, since they often miss the net completely, but it might shed some
 light on the subject.
 
 and, my playoff pool is running!!!  exact rules to be posted tomorrow, but
 don't hesitate to send in picks!!!
