 buffalo fans:
 
 some people in the discussion group, as well as "commentator al" on espn, 
 believe that game 3 is critical for the sabres.  helloooo!!!!! the sabres 
 are ahead 2 games to 0, not behind.  as a life-long sabres fan, i am well 
 aware of their ability to choke, but let's not exaggerate that.  as long as 
 the sabres win one of the next 2 games (be it game 3 or game 4), they are 
 still in good shape (ahead 3 games to 1), with game 6 to be played at 
 buffalo.  if they lose games three and four, then start worrying.  game 3 is 
 critical for boston, not buffalo.
