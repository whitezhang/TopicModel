 is it just me or is the camera work on some of these games really sad??  i
 can't remember how many times during the penguins-devils game they showed some
 guy (without the puck) being checked in the corner while the puck was being
 fired on goal.  in fact, i think they even missed one goal completely because
 they were showing two guys holding each other in the corner.
 
 now the last time i watched a football game, they didn't show the lineman going
 at it while the running back turned the corner for a touchdown . . . . 
 
 is it just me??
