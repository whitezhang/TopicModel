 i don't "notice" refs and linesmen until the playoffs come around, and
 yes i have to agree that stewart called the *two* worst games i've seen
 so far (mtl-quebec game 1, and last nights toronto-detroit game).
 
 what's the scoop on this guy? is he the latest incarnation of
 kerry fraser??? just because you are boneheadedly stubborn doesn't
 make you a good ref!!! making the right call does...
 
 my votes for:
 best ref: van hellemond
 most improved: koharski
 worst: paul stewart
 
 (oops, i don't really want to start a best/worst ref thread so don't
 follow up ;-)
 
 paul yatrou.
