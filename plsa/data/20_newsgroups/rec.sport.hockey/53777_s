 no, caleb, it's not the quality of espn that i have a problem with;
 it is superb, whereas it did not evolve beyond the point where espn
 left off when hockey went to sc (this is excepting sc's use of feeds
 from cbc (-;).  it's the amount of hockey they're showing, or lack
 of it, that we're complaining about.  they had rights to two ot's
 that could've been shown on sunday night after baseball ... and
 they had pickup trucks racing through oversized pigpens followed
 by super-8 home movies of old car races (yes, i was checking in
 desperation for canucks-jets) last night after sportscenter.
