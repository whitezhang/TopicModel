 
 caps/isles fans,
 
 anyone interested in catching the games from nassau
 coliseum (hopefully there will be another) can catch
 the game at north carolina's original sports bar in
 chapel hill.  i'm pretty sure they carry hts as well.
 they had all three games on at the same
 time last night.  this is the only place i know to
 catch all of the stanley cup action.
