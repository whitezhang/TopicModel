 people are seeming to be less concerned about kariya's size as he leads
 teams to championships (world junior and us college) and collects
 awards...everyone is watching with interest as to how he will perform
 on left wing with eric lindros and mark recchi at the world
 championships.
 
 4 months of go...chances were not very good that he would go in the
 top five...now it has become probable...a great world championship
 could put him in the top 3 with daigle and pronger.
