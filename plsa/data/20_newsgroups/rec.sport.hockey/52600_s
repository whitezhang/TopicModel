 you know, you're absolutely right.  i think we should round up all those
 players of european descent and ship 'em back to where they came from.  let's
 see, with whom should we start?  i dunno, lemieux?  hmmm...sounds like he
 has *french* blood in him!!!  hey!  france is part of europe!  send that
 euro-blooded boy back!!!
 
 sheesh.

 i don't think it would be hard to find some native americans (or native
 canadians, for that matter) who would dispute your claim to this great 
 continent of *ours.*  ya see, if you believe the anthropologists, we're *all*
 immigrants of some sort.  if you really don't think that mogilny, bure,
 selanne, et al have improved the nhl, then i'm not sure you understand the
 game.
