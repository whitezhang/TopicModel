 : you mention could cut it as stars in the nhl! even "rexi" in his prime was more
 : of a good regular in new york/edmonton than a superstar in his own right,
 : although some blamed that on lack of effort on his behalf.
 :
 i think that the ny management made a mistake, and remember how edmonton 
 called reksa in the middle of the season to win the cup ? why did they call
 him?
  
 : yeah, we've had a tendency to beat ourselves in the past. i almost knifed my
 : brother in anger when sweden scored two in the final minute of the wc 
 : semifinals back in 1986:-) or what about the three goals antero kivela let in
 : with five minutes to go against the russkies in lake placid'80? ugh . . . 
 
 o.k., that was bad luck. if penguins have the same kind of luck this year in
 the playoffs, they'll never win the cup. they are still the best team.
