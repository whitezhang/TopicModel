 yes and no. espn2 will be launched as early in september. cap cities
 are currently working with cable companies to ensure a good start-up
 base needed for a launch for any brand new cable service.
 
 the problem espn2 faces is the tci-cablevision connection in the
 merger of their prime and sportschannel networks. prime sportschannel
 will try to wrestle away nhl from espn in the off-season. also,tci
 and cablevision have control a large number of cable systems around the
 country with a total of 15 million subscribers. tci-cablevision will
 do their best that espn2 never gets off the ground successfully. and the
 nhl's value will suddenly skyrocket in this cable war between prime sc
 and espn. nhl is more vital to the survival of a regionalized prime
 sportschannel since they virtually have no national major league sports
 contracts and only cover local nhl/nba/mlb sports teams.
