 anything about him, i don't know whether it is just this area
 (pittsburgh) of the usa that is "deprived" of his broadcasts or whether
 he's a canadian thing altogether.  seriously, what is he all about?  i
 know he was a coach at one time, and from the volume of posts about him,
 someone surely is getting a steady diet of him somehow, but my question
 is, what is the deal with him?  secondly, are the comments of his that i
 read about on the net merely flame bait, or do people actually take him
 seriously?  i gotta tell you, from what i see, he really sounds like an
 ass.  let me know - maybe i'm missing something.
