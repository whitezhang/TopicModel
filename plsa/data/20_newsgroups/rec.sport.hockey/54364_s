 absolute nonsense.  the decision that was made was pocklington's.  he chose 
 20 mill over gretzky.  if gretzky wasn't upset about not being able to win
 a cup in la then i submit that he wasn't worth the 20 mill.

 how do you know what he thinks (or thought)?  the only "thought" that i
 can see that you have revealed is your own.  you don't like gretzky.
 big deal.

 the real purpose of diving is not merely an attempt to draw a penalty.  what
 the player is trying to do is make the checkers keep their distance so the
 ref won't be fooled.  i can't imagine why anyone would expect someone like
 lemieux to change his game.  why don't you pick on 1 dimensional over-rated
 type like hull and salami.
