  marcus thuresson had 6 goals, 10 assists, 16 points and 22 pim in 31 games
  this season for leksand in the swedish elite league. this was only 10th
  in point scoring for leksand.
 
  marcus (born may 31 1971, ht 185 cm, wt 85 kg) is relatively young so he
  might still start producing, but i think the sharks may have done a bad
  trade here.
