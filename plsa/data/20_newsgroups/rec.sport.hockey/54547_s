 
  have belfour and roenick done another disappearing act at chips are 
  down time?  when i saw them it looked like the blackhawks' defense
  might carry them along way in the playoffs.  
 
  well they held st. louis to 17 shots in game 2 and lost.
 
  looks like maybe keenan had (has) some insight to me.
