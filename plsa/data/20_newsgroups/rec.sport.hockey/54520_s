 and fleury is no enforcer. an agitator for sure, but fleury never has and never
 will have a fight, which seems to be what you're saying wood is. 
 
 the closest fleury ever came to fighting was a game two years ago against
 los angeles. there was a scrum and mcsorley pinched fleury's head under his
 arm. fleury dropped his gloves and gave mcsorley a weak shot to the side of the
 head. mcsorely, knowing a good thing when he saw one, popped fleury one right
 between the eyes. end of fight. fleury got ten stitches for his trouble.
 
 the only player i can ever see theo fighting is cliff ronning, and even then
 he'd be giving up two inches and 10-15 pounds. :-)
