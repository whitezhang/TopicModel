 for the first time all season, the flames are now injury-free. the only player
 remaining on the limp is center carey wilson who, even when healthy, is not 
 a major part of the team. 
 
 trent yawney did not score a goal all season until the last regular season
 game against san jose. he potted his first of the year in that game, and has
 also scored goals in both game 1 and game 2 against los angeles. 
 
 thoughts on game 1:
 ==================
 
 the flames played horribly in dropping the first game of their series with
 los angeles 6-3 on sunday afternoon. they seemed more interested in throwing
 big hits than in scoring goals. they physically dominated the kings, but that
 was the only area they dominated in. the game plan was to rush the net and 
 try and take advantage of a young, inexperienced l.a. defence and the shaky
 kings goaltending, but those plans fell by the wayside while the flames
 conducted a steady march to the penalty box. particularily stupid was theoren
 fleury taking a five minute major and a game misconduct for slamming warren
 rychel's face into the dasher while rychel was on his knees. 
 
 goaltender mike vernon played well and could not really be faulted for the
 loss, despite his well-publicized poor record in afternoon games. he got
 very little support from his defence in clearing the front of the net and 
 sweeping away rebounds. in fact, marty mcsorley's goal actually went in off
 chris dahlquist's skate in front of the net. 
 
 thoughts on game 2:
 ==================
 
 the flames came back strong in the second game, evidently aware of the
 potentially fatal consequences of losing both the first two games on home ice.
 the first period was fairly even, with the edge going to the kings. but calgary
 came out strong in the second period and simply dominated the kings, scoring
 five goals to take a lead they never relinquished en route to a 9-4 win. 
 
 the deciding factors in this game were faceoffs and special teams. calgary
 dominated on faceoffs as they did in game 1, but they were able to make better
 use of the won faceoffs in this game than they did in the first one. calgary
 also went 3-for-5 on the powerplay while l.a. only went 1-for-8 and gave up
 a shorthanded goal to joel otto. l.a.'s powerplay goal also came late in the
 game with the outcome already decided. the kings' powerplay failed them when
 they needed it most, in the 1st and 2nd periods. 
 
 the flames lost rw greg paslawski with a suspected shoulder injury when he
 was leveled by alexei zhitnik right after scoring calgary's 7th goal. charlie
 huddy left the game for the kings with a groin injury. 
 
 the game was marred by stupidity in the last minute. first, craig berube of
 calgary took a five-minute major for fighting plus a game misconduct for
 instigating when he went after tony granato for no apparent reason. granato
 drew a minor for some strange reason. (turtling perhaps). this was followed
 30 seconds later by warren rychel drawing a major, minor, and game misconduct
 for hitting frank musil in the face with his stick and then instigating a
 fight. musil got a fighting major for some similarily strange reason. hardy and
 yawney went toe-to-toe and both got double minors. (gregson thought that musil 
 turtling amounted to fighting, but that yawney and hardy throwing punches at 
 each other was just roughing? where's this guy from.....)
