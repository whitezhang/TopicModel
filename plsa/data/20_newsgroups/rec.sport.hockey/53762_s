 all of this is fine.  i never said that murray was a bad gm.  i merely said
 that he isn't the best gm in hockey- or even a contender for that honor.
 if murray is as great as you claim- the wings would have won the stanley cup
 by now- probably more than once.  if he was as great a gm as you claim
 and he was as poor a coach as you claim- he would have been intelligent
 enough to hire the coach to push the team to the next level of success.
 but murray is an average (unspectacular) nhl coach and a pretty good gm
 so none of this is true anyway.
