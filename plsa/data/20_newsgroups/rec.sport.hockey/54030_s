   well i think whenever espn covers the game they do a wonderful job. but
    what i don't understand is that they cut the ot just show some stupid
    baseball news which is not important at all. then i waited for the scores
    to comeon sportscenter, but they talk about baseball, basketball and 
    football. then they showed penguine highlight and went back to stupid
    basketball. finally they showed a highlight of the ot goal but that
    was like 30 sec. i think they should give more attention to nhl during
    the playoffs then talking about boring basketball games..
 
    i guess it is nhl's fault too for leaving espn. hope things improve
    by next season...
