 according to "quotations from chairman cherry", don was playing in
 springfield. he and another player had to pay some fines; the other
 player had his paid off, but not don didn't want to.
 
 don called the other player a "teacher's pet", and the other player
 replied "ah, that's just sour grapes".
 
 don't know how accurate that is, but that's what's printed.
