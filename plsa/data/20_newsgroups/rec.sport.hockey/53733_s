 and of course, mike ramsey was (at one time) the captain in buffalo prior to
 being traded to pittsburgh.  currently, the penguins have 3 former captains
 and 1 real captain (lemieux) playing for them.  they rotate the a's during the
 season (and even the c while mario was out).  even troy loney has worn the c
 for the pens.
