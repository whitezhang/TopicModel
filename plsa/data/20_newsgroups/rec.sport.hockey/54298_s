 bufflo sabres has just finished their great four wins over boston. all
 sabres players contribute to those great wins but those talent players
 including mogily, fuhr, kemhlev and lafontin impressed me most. their 
 skills showed the art of sport, not like the garbage speech from the
 coach's corner.
 
 go ! make hocky popular, make hocky more exciting but less violent !
