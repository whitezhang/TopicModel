 again i assume this is not just flame bait by roger, but actually a
 truly held opinion.

 thanks.  for speaking for all those who didn't feel it was important
 enough to say something themselves.  
 
 i wouldn't say that the letter clearly implies representation of the
 views of a group that you belong to.  it represents a subset (that you
 don't belong to) of a larger group (which you do, if only because this
 isn't a moderated group).
 
 look, there are several ways to state an opposing viewpoint.  three
 that come to mind are as follows:
 
 1) say it subtly.  result: it may not be clear.
 2) say it directly yet politely.  result: probably it will spark some 
    interesting conversation.
 3) say it directly and obnoxiously.  result: validity goes right out
    the window.

 you realize that anything you say can, and most certainly will, be
 used against you.
