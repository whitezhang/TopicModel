 i am not at all clear about what you are trying to say here.   if  you
 asked  somone,  who  had never heard of hockey before, if la played in
 the smythe division what do you think  that  the  response  would  be?
 what  if you asked this person if la played in the west division?  the
 naming of  divisions  after  long-dead  entrepreneurs  is  unnecessary
 obfuscation.

 hardly.  the "established" situation existed prior to smythe,  et  al.
 the  stanley  cup was a challenge trophy up for grabs to whatever team
 could successfully mount the challenge.  what our  dear  founders  did
 was formalize the challenge.  they created a closed league, an oligop-
 olistic professional system, in the interests of making money.  wheth-
 er  or  not  that system has contributed to better hockey is certainly
 debatable.  we are, however, stuck with their invention and  that  de-
 bate  is  academic.   the  point  to  be made, however, is that people
 played hockey and people enjoyed watching hockey  long  before  smythe
 and his pals showed up.

 what's wrong with best defenceman, period?  was there  ever  a  better
 defenceman?   was  there  ever a better player?  and if you think that
 bruce norris' contribution was somehow  more  significant  than  bobby
 orr's  then,  in the interests of education, why don't you take a poll
 and find out how many people know who norris was?  but you don't  have
 to, do you?

 so you don't feel that you should have to make the effort to  remember
 that  vancouver  plays in the west division?  (or pacific, or whatever
 other intuitively understandable moniker is chosen.)

 and of course you neatly deleted jason's  jingoistic  rant  about  the
 game  losing  its  "canadianization".   quoting me out of context does
 more to erode your credibility than it  does  mine.   my  position  is
 clearly  progressive  and  is anything but "biased, closed minded, ig-
 norant".  arrogant, i will grant you.

 nice try john.  but for a flame to be truly effective you have to
 display  at  least  enough  intelligence  to  earn  your target's
 respect.
