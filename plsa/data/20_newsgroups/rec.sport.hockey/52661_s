 this brings up a question i asked myself (no answer) when it was mentionned
 that the nhl could expand in europe.
 
 would most of the north-americans now playing in the nhl be willing
 to play for a team in europe?
 
 i do not think that the majority of hockey players are necessarily
 interested in expanding their cultural experience to that level.
 (i know i would but i am not a pro hockey player)
 
 when one recalls some players remarks in the last few years it makes
 me wonder how a european expansion could be achieved.  remember these:
 
 - lindros did not want to play in quebec (for more than $ reasons)
 - nicholls ... in edmonton.
 - r. courtnall wanted to be traded to la only.
 - c. lemieux said he would refuse to go to edmonton earlier this year.
 
 i know there are many non-cultural reasons behind these but there is more:
 
 - some american players who played for the expos complained about the french
   fact and that the city was not quite like the other us cities.  one
   players' wife trying to make her point went on to complain that she could
   not even find her favorite brand of nacho chips in montreal.
 
 anybody knows what happened when all these us football players moved
 to london, spain, etc .. for the one year of that new football league
 (2 years ago?)
 
 i wonder what the players association thinks about going to europe.
 
 myself i would like to see some european teams, but what would be 
 the best way to do it?
