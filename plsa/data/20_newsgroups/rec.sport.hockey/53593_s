 ruotsaleinen was a more than competent nhl'er...his choice of where
 to play when did not bear on his hockey playing ability.
 
 he was crucial to the oilers stanley cup victory in 1990, the one
 without gretzky, because he made an oiler power play which was
 lethargic that year until he arrived slide into overdrive.  the
 oilers missed him more the following year than kurri, and i think
 the oilers would have make the finals if ruotsaleinen has stayed
 around the following season, and would have beaten pittsburgh
 with ruotsaleinen and a healthy messier...and delayed pittsburgh's
 dynasty by a season.
