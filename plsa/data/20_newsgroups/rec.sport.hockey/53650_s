 you think that's bad ... one year, we had all three new york teams in
 the playoffs and the cableco operator (scny once shared a channel with
 bet but someone forgot to throw the switch at 6pm) didn't know what i
 was talking about ...
 
 while it's nice that the nhl is back on american network tv, it faces
 the same problems as it did with the all star game.  local preemptions
 and zero promotion (okay, i don't watch that much tv so i'm just foaming
 all right?).  the league should have made sure that it was solid on cable
 before going to the networks.  in year one of the new espn contract, the
 saturation coverage of sca (all other games shown to completion, like
 the quebec-montreal and sabres-bruins overtimes) is missed around here.
