 for those of you who complain about don cherry, and wonder why he is
 popular...
 
 the reply is dick vitale and john madden and bobby knight and
 joe garagiola and howard cosell.
 
 john madden picks gary clark of the redskins for his all-madden team
 a lot, over much better receivers...for much the same reasons cherry
 sings the praises of doug gilmour...a little guy with heart...yet one
 doesn't see a string of american posts saying that john madden has
 lost his marbles.
 
 dick vitale is always promoting this kid from this high school or
 that college with outrageous statements.
 
 why should americans expect that canada would not have such characters
 in relation to our greatest passion...which is hockey?   canadians
 are very similar to americans...culturally our sports are just hockey
 and curling, whereas with americans it is football/basketball/baseball
 and bowling.
