         well as for team captains being traded
         in there first year in the nhl the
         edmonton oilers traded their captain
         ron chiperfield to the quebec nordique
         right at the trading deadline for 
         goaltender ron lowe
         in their second year of existence
         the edmonton oilers again right at the trade 
         deadline traded their captain, this time 
         b.j. mcdonald to the vancouver canucks
         along with the rights to winger ken 
         berry for garry lariviere and the rights 
         to lars gunner petterson 
         
         as for more captain trivia, the next edmonton
         captain was lee fogilin who was later traded to
         the buffalo sabres, after him was wayne gretzky
         who was traded to l a, then came kevin low who
         only this year was traded to the n y rangers
         so that every captain the edmonton oilers have had
         has been traded.
 
         the present captain is craig mctavish and we'll
         just have to wait and see.
 
 
         well talk to you later
 
         steve
