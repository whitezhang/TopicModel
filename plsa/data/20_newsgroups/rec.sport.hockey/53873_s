 funny you should mention this; one time on hnic don cherry pointed out
 vanbiesbrouck's mask.  he _hated_ it.  i think he said something to the effect
 of:
 "you see?  he was great last year; now he goes out and gets that dopey mask 
 and he can't stop a beachball!"
 
 you may or may not take cherry seriously at all, but i cracked up when i heard
 it.
 
 i think ed belfour has the current best mask in the nhl btw.  i also like
 moog's, and i'll give fuhr's new one an honourable mention, although i haven't
 seen it closely yet (it looked good from a distance!).  what's also neat is
 chevaldae's in detroit; they call him "chevy" so he has two checkered flags
 painted at the top as in an auto race.
