  i'd like to echo these sentiments.  this is the worst coverage i can 
  ever remember seeing on cbc.  as soon as the game ends, i can count to 30,
  and by that time, they've signed off the air.  no post game interviews,
  no updating of late scores, nothin'.  tsn is really putting cbc to 
  shame.  i only hope the later round coverage improves, i mean, who
  really wants to see cbc primetime news instead of hockey.
 
  my $.02,
   darren
