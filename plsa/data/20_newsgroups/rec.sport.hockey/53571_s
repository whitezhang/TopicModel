 these players all are pretty good players.  they are the depth that the
 dynasties had to win stanley cups.  they tend to be the very good second
 line guys- who would be first liners on most weaker clubs in the nhl.
 they were all important to their clubs.  probably, several of these
 stanley cup winning teams would not have won the cups they did if it
 were not for the depth provided by these players.
 
 they compare to rick tocchet and ron francis of the penguins.  very good
 players who can lead lesser teams (francis-hartford, tocchet-philly) who
 provide the depth to the team that is currently best in the nhl.
 
 as a defensive forward, there have been none better than bob gainey.  that
 doesn't mean he was the best player (or even the best forward) the canadians
 had at that time, but he was excellent at what he did.  gainey could
 dominate games with his defence.  he didn't need to get goals to dominate.
 he shut down the opposition and was thus valuable.  there has never been
 anyone any better at doing this.  not ever.
