 well, as long as we're being unduly cocky here, it's obvious that the pens
 will cone out of the patrick division *not* the caps, and also that
 they will win thier third stanley cup. "collective wisdom" is a very polite
 way of putting it, i don't know if i'd be so gracious.
 and, for what it's worth (probably not much) i think the habs will come out of
 the adams too.
