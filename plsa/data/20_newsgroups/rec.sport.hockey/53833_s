 i think the three-headed gm's guiding principle was to keep veterans
 in favor of youngsters only if they offered a "significant" advantage.
 at the end of last season, the contracts of several veterans with somewhat
 maginal contributions (fenton, bozek, anderson, and a couple others i
 can't remember) were bought out. the idea was that youngsters could
 play almost as well, and had the potential to improve where these
 older guys did not. 
 and they traded mullen, because he wanted to go, not because he
 wasn't good enough, but i think they were a bit too optimistic
 in thinking they could make up for his contributions.
 an example from this season, skriko was brought in on a trial basis
 but not kept, because of his age. i thought he was a decent
 contributor worth keeping around.
 
 the youth movement has its advantages; look at gaudreau who
 might still be in kc if more veterans had been kept around. but
 you have to find the right balance.
