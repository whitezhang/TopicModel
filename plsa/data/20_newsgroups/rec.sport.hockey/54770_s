 here is something crossposted from the ahl mailing list:			
 
 in a discussion between me and chris lerch, the subject of springfield's 
 1st round upset of the providence bruins
 came up. chris basically raised the possibility that the ahl 
 hierarchy is biased in favor of the indians. he noted that the offices
 for the league are in spring. and many ex-indians are working for the ahl.
 furthermore, he also informed me that back a few years ago in the cup 
 finals between roch and spring, that the amerks charged favoritism by the office
 and that:
 
 "...there were little questionable things liket he ahl president and
 staff attending all games with the springfield brass, including sitting
 in their box for the game in springfield and, according to the rochester
 media, openly cheering for springfield."
 
 certainly this is something that is quite serious if any of this
 is true. i don't know if this is anything more than whining on the
 part of the amerks (they have pulled this sort of crap against the
 wings before) but if true, this is somthing that seriously raises
 questions about president jack butterfield's leadership.
