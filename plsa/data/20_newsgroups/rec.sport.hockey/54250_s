 	the sharks appear to be leaning toward picking rob
 	niedermayer, a center (his brother scott (?) is a defenseman
 	picked by nj a couple years ago).  they brought him in for a
 	physical/tryout a week or so ago. from what i have read
 	niedermayer is the best skater in the draft, plays both
 	offense and defense, and isn't afraid of physical play.
 	defensively the sharks are looking pretty good in terms of
 	defense prospects (rathje, sykora, ragnarsson), and our
 	centers (kisio et al) are getting old.
 
 	with all of the small players the sharks have i justs can't
 	see them picking yet another small player like kariya, he'd
 	just get bashed by the oppposition and get a separated 
 	shoulder.
