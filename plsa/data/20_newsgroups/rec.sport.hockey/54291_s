 do the isles have another defenseman to insert into the line-up besides
 pilon??? once again, last night's stupid penalty put the isles in a hole for the
 remainder of regulation and 2 minutes into overtime!!! even though the isles
 nearly survived pilon's blunder in regulation, it was the most inopportune time
 for a 5-minute major penalty. instead of confronting cote as he came across the
 blueline, pilon backed up and swiped at cote's nose with his stick. al arbour
 can't be serious to think pilon is the guy to have out there with the game on
 the line??? i heard scott lachance is out till later in the series, but there
 must be someone else!!! bring back the bammer, dave langevin!!!!
