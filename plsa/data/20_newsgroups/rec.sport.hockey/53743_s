 yes, it is true that he refused to buy a franchise from the nhl for $50m; but
 at the time the reason was that the established market for teams was much 
 less than that. he felt that no one would pay $50m for an expansion team, and
 that he would simply wait to buy an existing franchise for less than that. but
 the market fooled him, and 5 teams have been created for $50m apiece in the
 last three years, and even the existing teams can't be moved for less than 
 $50m and i doubt that he could get one for that little.
 
 pettit gambled and lost. now he'll have to pay more.
