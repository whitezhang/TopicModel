 while i agree that lemieux deserves the hart, it is far from a "no-brainer". 
 the hart trophy goes to the player most valuable to his team, not to the best
 player in the league. so your above arguement is really worthless. 
 
 the pens without mario are still a damn good hockey team. the leafs without 
 gilmour would have been fighting tampa bay for the 3rd pick. 
 
 like i said, mario deserves it, imho. but it is a very close race and a 
 gilmour victory would not surprise me. i dislike doug gilmour with a passion, 
 but i must concede that he is extremely valuable to the leafs.
