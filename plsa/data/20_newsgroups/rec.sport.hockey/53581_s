 it's just as meaningless to compare goals, assists, pim and any other stat i
 can think of.  each player is asked to take a unique role for his team.  the
 contexts will never be the same from one player to another playing on the
 same team or different teams.  and yet ... awards are given and promotions
 received based in part on these meaningless stats.  the operative words are
 "in part" - stats must be interpreted, tempered with other information one
 has about the player.

 and comparing jagr's and francis's points is just as ridiculous and absurd...
 but not more ridiculous and absurd as comparing goals, assists, points, +\-
 for selanne, lindros, juneau, potvin, and the other rookies in the league...
 and yet...
 
 how about looking at them for what they are and enjoy the game.
