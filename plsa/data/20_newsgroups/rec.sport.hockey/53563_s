 i watched him over his entire career.  i have never seen a player, and that
 includes russell courtnall and davie keon, screw up as many breakaways as
 bob gainey.  and i will never forget the time denis potvin caught gainey
 with his head down.  you have been sold a bill of goods on bob gainey.
 
 gainey was a plugger.  and when the press runs out of things to say about 
 the stars on dynasties they start to hype the pluggers.  grant fuhr, essa
 tikkannen, butch goring, bob nystrom, bob gainey, doug jarvis, derek
 sanderson, wayne cashman, bob baun, bob pulford, ralph backstrom, henri
 richard, dick duff...and so on...
 
 cordially, as always,
