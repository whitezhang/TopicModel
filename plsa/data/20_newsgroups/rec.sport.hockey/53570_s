 well, i don't recall assuming anything, except perhaps that the columnist 
 who reported the incident was telling the truth i.e. the sarcastic impression
 came from _him_ (steve simmons?).  besides, to my knowledge alex has a pretty
 fair grasp of the english language...and his recent comment after the detroit
 game would indicate that this remark _is_ what i think it to be.  very low.
