 tsn sportsdesk just reported that the ottawa sun has reported that
 montreal will send 4 players + $15 million including vin damphousse 
 and brian bellows to phillidelphia, phillie will send eric lindros
 to ottawa, and ottawa will give it's first round pick to montreal.
  
 if this is true, it will most likely depend on whether or not ottawa
 gets to choose 1st overall.  can ottawa afford lindros' salary?
  
 personally, i can't see philli giving up lindros -- for anything.  
 they didn't give away that much to quebec just to trade him away 
 again.  not to mention that lindros seems to be a *huge* draw in
 phillie -- and that he represents a successful future for the 
 franchise.
  
 ottawa may be better off taking the 4 players +$15 from montreal
 for the pick.
