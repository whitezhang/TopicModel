 don't let this confuse anybody.  the winnipeg jets have never won the
 stanley cup (or even come that close).  these stanley cup championships
 go back a long way to about the turn of the century.  the winnipeg
 victorias won one or more of these cups- the jets didn't win any of
 them.
 
 can you think of anything more irrelevant to argue about a playoff
 series going on today than who won more stanley cups around the turn
 of the century??
 
 lets face facts.  the canucks are leading the series 3-1.  the canucks
 dominated the jets in their season series.  the canucks did better in
 the regular season than winnipeg.  who is the better team?  i think
 that the facts show that vancouver is better than winnipeg.
