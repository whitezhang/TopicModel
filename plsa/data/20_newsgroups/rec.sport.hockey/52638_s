 i've never seen a game where one player has committed 5
 penalties.  something like this would require more attention by
 the referee.

 but you're creating a scoring opportunity where there might not
 have been one before.  i can see the relationship between free
 throws awarded after a certain number of fouls, but it's
 obviously easier to score in basketball, there are more
 opportunities.  if a basketball team scores 100 points, that's
 at least fifty chances made.  the average number of shots taken
 by each team in a hockey game (and this is a total guess) is
 probably around 40, and a team is lucky to capitalize on maybe
 5 of them.  you have some good ideas concerning the other
 penalties, but i think that a player should be awarded a
 penalty shot only when they had a chance to score and was
 interfered with.
 
 also, later in the post, you talked about how boring the nba
 game you attended was, that play was stopped too often.
 wouldn't your penalty shot rule take up more time during a
 hockey game?
