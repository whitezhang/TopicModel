 look how long the maple leafs and nordiques used similar logic....  not that
 they fielded bad teams solely to field bad teams, but the maple leafs (and a
 certain dead man who was in charge) were one of the cheapest teams in the
 history of the sport.  guess what-- they were immensely popular at the
 gate.  the nordiques have also done well for a team that had missed the
 playoffs so many years in a row.

 ha!  such humor!  they have major fan problems, namely that on occasion some of
 them don't make it home from the match!  the soccer fans tend to be fanatical,
 much like the montreal fans who firebomb the players and coaches houses when
 they play pathetically.
