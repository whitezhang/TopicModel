 he's a canadian "thing". former coach of the boston bruins and colorado
 rockies. from the summaries that get posted i gather that his ongoing beef
 this year has been the conventional wisdom that canadian hockey is doomed
 to be second or third rate behind the perceived emergence of the u.s.
 and european programs.

 after he left the rockies, he got a job with cbc's hockey night in canada

 i'd say it's a combination of flame bait and serious journalism. the closest
 thing you'll find to cherry in the u.s. is stan fischler, a self-described
 hockey maven. the similarities are that they both say things that get
 people upset. the difference is that cherry knows the game and fischler
 doesn't.

 don's a character. if he were completely rational and noncontroversial
 he wouldn't have a job. by some definitions, he could be called an ass.
 but then some people feel the same about mike lang, another character that
 i wish would get wider exposure (only one national telecast last year).
