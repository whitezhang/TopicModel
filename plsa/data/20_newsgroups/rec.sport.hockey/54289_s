   an interesting note ... i have absolutely no recollection who was on my team.
   i picked all my players about 2 weeks before the start of the season, and
   then never touched the roster again.  i got wrapped up in my own "money" pool
   and decided not to get involved at all with the usenet pool (sorry andrew
   btw).  the only thing i remember about my team is that i had joe sacco and
   maybe john maclean.  maybe francis and kevin stevens as well.  out of
   curiousity i checked the final standings today on r.s.h., only to find to my
   amazement that with absolutely no input, the initial team still managed to
   finsh 79th!  i'm not sure what that implies for those who finished below me
   :)
 
   ciao.
