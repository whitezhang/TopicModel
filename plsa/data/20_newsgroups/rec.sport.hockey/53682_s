 how about kevin hatcher? scored roughly 35 goals, plays 30 minutes a game.

 that's really sad when two second-rate goalies (barasso and belfour)
 are the main contenders for the vezina. call me crazy, but how about
 tommy soderstrom - five shutouts for a 6th place team that doesn't
 really play defense. it's really unfortunate that the better goalies
 in the league (mclean, essensa, vernon) had unspectacular years. btw,
 if you are going to award the norris on the basis of the last 30 days,
 why not give the vezina to moog? he has been the best goalie over the
 past month.

 arbour or king. burns will probably win, since playoffs aren't taken
 into consideration - he's ok in the regular season, but i'm not sure
 if he's beaten anyone other than hartford in the playoffs.
