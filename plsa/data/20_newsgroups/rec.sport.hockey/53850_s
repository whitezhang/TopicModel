 from this account, it doesn't sound like you even saw the goal, mike. smith
 came out from behind his own net and fired a breakout pass that hit fuhr in the
 back of the leg. fuhr was backing up at the time and never saw what
 happened. the puck went straight off fuhr's leg and into the net. fuhr never
 had a chance. there was no play back to the goaltender, in fact perry berezan
 of calgary had just dumped it in and smith was retrieving it. 
 
 it was unfortunate that it happened; smith is a nice guy and was only a rookie
 at the time, and on his birthday too. but all the blame lies with him. starting
 in pee-wee coaches tell players never to make a cross-ice pass in front of 
 their own net. too much chance of having it intercepted, or hitting the 
 goaltender, or whatever.
 
 and to the people who say that smith cost the oilers the series, i can only
 say that he certainly didn't cause the team to lose the other three games.
 there was no reason for a powerhouse team like edmonton to be tied late
 in the third period of the 7th game of the second round. everybody on the team
 has to take responsibility for them even being in that situation.
