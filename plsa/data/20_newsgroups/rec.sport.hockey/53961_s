 
 tom barrasso wore a great mask, one time, last season.  he unveiled it
 at a game in boston.  
 
 it was all black, with pgh city scenes on it.  the "golden triangle"
 (pgh's downtown area where the 3 rivers meet) graced the top, along
 with a steel mill on one side and the civic arena (i think) on the 
 other.   on the back of the helmet was the old pens' logo (the really
 fat little penguin with the blue scarf) the current (at the time) pens
 logo, and a space for the "new" (now current) logo.
 
 tommy had designed the mask, and his mother (an artist) painted it
 for him.  
 
 but while wearing the mask, the pens got thumped by the bruins.  the
 very next game, tommy was back to the old paint job.  a great mask
 done in by a goalie's superstition.
