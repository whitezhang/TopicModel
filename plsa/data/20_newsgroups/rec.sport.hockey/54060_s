 michael j. fox was on letterman about a year ago (or two) during the 
 playoffs as a celebrity hockey player for the bruins.  while he's not
 exactly a nhler he did mention that the bruins wanted to break ulfie's
 legs (or something like that) in response to the neely incident.  it
 was quite amusing, as one of the few letterman viewers who actually knew
 what he was talking about.  anybody know who the pens celebrity hockey
 player is?  michael douglas (aka michael keaton)?
