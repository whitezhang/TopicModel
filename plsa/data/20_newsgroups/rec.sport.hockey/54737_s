 this is not a trend. the caps were done. goneso in five games, and it saves
 us caps fans a lot of pain.
 
 i mean, it would be more painful if the caps were up 3-1, watching them 
 tumbled when they need one more win to clinch the series. how many times
 have they done that in their history?
 
 1985 up 2-0 in a five game series against the isles, lost 3 straight
 1987 up 3-1 against the isles, lost 3 straight
 1992 up 3-1 against the pens, lost 3 straight
 
 in other words, when they were about to clinch with 3 games to go, they 
 were a pitiful 2-9, the lone wins being 
 
 1) a sweep of philly in 1984
 2) the 1990 win against the rangers in the patrick finals, the only time 
 they managed to get out of the division.
 
 actually, saturday's blown lead wasn't anything new. we all know the caps
 are famous lead blowers in crucial playoff games. examples:
 
 1) game 4 against the isles, 1985, led 4-2 after two, lead series 2-1,
 gave up 4 goals in the 3rd period, including the game winning goal in the
 last minute. after that goal, bobby carpenter botched a penalty shot.
 series tied 2-2, lost game 5 a few days later.
 
 2) game 4 against the rangers, 1986, led series 2-1, led by 2 in the 3rd 
 period, blew it. lost game in ot and three consecutive games.
 
 3) game 6 against pittsurgh, 1992, led series 3-2, led by 2 in 2nd period.
 blew it and the series.
 
 4) game 3 against isles, 1993, series tied 1-1, led by 2 after 2. blew it.
 
 5) game 4 against isles, 1993, trailed series 2-1, led by 3 in 2nd period.
 blew it again.
 
 when they were leading by 3 in game 4, i said to myself: "if they blew this
 lead, the series is over". they have lost all the momemtum. the islanders
 believe they can come back no matter what the score is.
 
 i am still waiting for a cap goalie who can carry the team, who can 
 completely shut down the opposition when they are hanging on their dear 
 lives in a crucial game.
 
 >the admiral, a hopeless caps fan.
 >p.s. we still remember that 3 ot loss to the islanders! aurggghhhhhhhhh!
 well, some teams such have it and some teams just don't. when the caps
 were frustrated year in year out by the islanders, i was thinking "wait
 until potvin/bossy/trottier/smith retire". well, they retired (even though
 trottier was still able to haunt the caps on a pens uniform), yet another
 generation of islanders were still doing the same thing. well, i guess 
 it has nothing to do with the players.
