 but only in ny,nj, philadelphia, and chicago. everywhere else, the only
 reason sportschannel was available was for local baseball broadcasts.
 and local baseball pre-empted the nhl playoffs. thus far into this
 playoff season, espn/abc has given me more hockey in 2 days (1 game)
 than sportschannel did (0 games).
 
 if people want hockey on tv, they should watch hockey on tv. i bet the
 ratings for hockey on sunday on abc went into the toilet. next week, there
 will be far fewer abc affiliates with hockey.
 
 someone in this thread said that he wouldn't watch the games even if
 they were on tv, and this is a r.s.h. regular contributor!
 
 xenophobes north of border needn't fear the us-americanization of "our"
 game, because us-americans will never figure out how to market hockey
 here. support your team; support your game.
