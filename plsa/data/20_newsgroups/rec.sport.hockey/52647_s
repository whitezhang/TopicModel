 mr. bettman	the guy in the wrong sport
 mr. stein	the guy who should be in charge but isn't
 
 of course, we also need new names for the individual awards, and other
 stuff like the president's cup.
 
 president's cup		the trophy given to the best regular-season team
 hart winner		the most valuable player, chosen from the
 				guys in the middle, the guys on the
 				right, the guys on the left, the guys
 				back there, and the guy in the net,
 				though typically given only to the
 				guys in the middle and the guys on 
 				the left and on the right
 norris winner		the best guy in the back; or, the guy who was
 				awarded for something even though he
 				is not one of the guys in the middle
 				or on the left or the right
 
 ...ad nauseum.
