 are there any montreal canadiens fans out there who can let me the radio
 station(s) which are playing the playoff series (including short wave radio
 frequencies)?  lewisburg, pa (home of bucknell university) is definitely
 not a hockey town! 
 
 please send responses to malinich@bucknell.edu
 
 thanks!
