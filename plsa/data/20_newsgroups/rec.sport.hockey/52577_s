 chelios is by far the mvp on chicago...

 >edmonton oilers         manson         buchberger    mellanby
 
 manson, by his own admission, had a terrible year...the oilers
 don't really have a team mvp...by default, it should go to craig
 mactavish.  shjon podein was the biggest surprise...tikkanen the
 biggest disappointment.

 >minnesota north stars   modano      tinordi(not expected back)  broten
 
 tinordi was back by mid-season last year...and when he plays he is the mvp.

 king had a great year last year also.
 
 >new york rangers        messier        kovalev       bourque
 
 how can kovalev be a surprise?

 >philadelphia flyers     lindros/recchi fedyk/galley  eklund
 
 fence-sitting...look at philly's record with eric and without...
 there is no doubt.  soderstrom is probably the biggest surprise.
 
 >pittsburgh penguins     lemieux        tocchet(even for him)  jagr
 
 tocchet had a near 100 point season in philly with mike bullard as
 his center...why shouldn't he be able to do that with mario?
