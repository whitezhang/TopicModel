 you can get wjr a long way away.  the problem is that, because of those
 well known and beloved "contractual obligations", wjr will be doing
 tiger baseball instead of the wings playoff games for probably half
 the games the wings could play.  for this series, i know tonight's
 game and i believe games 5 and 6 (if necessay) will be bumped.
