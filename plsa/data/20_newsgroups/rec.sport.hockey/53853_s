 yes, colin... i have to agree with you here...  i've put the puck in
 my own net the same way smith did... (only once, mind you :-) and it
 was definitely my fault.  it is not a common play to play the puck the
 way that smith did.  
 
 luckily, for me...  when i did it... it was only a scrimmage :-)
