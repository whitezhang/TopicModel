 .sigs to root for our second favorite teams :-)

 i have a feeling that alot of people out there may not like this statement
 but......
 by far the worst "band  wagon" fans are the pit fans (at least at the present).
 case in point -- i know a guy who just came to hockey hell(tm) from pitt u.
 him - "how 'bout the pens? the're f-ing awesome"
 me - "yeah but beating up on the devils doesn't mean alot. wait until
 	they meet boston and/or detroit in the playoffs start."
 him - "when do the playoffs start?"
 me - "uhhhh. they started a week ago."
 
 i'm not saying that this is true of all the waddlers fans but there seems to 
 be alot of them floating around who really know nothing about hockey except
 that they're newly beloved waddlers are the best team in the game right now
 and when they're not the best team those fans will disappear into the woodwork.
