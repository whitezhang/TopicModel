 buffalo seems to have started a tradition of trading its captains.
 
 pat lafontaine was awarded the captaincy when mike ramsey was forced
 to give it up (ramsey's now a penguin).  ramsey inherited it from mike
 foligno (who's now a leaf).  he in turn had inherited it from lindy
 ruff, who went i forget where.  ruff had it from perreault, who
 retired, so i guess that's where the streak started.  or did it?
 after all, danny gare was captain before him, and he went to detroit.
 jim scoenfeld, gerry meehan, and floyd smith are the others, in
 reverse order, last to first.  i was a bit young at the time, so i'm
 not sure of the fate of schoenfeld, but he ultimately went to detroit
 and boston.  meehan went to vancouver, atlanta and washington.  smith
 seems to have hung up his skates after buffalo, but i don't know if
 the captaincy was removed before or after that, or how many games he
 played for buffalo.  this is actually getting fascinating.  :-)
 
 captaincy in buffalo is a sure sign you're to be traded, almost,
 unless you're a franchise player.
