 : bri, as i have tried to tell you since 2 february, michael o'neill
 : might be the most underrated goalie in the ahl, but he isn't in the
 : ahl.  he's on the winnipeg jets' injury list, as he has been since
 : his first nhl start against the ottawa senators.  he's out until
 : next year after surgery to repair a shoulder separation.
 
 : stu barnes might be an ahl gun for the hawks, but he's now the third
 : line center with the jets, and has been since mid january or so.
 
 sorry, my memory is gone. i thought that o'neill got sent back
 down in february but i must have been given incorrect info. i guess
 this says it all about moncton because barnes is still one of
 their top 3 or so scorers even though he's been out since january.
