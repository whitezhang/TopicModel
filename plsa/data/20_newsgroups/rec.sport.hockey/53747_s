 i think that mike foligno was the captain of the sabres when he
 got traded to the leafs. also, wasn't rick vaive the captain of
 the leafs when he got traded to chicago (with steve thomas for
 ed olcyzk and someone). speaking of the leafs, i believe that
 darryl sittler was their captain (he'd torn the "c" off his
 jersey but i think he re-claimed the captaincy later on) when he
 was traded to the flyers.
 
 oh yeah, of course, gretzky was the captain of the oilers before
 he was traded wasn't he?
