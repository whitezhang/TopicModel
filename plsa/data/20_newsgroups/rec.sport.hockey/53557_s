 question:
 if a team uses 40 players in a season do you merely divide the total +/-
 by 40?  if so, a player who plays in only 1 game is considered equally
 valuable as a player who plays in all of them.

 since the standard deviation for each team is different, i am unsure how 
 "transferable" between teams that these stats are.  shouldn't the average
 standard deviation in the league be used?
 
 i am interested in seeing each method.
 but i still think that mine is the best. if for no other reason than familiarity.
