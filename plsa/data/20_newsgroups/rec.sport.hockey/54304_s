 i am sorry to tell you this, but
 i don't think the devils will win
 a game against pittsburg, the 
 penguins have so many scoring threats
 that you shut down one and another
 will kill you
 it's too bad but i must conclude that the penguins will
 win their third stanley cup in a row.
 i hope someone will beat them, but i just cannot see it
 happening.
