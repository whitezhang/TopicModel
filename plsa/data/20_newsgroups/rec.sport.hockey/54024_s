 i think a compromise would work; namely honouring personages in 
 conference names, and using geographical references in the divisional 
 names.  although i still do not think the move will draw fans to the
 game; imo it's a cosmetic change that bettman and the owners _hope_ 
 will have an effect.  and it doesn't say much for the mentality of 
 anybody it works on, either.

 surprise, i agree totally.  the points system is fine, if everybody at all
 times has played the same number of games.  since this is almost never the
 case, winning percentage is the way to go.  i don't particularly care if it 
 is an "american" thing either, if it works.
