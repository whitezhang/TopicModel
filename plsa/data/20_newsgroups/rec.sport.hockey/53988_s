 well, the "jettison for youth fast" strategy was his. also in hindsight, it
 didn't work all that well, but i think it was more because it left the
 sharks on a tightrope without a net, not that it was inherently flawed. it
 was the injuries that caused us to fall.

 from all indications, it wasn't the "major" factor, but the "last straw".
 there were personality conflicts among shark management, and disagreements
 over how personnel were going to be handled (not just who was being traded
 vs. kept, but who was being sent to kc. what ferriera did, if rumors are
 right, was not always what the folks behind the bench wanted or needed).

 i think if they'd kept ferriera, they would have lost some of their other
 management staff. depending on which sources you trust, we might have lost
 grillo and lombardi and murdoch over the summer. frankly, i want to keep
 those three. (we may well ahve also lost kingston, which, of course, is now
 a moot point). 
 
 the sharks have been building an organizational staff that is highly
 consensual and cooperative. ferriera wanted to run things his way. there
 were conflicts. ferriera lost. that says nothing about his skills or
 accomplishments -- at that level, a lot is personality and politics. 
 
 i think he did some good things for the sharks, but that he never fit in as
 a "shark person". i hope he succeeds beyond his wildest dreams down in
 anaheim, too, because it'll be good for hockey. (but i want the ducks to be
 doormats for a couple of years, so the sharks succeeed first).
