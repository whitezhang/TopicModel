 it was a classy move.  but it looks like espn is going to devote most of
 the coverage to the pens.  on tuesday night, they continued to broadcast
 the pen-devil game even though pittsburgh had the game well in control.
 granted they did show some "bonus" coverage of the caps and isles but
 they cut away from the close game, which went into double ot, to update
 us on the fifth goal of the rout.
 thursday was a good game even if it was the second straight game between
 the pens and devils.  imho they should program some variety into the
 telecasts.(yes i know the game shown on saturday is between the b's and
 sabres, probably throwing a bone to us bruin fans.)
 and what about the cambell conference?  i'd like to see a game in the
 norris or smythe.  why not have back to back nights of national
 hockey night?
 
 just a thought.
