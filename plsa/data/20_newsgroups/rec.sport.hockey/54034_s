     i remember reading an article in reader's digest many moons ago
  about a similar incident. during a minor leaque game a player neck was
  cut when the opponent he was back-checking tripped and his skakes
  flew up. in this case the victim's mask proved a hinderance since
  his face was protected and so he didn't bother with the
  usually instinctive reaction to protect his face/neck. a quick        
  thinking coach saved his life by applying direct pressure and using
  snow to contract the blood vessels (from what i can remember).
