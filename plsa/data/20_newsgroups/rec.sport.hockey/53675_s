 everyone keeps talking about european expansion by 2010 thinking
 wishful thoughts, but being totally off the ball.
 
 the league format we use here is incompatible with that in europe.
 (for those that don't know, the best teams from lower divisions get
 promoted and the worst get demoted).
 
 would european fans put up with our "if you've paid, you can play" 
 attitude??
 
 how long would they support teams that are run on ranger-based 
 corporate thinking (i use the term lightly).  (we don't need a good
 product because these duffuses in nyc would fill the arena for ottawa's
 record every year......1940!! haha (sorry, had ta say it)).
 
 if hockey (and other pro sports) had a similar system to europe, maybe
 teams like the rangers would be forced to compete (or get demoted the fourth 
 division).  we'd have many more teams...centres that aren't as big (like
 halifax or adirondack....ok, so halifax isn't a good example) would 
 eventually get promoted, and every team would be somewhat competetive within
 its own division (unlike ottawa, sj, edmonton, etc.). fans would eventually
 get rewarded for their loyalty (or penalized for their neglect), and the
 league would be more interesting and dynamic every year because of the influx
 of newly promoted teams (and the halifax citadels win the stanley cup...i can
 dream, can't i??)
 
 look at british (or any european) soccer as an example (they never have fan
 problems).
 
 just someone who thinks our system really sucks
