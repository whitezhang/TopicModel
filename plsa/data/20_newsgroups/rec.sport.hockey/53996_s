 chevy has let in 2 or 3 soft goals so far, but they all didn't matter.
 however, his recent history has been inconsistant play but comes up
 big when it counts.  the score was 4-0 i think when the goal you mentioned
 was scored.  in the third period when it looked like toronto was coming
 back, chevy was exceptional.  i can see him as a barraso style playoff
 goalie:  inconsistant when there's nothing on the line,
 but comes up big when really needed.  i guess we'll both find out.
