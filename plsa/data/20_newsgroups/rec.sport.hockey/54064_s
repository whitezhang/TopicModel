 i agree that keenan is an excellent choice.  did you see mike
 lupica's column in sunday's news?  my sentiments exactly.  i
 think he just may be the one to instill some hunger and fire
 into their hearts next season.  either that or he's going to 
 be kicking alot of butt!
 
 >reading through most of these hockey news i don't see many ranger fans writing.   
 
 i'm here, but am new to this group and have been keeping fairly
 quiet (you know, doing the "lurking" thing).  i don't have a
 sense how many rangers fans there are on the list either.  i 
 am a die-hard ranger fan (i guess i have to be - i sat in the
 garden throughout the penguins' - led by mario's 5 goals - decimation 
 of them on 4/9), but am sick at the abundance of talent that has
 been totally untapped, and the lack of heart displayed this
 season.

 hurlbut was injured for quite a while.  i'm not sure, but i
 think he may have recovered in time for the playoff run, and
 if so, like you, question why he wasn't used.

 i believe kocur was used, in many instances, for his intimidation 
 factor.  granted, he seemed to get an awful lot of ice time for 
 that reason alone, but you have to realize that when a team is
 not doing any real physical intimidation (i'd like to have a nickel 
 for every time j.d. said 'they've got to take the body more'), 
 you've got to at least have some illusions ;-(

 i agree and i don't know.

 sorry, i don't agree with you here.  i think joey c. did a good
 job filling in when he was asked to.  i can't imagine that it's
 easy going from near 0 ice time to being a full timer.  i don't
 seem to remember him turning the puck over at the blue line too
 much, or failing to clear the zone.  he worked hard, and at
 least didn't make any rookie mistakes.  as he said himself in an
 interview, he can only give what he has.  and he did.

 absolutely.  i think attendance at the garden was better on the
 last day of the season, than any average night for the
 islanders.

 the man is awesome.  in a way, i'm enjoying the playoffs more,
 now that the rangers aren't in them.  i can really appreciate
 all the glory mario is getting without 'hating' him because he's
 on the opposing team.  he deserves it all, as far as i'm
 concerned.
