 being a a blues fan i don't get to see much else from around the league
 with the exception of hockey night on espn.  i can't get the blues games
 where i go to school, thus i don't get to see a whole lot of other teams
 play except for the hawks.  but last night i got to catch a glimpse of
 the caps/isles game.  it occurred to me that turgeon is a stud on skates.
 his moves are quick and brilliant.  you ny fans should be proud.
 p.s. who won the game (caps/isles)?
  
 peace,
 hammer
