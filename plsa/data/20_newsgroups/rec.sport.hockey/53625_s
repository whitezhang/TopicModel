 oh yeah, how come dino could never take the caps out of the patrick
 division?  he choked up 3 games to 1 last year and got swept away in
 the second round two years ago.  he rarely, if ever, makes it out of the
 division.

 so are the islanders, but they can still pull it out.  vancouver has winnipeg's
  number, so it really doesn't matter.

  kings always seem to go at least 6 or 7, they never play a four or five
 game serious.  there's a difference between battling it out and pulling it
 out, as i take calgary to pull it out in 7.
