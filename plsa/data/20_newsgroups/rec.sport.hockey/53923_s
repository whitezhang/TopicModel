 whoa there!  lighten up, andrew!  when i was referring to "you dorks at
 the western business school", i was specifically referring to those
 assholes writing obnoxious comments insulting the state and people of
 minnesota for no apparent reason.  being canadian, and one who has
 friends who attended uwo, i personally don't want to be associated with
 the idiots who wrote those messages.  one more thing, andrew...until
 this season, the leafs have sucked pretty badly over the last umpteen
 years (have they won the cup during our lifetime?)...so the north stars
 haven't been the only "shit" team in the norris.
