 yep.

 if you asked me 30 days ago, i'd agree with you.  i now give the nod to
 raymond bourque; his play took off the same time the b's did.  chelios
 gets a close second...

 barrasso finally gets his due, in a close one over eddie the eagle...

 in *your* case, that bias is acceptable :-)... mine shows with the norris pick,
 so we're even...
 
 i'm impressed with what all the coaches you mentioned did, but my pick would be 
 al arbour.  not too many folks thought the isles would be in the playoffs, let 
 alone contend for 3rd in their division... granted that they *did* have a little
 help from their cousins on broadway... :-)
 
 and i like the islanders about as much as i like mowing my lawn...
