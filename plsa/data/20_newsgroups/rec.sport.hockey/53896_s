 we're probably stuck, as mike burger pointed out that the baseball
 deal was made far in advance of the nhl contract.  wabc did the same
 thing; they were thankful that the devils were wiped out by 9:30,
 because they had to switch over to yankees baseball.  the proof of 
 the reasons for this is left to the reader ...
 
 it's too bad, but i wonder if espn is stuck with other us local team
 coverage for their alternate games?  we got nesn's coverage of the
 bruins-sabres with the boston homers ... they were awful!!!  i've read
 that derek sanderson is the colour analyst ... i wonder if he spent
 his early years after hockey as an intern at pravda before landing
 this job?  *everything* had to be twisted into something good to say
 about the bruin(s) involved ... not even bill wirtz's shills on sc
 chicago (pat foley, dale tallon) were this bad.  and just to be fair,
 sc used to take their feed from esn (empire sports network), the sabre
 homers and they were horrible too ... but they were spacy.
 
 from the cnn highlights, i hear chris cuthbert's voice from the cbc
 coverage of the habs-nords series.  too bad that we couldn't get it
 on espn, with all due respect to the sabres and the bruins.
 
 mike emrick is substituting on the devils scny team for gary thorne.
 mike was the original devils tv play-by-play announcer, by the way.
