 st>         as for more captain trivia, the next edmonton
 st>         catain was lee fogilin who was later traded to
 st>         the buffalo sabres, after him was wayne gretzky
 st>         who w   traded to l a, then came kevin low who
 st>         nly this year was traded to the n y rangers
  
 wasn't mark messier captain of the oilers before kevin lowe?
 but, of course, he was traded as well -- so your point of every
 oilers captain being traded is still true.
