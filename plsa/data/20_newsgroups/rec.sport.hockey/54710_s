 norman green claims that he has lost money over the last three years
 that he has owned the team.  when he bought the team, it seemed kind of
 obvious that he was going to have to deal with a few years in the red,
 before the team started making a profit again.  he gave the impression
 that he was willing to do so.  he claimed two years ago that the team
 needed to average only 8000+ fans per game in order to pull a profit,
 but this season the team averaged 12000+ fans, despite increasd ticket
 prices.  i think the team's attendence and play was clearly in an upward
 trend, which leaves me dumbfounded as to how he could ignore that in
 deciding to move.  he was even offered the many concessions he rudely
 demanded, such as guaranteed season ticket sales, cheap rent at the
 other two arenas in town, etc.
 
 oh well, i guess the bottom line is $$$.  green wanted immediate huge
 returns in dallas, and wasn't willing to wait another year or so in mn. 
 dallas gave green a pretty stellar deal to play there (although i feel
 minnesota's was quite reasonable), and he also has some cronies down
 there as well.  all this means, is that minnesota is without an nhl team
 for a year or two.  too bad for the nhl.
