   i thought that he was comparing cullen to teemu sel[nne. i always thought
   that salami is some sort of sausage, but if you, dear roger, are able to
   see salami on the ice playing hockey... i don't know what to do, but you
   surely should do something and very quickly!!!
 
   maybe you think that if you keep on talking some rubbish, after some time
   everybody will consider it to be really true... you should take care of
   your leafs, they surely need it more.

  during the latest philly game the leaf players didn't parade... philly
  crunched them 4-0 !!!  maybe you need some more two way players who can
  score, too !!???
