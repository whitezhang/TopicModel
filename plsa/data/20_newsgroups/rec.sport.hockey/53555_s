 the selke candidate forwards main purpose on a shift is to prevent goals
 from being scored- not to score them.  when lemieux or gilmour play their
 number one purpose is to score- defence is secondary- especially considering
 the line that plays against them is probably a defensive one.  that is
 why they are not selke candidates.

 someone posted something about this assumption being lost in translation
 (it was a few months ago).  whoever this was please repost it.

 gainey is the best defensive forward ever.  i stand by that assessment.
 he was a very good player who belongs in the hall of fame.  did you
 ever watch him play? he never made a technical error.

 who are these pundits??  gilmour was good with st louis- but he was not the
 best two-way player in the game when he was with them.  you have overhyped
 gilmour on this net for months.  he is a very good forward- but hardly the
 best in the nhl.
