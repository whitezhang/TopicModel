 you realize that we dominated game 1 also and should be ahead in this 
 series 2 - 1?
 
 j<--> glorieux were plagued by bad luck; the puck wouldn't bounce their

 it's all up to patrick roy to provide **consistent** goaltending.
 
 j<--> and those damn bruins lost in o.t., their down 3-0.  congratulations
 j<--> buffalo!!
