 i think quinn is one of several who are better.

 when quinn took over vancouver- several years ago, not last year, they 
 regularily missed the playoffs.  i can't recall if they missed the playoffs
 the year before his hiring but they probably did.  quinn has improved the
 team from non-playoff calibre to a serious contender.
 
 when murray took over in detroit, the were about a .500 team that was a
 contender to win the norris division and possibly even a stanley cup
 contender.
 
 so quinn has improved his team more than murray has since taking over as a gm.
 quinn is one example of a better gm than murray.
