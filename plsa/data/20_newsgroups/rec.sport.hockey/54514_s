 have the rules for goalies' equipment changed? it seems that e.g. glove
 has become bigger and bigger all the time (and pads too), and the goalies are
 wearing "over size" jerseys. am i dreaming? if you watch old photos or
 films let say about ten years back, i think the difference is quite obvious.
 who is an expert on this, please let me know. (or have the goalies become
 bigger?)
