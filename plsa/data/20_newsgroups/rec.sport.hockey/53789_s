 during the regular season, when the intensity is down, not many teams
 have forwards who will continually go and park themselves in front of
 the opposing teams net...and the inadequacy of the leafs defense in
 this regard thus didn't matter...however, the playoffs are a different
 story...every good team is going to have players who are going to
 become potted plants in front of potvin...and the leafs relatively
 unphysical defensive core will finally be exposed as weak an inept.
 
 hard work will go a long way during the regular season...almost
 to 100 points...and the leafs deserve credit for that...but in the 
 playoffs talent matters, because everyone begins working hard.
