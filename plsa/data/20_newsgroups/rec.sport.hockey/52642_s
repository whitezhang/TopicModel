 kovalev is too talented a player to play for roger nielson...roger needs
 players who can't think for themselves and can only skate in straight
 lines up and down the ice.  dudley and nielson are the only two coaches
 bad enough in the league to take talents like mogilny and kovalev and
 not know how to turn them into bure and selanne.

 get muckler as coach, and kovalev will look like mogilny.
 
 the trouble with the rangers is that neil smith went out and got
 players like messier, kovalev, and graves who have been schooled in
 taking the game to their opponent and attacking, while hiring coaches
 who are interested in "rope-a-dope" strategies.  if you want the
 roger nielsons of the world to be your coach you don't go out and
 get a mark messier, who is an old dog who can't learn new tricks
 from a known loser, and you don't waste your draft picks on players
 like kovalev.
