 farewell, minnesota fans.  get stuffed, dallas stars.
 
 as the north stars fade to black, i hope that minneapolis/st. paul are
 not long without an nhl team.  it just seems "right" that the hotbed of
 amateur hockey in the usa should have an nhl team as well.  the loss of
 the team is certainly not the fault of the fans (though the start of the
 1989-90 season made it look real bad for a while).
 
 i wish now that i kept the north stars cap i bought at maple leaf
 gardens the morning after they eliminated montreal in 1980.  (i got it
 to spite the montreal fans in the small town where i grew up.)  what a
 glorious season that was for the north stars!
