 you, along with mario lemieux, must be from another planet.  the only
 difference is that lemieux comes from the one with geo. washington, abe
 lincoln (and many other great men and women of this world) whereas you come
 from the one with david koresh.  yeah, mario is good at drawing penalties,
 but wouldn't you try do something (you do claim to play) to give your team
 an advantage?  i don't remember lemieux getting any diving penalties this
 year, whereas many others did.  finally, mario has never complained about
 being hit.  he knows it's part of the game; he gets back by dishing out an
 even bigger hit to the same guy or just scoring a few goals (or setting
 them up.)  don't you have any compassion for a man who has gone through so
 much in his life?
