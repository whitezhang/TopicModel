 this is incorrect.  this year the pens had 61 games on "free" tv and 6
 games on ppv.  next year they will have 62 games on free tv and 22 on 
 a subscription basis.  
 
 you actually get 1 more free game than last year, and there will be no
 more "radio-only" games.
 
 its a good deal.  last year, everybody bitched about baldwin "breaking
 up the team".  now, he goes out of his way to keep the nucleus of this
 team together and that takes money.  he comes up with a creative way
 to generate more revenue so he can afford this team, and people bitch
 some more.
 
 everybody wants something for nothing.
