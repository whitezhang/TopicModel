 actually, the way i understand it, it is an octapus.
 apparently, a number of years ago, a fan threw an octapus on
 the ice and the announcer said "octapi will not occupy the ice"
 or something like that, and it's happened ever since.  the fans
 cheer those who pick up the dead octapus with their hands, and
 boo those who use a shovel.
