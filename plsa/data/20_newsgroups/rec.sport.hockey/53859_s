 hopefully, a miracle (o.k. not quite a miracle, but close!) will occur and
 pittsburgh will be elminated prior to the finals.  if they make it again, 
 they will probably keep the cup.  if they don't, it's the hawks' turn!
 
 go blackhawks!!
 
 congrats to jeremy roenick for being only the 2nd hawks player to post 
 back to back 50 goal seasons!!
