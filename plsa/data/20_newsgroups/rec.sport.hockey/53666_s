 it was bryan trottier, not denis potvin.  it was a vicious
 'boarding' from behind...trottier was given a major.
  
 but roger, what the hell does this have to do with gainey's skill
 as a hockey player?  if probert smashes gilmour's head into the
 boards next week, will that diminish your assessment of gilmour's
 skills?

 i would take fuhr and sanderson off of the latter.
  
 i think gainey would be honoured to know that you've included him
 on this list.  i also think you have a relatively naive view
 about what wins a hockey game...pluggers are an integral part of
 any team.  the selke is designed to acknowledge their
 contribution...i think that most people understand that it's not
 the nobel prize...so settle down.
