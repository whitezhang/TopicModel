 i agree. it was great for the espn people to show the detroit game. (my
 roommate just about sh*t when they threw the octopus on the ice. (thanks
 for explaining the significance of that btw)) the only problem i had was
 when they blotted out the local commentators with the baseball ads and
 music. especially when the wings player hit the rut and went into the
 boards injuring his shoulder and they blotted out the injury report. other
 then that, hats off to espn. now if they'll only make a habit of this. yeah
 right! baseball seasons started (zzzzzz.....) =)
