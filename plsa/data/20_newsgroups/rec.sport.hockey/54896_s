     well, in my opinion the canucks played a really strong game. i was
 especially pleased by a very strong game from linden - i think he
 could be a key to success for them this year.  defensively, they
 really had a strong game.  hardly heard selanne's name all night.
 craven also played one of his best games since coming over.  with a
 few exceptions, they really didn't let the high-flying jets do much
 high-flying.  i thought the jets defence looked overmatched by the
 canucks forwards - they will have to improve on that if they want to
 make this a series.
 
     in short, it was a great start!
