   listen guys you can talk about this the whole playoffs.  i'm here in a
 small town in southern illinois at school.  i'm from canada and i know
 that cbc and tsn have games on every night,  all you have to do is go to
 a bar with a satellite.  i have watched both games between mon que and
 toronto and detroit,  not to mention van vs winn and with cbc.  they
 show all goals from every game that evening so i haven't missed a goal
 all playoffs.  well have to go boy leafs are on ciao.
