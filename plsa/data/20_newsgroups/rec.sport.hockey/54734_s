 speaking of roger and ilk, whatever happened to good ol' gln?  i had him in
 my kill file since last year's playoffs and now that i've moved to a new
 news reader which doesn't have kill files, i find that he's gone.  i must
 admit, however, that unlike gln, roger seems to know something about the game
 as long as the subject doesn't touch on the leafs.
