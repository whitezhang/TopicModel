 actually, messier was invited, but declined due to nagging injuries...
 keenan and messier have always gotten along...keenan dumped steve
 yzerman from the last canada cup team, even though yzerman had
 endured the training camp, when messier who had missed essentially the
 entire camp recovering from injuries became available at the
 last moment.
