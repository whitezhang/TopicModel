 the last name is niedermayer, as in new jersey's scott's last name, because
 (you guessed it) they are brothers.  but rob niedermayer is a center, not
 a defenseman.
 
 i am not sure that the sharks will take kariya.  they aren't saying much, but
 they apparently like niedermayer and victor kozlov, along with kariya.  chris
 pronger's name has also been mentioned.  my guess is that they'll take
 niedermayer.  they may take pronger, except that they already have too many
 defensive prospects.
