 actually, fired-coach george kingston was a third of the gm
 triumvirate.  now that the trio is now duo (dean lombardi and chuck
 grillo), the sharks are already on their 3rd "office of the gm". and a
 4th is likely to happen before september; they'll either add the new
 coach to the oofgm, or name a single gm. so your wager should be
 amended to read that sharks are likely to have their 5th gm before the
 panther's get their 2nd. can't wait to see how the next season's nhl
 guide and record book lists the gm history of the sharks.
 
 given the depth of next year's draft, the expansion draft rules, and
 the reputation of their gms, anaheim and miami look pretty good as the
 first 90s expansion teams to win a cup.  san jose and ottawa have
 instability at the gm position, something that philly, nyi, edmonton,
 and calgary did not have when they won their first cups. pittsburgh
 did, but they needed a quarter century.
