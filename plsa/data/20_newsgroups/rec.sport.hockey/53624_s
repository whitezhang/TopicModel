 i think this guy is going to be just a little bit disappointed.  lemieux
 two, tocchet, mullen, tippett, and jagr.  i buzzed my friend because i forgot
 who had scored mullen's goal.  i said, "who scored?  lemieux two, tocchet,
 tippett, jagr."  the funny part was i said the "jagr" part non-chalantly as
 he was in the process of scoring while i was asking this question!!! :-)
 
 all in all abc's coverage wasn't bad.  on a scale of 1-10, i give it about

 >it's nice that the devils are starting out their playoffs on network
 >television ... too bad that their playoff game has been preempted on
 >wabc-am for an early-season yankees baseball game!
 
 that's stupid!!!  i'd complain to the television network!  if i were to even

 >it's a 12-2 win by the texas rangers ... and they're delaying the
 >tape-delay by another half-hour for the ballgame "highlights"!!!
 
 texas is off to a good start, they may pull it out this year.  whoops!  that
 belongs in rec.sport.baseball!!!
