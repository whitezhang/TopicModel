 season on abc (wtae - channel 4), immediately preceding the opening 
 game against the devils on sunday.  i only turned it on in time to 
 watch the credits.  if anyone taped it and is willing to let me borrow 
 it to dub it, i would appreciate it.  i would be willing to come pick 
 it up, and i'll return it the next day and buy you a beer.  please 
 respond via e-mail.  thanks a lot.
 	oh yeah.  was it any good?
