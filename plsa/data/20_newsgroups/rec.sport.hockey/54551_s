 i'm personally expecting moog.  blue played fairly decent (alright
 spectacular at times) in his 1/2 a game but moog has the experience.
 what did blue have going for him, nothing, what would happen in a tie
 game, the prssure is then on the goal tender to insure that you keep the
 puck out (at the very least until your team scores)  blue didn't face that
 kind of pressure on tuesday.  the bruins will come out storming that
 is for sure.  i really think that this series is up to buffalo, boston
 (except for two bad passes in game one) really hasn't played that bad
 ,  as a believer is statistics, you know that your going to get the
 puck by fuhr sooner or later, just keep shooting.  there game plan is
 sound but they need to take the lead first, and control the tempo.....
 
                imho
