 bryan murray has done very little as gm...yzerman, fedorov, cheveldae,
 chaisson, the whole russian strategy was a product of the previous
 gm...murray has made a couple of decent trades...that's about it...
 that would hardly rank him as the best gm.
 
 wasn't primeau, murray's first decision as gm...
