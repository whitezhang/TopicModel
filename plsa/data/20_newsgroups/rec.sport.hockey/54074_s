 your hatred of the minnesota north stars:
 
 1. a real team like toronto would not be moved, you are right,
    just eliminated from the playoffs first round!
 2. why stay in minnesota when you can go to a college in
    western ontario and actually take classes on map-reading
    and the artistry of bsing specifically set up for just you.
 3. why should anyone love the stars, when hating the leafs
    is so much better?
 4. oh, i'm sorry.. well, maybe you can't understand my
    big words.. next time i'll limit my vocabulary to words
    like "get real team now" and "do not waste our time"
 5. respond to this article. i love to laugh at your humor,
    even though it it unintentional. i got a big kick out of
    go leafs go.... go where? home, i think!! :)
