 you don't say whether or not you have any symptoms other than pain.
 if you have numbness, weakness or bladder problems, for example,
 these would suggest a need for surgery. if pain is your only symptom
 you might do well to find a reputable, multi-disciplinary pain
 clinic in your area. chronic low back pain generally doesn't do well
 with surgery, acute on chronic pain (as only symptom) doesn't fare
 much better.
 e correlation between mri findings and symptoms is controversial.
