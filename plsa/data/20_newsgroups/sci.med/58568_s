 ==============
 using a pc's keyboard on your workstation / compatibility issues
 
     mini outline:
         1. spoofing a keyboard over the serial port
         2. x terminals
         3. next
         4. silicon graphics
         5. ibm rs/6000
 	6. other stuff
 
     1. spoofing a keyboard over the serial port
 
 	if you've got a proprietary computer which uses its own keyboard
 	(sun, hp, dec, etc.) then you're going to have a hard time finding
 	a vendor to sell you a compatible keyboard.  if your workstation
 	runs the x window system, you're in luck.  you can buy a cheap used
 	pc, hook your expensive keyboard up to it, and run a serial cable
 	to your workstation.  then, run a program on the workstation to read
 	the serial port and generate fake x keyboard events.
 
 	the two main programs i've found to do this are kt and a2x.
 
 	a2x is a sophisticated program, capable of controlling the mouse, and
 	even moving among widgets on the screen.  it requires a server
 	extension (xtest, dec-xtrap, or xtestextension1).  to find out if your
 	server can do this, run 'xdpyinfo' and see if any of these strings
 	appear in the extensions list.  if your server doesn't have this,
 	you may want to investigate compiling x11r5, patchlevel 18 or later,
 	or bugging your vendor.
 
 	kt is a simpler program, which should work with unextended x servers.
 	another program called xsendevent also exists, but i haven't seen it.
 
 	both a2x and kt are available via anonymous ftp from soda.berkeley.edu.
 
     2. x terminals
 
 	also, a number of x terminals (ncd, tektronics, to name a few) use
 	pc-compatible keyboards.  if you have an x terminal, you may be all
 	set.  try it out with a normal pc keyboard before you go through the
 	trouble of buying an alternative keyboard.  also, some x terminals add
 	extra buttons -- you may need to keep your original keyboard around
 	for the once-in-a-blue-moon that you have to hit the setup key.
 
     3. next
 
 	next had announced that new next machines will use the apple desktop
 	bus, meaning any mac keyboard will work.  then, they announced they
 	were cancelling their hardware production.  if you want any kind of
 	upgrade for an older next, do it now!
 
     4. silicon graphics
 
 	silicon graphics has announced that their newer machines (indigo^2 and
 	beyond) will use standard pc-compatible keyboards and mice.  i don't
 	believe this also applies to the power series machines.  it's not
 	possible to upgrade an older sgi to use pc keyboards, except by
 	upgrading the entire machine.  contact your sgi sales rep for more
 	details.
 
     5. ibm rs/6000
 
 	ibm rs/6000 keyboards are actually similar to normal pc keyboards.  ||
 	unfortunately, you can't just plug one in.  you need two things: a  ||
 	cable converter to go from the large pc keyboard connector to the   ||
 	smaller ps/2 style din-6, and a new device driver for aix.  believe ||
 	it or not, ibm wrote this device driver recently, i used it, and it ||
 	works.  however, they don't want me to redistribute it.  i've been  ||
 	told judy hume (512) 823-6337 is a potential contact.  if you learn ||
 	anything new, please send me e-mail.				    ||
     
     6. other stuff
 
 	some vendors here (notably: health care keyboard co. and accucorp)
 	support some odd keyboard types, and may be responsive to your
 	queries regarding supporting your own weird computer.  if you can
 	get sufficient documention about how your keyboard works (either
 	from the vendor, or with a storage oscilloscope), you may be in
 	luck.  contact the companies for more details.
 
 
 apple adjustable keyboard
     apple computer, inc.
     sales offices all over the place.
 
     availability: february, 1993
     price: $219
     supports: mac only
 
     apple has recently announced their new split-design keyboard.  the
     keyboard has one section for each hand, and the sections rotate
     backward on a hinge.  the sections do not tilt upward.  the keys are
     arranged in a normal qwerty fashion.
 
     the main foldable keyboard resembles a normal apple keyboard.
     a separate keypad contains all the extended key functions.
 
     the keyboard also comes with matching wrist rests, which are not
     directly attachable to the keyboard.
 
     as soon as soda comes back up, i'll have a detailed blurb from
     tidbits available there.
 
 
 flexpro keyboard
     key tronic
     phone: 800-262-6006
     possible contact: denise razzeto, 509-927-5299
     sold by many clone vendors and pc shops
 
     availability: spring, 1993 (?)
     price: $489 (?)
     supports: pc only (highly likely)
 
     keytronic apparently showed a prototype keyboard at comdex.  it's
     another split-design.  one thumb-wheel controls the tilt of both
     the left and right-hand sides of the main alphanumeric section.
     the arrow keys and keypad resemble a normal 101-key pc keyboard.
 
     keytronic makes standard pc keyboards, also, so this product will
     probably be sold through their standard distribution channels.
 
 
 dragondictate-30k (and numerous other dragon products)
     dragon systems, inc.
     320 nevada street
     newton, ma  02160
 
     phone: 800-talk-typ or 617-965-5200
     fax: 617-527-0372
 
     shipping: now.
 
     price: dragondictate-30k -- $4995 (end user system)
 	   dragonwriter 1000 -- $1595 / $2495 (end user/developer system)
 	   various other prices for service contracts, site licenses, etc.
     
     compatibility: 386 (or higher) pc only
 		   (3rd party support for mac)
 
 	free software support for x windows is also available -- your
 	pc with dragon hardware talks to your workstation over a
 	serial cable or network.  the program is called a2x, and is
 	available via anonymous ftp:
 
 	soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/a2x.tar.z
 	export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/a2x.tar.z (most current)
 
 	if you want to use your dragon product with x windows, you may want
 	to ask for peter cohen, an salesman at dragon who knows more about
 	this sort of thing.
 
     dragon systems sells a number of voice recognition products.
     most (if not all) of them seem to run on pc's and compatibles
     (including ps/2's and other microchannel boxes).  they sell you
     a hardware board and software which sits in front of a number
     of popular word processors and spreadsheets.
 
     each user `trains' the system to their voice, and there are provisions
     to correct the system when it makes mistakes, on the fly.  multiple
     people can use it, but you have to load a different personality file
     for each person.  you still get the use of your normal keyboard, too.
     on the dragondictate-30k you need to pause 1/10th sec between
     words.  dragon claims typical input speeds of 30-40 words per minute.
     i don't have specs on the dragonwriter 1000.
 
     the dragondictate-30k can recognize 30,000 words at a time.
     the dragonwriter 1000 can recognize (you guessed it) 1000 words at a time.
 
     dragon's technology is also part of the following products
     (about which i have no other info):
 
 	microsoft windows sound system (voice pilot)
 	ibm voicetype
 	voice navigator ii (by articulate systems -- for macintosh)
 	emstation (by lanier voice products -- "emergency medical workstation")

     coming very soon...).  no other workstations supported, but serial
     support for unix with x windows has been written.  pc and mac are
     getting all the real attention from the company.
 
     a chording system.  one hand is sufficient to type everything.
     the second hand is for redundancy and increased speed.

     mark roggenbuck (contact)
 
     supports: pc and mac
 
     shipping: in beta.  "big backlog" -- could take 3+ months.
 
     price: $2000/unit (1 unit == 2 pods). (new price!)			    ||
 
     each hand has its own "pod".  each of the four main fingers has five
     switches each: forward, back, left, right, and down.  the thumbs have
     a number of switches.  despite appearances, the key layout resembles
     qwerty, and is reported to be no big deal to adapt to.  the idea is
     that your hands never have to move to use the keyboard.  the whole pod
     tilts in its base, to act as a mouse.

     jeffrey szmanda (vice president -- contact)
 
     shipping: now.
 
     supports: pc (and mac???)						    ||
     
     planned future support:
 	ibm 122-key layout (3270-style, i believe)
 	sun sparc
 	decision data
 	unisys uts-40
 	silicon graphics
 
 	others to be supported later.  the hardware design is relatively
 	easy for the company to re-configure.
 
     price: $690, including one system "personality module".		    ||
 
     the idea is that one keyboard works with everything.  you purchase
     "compatibility modules", a new cord, and possibly new keycaps, and
     then you can move your one keyboard around among different machines.
 
     it's a three-piece folding keyboard.  the layout resembles the
     standard 101-key keyboard, except sliced into three sections.  each
     section is on a "custom telescoping universal mount."  each section
     independently adjusts to an infinite number of positions allowing each
     individual to type in a natural posture.  you can rearrange the three
     sections, too (have the keypad in the middle if you want).  each
     section is otherwise normal-shaped (i.e.: you put all three sections
     flat, and you have what looks like a normal 101-key keyboard).

     shipping: now.
 
     supports: pc.  mac and sun sparc in the works.
 
     price: $690.  volume discounts available.  the $690 includes one foot
 	pedal, one set of adhesive wrist pads, and a typingtutor program.
 	an additional foot pedal and other accessories are extra.
 
     the layout has a large blank space in the middle, even though the
     keyboard is about the size of a normal pc keyboard -- slightly
     smaller.  each hand has its own set of keys, laid out to minimize
     finger travel.  thumb buttons handle many major functions (enter,
     backspace, etc.).
 
     you can remap the keyboard in firmware (very nice when software won't
     allow the reconfig).
 
     foot pedals are also available, and can be mapped to any key on the
     keyboard (shift, control, whatever).

     doesn't use conventional push-keys.  soft rubber keys, which rock
     forward and backward (each key has three states), make chords for
     typing keys.  learning time is estimated to be 2-3 hours, for getting
     started, and maybe two weeks to get used to it.
 
     currently, the thumbs don't do anything, although a thumb-trackball
     is in the works.

     information: grade i, grade ii, or computer braille.  basically,
     letters a-j are combinations of dots 1, 2, 4, and 5.  letters k-t are
     the same combinations as a-j with dot 3 added. letters u, v, x, y, and
     z are like a-e with dots 3 and 6 added.  (w is unique because louis
     braille didn't have a w in the french alphabet.)
