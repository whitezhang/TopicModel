 i just got back from the american academy of neurology annual meeting,
 where the consensus was that sumatriptan (imitrex) has no advantages
 over dhe-45 nasal spray, which is much less expensive, has fewer side
 effects, is as effective, and works more quickly (5-10 minutes vs. 30).
 besides, who wants to give themselves a shot (sumatriptan) when a nasal
 spray works?  dhe nasal spray is not widely available yet -- it has to
 be mail ordered from one of a few pharmacies in the country -- but most
 neurologists now know about it and know how to order it.
