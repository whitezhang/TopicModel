 digression 6.1:  miracle berries and the modification of taste receptors
 
 although the _miracle berry_, a plant native to west africa is practically
 tasteless, it temporarily changes the taste of other substances.  miracle
 berries contain a protein, _miraculin_, that modifies sweet receptors in
 such a way that they can be stimulated by acids (bartoshuk, gentile, 
 moskowitz, & meiselman, 1974).  if you ever get a chance to chew a miracle
 berry (and i do recommend it), for about the next half an hour all acids 
 (which are normally sour) will taste sweet.  they will continue to taste
 sour as well.
 
 miraculin was, for a time, commercially available in the united states as a
 diet aid.  the idea was that dieters could coat their tongue with a miraculin
 pill and then eat and drink unsweetened, slightly acidic substances.  such
 substances would taste sweet without providing many calories.
 
 a colleague and i once spent an evening experimenting with miracle berries.
 we drank straight lemon juice, sauerkraut juice, even vinegar.  all tasted
 extremely sweet.  somehow we forgot how acidic these substances are.  we 
 awoke the next day to find our mouths full of ulcers.
 
 [... continued discussion of a couple other taste-altering substances ...]
