 in holland insurences pay for homeopathic treatment. in germany they do
 so as well. i austria they do if you have a condition which can not be 
 helped by "normal" medicine (happened to me). switzerland seems to be 
 the same as austria (i have direct experience in the swiss case).
 
 at the univeristy of vienna (i believe innsbruck as well) homeopathy
 can be taken in med. school.
 
 i found that in combination with acupuncture it changed my life from
 living hell to a condition which enables me to lead a relatively 
 normal life. i found that modern medicine was powerless to cure me
 of a *severe* case of neurodermitis (note: i mean cure, not 
 surpress the symptoms, which is what modern medicine attempts to 
 do in the case of neurodermitis). 
 
 i'm not saying that homeopathy is scientific, but that it can offer 
 help in areas in which modern medicine is absolutely helpless.
 
 from reading your aritcle it seems that your have some deeply rooted
 beliefs about this issue (this is not intended to be offensive or 
 sarcastic - it just sounded like that to me) which makes me doubt 
 if you can read this with an open mind. if you do/can, please excuse
 my last comment.
