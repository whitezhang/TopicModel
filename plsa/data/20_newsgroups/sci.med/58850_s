 um, i hate to break this to you, but article numbers are unique per site.
 they have no meaning on other machines.

 you mean the responses some of which pointed to double-blind tests
 which show no such "chinese restaurant effect" unique to msg
 (it's elicited by the placebo as well.)

 like youself?  someone who can read a scientific paper and apparently
 come away from it with bizarrely cracked ideas which have nothing to
 do with the use of this substance in human nutrition?

 no, it's undisputed in the literature that glutamate is an amino acid
 which is an excitatory neurotransmitter.  there is also evidence that
 excessive release of glutamate may be involved in the pathology of certain
 conditions like stroke, drowning and lou gehrig's disease, just to name a few.
 this is a completely different issue than the use of this ubiquitous amino acid
 in foods.  people are not receiving intra-ventricular injections of glutamate.

 i don't know about premier, but it's certainly an important one.

 sez you.  such an effect in humans has not been demonstrated in any
 controlled studies.  infant mice and other models are useful as far
 as they go, but they're not relevant to the matter at hand.  which is
 not to say that i favor its use in things like baby food--a patently
 ridiculous use of the additive.  but we have no reason to believe
 that msg in the diet effects humans adversely.

 wrong.  do you know how much aspartate or phenylalanine is in a soft drink?
 milligrams worth.  compare that to a glass of milk.  do you know how much
 glutamate is present in most protein-containing foods compared to that
 added by the use of msg?

 notice the subtle covering of her ass here: "anyone _with a sensitivity_..."
 we're disputing the size of that class.

 impeccable.  there most certainly is a dispute.
