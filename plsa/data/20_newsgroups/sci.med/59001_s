 i think some essential information must be missing here, i.e., you must be
 suffering from a condition which has caused immunosuppression.  there is
 no indication for iv acyclovir for shingles in an otherwise healthy
 person.  the oral form can help to reduce the length of symptoms, and may
 even help prevent the development of post-herpetic neuralgia, but i
 certainly would not subject someone to iv therapy without a good reason.
 
 to address your more general question, iv therapy does provide higher and
 more consistently high plasma and tissue levels of a drug.  for treating a
 serious infection this is the only way to be sure that a patient is
 getting adequate drug levels.
