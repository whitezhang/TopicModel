 well, let me put it this way, based on my own experience.  a
 general practitioner with no training in infectious diseases,
 by establishing links to the "lyme community", treating patients
 who come to him wondering about lyme or having decided they
 have lyme as if they did, saying that diseases such as ms
 are probably spirochetal, if not lyme, giving talks at meetings
 of users groups, validating the feelings of even delusional
 patients, etc.  this gp can go from being a run-of-the-mill
 $100k/yr gp to someone with lots of patients in the hospital
 and getting expensive infusions that need monitoring in his
 office, and making lots of bread.  also getting the adulation
 of many who believe his is their only hope (if not of cure,
 then of control) and seeing his name in publications put out
 by support groups, etc.  this is a definite temptation.
