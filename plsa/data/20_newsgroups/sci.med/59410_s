 colonics were a health fad of the 19th century, which persists to this day.
 except for certain medical conditions, there is no reason to do this.
 certainly no normal person should do this.
 
 frequent use of enemas can lead to a condition in which a person is unable
 to have normal bowel passage, essentially a person becomes addicted to
 enemas.  as i understand it, this is a very unpleasant condition, and it
 would be best to avoid it.
