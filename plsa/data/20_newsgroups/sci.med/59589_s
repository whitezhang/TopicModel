     but no one (or at least, not many people) are trying to pass off god
 as a scientific fact.  not so with kirlian photography.  i'll admit that
 it is possible that some superior intelligence exists elsewhere, and if
 people want to label that intelligence "god", i'm not going to stop
 them.  anyway, let's _not_ turn this into a theological debate.  ;-)
