 as an animal science student, i know that a number of animals transfer
 immunoglobin to thier young through thier milk.  in fact, a calf _must_
 have a sufficient amount of colostrum (early milk) within 12 hours to
 effectively develop the immune system, since for the first (less than)
 24 hours the intestines are "open" to the ig passage.  my question is,
 does this apply to human infants to any degree?
