 but after you have taken antihistamines for a few nights, doesn't it start
 to have a paradoxical effect?  i used to take one every night for
 allergies and couldn't figure out why i developed bad insomnia.  finally
 figured out it was the antihistamines.  i would fall asleep for a few
 minutes but would awaken at the drop of a pin a little later and could not
 get back to sleep.  i don't have that problem since i stopped the
 antihistamines at bedtime.  ?
