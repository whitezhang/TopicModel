 interesting statements, simply because i have been told otherwise.  i'm
 certainly not questioning steve's claims, as for one i am not a doctor, and i
 agree that foods don't bring on the recurrence of crohn's.  but inflammation
 can be either mildly or drastically enhanced due to food.
 
 having had one major obstruction resulting in resection (is that a good enough
 caveat :-), i was told that a *low residue* diet is called for.  basically,
 the idea is that if there is inflammation of the gut (which may not be
 realized by the patient), any residue in the system can be caught in the folds
 of inflammation and constantly irritate, thus exacerbating the problem.
 therefore, anything that doesn't digest completely by the point of common
 inflammation should be avoided.  with what i've been told is typical crohn's,
 of the terminal ileum, my diet should be low residue, consisting of:
 
 completely out - never again - items:
 	o corn (kernel husk doesn't digest ... most of us know this :-)
 	o popcorn (same)
 	o dried (dehydrated) fruit and fruit skins
 	o nuts (very tough when it comes to giving up some fudge :-)
 
 discouraged greatly:
 	o raw vegetables (too fibrous)
 	o wheat and raw grain breads
 	o exotic lettuce (iceberg is ok since it's apparently mostly water)
 	o greens (turnip, mustard, kale, etc...)
 	o little seeds, like sesame (try getting an arby's without it!)
 	o long grain and wild rice (husky)
 	o beans (you'll generate enough gas alone without them!)
 	o basically anything that requires heavy digestive processing
 
 i was told that the more processed the food the better! (rather ironic in this
 day and age).  the whole point is preventative ... you want to give your
 system as little chance to inflame as possible.  i was told that among the
 numerous things that were heavily discouraged (i only listed a few), to try
 the ones i wanted and see how i felt.  if it's bad, don't do it again!
 remember though that this was while i was in remission.  for veggies: cook the
 daylights out of them.  i prefer steaming ... i think it's cooks more
 thoroughly - you're mileage may vary.
 
 as with anything else, check with your doctor.  don't just take my word.  but
 this is the info i've been given, and it may be a starting point for
 discussion.  good luck!
