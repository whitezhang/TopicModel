 
 
 i recently attended an allery seminar.  steroid nasal sprays were 
 discussed.  afterward on a one-on-one basis, i asked the speaker what if 
 none of the vancanese, beconase, nasalide, nasalcort, or nasalchrom work 
 nor do any oral decongestants work.  she replied that she saw an article on 
 vasomotor rhinitis.  that this is not an allergic reaction and that nothing 
 other than the afrin's and such would work.  (which in my case is true).
 
 i want to find out as much as possible about this, since i am going to see 
 my allergist in may and want to be armed to the hilt with information; 
 since nothing he has done with me has helped me at all and i have had no 
 relief for 14 months.
 
 please respond if you know anything about this and/or please let me know 
 what articles might be helpful that i could look up in the library.
