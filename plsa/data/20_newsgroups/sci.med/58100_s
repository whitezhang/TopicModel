 i do not know a lot about this, except from seeing one patient with
 "kartagener's syndrome", which is a form of immotile cilia syndrome
 in which there is situs inversus, bronchiectasis, and chronic
 infections. "situs inversus" means that organs are on the wrong
 side of the body, and can be complete or partial. it is interesting
 medically because the normal location of organs is caused in part
 by the "normal" rotation associated with ciliary motion, so that in
 absence of this, laterality can be "random." people with situs
 inversus are quite popular at medical schools, because of their
 rarity, and the fact that most doctors get a bit upset when they
 can't find the patient's heart sounds (because they're on the wrong
 side). 
 
 according to harrison's, immotile cilia syndrom is an autosomal
 recessive, which should imply that on average one child in four
 in a family would be affected. but there may be much more current
 information on this, and as usual in medicine, we may be talking
 about more than one conditiion. i would suggest that you ask your
 pediatrician about contacting a medical geneticics specialist, of
 which there is probably one at ncsu.
