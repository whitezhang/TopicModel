 this is one of those sticky areas of medicine where battles frequently
 rage.  with respect to your ob, i suspect that she has been certified in
 ultrasound diagnostics, and is thus allowed to use it and bill for its
 use.  many cardiologists also use ultrasound (echocardiography), and are
 in fact considered by many to be the 'experts'.  i am not sure where obs
 stand in this regard, but i suspect that they are at least as good as the
 radioligists (flame-retardant suit ready).
