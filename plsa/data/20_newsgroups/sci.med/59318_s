 i guess i'm still not clear on what the term "candida bloom" means,
 but certainly it is well known that thrush (superficial candidal
 infections on mucous membranes) can occur after antibiotic use.
 this has nothing to do with systemic yeast syndrome, the "quack"
 diagnosis that has been being discussed.

 lucky how?  since a recent article (randomized controlled trial) of
 oral yogurt on reducing vaginal candidiasis, i've mentioned to a 
 number of patients with frequent vaginal yeast infections that they
 could try eating 6 ounces of yogurt daily.  it turns out most would
 rather just use anti-fungal creams when they get yeast infections.

 again, this just isn't what the systemic yeast syndrome is about, and
 has nothing to do with the quack therapies that were being discussed.
 there is some evidence that attempts to reinoculate the gi tract with
 bacteria after antibiotic therapy don't seem to be very helpful in
 reducing diarrhea, but i don't think anyone would view this as a
 quack therapy.
