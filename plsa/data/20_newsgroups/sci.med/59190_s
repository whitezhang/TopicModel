 for those of you interested in the above procedure, i am able to add the
 following facts:
 
 1) this procedure is not done in philadelphia.
 
 2) it is performed in maryland at johns hopkins for corrections between
    0 and -5 and from -10 to -20 (diopters, i think are the units).
 
 3) it is performed in new york city at manhattan eye and ear for corrections
    between 0 and -6.
 
 the magic words to use when requesting information on this is not prk (they
 think you mean rk) but the excimer laser study (or protocol). this will get 
 you to the proper people.
