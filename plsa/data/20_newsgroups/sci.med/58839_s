 first, i am not a doctor.  i know about this because i have been
 through it.
 
 it sounds like tonsilitis (lit. swollen tonsils).  feel under your jaw
 hinge for a swelling on each side.  if you find them, its tonsilitis.
 i've had this a couple of times in the past.  the doctor prescribed a
 weeks course of penicillin and that cleared it up.
 
 in my case it was associated with glandular fever, which is a viral
 infection which (from my point of view) resembled flu and tonsilitis
 that kept coming back for a year or so.  there is a blood test for
 this.
 
 in conclusion, see a doctor (if you have not done so already).
