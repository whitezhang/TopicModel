 living things maintain small electric fields to (1) enhance certain
 chemical reactions, (2) promote communication of states with in a cell,
 (3) communicate between cells (of which the nervous system is a specialized
 example), and perhaps other uses.  these electric fields change with location
 and time in a large organism.  special photographic techniques such as applying
 external fields in kirillian photography interact with these fields or the resistances
 caused by these fields to make interesting pictures. perhaps such pictures will
 be diagonistic of disease problems in organisms when better understood. perhaps not.
 
 studying the overall electric activity of biological systems is several hundred
 years old, but not a popular activity.  perhaps, except in the case of a few
 tissues like nerves and the electric senses of fishes, it is hard to reduce the
 investigation into small pieces that can be clearly analyzed.  there are some
 hints that manipulating electric fields is a useful therapy such as speeding
 the healing of broken bones, but not understood why.
 
 bioelectricity has a long association with mysticism. ideas such as frankenstein
 reanimation go back to the most early electrical experiments on tissue such as
 when volta invented the battery.  i personally don't care to revert to supernatural
 cause to explain things we don't yet understand.
