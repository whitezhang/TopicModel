 ear wax is a healthy way to help prevent ear infections, both by preventing
 a barrier and also with some antibiotic properties.  too much can block the
 external auditory canal (the hole in the outside of the ear) and cause some 
 hearing problems.  it is very simple, and safe, to remove excess wax on your
 own, or at your physician's office.  you can take a syringe (no needles!) and
 fill it with 50% warm water (cold can cause fainting) and 50% otc hydrogen
 peroxide.  then point the ear towards the ceiling ( about 45 degrees up)
 and insert the tip of the syringe (helps to have someone else do this!) and  
 firmly expell the solution.  depending on the size of the syringe and the
 tenacity of the wax, this could take several rinses.  if you place a bowl 
 under the ear to catch the water, it will be much drier :-).  you can buy
 a syringe with a special tip at your local pharmacy, or just use whatever
 you may have.  if wax is old, it will be harder, and darker.  you can try
 adding a few drops of olive oil into the ear during a shower to soften up
 the wax.  do this for a couple days, then try syringing again.  it is also
 safe to point your ear up at the shower head, and allow the water to rinse
 it out.
 good luck
