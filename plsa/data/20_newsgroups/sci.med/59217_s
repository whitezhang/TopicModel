 i don't think they provide homeopaths, heck the heir apparent was trying to 
 promote osteopaths to the ranks of eligibility a couple of years back... it 
 pleased my family no end, since i'm at an osteopathic school, sort of 
 validated it for them...then i told them that the name was the same but the 
 practice was different....oh.
 	if you're seeking validation for your philosophy on the strength of 
 the national health service adopting it, i suggest that you are not very 
 sure of the validity of your philosophy. i believe in 1946, the nhs was 
 still having its nurses taught the fine art of "cupping", which is the 
 vacuum extraction of intradermal fluids by means of heating a cup, placing 
 it on the afflicted site and allowing it to cool.
 	i wouldn't take my sick daughter to a homeopath.
