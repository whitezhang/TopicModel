 i'd suggest writing a detailed letter about the incident to the
 hospital administrator. specify the date and time. if possible the
 names of the technicians. 
 
 send a copy to the clinician under whose care your friend was
 admitted. i say this because, though your friend has no argument
 with the doctor, i have found that administrators sometimes ignore
 complaints until the patient becomes litigious. clinicians may not
 have been informed of the complaint and are very surprised to find
 themselves named in a suit.
 
 if there is no response within a week send a follow up letter.
 attach a photocopy of the original letter. do this weekly until you
 do get a response.
 
 cat scans are non-invasive but they can be very scary. the scanner
 can be a bad place for the claustrophobic. there was an interesting
 study in the bmj, about 10 years ago, which found that around 10% of
 people who had cat scans found it so unpleasant that they would
 never have another. this compares with 15% who said the same about a
 lumbar puncture.
