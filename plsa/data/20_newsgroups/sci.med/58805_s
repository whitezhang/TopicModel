 my mom has just been diagnosed with cystic breast disease -- a big
 relief, as it was a lump that could have been cancer.  her doctor says
 she should go off caffeine and chocolate for 6 months, as well as
 stopping the estrogen she's been taking for menopause-related reasons.
 she's not thrilled with this, i think especially because she just gave
 up cigarettes -- soon she won't have any pleasures left!  now, i thought
 i'd heard that cystic breasts were common and not really a health risk.
 is this accurate?  if so, why is she being told to make various
 sacrifices to treat something that's not that big of a deal?
 
 thanks for any information.
