 i don't know if anyone knows about this topic: electrical heart 
 failure. one of my friends has had to go to the doctor because
 he had chest pains. the doc said it was arythmia. so he had to
 go to a new york hospital for a lot of money to get treated. his
 doctors said that he could die from it, and the medication caused
 cancer ( that he was taking). well, i suggested that he run, excersize
 and eat more, ( he is very skinny) but he says that has nothing
 to do with it. does anyone know what causes arythmia and how 
 it can be treated?
 			thanks
