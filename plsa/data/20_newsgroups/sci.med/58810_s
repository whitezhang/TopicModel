 of course, bee venom isn't a single chemical.  could be your brother is
 reacting to a different component than the one that causes anaphylactic shock
 in other people.
 
 similarly, chinese food isn't just msg.  there are a lot of other ingredients
 in it.  why, when someone eats something with lots of ingredients they don't
 normally consume, one of which happens to be msg, do they immediately conclude
 that any negative reaction is to the msg?
 
 =i would not be surprised in the least to find out the some people have bad
 =reactions to msg, including headaches, stomachaches and even vomiting.
 
 i'd be surprised if some of these reactions weren't due to other ingredients.
