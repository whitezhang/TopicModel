 i've had prk.
 
 i would suggest asking a doctor about contacts. mine said yes to
 contacts. i think the scars from rk would preclude contacts.

 no. rk makes radial cuts around the circumference of the cornea, up to
 8 i think, and these change the curvature of the cornea through stress
 chages. prk vaporizes (burns) away a thin layer from the front of the
 cornea making the optical axis of the eye shorter. the laser doesn't
 cut in prk, it vaporizes. in rk, the eye is cut into.

 i find my vision is more clear for some things, and less clear for
 others, only at night. i notice a definite haloing at night in the
 darkness when i look at automobile headlamps, though this is not
 something i spend inordinate amounts of time doing. for ordinary
 things, my vision, in particular having a fully-operating peripheral
 vision, is clearer than with glasses, or contacts.
