 no doubt the sci.med* folks are getting out their flamethrowers.  i'm
 rather certain that the information you got was not medical literature
 in the accepted academic/scientific journals.  so, the righteous among
 them will no doubt jump on that.
 
 also, insofar as it doesn't conform to the accepted medical presumption
 that it just doesn't matter what you eat, and that we can think of the
 gi tract as a black box in which nothing ever goes wrong (except for
 maybe cancer and ulcers), the righteous will no doubt jump on that too.
 
 then there'll be the ones who call your doctor a raving quack, even
 though he, like linus pauling, is lucid and robust well into his
 nineties--but nevermind about that.  he shouldn't charge for his
 equipment and supplies, since they're no doubt not approved by the
 fda.  of course, with fda approval an md or pharmaceutical company can
 charge whatever they can get for such safe and effective treatments as
 thalidomide.  but nevermind about that either.
 
 unfortunately, you dared to step into the sacred turf of net.medical.
 discussion without a credential and without understanding that the
 righteous among them will make certain that you are suitably denounced
 before dismissing you as a fool.
 
 but maybe somebody without such a huge chip on their shoulder will
 send you some reasonable responses by e-mail.

 oh yes, i did have a point.  a few years ago an md with a thriving
 practice in a very wealthy part of silicon valley once recommended that
 i take such treatments to clear up a skin condition.  (not through his
 office, i might add.)  although i'm sure that's not conclusive, it was
 sure an unusual prescription!
