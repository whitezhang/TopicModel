 does anyone know if either theophylline or ephedrine, or the two in
 combination, can reduce the body's ability to make use of 
 available water?  i had kind of an odd experience on a group hike
 recently, becoming dehyrated after about 9 hours of rigorous
 hiking despite having brought 1 1/2 gallons of water (c. 6 liters).
 i drank close to twice as much as anyone else, and no one else was
 dehydrated.  i don't think general physical condition was an issue,
 since i was in at least the middle of the pack in terms of general
 stamina, so far as i could tell.
 
 it may be that i just plain need more water than most people.  but i am
 wondering if theophylline and/or ephedrine might be aggravating things.
 i took a couple of primatene tablets during the hike to control asthma
 (24 mg. ephedrine, 100 mg. theophylline).  i gather that both those
 drugs are diuretics.  so now i'm wondering: does that mean they can
 reduce the body's ability to utilize available water?  would it be a
 particularly  stupid thing to take that medication during hot-weather
 exercise?  (i always assumed diuresis just meant you urinated a lot, but
 that wasn't the case yesterday.)
