 i've read that exercise makes the heart pump more blood at a stroke, and
 that it also makes the heart pumb slower, in order to make up for the
 greater volume. my internist, who diagnosed my av block, slow heart rate
 and pvc's, told me something different. she says that heart rate is
 associated with the electrical properties of the hear muscle, not its
 size. exercise lowers heart rate and increases stroke volume, but the
 effects are unrelated except for their common source. the av block, she
 asserts, is another electrical effect, which is irreversable - even when
 exercise is dicontinued. pvc's are also common in runners. 
 
 so my ekg puts me in a class with trained athletes and also with heart
 patients. isn't that strange, though? are there any not-so-beneficial
 aspects to athlete's heart? is it all good?
 
 not worried, just curious,
