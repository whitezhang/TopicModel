 i second what spenser aden said in reply.  additionally, it is hard to say
 what type of response you ar3e having to prednisone since you did not say
 how long you have been on it.  patients are generally kept on steroids for
 months before thinking about tapering.  alternatives to daily dosing are 
 every other day dosing, in your case 20mg every other day would be a start.
 another option if it is not possible to get you off prednisone is to start
 azathioprine.  like spenser said, you should generally be on another drug
 in addition to your prednisone, like asulfidine.  a lot of the specifics
 about options, though, depends on severity, location, and duration of 
 disease, as well as histology, so take advice off the net for what it
 is worth.  
 
 i treat patients with uc and crohn's.  an educated patient is a good 
 patient, but let your doctor know where the advice came from so things
 can be put in context.  you should also be a member of the crohn's and
 colitis foundation of america.  1-800-932-2423 office / 1-800-343-3637
 info hotline.
 
 best of luck to you.
