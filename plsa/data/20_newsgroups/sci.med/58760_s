 there's a pretty good article in the the march 6, 1993 new scientist titled
 "pouring cold water on lorenzo's oil".  the article states that research
 has shown that the oil has no discernable effect on the progression of the
 disease in patients in which demyelination has begun.  in patients with
 amn (a less acute form of the same disease) there is some improvement
 seen in the ability of nerve fibres to conduct impulses.  in ald patients
 who have not yet begun demyelination, the jury is still out.
