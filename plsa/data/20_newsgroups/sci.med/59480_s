 actually i am entering vet school next year, but the question is 
 relevant for med students too.
 
 memorizing large amounts has never been my strong point academically.
 since this is a major portion of medical education -- anatomy, 
 histology, pathology, pharmacology, are for the most part mass 
 memorization -- i am a little concerned.  as i am sure most 
 med students are.
 
 can anyone suggest techniques for this type of memorization?  i 
 have had reasonable success with nemonics and memory tricks like
 thinking up little stories to associate unrelated things.  but i have
 never applied them to large amounts of "data".
 
 has anyone had luck with any particular books, memory systems, or
 cheap software?   
 
 can you suggest any helpful organizational techniques?  being an
 older student who returned to school this year, organization (another
 one of my weak points) has been a major help to my success.
 
 please no griping about how all you have to do is "learn" the material
 conceptually.  i have no problem with that, it is one of my strong 
 points.  but you can't get around the fact that much of medicine is
 rote memorization.  
 
 thanks for your help.
