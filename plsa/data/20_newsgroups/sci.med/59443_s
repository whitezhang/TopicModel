 i need some information on the implications of receiving
 cortisone shots for a seasonal allergic condition.  
 
 i've had the usual "skin prick" tests for the
 common allergies, but reacted to none of the substances.
 so for the last two seasons i've received cortisone shots
 but the doctors seem reluctant to give more than two or
 three shots.  why?  what are the dangers?
