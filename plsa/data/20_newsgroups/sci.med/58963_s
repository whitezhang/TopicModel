 this smacks a bit of ideology -- the supposition being that toricelli's
 subsequent descriptions of his reasoning are not veridical.  it gets dangerously
 close to an unfalsifiable view of the history and methodology of science if
 we deny that no subsequent reports of experimenters are reliable descriptions
 of their "real" reasons.

 but my point is that this type of case is *not* a rarity.  in fact, i was
 going to point to pasteur as yet another rather common example -- particularly
 the studies on spontaneous generation and fermentation.  i will readily
 concede that "ridiculous reasons" can play an important role in how
 scientists spend their time.  but one should not confuse motivation with
 methodology nor suppose that ridiculous reasons provide the impetus in the
 majority of cases based on relatively infrequent anecdotal evidence.
