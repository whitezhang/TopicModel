 a friend of mine is going in later this week for tests to see if has
 emphysema.  his lung capacity has decreased over time.  his father died
 of the disease.  he works in woodworking.  i believe he has a very
 occasional cigarette, perhaps one cigarette a day or even less.  he tells
 me this..i've never seen him light up.  he has some pretty healthy
 life style habits, good diet, exercise, meditation, retreats, therapy
 etc.  anyhow..he is very concerned with this check up.  i know really
 nothing about the disease.  i believe it interferes with the lining
 of the lung being able to exchange oxygen.  
 
 is a diagnosis of emphysema a death sentence?  if he were to give up smoking
 entirely would that better his chances for recovery?  what are some 
 modern therapies used in people with this disease?  i would appreciate 
 any information.  thanks.  amigan@cup.portal.com
