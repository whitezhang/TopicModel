 	i'm not sure who the "original respondent" was but to
 reiterate cones respond to particular portions of the spectrum, just
 as _rods_ respond to certain parts of the visible spectrum (bluegreen
 in our case, reddish in certain amphibia), just as the hoseshoe crab
 _limulus polyphemus_ photoreceptors respond to a certain portion of
 the spectrum etc.  it is a common misconception to confound wavelength
 specificity with being color sensitive, however the two are not
 synonymous.
 	so in sum and to beat a dead horse:
 	(1) when the outputs of a cone are matched for number of
 absorbed photons _irrespective_ of the absorbed photons wavelength,
 the cone outputs are _indistinguishable_.
 	(2) cones are simply detectors with different spectral
 sensitivities and are not any more "color sensitive" than are rods,
 ommatidia or other photoreceptors.
 	(3) color vision arises because outputs of receptors which
 sample different parts of the spectrum (cones in this case) are
 "processed centrally".  (the handwave is intentional)
 
 	i've worked and published research on rods and cones for over
 10 years so the adherence to the belief that cones can "detect color"
 is frustrating.  but don't take my word for it.  i'm reposting a few
 excellent articles together with two rather good but oldish color
 vision texts.
