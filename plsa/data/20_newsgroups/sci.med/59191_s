    a non-invasive use of ultra-sound where the patient is lowered
    into some sort of liquid when he/she undergoes treatment? i'm sure
    i've read about it somewhere. if i remember it correctly it is a
    painless and effective treatment.
    a couple of weeks ago i visited a hospital here in stockholm and
    saw big signs showing the way to the "kidney stone chrusher" ...
