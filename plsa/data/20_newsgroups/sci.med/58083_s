 the crew rest requirements are to prevent undue fatigue.  the cockpit
 crew (pilot) limits are somewhat more stringent than the cabin crew
 limits for this reason.  crew rest requirements address amount of time
 on duty plus rest time.  a tired crew is an accident-prone crew.
 
 the only limits i know of for inner-ear problems are in military
 aircraft, which are frequently unpressurized or less reliably
 pressurized.  not being able to clear the ears renders aircrew members
 dnif (duties not involving flying) or grounded until the ears clear.
 
 flying can accentuate problems if ears don't clear.  if you don't have
 big pressure changes, you may not know that you've got a problem.  but
 if you zip up to 5,000 or 6,000 ft (the usual cabin altitude in an
 airliner) and then back down to sea level, you may discover a problem.
 ears don't clear readily because of allergies, colds, infections, and
 anatomical problems.  the last won't change; the first three can.
 medication (decongestants or antihistimines, usually) can help.
 chewing gum, sucking hard candy (or a bottle for babies),
 yawning--these will help all four causes.
