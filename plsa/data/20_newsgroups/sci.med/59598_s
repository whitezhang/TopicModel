 i have a problem with wasps -- they seem to love me. last summer i
 couldn't spend more than ten to fifteen minutes at a time in my garden
 before one or several wasps would come for me. i am asking for advice
 on how to repel wasps.
 
    this year the wasps have built their nest under a stone next to one
 of my tiny ponds. the caretaker (poor fellow!) will have to take care
 of them, and that will give me a head start on them. last year we
 couldn't find any nest. even after the caretaker has gassed the nest
 in my tiny garden of 30 square meter, other wasps will most likely vie
 for the territory. is there anything i can grow, rub on my skin or
 spread on the soil that will repel the black and yellow bastards?
 never mind if it turns my skin purple or kills off all my beloved
 plants, i want to be able to spend time in my garden like everyone
 else.
 
    would it help to remove the ponds and the bird bath? the wasps seem
 to come to drink at them, and i suppose that their prey will breed in
 them. the black tits seem to be afraid of the wasps, because as soon
 as the wasp season starts, they stop coming to have their bath.
 
 even when i am not trying to win back my patio from 15-20 wasps, they
 seem to love me. the advice i usually get when i ask what to do about
 wasps, is to stand still and not wave my arms. i've got some painful
 stings when trying to follow that advice. i have also tried to use
 hygienic products without perfumes, to no avail. they still love me,
 and come for me, even when i'm in the middle of a crowd. so far only
 two things seem to work: to kill it dead or to run into the house and
 close all doors and windows. 
 
 nb: i don't have a problem with bees or bumble-bees, just wasps.
