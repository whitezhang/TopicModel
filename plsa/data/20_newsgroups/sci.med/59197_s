 maybe, maybe not.  a new graduate would obviously be well trained (but
 perhaps without sufficient experience). a radiologist trained 10 or
 15 years ago who has not kept his continuing education current is a 
 whole 'nuther matter.  a ob who has trained in modern radiology technology
 is certainly more qualified than the latter and at least equal to 
 the former.

 if the radiologist is also trained in ob/gyn, why not?
