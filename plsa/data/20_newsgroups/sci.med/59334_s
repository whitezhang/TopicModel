 to whomever who can help me,
 
 	i am a doctor from kota bharu, kelantan, malaysia. i have recently hooked up my 
 private home computer to email via the local telephone company. i am really interested
 in corresponding with other doctors or medical researchers through email. i also hope
 to be able to subscribe to a news network on medicine.
 
 can someone please tell me what i should do? i am completely new to this and have no 
 idea about the vast capabilities of email.
 
 thank you for your attention.
