 no, obviously talking about research assistants.  i favor a high protein,
 low fat diet, barely adequate salary on a fixed time schedule, four hours
 of sleep a night, continuous infusion of latte, unpredictable praise 
 mixed randomly with anxiety-provoking, everpresent glances with 
 lowered eyebrows, unrealistic promises of rapid publication, and 
 every three months a dinner consisting of nothing but microbrewery ale
 and free pretzels.  actually, mine hails from san diego, and indeed 
 has more problems in seattle in cold weather than in warm.
