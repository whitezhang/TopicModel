 i do not have enough medical expertise to have much of an opinion
 one way or another on hidden candida infections.  i can
 understand the skepticism of those who see this associated with
 various general kinds of symptoms, while there is a lack of solid
 demonstration that this happens and causes such general symptoms.
 (to understand this skepticism, one only needs to know of past
 failures that shared these characteristics with the notion of
 hidden candida infection.  there have been quite a few, and the
 proponents of all thought that the skeptics were overly skeptical.)
 
 on the other hand, i am happy to read that some people are
 sufficiently interested in this possibility, spurred by
 suggestive clinical experience, to research it further.  the
 doubters may be surprised.  (it has happened before.)
 
 i realize that admitting ignorance in the face of ignorance may
 not endear me to those who are so sure they know one way or
 another.  (and, indeed, perhaps some of them do know -- i am the
 one who is currently ignorant.)  but i find this the most honest
 route, and so i am happy with it.
