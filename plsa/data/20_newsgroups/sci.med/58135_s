 i agree that some specialties have gotten way out of line.  the main
 problem is the payment method for procedures rather than time distorts
 the system.  i hope they will fix that.  but i'm afraid, as usual,
 the local doc is going to take the brunt.  people grouse about paying
 $50 to see their home doctor in his office, but don't mind paying
 $20,000 to have brain surgery.  they think their local doc is cheating
 them but worship the feet of the neurosurgeon who saved their life.
 what they don't realize is that we need more local docs and fewer
