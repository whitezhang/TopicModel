 forgive me, but just the other day i read on some newsgroup or other a
 physician's posting about the theraputic uses of vitamin b6.  i can't
 seem to locate the article, but i recall there was mention of some safe
 limits.
 
 i looked at a "balanced 100" time release formulation from walgreen's
 and noted that the 100 mg of b6 was some thousands times the rda.  is
 this safe?!?.
 
 also what was the condition that b6 was theraputic for?
 
 mail would be just fine if you don't want to clog the net.
 
 thanks,
