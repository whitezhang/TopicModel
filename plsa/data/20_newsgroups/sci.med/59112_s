 my girlfriend just started taking imitrex for her migraine headaches.  her
 neurologist diagnosed her as having depression and suffering from rebound
 headaches due to daily doses of analgesics.  she stopped taking all
 analgesics and caffine as of last thursday (4/15).  the weekend was pretty
 bad, but she made it through with the help of imitrex about every 18 hours.
  her third injection of imitrex, during the worst of the withdrawl on
 friday and six hours after the first of the day, left her very sick.  skin
 was flushed, sweating, vomiting and had severe headache pain.  it subsided
 in an hour or so.  since then, she has been taking imitrex as needed to
 control the pain.  immediately after taking it, she has increased head pain
 for ten minutes, dizziness and mild nausea and mild chest pains.  a friend
 of hers mentioned that her doctor was wary of imitrex because it had caused
 heart attacks in several people.  apparently the mild chest pains were
 common in these other people prior to there attacks.  is this just rumor? 
 has anyone else heard of these symptoms?  my girlfriend also has mitral
 valve prolapse.
 
 opinions are mine or others but definately not mda's!
