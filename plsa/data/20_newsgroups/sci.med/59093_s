 i heard third-hand (not the best form of information) that there was recently
 published results of a study on multiple-personality-disorder syndrome
 patients revealing some interesting clues that the root cause of allergy may
 have a psychological trigger or basis.  what i heard about this study was that
 in one 'personality', a mpds patient exhibited no observable or clinical signs
 of inhalant allergy (scratch tests were used, according to what i heard),
 while in other personalities they showed obvious allergy symptoms, including
 testing a full ++++ on scratch tests for particular inhalants.
 
 if this is true, it is truly fascinating.
 
 but, i'd like to know if this study was ever done, and if so, what the study
 really showed, and where the study is published.  any help out there?
