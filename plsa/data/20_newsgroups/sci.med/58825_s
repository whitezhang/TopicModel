 
 can anyone tell me if a bloodcount of 40 when diagnosed as hypoglycemic is
 dangerous, i.e. indicates a possible pancreatic problem?  one dr. says no, the
 other (not his specialty) says the first is negligent and that another blood
 test should be done.  also, what is a good diet (what has worked) for a hypo-
 glycemic?  tia.
