 there is the possibility that there is some degree of constipation causing
 chronic straining which has caused the bowel movements.  the classic 
 problems that are supposed to be looked for in someone with a hernia are
 constipation, chronic cough, colon cancer (and you're not too young for
 that) and sitting for long periods of time at the computer, reading news.
 
 good luck with your surgery!
