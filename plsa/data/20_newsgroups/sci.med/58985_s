 my 6 year son is so plagued.  lots of vaseline up his nose each night seems 
 to keep it under control.  but let him get bopped there, and he'll recur for 
 days!  also allergies, colds, dry air all seem to contribute.  but again, the 
 vaseline, or a&d ointment, or neosporin all seem to keep them from recurring.
