 ming-zhou liu's main problem is that he has an incompetent
 physician -- himself.  this physician has diagnosed a problem,
 even though he probably has never seen the diagnosed disease
 before and has no idea of what kinds of problems can present
 similar symptoms.  this physician now wants to treat his first
 case of this disease without any help from the medical community.
 
 the best thing ming-zhou liu could do is fire his current
 physician and seek out a better one.
