 i can't answer most of your questions, but i've seen it happen in 
 family members who are being treated with radiation and/or chemotherapy.
 jory graham published a cookbook many years ago (in cooperation with 
 the american cancer society, i think) called "something has to taste
 good" (as i recall).
 
 the cookbook was just what we needed several times when favorite foods
 suddenly became "yech".
