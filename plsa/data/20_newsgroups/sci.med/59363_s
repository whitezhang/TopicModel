         heck, i seem to feel like that *every* time i eat out. including 
 in the cafeteria at work. about half the time, the headache intensifies 
 until nothing will make it go away except throwing up. ick.
 
         as you might imagine, i don't eat out a lot. i guess my tolerance 
 for food additives has plummeted since i switched to eating mostly 
 steamed veggies. they're easy to fix, that's all.
 
         i won't even mention what happened the last time i ate corned 
 beef. (oops. too late.)
