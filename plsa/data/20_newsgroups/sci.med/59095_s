 years ago when i was an intern, an obese young woman was brought into
 the er comatose after having been reported to have grand mal seizures
 why attending a "corn festival".  we pumped her stomach and obtained
 what seemed like a couple of liters of corn, much of it intact kernals.  
 after a few hours she woke up and was fine.  i was tempted to sign her out as
 "acute corn intoxication."
