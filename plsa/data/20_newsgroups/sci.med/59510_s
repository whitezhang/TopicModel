 ok, much as i hate to do it, here i am posting an even better "dr. idiot"
 story.
 
 
 i was in my 18th hour of labor, had been pushing for 4.5 hours and was
 exhausted.  my ob and i decided to go for a csec.  the ob called in
 the anesthisiologist (sp?) and asked him to help prep me for surgery.
 
 after, watching me go through a couple contractions, the anes (or anus as
 i like to refer to him) said, "well, i am off duty now." (still staring
 between my legs at that).  the ob asked to go call whomever it was who
 was on duty and ask him/her how long it would take...and if it was going
 to take more than a few minutes, to please stay even though he was off duty.
 
 the anes. went out, supposedly to call the on-call anes.   in a couple of
 minutes the nurse came running in to tell the ob that the anes. had left
 without even trying to get ahold of the on-call.  it was the only time 
 during my labor that i swore.  the on-call anes. took 20 minutes to get
 there.
 
 come to find out, the anes. had only just gone off duty (about 2 minutes
 before) and technically was supposed to stay in the hospital until the
 next on-call got there.  good thing for all of us (especially him) that
 it was not a critical emergency.  but boy would i love to knock that
 fellow's ouchie places ...just to let him be in pain a
 few little minutes.
 
 
 
 i have run into "dr. idiots", "mechanic idiots", "clerk idiots" and "etc.
 idiots" in my time, but this fellow i would like to have words with.
