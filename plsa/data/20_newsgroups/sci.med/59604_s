 cute anecdote, but hardly indicative of the population.  from the responses
 i've received to that post (all from men, by the way) i get the impression
 that unless a person is willing to drop down and masturbate whenever the
 need or desire strikes, then that person is very hung up on sex.
 
 with tv programs about "boobs" (seinfeld) and "masturbation (again seinfeld)
 and with condoms being handed out in high schools and with the teenage
 pregnancy rate and the high abortion rate here in the states, i would
 not assume that we american's are frightened of sex.  rather we are a bit
 stupid about it.  healthy sexuality does not require flamboyance or
 promiscuity.  it requires responsibility.
