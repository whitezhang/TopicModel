 
 i have seen a fair bit of traffic recently concerning epilepsy and
 seizures.  i am also interested in this subject -- i have a son with
 epilepsy and i am very active with the local association.  i posted a
 message like this a few months ago and received no replies, but here it
 is again.
 
 is anyone interested in participating in a mailing list on epilepsy and
 seizures?  this would allow us to hold discussions and share
 information via electronic mail.  i already run a listserver for two
 other groups, so the mechanics would be easy.
 
 if you are interested, mail me a note.  if i get enough replies, i will
 make it happen and provide you with the details.
 
 btw, i have also started a database on epilepsy.  this is part of my
 research on natural language question answering systems.  users of this
 service are able to ask questions about epilepsy and the program
 searches the database and retrieves its best response.  the technology
 works by comparing your question against a set of questions that have
 been seen before.  all new questions that are not answered are recorded
 and used to improve the system.
 
 this database is still small and sparse, but we are adding new
 information.  to try it out, do the following
 
 	telnet debra.dgbt.doc.ca
 	login: chat
 
 	then select the epilepsy item from the menu of databases.

   for a good time, run "telnet debra.dgbt.doc.ca" and login as "chat".
