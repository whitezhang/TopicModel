 here is another anecdotal story.  i am a picky eater and never wanted to 
 try chinese food, however, i finally tried some in order to please a
 girl i was seeing at the time.  i had never heard of chinese restaurant
 syndrome.  a group of us went to the restaurant and all shared 6 different
 dishes.  it didn't taste great, but i decided it wasn't so bad.  we went
 home and went to bed early.  i woke up at 2 am and puked my guts outs.
 i threw up for so long that (i'm not kidding) i pulled a muscle in
 my tongue.  dry heaves and everything.  no one else got sick, and i'm
 not allergic to anything that i know of.  
 
 suffice to say that i wont go into a chinese restaurant unless i am 
 physically threatened.  the smell of the food makes me ill (and that *is*
 a psycholgical reaction).  when i have been dragged in to suffer
 through beef and broccoli without any sauces, i insist on no msg.  
 i haven't gotten sick yet.
