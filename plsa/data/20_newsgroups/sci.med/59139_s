 i'm looking for good background and review paper references that can help me
 understand the dynamics of cytoskeleton in normal and transformed cells.  in
 particular, i'm not interested in translational behavior and cell motility,
 but rather in the internal motions of the cytoskeleton and its components
 under normal and transformed circumstances.
 
 also, i'd appreciate any data on force constants, mechanical, and elastic
 properties of microtubules, and viscous properties of cytoplasm.  any other
 info relevant to the vibrational or acoustical properties of these would
 be useful to me.
 
 thanks...
