 where did you read this?  i don't think this is true.  i think most
 medical treatments are based on science, although it is difficult
 to prove anything with certitude.  it is true that there are some
 things that have just been found "to work", but we have no good
 explanation for why.  but almost everything does have a scientific
 rationale.  the most common treatment for prostate cancer is
 probably hormone therapy.  it has been "proven" to work.  so have
 radiation and chemotherapy.  what treatments did the article say
 are not proven?
