 i have several isolation amplifier boards that are the ideal interface
 for eeg and ecg.  isolation is essential for safety when connecting
 line-powered equipment to electrodes on the body.  these boards
 incorporate the burr-brown 3656 isolation module that currently sells
 for $133, plus other op amps to produce an overall voltage gain of
 350-400.  they are like new and guaranteed good.  $20 postpaid,
 schematic included.  please email me for more data.
