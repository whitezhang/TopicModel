 but it is quite a leap in logic to observe one situation where anecdotal
 evidence led nowhere and therefore conclude that anecdotal evidence will
 never lead anywhere.  i'm sure somebody here can provide an example where
 anecdotal evidence (and the interpretation of it) was upheld/verified by
 follow-on rigorous clinical trials.

 good point.  there has been a tendency by some on this newsgroup to "circle
 the wagons" to the viewpoint that anecdotal medical evidence is worthless
 (maybe to counter the claims of those who are presenting anecdotal evidence
 to support controversial subjects, such as the "yeast hypothesis").  but
 evidence is evidence - it requires a "jury" or a process to sort it out and
 determine the truth from the junk.  medicine must continue to strive to better
 understand the workings of the body/mind for the purpose of alleviating
 illness - anecdotal evidence is just one piece of the puzzle;  it is not
 worthless.  rather, it can help focus limited resources in the right direction.
