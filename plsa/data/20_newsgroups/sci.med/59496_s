 there's always the old switcheroo.
 
 my brother works at a dialysis clinic.  they were interviewing 
 candidates for a technician job (mainly electronics tech), and a
 urine screen was part of the interview.  the bathroom was across
 the hall from a lab.  one candidate managed to switch his urine
 sample with one he grabbed from the lab.  (no one was in it at
 the time.)
 
 most inner-city dialysis patients have quite a few medical problems,
 so it was immediately obvious what had happened.  my brother 
 fleetingly considered telling the candidate, "i'm sorry but you
 are very ill and need medical attention immediately."  they offered
 him another *well-monitored* chance and he declined.
