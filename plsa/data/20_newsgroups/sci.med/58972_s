 is that true?  i know some that won't even interview fmgs.  
 most programs discriminate, in that given an fmg equally
 qualified as an american they will take the american.  what
 rights do they actually have?  does it matter if they are
 us citizens (most are not)?  we have had good luck with fmgs
 and bad luck.  some of our very best residents have been fmgs.
 also, our very worst.  as it turns out, the worst fmgs are often
 us citizens that studied in off-shore medical schools.  of the
 5 residents fired for incompetence in the 12 years i've been here 
 in my department, all have been fmgs.  3 were us citizens who studied 
 in guadalajara, 1 was a us citizen but was trained in the soviet union, 
 and one was philipina.  unfortunately, all are now practicing medicine
 somewhere, 3 of them in neurology after having been picked up by 
 other programs, 1 in psychiatry, and the other in emergency medicine.
