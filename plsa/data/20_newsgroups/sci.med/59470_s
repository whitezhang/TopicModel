 the bacteria in your gut are important.  but colonic flushes are not the 
 way to improve gut function.  each person has almost a unique mix of 
 bacteria in his/her gut.  diet affects this mix as does the use of 
 antibiotics.  a diet change is a much better way to alter the players in 
 your gut than is colonic flushes.  cross contamination has been a real 
 problem in some of the outfits that do this "treatment" since the equipment 
 is not always cleaned as well as it should be between patient "treatments".
 dental drills have me a little concerned about hiv infection and i've 
 picked a dentist that uses both chemical and autoclave sterilization of his 
 instruments(more clostly but much safer).  full sterile technique is 
 also used just like that practiced in an or(mask, gloves and gowns worn and 
 disposed of between patients).  each visit costs me 15 dollars more than 
 the standard and customary fee so i have to pay it out of pocket.  his much 
 higher fees do not drive away patients.
 
 i can not think of any good reason why someone should subject themselves to 
 this colonic flush procedure.  for very little, if any benefit, you 
 subject yourself to hepatitis, cholera, parasitic disease and even hiv.
 just ask yourself why someone might resort to this kind of treatment?
 could they be having gi distress?  could this distress be due to a 
 pathogenic organism?  could i get this organism if the equipment is not 
 cleaned properly between patients?  do i really want to take this risk?
 food for thought.
