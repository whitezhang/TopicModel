 
 
 a friend of mine has a trouble with her ears ringing.  the ringing is so loud
 that she has great difficulty sleeping at night.  she says that she hasn't 
 had a normal night's sleep in about 6 months (she looks like it too :-().
 this is making her depressed so her doctor has put her on anti-depressants.
 
 the ringing started rather suddenly about 6 months ago.  she is quickly losing
 sleep, social life and sanity over this.
 
 does anyone know of any treatments for this?  any experience?  coping
 mechanisms?  any opinions on the anti-depressant drugs?
