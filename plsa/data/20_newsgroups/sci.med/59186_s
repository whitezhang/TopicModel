 the areas that are least likely to hurt are where you have a little 
 fat.  i inject on my legs and gut, and prefer the gut.  i can stick
 it in at a 90 degree angle, and barely feel it.  i'm not fat, just
 have a little gut.  my legs however, are muscular, and i have to pinch
 to get anything, and then i inject at about a 45 degree angle,and it
 still hurts.  the rate of absorbtion differs for subcutaneous and  
 muscular injections however--so if it's a daily thing it would be
 best not to switch places every day to keep consistencey.  although
 some suggest switch legs or sides of the stomach for each shot, to prevent 
 irritation.  when you clean the spot off with an alcohol prep, 
 wait for it to dry somewhat, or you may get the alcohol in the
 puncture, and of course, that doesn't feel good.  a way to prevent
 irratation is to mark the spot that you injected.  a good way to
 do this is use a little round bandage and put it over the 
 spot.  this helps prevent you from injecting in the same spot,
 and spacing the sites out accuartely (about 1 1/2 " apart.)
 
 this is from experience, so i hope it'll help you.  (i have
 diabetes and have to take an injection every morning.)
