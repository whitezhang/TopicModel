 i've got a very nice collection of historical books on medical quackery,
 and on the topic of massage this is a recurring theme.  ordinary massage
 is intended to make a person feel better, especially if they have muscular
 or joint problems.  but -- like chiropracty -- there are some practitioners
 who take the technique to a far extreme, invoking what seems to me to be
 quack science to justify their technique.
 
 in the case of massage, there is a technique called "deep abdominal massage"
 in which the masseur is literally attempting to massage the intestines!
 the notion is that undigested food adheres to the inner surface of the
 intestines and putrifies, releasing poisons which cause various disease
 syndromes.  by this vigorous and painful procedure, it is alleged that
 these deposits can be loosened up and passed out.
 
 i just can't believe this idea has any truth behind it!  the human intestine
 is not a new york city sewer pipe!  and even if it were, you eat half of
 a small box of triscuits, and there ain't gonna be nothin' sticking to the
 inner surface of your intestine  :-)
