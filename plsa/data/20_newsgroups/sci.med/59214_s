 true.

 not really.  
 
 kirlian photography is taking pictures of the corona discharge from
 objects (animate or inanimate).  the fields applied to the objects are
 millions of times larger than any biologically created fields.  if you
 want to record the biologically created electric fields, you've got to
 use low-noise, high-gain sensors typical of eegs and ekgs.  kirlian
 photography is just phun-with-physics type stuff (right up there with
 soaking chunks of extra-fine steel wool in liquid oxygen then hitting
 them with a hammer -- which, like a kirlean setup, is fun but possibly
 dangerous).

 : organisms when better understood. perhaps not.
 
 probably not.
