 i know that there is a relationship between fibromyalgia and deep 
 sleep.  i believe that there are five levels of sleep.  i think 
 that r.e.m. sleep is the third deepest level of sleep and that 
 there are two deeper levels of sleep.  if i am in error in any of 
 this, please let me know.
 
 which level of sleep is thought to be deficient in people with 
 fibromyalgia?  are there any known sleep disturbances associated 
 with cfs?  what sleep disturbances (if any) are associated with 
 clinical depression?  do antidepressants correct the sleep 
 disturbances in these diseases?  are there any good books or 
 medical journal articles about sleep disturbances and these 
 diseases?  thank you in advance for all replies.
