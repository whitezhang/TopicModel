  new data show about 100 major u.s. water supplies vulnerable to
 milwaukee-type disease outbreak

    washington, april 14  -- internal epa data released
 today by the natural resources defense council reveals that about
 100 large water systems -- serving cities from boston to san
 francisco -- do not filter to remove disease-carrying organisms
 leaving those communities potentially vulnerable to a disease
 outbreak similar to the one affecting milwaukee.
    the epa list is attached.
    "these internal epa documents reveal that the safety of water
 supplies in many american cities is threatened by inadequate
 pollution controls or filtration," said erik olson, a senior
 attorney with nrdc.  "water contamination isn't just a problem in
 bangladesh, it's also a problem in bozeman and boston."
    "as of june 29, 1993, about 100 large surface water systems on
 epa's list probably will be breaking the law.  the 1986 safe
 drinking water act requires all surface water systems to either
 filter their water or fully protect the rivers or lakes they use
 from pollution," olson continued.  some systems are moving
 towards eventually implementing filtration systems but are
 expected to miss the law's deadline.
    olson pointed out that the threat of contamination is already
 a reality in other cities.  a 1991 survey of 66 u.s. surface
 water systems by water utility scientists found that 87 percent
 of raw water samples contained the milwaukee organism
 cryptosporidium, and 81 percent contained a similar parasite
 called giardia.
    adding to the level of concern, a general accounting office
 study released today by house health and environment subcommittee
 chairman henry waxman indicates serious deficiencies in the
 nation's system for conducting and following through on sanitary
 surveys of water systems.
    "this new information raises a huge warning sign that millions
 of americans can no longer simply turn on their taps and be
 assured that their water is safe to drink.  we must immediately
 put into place programs to protect water sources from
 contamination and where this is not assured, filtration equipment
 must be installed to protect the public," olson noted.  "the time
 has come for many of the nation's water utilities to stop
 dragging their feet and to aggressively protect their water from
 contamination; consumers are prepared to pay the modest costs
 needed to assure their water is safe to drink."
    nrdc is a national non-profit environmental advocacy organization.
