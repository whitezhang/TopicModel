 precisely.  one wonders what unusual strain the boy might be under that
 could be causing "difficulty with his behavior".  standard practice would
 be to get a second opinion from a child psychiatrist.  one would want to
 rule out the possibility that the "bad behavior" is not psychiatric
 illness at all.
