 
 can anyone give me more information regarding endometriosis?   i heard
 it's a very common disease among women and if anyone can provide names
 of a specialist/surgeon in  the north carolina research triangle  park
 area (raleigh/durham/chapel  hill) who is familiar with the condition,
 i would really appreciate it.
 
 thanks.
