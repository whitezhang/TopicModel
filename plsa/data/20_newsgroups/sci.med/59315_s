 somewhere or other i read that when a person of chinese heritage was
 told that he had high blood pressure he responded by eating celery
 (sorry, i don't recall the "dosage").  apparently this is supposed to
 work in reducing hypertension.
 
 can anyone out there verify this?  and if it does work, does anyone
 know the appropriate amounts and possible side-effects?
 
 thanks,
