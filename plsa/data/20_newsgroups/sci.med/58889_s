 the danger in philosophizing about science is that theory and generalization 
 can end up being far removed from the actual day-to-day of the grunt at the
 bench.  yes, its great to be involved in a process were i can walk into the
 lab after a heavy night of dreaming and just do something for the hell of it
 (as long as my advisor doesn't catch me - which is easy enough to do), but 
 stamping out such behavior seems to be the purpose in life of grant review 
 committees and the peer review process in general.  in today's world that's 
 what determines what science is: what gets funded.  and a damn good thing to.
 flights of fantasy just don't have much chance of producing anything, at 
 least not in biomedical research.  the surest way for a graduate student to
 ruin their life is to work in a lab where the boss is more concerned with 
 fleshing out his/her fantasies than with having the student work on a project
 that actually has a good chance of producing some results.  md's seem to 
 be particularly prone to this aberrant behavior.

 i have to agree with gary merrill's response to this.  i've read alot of the
 alu and middle repetitive sequence work and it's really very interesting, 
 good work with implications for many fields in molecular genetics.  it's 
 really an example of how a well reasoned project turned up interesting 
 results that were unexpected.
