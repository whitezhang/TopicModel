 seems to me that i read in either a recent ny times
 science times or maybe it was science news that there is
 evidence that ex-smoker's risk of lung cancer never returns
 to that of a person who has never smoked (i think it may
 get close).  i'll find the article and post it since my
 memory is hazy on the specifics - if you are interested.
