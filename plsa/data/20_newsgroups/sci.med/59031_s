 as i understood it, msg *is* natural.  isn't it found in 
 tomatoes?
 
 anyway, lots of people are terribly allergic to lots of natural
 things; peanuts, onions, tomatoes, milk, etc.  just because something
 is 'natural' doesn't mean it won't cause problems with some folks.
 
 as for how foods taste:  if i'm not allergic to msg and i like
 the taste of it, why shouldn't i use it?  saying i shouldn't use
 it is like saying i shouldn't eat spicy food because my neighbor
 has an ulcer.
 
 people have long modified the taste of food by additives, whether
 they be chiles, black pepper, salt, cream sauces, etc.  all of these
 things cloud the flavor of the food.  why do we bother with them?
 how should food be tasted?  isn't it better left to the diner?
