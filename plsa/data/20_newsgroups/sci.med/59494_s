 
 i recently heard of some testing of a new migraine drug called sumatripton
 (i have no idea of the actual spelling) that supposedly utilizes a chemical
 that trips neuro-transmitters.  my mother has regular migraines and nothing
 seems to help - does anyone know anything about this new drug?  is it in
 a testing phaze or anywhere near approval?  does it seem to be working?
 
 any information would help.
 
 please feel free to e-mail rather than take up bandwidth if you prefer.
 
 thanks in advance,
