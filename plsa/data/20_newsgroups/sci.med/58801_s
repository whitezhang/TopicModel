    i have a back machine and have had one since january.  while i have not 
 found it to be a panacea for my back pain, i think it has helped somewhat. 
 it mainly acts to stretch muscles in the back and prevent spasms associated
 with pain.  i am taking less pain medication than i was previously.  
    the folks at back technologies are very reluctant to honor their return 
 policy.  they extended my "warranty" period rather than allow me to return 
 the machine when, after the first month or so, i was not thrilled with it. 
 they encouraged me to continue to use it, abeit less vigourously. 
    like i said, i can't say it is a cure-all, but it keeps me stretched out
 and i am in less pain.
