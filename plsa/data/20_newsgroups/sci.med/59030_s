 obesssive compulsive disorder (not to be confused with obsessive compulsive
 _personality_ disorder !) is an acute anxiety disorder characterized by
 either obsessions (persistent intrusive thoughts that cause anxiety when
 not entertained), or compulsions (repetitive, ritualistic actions that
 similarly cause intense psychological discomfort when resisted).  
 
 ocd is often associated with certain forms of depression.  
 
 examples of obsessive thoughts are repeated impulses to kill a loved
 one (though not accompanied by anger), or a religious person having 
 recurrent blasphemous thoughts.  generally, the individual attempts to ignore
 or suppress the intrusive thoughts by engaging in other activities.  
 the individual realizes that the thoughts originate from the own mind, rather
 than being from an external source.
 
 examples of compulsive actions are constant repetitive hand washing,
 or other activity that is not realistically related to alleviating a
 source of the anxiety.
 
 in ocd, the obsessions or compulsions are highly distressing to the
 individual, take an hour or more per day, and significantly impair their
 daily routine and social relationships.
 
 treatments include psychotherapy, behavioral methods, and sometimes
 certain anti-depressants which have recently been found effective in alleviating
 obsessions and compulsions.
 
 the standard diagnostic code for ocd, if you want to look it up in the
 dsm-iii manual of psychiatric diagnosis is 300.30 .
