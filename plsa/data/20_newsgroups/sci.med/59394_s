 your hearing curve sounds a lot like mine (thanks, uncle sam!).  i've been
 wearing miracle ear canal aids for about 5 months now and i find them to be
 acceptable.  they are molded to the shape of your ear canal, and tuned to 
 your hearing curve.  they are comfortable to wear and almost invisible, if
 you're worried about that (although if you're currently wearing behind the
 ear models, that's not an issue).  the cost:  i paid $1200 each for mine,
 through the miracle ear counter at sears.  i've heard that there is a
 substantial discount for senior citizens, but i haven't researched that, because
 i'm not a senior citizen, yet!
 
 give them a try; you might be pleasantly surprised!
