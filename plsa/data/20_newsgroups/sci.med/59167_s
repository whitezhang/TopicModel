 first, let me offer you my condolences.  i've had kidney stones 4 times 
 and i know the pain she is going through.  first, it is best that she see 
 a doctor.  however, every time i had kidney stones, i saw my doctor and the
 only thing they did was to prescribe some pain killers and medication for a
 urinary tract infection.  the pain killers did nothing for me...kidney stones
 are extremely painful.  my stones were judged passable, so we just waited it
 out.  however the last one took 10 days to pass...not fun.  anyway, if she
 absolutely won't see a doctor, i suggest drinking lots of fluids and perhaps
 an over the counter sleeping pill.  but, i do highly suggest seeing a doctor.
 kidney stones are not something to fool around with.  she should be x-rayed 
 to make sure there is not a serious problem.
