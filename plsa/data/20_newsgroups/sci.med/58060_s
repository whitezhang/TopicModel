  well, yes.  that was a part of my point.  aspirin has its problems, but
 in some situations it is useful.  ditto stuff like licorice root.  taking
 anything as a drug for theraputic purposes implicitly carries the idea
 of taking a dose where the benefits are not exceeded by any unwanted,
 additional effects.  taking any drug when the potential ill-effects are
 not known is a risk assumed by the parties involved, and it may be that
 in a given situation the risk is worthwhile.
    like prozac, for instance; prozac has been shown to be theraputic in
 some cases where the tri-cyclics fail.  but prozac hasn't been in use
 that long, and it really isn't clear what if any effects it may have
 when taken over long periods of time, even though it has been tested
 by present day standards.  should prozac be taken off the market because
 long-term effects, if any, are not known?  imho, i'd say no.
