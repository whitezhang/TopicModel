 i recall reading in the recently revised edition of the "yeast connection"
 that there is indeed work by researchers to do this.  of course, they are
 working on the theory that candida overbloom with penetration into mucus
 membrane tissue with associated "mild" inflammatory response can and does
 occur in a large number of people.  if you reject this "yeast hypothesis",
 then i'd guess you'd view this research as one more wasteful and quixotic
 endeavor.  stay tuned.
