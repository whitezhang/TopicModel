 do i ever!!!!!!  after 2 years of having health problems that had been
 cleared up w/allery shots, and not knowing why, i went and was re-tested.
 i actually did better than when i had been tested 2 years ago....
 then putting 2 + 2 together, i realized that it all started back up
 when the laser printer came into the office.  i kept track of the usage, and
 on hi use days, i was worse.  i got better over the weekends....
 
 the laser printer is gone, i'm 100% better!!!..... whether it is the toner
 dust or chemicals, i dont know (i am highly allergic to dust...), but
 it definitely was the laser printer....
