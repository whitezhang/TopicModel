 reading through the posts about kirlian (whatever spelling)
 photography i couldn't help but being slightly disgusted by the
 narrow-minded, "i know it all", "i don't believe what i can't see or
 measure" attitude of many people out there.
 
 i am neither a real believer, nor a disbeliever when it comes to
 so-called "paranormal" stuff; but as far as i'm concerned, it is just
 as likely as the existence of, for instance, a god, which seems to be
 quite accepted in our societies - without any scientific basis.
 
 i am convinced that it is a serious mistake to close your mind to
 something, anything, simply because it doesn't fit your current frame
 of reference. history shows that many great people, great scientists,
 were people who kept an open mind - and were ridiculed by sceptics.
 
 especially the usa should be grateful; after all, columbus did not
 drop off the edge of the earth.
 
 flame off, or end sermon :-)
