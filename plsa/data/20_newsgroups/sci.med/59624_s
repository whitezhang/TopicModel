 insomnia is a known, but relatively infrequent, side-effect of
 diphenhydramine.  
 
 for most people, this does not occur.  on the other hand, most people
 can build up a tolerance to an antihistamine with extended use.
 (allergy sufferers are often switched from one antihistamine to
 another to avoid this.)
