      combined health information database (chid).  a computerized
      bibliographic database developed and managed by agencies of
      the u.s. public health service.  it contains references to
      health information and health education resources.  the
      database provides bibliographic citations and abstracts for
      journal articles, books, reports, pamphlets, audiovisuals,
      product descriptions, hard-to-find information sources, and
      health promotion and education programs under way in state
      and local health departments and other locations.  in
      addition, chid provides source and availability information
      for these materials, so that users may obtain them directly.
  
      at present, there are twenty-one subfiles on chid. the
      national cancer institute created the cancer patient
      education subfile in 1990. it serves as a resource for the
      chid user who is interested in identifying patient education
      programs for specific cancer patient populations, as well as
      for the user who is trying to locate educational resources
      available for patient or family cancer education.  citations
      include the contact person at cancer centers, so the user
      can follow up directly with the appropriate person.
  
      to access chid, check with your local library.  most medical
      school, university, hospital, and public libraries subscribe
      to commercial database vendors.

  "absence of hiv transmission from an infected orthopedic surgeon" journal of 
 the american medical association (04/14/93) vol. 269,  no. 14, p. 1807  (von 
 reyn, c. fordham) 
 
      the risk of hiv transmission from an hiv-positive surgeon to  patient is 
 extremely low, provided that the surgeon strictly  adheres to universal 
 infection control procedures, write c.  fordham von reyn et al. of the 
 dartmouth-hitchcock medical center in lebanon, n.h.  the researchers contacted 
 2,317 former patients on whom an hiv-positive orthopedic surgeon performed 
 invasive  procedures between january 1, 1978 and june 30, 1992.  the  
 orthopedic surgeon voluntarily withdrew from practice after  testing positive 
 for hiv.  a total of 1,174 former patients  underwent hiv testing, 
 representing 50.7 percent of patients on  whom the orthopedic surgeon 
 performed invasive procedures during  the 13.5-year period.  patients were 
 tested from each year and  from each category of invasive procedure.  all 
 patients were  found to be negative for hiv by enzyme-linked-immunosorbent  
 assay.  two former patients reported known hiv infection prior to surgery.  
 the examination of aids case registries and vital  records neglected to detect 
 cases of hiv infection among former  surgical patients.  the estimated cost of 
 the initial patient  notification and testing was $158,000, with the single 
 most  expensive activity being counseling and testing.  this accounted  for 37 
 percent of the total expense.  the patient notification  and testing were 
 conducted while maintaining the confidentiality  of the orthopedic surgeon who 
 was an active participant in the  planning and execution of the study.  
 notifying patients of the  infected surgeon's hiv-status is both disruptive 
 and expensive  and is not routinely recommended, the researchers conclude. \

 269,  no. 14, p. 1795  (smith rogers, audrey et al.) 
 
      the risk of hiv transmission during surgery is so remote that it  will be 
 quantified only by gathering data from multiple,  methodologically similar 
 investigations, writes audrey smith  rogers et al. of the johns hopkins 
 university school of medicine  in baltimore, md.  the researchers identified a 
 total of 1,131  persons in hospital databases who underwent invasive surgical  
 procedures between 1984 and 1990 and for whom the hiv-positive  surgeon was 
 listed as the operating surgeon.  the aids case  registries were reviewed for 
 all patients having undergone  invasive procedures and death certificates were 
 obtained.  among  the 1,131 patients, 101 were dead, 119 had no address, 413 
 had  test results known, and 498 did not respond to the questionnaire. no 
 study patient name was found in reported aids case registries. one newly 
 detected, hiv-positive patient was determined to have  been most probably 
 infected in 1985 during a transfusion.  there  was no hiv transmission in 369 
 person-hours of surgical exposure, suggesting that hiv transmission to 
 patients is unlikely to occur more frequently than once per 1000 person-hours 
 of surgical  exposure.  the researchers determined there is no evidence to  
 suggest that the surgeon failed to adhere to standard  infection-control 
 guidelines; over 50 percent of the patients  with invasive procedures chose to 
 be tested, and of those whose  results were revealed, only one person was 
 found to be infected  with hiv.  the study patient's infection was probably 
 the result  of a tainted blood transfusion received in 1985.  as a result,  
 there is no evidence that the transmission of hiv from the  hiv-positive 
 surgeon to any patient transpired, the researchers  conclude.

 unusual move, to share aids drugs and information while  the drugs are 
 undergoing early clinical testing.  dr. edward  scolnick, president of the 
 merck research laboratory in rahway,  n.j., arranged the collaboration.  he 
 said that cooperation  between companies seemed increasingly significant as it 
 had  become clear that combinations of drugs were likely to be more  effective 
 in fighting hiv than any drug used alone.  the  researchers are hopeful that 
 hiv, when faced with a combination  of several drugs requiring mutation at 
 different sites for  resistance to develop, will be unable to evolve all the 
 mutations at the same time.  therefore, several drugs taken together or one 
 after the other could halt the spread of hiv.  currently, the  drug companies 
 do not know what other drugs their competitors are developing.  the new 
 agreement allows companies to routinely  exchange animal data and safety data 
 on new aids drugs.  "an  agreement like this will greatly facilitate

 companies' ability to choose the best drug combinations much faster and in a 
 much more  efficient way," said scolnick.  he also said that the  
 collaboration would not violate antitrust laws.  in creating the  agreement, 
 merck spoke frequently to members of aids advocacy  groups, including act-up.  
 dr. daniel hoth, director of the  division on aids at the national institute 
 of allergy and  infectious disease said, "we're delighted to see the  
 pharmaceutical industry take this step because we think that  increasing the 
 information flow will likely accelerate the  discovery of better compounds for 
 aids."  related stories: wall street journal (04/20) p. b1; philadelphia

 "the next step in aids treatment" nature (04/08/93) vol. 362, no. 6420, p. 493  
 (maddox, john) 
 
      although azt was found to be ineffective in prolonging the lives  of 
 people infected with hiv, the findings do not indicate that  azt should not be 
 administered in people with full-blown aids,  writes columnist john maddox.  
 azt has been used in the united  states in asymptomatic hiv-positive people on 
 the basis that  administration of the drug appeared to abate the decline of  
 t-cell counts.  however, a report in the lancet demonstrated that azt should 
 not be used early in the course of disease.  while the cd4 counts of the 877 
 people given azt were consistently greater  than those of patients receiving 
 only placebo, the first three  years of follow-up have shown that the 
 proportions of people in  the two groups progressing to overt aids or even to 
 death were  not significantly different at roughly 18 percent.  the  
 conclusions are that azt is not an effective aids drug in  hiv-infected 
 individuals, and that cd4 cell count may not be a  reliable proxy for the 
 progression to aids in infected people.   but nothing is implied by the study 
 of the utility of azt in the  treatment of those in whom symptoms have already 
 appeared--there  is no case for abandoning that treatment, at least on the  
 evidence now available.  it is much more alarming that the cd4  count has 
 proven to be an unreliable mark of the efficacy of drug treatment in hiv 
 infection.  aids researchers should acknowledge  hiv is alive from the 
 beginning of infection and turn it into a  workable assay of the progress of 
 disease.  the general  application of such an assay will probably in itself 
 provide a  better understanding of the pathogenesis of aids, concludes  
 maddox.

 national aids control program in kigali, rwanda.  the researchers hypothesized 
 that  transmission of hiv-1 through breastmilk could be favored by the  
 presence of infected cells, by deficiency of anti-infective  substances in 
 breastmilk, or both factors.  a total of 215  hiv-1-infected women were 
 enrolled at delivery in kigali, rwanda; milk samples were collected 15 days, 6 
 months, and 18 months post partum.  hiv-1 igg, secretory iga, and igm were 
 assayed by  western blot, for the latter two after removal of igg with  
 protein g.  in the 15-day and 6-month samples, the researchers  sought viral 
 genome in milk cells by double polymerase chain  reaction with three sets of 
 primers (gag, pol, and env).  at 15  days, 6 months, and 18 months post 
 partum, hiv-1 specific igg was detected in 95 percent, 98 percent, and 97 
 percent of breastmilk  samples; iga in 23 percent, 28 percent, and 41 percent; 
 and igm  in 66 percent, 78 percent, and 41 percent.  in children who  survived 
 longer than 18 months the risk of infection was  associated with lack of 
 persistence of igm and iga in their  mothers' milk.  the presence of hiv-1-
 infected cells in the milk  15 days post partum was strongly predictive of 
 hiv-1 infection in the child by both univariate and multivariate analysis.  
 the  combination of hiv-1 infected cells in breastmilk and a defective igm 
 response was the strongest predictor of infection.  igm and  iga anti-hiv-1 in 
 breastmilk may protect against postnatal  transmission of hiv, the researchers 
 conclude.

 "firms to share aids research in global venture" journal of commerce 
 (04/21/93), p. 7a 
 
      a total of fifteen u.s. and european pharmaceutical companies  announced 
 tuesday they will swap drug supplies and information on early-stage aids 
 research to hasten the search for combination  therapies to fight hiv 
 infection and aids.  the companies said  the unusual move resulted primarily 
 from the increasing  concentration of aids research on combination therapies 
 since  realizing that hiv is likely to develop resistance to every  individual 
 aids drug.  edward scolnick, president of merck & co.  research laboratories, 
 led the collaborative effort that took a  year of negotiations to come 
 together, said participants.  in  addition to merck, the other companies 
 involved in the  inter-company collaboration for aids drug development are  
 bristol-myers squibb co., burroughs wellcome, glaxo inc.,  hoffman-la roche, 
 eli lilly & co., pfizer inc., smithkline  beecham, ab astra, du pont merck, 
 syntex inc., boehringer  ingelheim, miles inc., and sigma-tau.  the 
 participants said that all companies involved in aids drug development they 
 were aware  of had joined the collaboration, and that any company actively  
 involved in hiv anti-viral development may participate.  scolnick said the 
 collaborators would most likely meet every couple of  months for a daylong 
 scientific meeting where they will review  for one another their preclinical

 and early clinical data.  the  american foundation for aids research (amfar) 
 was pleased with  the news of the collaboration, which it hopes will lead to 
 the  development of drug combinations that will reduce viral  resistance.

 "guidance over hiv-infected health-care workers" lancet (04/10/93) vol. 341, 
 no. 8850, p. 952  (horton, richard) 
 
      the united kingdom's department of health recently followed the  advice 
 of aids experts that there is no scientific reason for  routine hiv testing 
 among health-care workers.  following recent  highly publicized reports of 
 health professionals who contracted  hiv, the department issued revised 
 guidelines on the management  of such cases.  dr. kenneth calman, chief 
 medical officer, said  doctors, dentists, nurses, and other health-care 
 workers have an  ethical duty to seek advice if they have been exposed to hiv  
 infection, including, if appropriate, diagnostic hiv testing.  he said, 
 "infected health care workers should not perform invasive  procedures that 
 carry even a remote risk of exposing patients to  the virus."  the guidelines
