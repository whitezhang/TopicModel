 what do you mean "more comfortable putting it up to."  that seems a bit
 hard to evaluate.  at least for me it is.  
 
 stare straight point with both hands together and clasp so that only the
 pointer fingers are pointing straight forward to a a spot on the wall about
 eight feet away.  first stare at the spot with both eyes open.  now
 close your left eye.  now open your left eye.  now close your right eye.
 now open your right eye.
 
 if the image jumped more when you closed your right eye, you are right
 eye dominant.
 
 if the image jumped more when you closed your left eye, you are left eye
 dominant.
