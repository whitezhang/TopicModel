 in fact adiposity 101 mentions a similar study (search for "life
 events" in any recent version of adiposity 101).
 
 the problem with anecdotal reports about individuals who have
 lost weight and kept it off is that we don't know what caused
 the weight gain in the first place.  this is critical because
 someone who gains weight because of something temporary (drug
 effect, life event, etc.) may appear successful at dieting when
 the weight loss was really the result of reversing the temporary
 condition that caused the weight gain.
