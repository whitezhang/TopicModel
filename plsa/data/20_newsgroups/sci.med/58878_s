 shades of james watson!  that's exactly the way many workers have described
 their misgivings about the human genome project.  if you take a rigid 
 definition of scientific research, the mere accumulation of data is not 
 doing science.  one of the early arguments against the project were that the 
 resources would be better used to focus on specific genetics-related 
 problems rather than just going off and collecting maps and sequence.  
 the project can't be so narrowly defined or easily described now though.
