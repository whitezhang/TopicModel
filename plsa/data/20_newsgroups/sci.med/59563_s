 
 hi sci.med folks...
 
 i would like to know anything you folks can tell me regarding lithium.
 
 i have a 10 year old son that lives with my ex-wife.  she has been having
 difficulty with his behavior and has had him on ritalin, tofranil, and now
 wants to try lithuim at the local doctors suggestion.  i would like to 
 know whatever is important that i should know.  i worry about this sort of
 thing and would like pros/cons regarding lithium therapy.
 
 i have a booklet from the "lithium information center" based at the 
 university of wisconsin, but feel that it is pro-lithium and would be
 interested in comments from the "not necessarily pro" side of the fence.
 
 i am a concerned father and just wish to be well informed...
 
 thanks for any information you can provide.
 
 please email me directly...
