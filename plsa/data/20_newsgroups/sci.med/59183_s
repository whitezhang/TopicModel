 
 great post martin.  very informative, well-balanced, and humanitarian
 without neglecting the need for scientific rigor.
 
 
 (cross-posted to alt.psychology.personality since some personality typing
 will be discussed at the beginning - note: i've set all followups to sci.med
 since most of my comments are more sci.med oriented and i'm sure most of the
 replies, if any, will be med-related.)

 they are just responding in their natural way:  hyper-choleric syndrome (hcs).
 oops, that is not a recognized "illness" in the psychological community,
 better not say that since it therefore must not, and never will, exist.  :^)
 
 actually, it is fascinating that a disproportionate number of physicians
 will type out as nt (for those not familiar with the myers-briggs system,
 just e-mail me and i'll send a summary file to you).  in the general
 population, nt's comprise only about 12% of the population, but among
 physicians it is much much higher (i don't know the exact percentage -
 any help here a.p.p.er's?)
 
 one driving characteristic of an nt, especially an ntj, is their obvious
 choleric behavior (driver, type a, etc.) - the extreme emotional need to
 control, to lead, and/or to be the best or the most competent.  if they are
 also extroverted, they are best described as "field marshalls".  this trait
 is very valuable and essential in our society - we need people who want to
 lead, to strive to overcome the elements, to seek and thirst for knowledge,
 to raise the level of competency, etc.  the great successes in science and
 technology are in large part due to the vision (an n trait) and scientifically-
 minded approach (t trait) of the nt personality (of course, the other types
 and temperaments have their own positive contributions as well).  however,
 when the nt person has self-image challenges, the "dark-side" of this
 personality type usually comes out, which should be obvious to all.
 
 a physician who is a strong nt and who has not learned to temper their
 temperament will be extremely business-like (lack of empathy or feeling),
 and is very compelled to have total control over their patient (the patient
 must be obedient to their diagnosis and prescription without question).  i've
 known many m.d.'s of this temperament and suffice to say i don't oblige them
 with a followup visit, no matter how competent i think they are (and they
 usually are very competent from a knowledge viewpoint since that is an
 extreme drive of theirs - to know the most, to know it all).
 
 maybe we need more nf doctor's.  :^)
 
 enough on this subject - let's move on to candida bloom.

 you've helped me already by your post.  of course, i believe that i have
 been misdiagnosed on the net as suffering from 'anal retentivitis', but being
 the phlegmatic i am, maybe i was just a little too harsh on a few people
 myself in past posts.  let's all try to raise the level of this discussion
 above the level of anal effluent.

 in my well-described situation (in prior posts), i definitely was immune
 stressed.  blood tests showed my vitamin a levels were very low.  my sinuses
 were a mess - no doubt the mucosal lining and the cilia were heavily damaged.
 i also was on antibiotics 15 times in 4 years!  in the end, even two weeks
 of ceftin did not work and i had confirmed diagnoses of a chronic bacterial
 infection of the sinuses via cat-scans, mucus color (won't get into the
 details), and other symptoms.  three very traditional ent's made this
 diagnosis (i did not have any cultures done, however, because of the
 difficulty of doing this right and because my other symptoms clearly showed
 a bacterial infection).  enough of this background (provided to help you
 understand where i was when i make comments about my sporanox anti-fungal
 therapy below).
 
 
 the first question i have is this.  can fungus penetrate a little way into poor
 mucus membrane tissue, maybe via hyphae, thus causing symptoms, without being
 considered 'systemic' in the classic sense?  it is sort of an inbetween
 infection.
 
 
 >steve got real upset with elaine's doctor because he was using anti-fungals 
 >and vitamin a for her gi problems.  if steve really understoood what 
 >vitamin a does in the body, he would not(or at least should not) be calling 
 >elaine's doctor a quack.
 
 i was concerned, too, because of the toxicity of vitamin a.  my doctor, after
 my blood tests, put me on 75,000 iu of vitamin a for one week only, then
 dropped it down to 25,000 iu for the next couple of weeks.  i also received
 zinc and other supplementation, since all of these interrelate in fairly
 complex ways as my doctor explained (he's one of those 'evil' orthomolecular
 specialists).  i had a blood test three weeks later and vitamin a was normal,
 he then stopped me on all vitamin a (except for some in a multi-vitamin)
 supplement), and made sure that i maintain a 50,000 iu/day of beta carotene.
 call me carrot face.  :^)
 
 hopefully, elaine's doctor will take a similar, careful approach and to
 all supplements.  i'm even reevaluating some supplements i'm taking, for
 example, niacin in fairly large dosages, 1 gram/day, which steve dyer had
 good information about on sci.med.nutrition.  if niacin only has second-order
 improvement in symptomatic relief of my sinus allergies, then it probably is
 not worth taking such a large dose long-term and risking liver damage.
 
 
 >survives.  if it gets access to a lot of glucose, it blooms and over rides 
 >the other organisms living with it in the sinuses, gi tract or vagina.  in 
 
 though i do now believe, based on my successful therapy with sporanox, that
 i definitely had some excessive growth of fungus (unknown species) in my
 sinuses, i still want to ask the question:  have there been any studies that
 demonstrate candida "blooms" in the sinuses with associated sinus irritation
 (sinusitis/rhinitis)?  (my sinus irritation reduced significantly after one
 week of sporanox and no other new treatments were implemented during this
 time - i did not have any noticeable gi track problems before starting on
 sporanox, but some for a few days after which then went away - considered
 normal).
 
 btw, my doctor dug out one of his medical reference books (sorry, can't
 remember which one), and found an obscure comment dating back into the 1950's
 which stated that people can develop contained (non-lethal or non-serious)
 aspergillis infestations (aspergiliosis) of the sinuses leading to sinus
 inflammation symptoms.  i'll have to dig out that reference again since it
 is relevant to this discussion.
 
 
 >some people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus 
 >membrane or skin bloom site.  whether this is an allergic like reaction to 
 >the candida or not isn't certain.
 
 my doctor tested me (i believe a rast or rast similar test) for allergic
 response to specificially candida albicans, and i showed a strong positive.
 another question, would everybody show the same strong positive so this test
 is essentially useless?  and, assuming it is true that candida can grow
 part-way into the mucus membrane tissue, and the concentration exceeds a 
 threshold amount, could not a person who tests as having an allergy to
 candida definitely develop allergic symptoms, such as mucus membrane
 irritation due to the body's allergic response?  as i said in an earlier post,
 one does not need to be a rocket scientist, or have a m.d. degree or a 
 ph.d. in biochemistry to see the plausibility of this hypothesis.
 
 btw, and i'll repost this again.  dr. ivker, in his book, "sinus survival",
 has routinely given, before anything else, nizoral (a pre-sporanox systemic
 anti-fungal, not as safe and not as good as sporanox) to his new chronic
 sinusitis patients if they have been on antibiotics four or more times in
 the last two years.  he claims that out of 2000 or so patients, well over
 90% notice some relief of sinus inflammation and other symptoms, but it
 doesn't cure it by any means, implying the so-called yeast/fungus infection
 is not the primary cause, but a later complication.  he's also found that
 nystatin, whether taken internally, or put into a sinus spray, does not help.
 
 this implies (of course assuming that excessive yeast/fungus bloom is
 aggravating the sinus inflammation) that the yeast/fungus has grown partway
 into the tissue since nystatin will not kill yeast/fungus other than by
 direct contact - it is not absorbed into the blood stream.  again, i admit,
 lots of 'ifs', and 'implies', which doesn't please the hard-core nt who
 has to have the double-blind study or it's a non-issue, but one has to start
 with some plausible hypothesis/explanation, a strawman, if you will.
 
 
 >if it's internal, only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty 
 >nondescript.  
 
 this brings up an interesting observation used by those who will deny
 and reject any and all aspects of the 'yeast hypothesis' until the
 appropriate studies are done.  and that is if you can't observe or culture
 the yeast "bloom" in the gut or sinus, then there's no way to diagnose or
 even recognize the disease.  and i know they realize that it is virtually
 impossible to test for candida overbloom in any part of the body that cannot
 be easily observed since candida is everywhere in the body.
 
 it's a real catch-22.
 
 another catch-22:  those who totally reject the 'yeast hypothesis' say that
 no studies have been done (actually studies have been done, but if it's not
 up to a certain standard then it is, from their perspective, a non-study which
 should not even be considered).  i agree that the appropriate studies should
 be done, and that will take big $ to do it right.  however, in order to
 convince the funding agencies in these austere times to open their wallets,
 you literally have to give them evidence, and the only acceptable evidence to
 compete with other proposals is paradoxically to do almost the exact study
 needed funding.  that is, you have to do 90% of the study before you even get
 funding (as a scientist at a national lab, i'm very aware of this for the
 smaller funded projects).  i'm afraid that even if dr. ivker and 100 other
 doctors got together, pooled their practice's case histories and anecdotes
 into a compelling picture, and approach the funding agencies, they would get
 nowhere, even if they were able to publish their statistical results.
 
 it is obvious from the comments by some of the doctors here is that they have
 *decided* excessive yeast colonization in the gut or sinuses leading to
 noticeable non-lethal symptoms does not exist, and is not even a tenable
 hypothesis, so any amount of case histories or compiled anecdotal evidence
 to the contrary will never change their mind, and not only that, they would
 also oppose the needed studies because in their minds it's a done issue - 
 excessive yeast growth leading to diffuse allergic symptoms does not, will
 not, and cannot exist.  period.  kind of tough to dialog with those who hold
 such a viewpoint.  kind of reminds me of lister...

 aren't there also other nutrients necessary to the proper working of the

 again, the evidence from mycological studies indicate that many yeast/fungus
 species can grow hyphae ("roots") into deep tissue, similar to mold growing
 in bread.  you can continue to kill the surface, such as nystatin does, but
 you can't kill that which is deeper in the tissue without using a systemic
 anti-fungal such as itraconazole (sporanox) or some of the older ones such
 as nizoral which are more toxic and not as effective.  this is why, as has
 been pointed out by recent studies (sent to me by a doctor i've been in
 e-mail contact with - thanks), that nystatin is not effective in the long-
 term treatment of gi tract "candidiasis".  it's like trying to weed a garden
 by cutting off what's above the ground but leaving the roots ready to come
 out again once you walk away.
 
 the $60000 question is whether a contained candida "bloom" can partially
 grow into tissue through the mucus membranes, causing some types of symptoms
 in susceptible people (e.g., allergy), without becoming "systemic" in the
 classical sense of the word - something in between strictly an excessive
 bloom not causing any problems and the full-blown systemic infection that
 is potentially lethal.

 also, if one is an 'anal retentive', like i've been diagnosed in a prior
 post, that can also provide more sites for excessive candida growth.  ;^)

 as i've said in private e-mail, there are flaws in our current medical system
 that make it difficult or even impossible for a physician to attempt
 alternative therapies after the approved/proven/accepted therapies don't work.
 for example, i went to three ent's, who all said that i will just have to live
 with my acute/chronic sinusitis after the ab's failed (they did mention
 surgery to open up the ostia, but my ostia weren't plugged and it would not
 get to the root cause of my condition).  after three months of aggressive and
 fairly non-standard therapy (sporanox, body nutrient level monitoring and
 equalization, vitamin c, lentinen, echinacea, etc.), my health has vastly
 improved to where i was two years ago, before my health greatly deteriorated.
 of course, skeptics would say that maybe if i did nothing i would have
 improved anyway, but that view is stretching things quite far because of the
 experience of the three ent's i saw who said that i'd just have to "live with
 it".  i'm confident i will reach what one could call a total "cure".  the
 anti-fungal program i undertook was one necessary step in that direction
 because of my overuse of ab's for the last four years.  (note:  for those
 having sinus problems, may i suggest the book by dr. ivker i mention above.
 be sure to get the revised edition.)
 
 
 >...i have often wondered what an m.d. with chronic 
 >gi distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his 
 >patients is a non-existent syndrome.
 
 dr. ivker started off having chronic and severe sinus problems, and his
 visits to several ent's totally floored him when they said "you'll just have
 to live with it".  he spent several years trying everything - standard and
 non-standard, until he was essentially cured of chronic sinusitis.  he now
 shares his approach in his book and i can honestly say that i am on the road
 to recovery following some parts of it.  his one recommendation to take a
 systemic anti-fungal at the beginning of treatment if you have a history of
 anti-biotic overuse has been proven to him time and time again in his own
 practice.  i'm sure if i commented to him of the hard-core beliefs of the anti-
 "yeast hypothesis" posters that he would have definite things to say, such as,
 "it's worked wonders for me in almost two thousand cases", to put it mildly.
 i also would not be surprised if he would say that they are the ones violating
 their moral obligations to help the patient.
 
 maybe those doctors who are reading this who have a practice and are
 confronted by a patient having symptoms that could be due to the "hypothetical
 yeast overgrowth" (e.g., they fit some of the profiles the pro-yeast people
 have identified), should consider anti-fungal therapy if all other avenues
 have been exhausted.  remember, theory and practice are two different things -
 you cannot have one without the other, they are synergistic.  if a doctor does
 something non-standard yet produces noticeable symptomatic relief in over a
 thousand of his patients, shouldn't you at least sit up and take notice?
 maybe you ought to trust what he says and begin hypothesizing why it works
 instead of why it shouldn't work.  i'm afraid a lot of doctors have become
 so enamored with "scientific correctness" that they are ignoring the patients
 they have sworn to help.  you have to do both;  both have to be balanced, which
 we don't see from some of the posters to this group.  there comes a point when
 you just have to use a little common sense, and maybe an empirical approach
 (such as trying a good systemic anti-fungal such as sporanox) after having
 exhausted all the other avenues.  i was one of those who the traditional
 medical establishment was not able to help, so i did the natural thing:  i
 went to a couple of doctor's who are (somewhat) outside this establishment,
 and as a result i have found significant relief.
 
 would it not be better if the traditional medical establishment can set up
 some kind of mechanism where any doctor, without fear of being sued or having
 his license pulled, can try experimental and unproven (beyond a doubt)
 therapies for his/her patients that finally reach the point where all the
 accepted therapies are ineffective?  i'd like to hear a doctor tell me:
 "well, i've tried all the therapies that are approved and accepted in this
 country, and since they clearly don't work for you, i now have the authority
 to use experimental, unproven techniques that seem to have helped others.  i
 can't promise anything, and there are some risks.  you will have to sign
 something saying you understand the experimental and possibly risky nature of
 these unproven therapies, and i'll have to register your case at the state
 board."  anyway, if my ent had suggested this to me, i would've jumped on this
 pronto instead of going to one of those doctors who, for either altruistic
 reasons, or for greed, is practicing these alternative therapies with much
 risk to him/her (risk meaning losing their license) and possibly to the
 patient.  such a mechanism would keep control in the more mainstream medicine,
 and also provide valuable data that would essentially be free.  it also would
 be morally and ethically better than the current system by showing the
 compassion of the medical community to the patient - that it's doing everything
 it can within reason to help the patient.  it is the lack of such a mechanism
 that is leading large numbers of people to try alternative therapies, some of
 which seem to work (like my case), and others of which will never work at all
 (true quackery).
 
 i better get off my soapbox before this post reaches 500k in size.

 i'd like to see the role of complex carbohydrates, such as starch.

 brave soul you are.  the venom on usenet can be quite toxic unless one
 develops an immunity to it.  one year ago, my phlegmatic self would have
 backed down right away from an attack of cholericitis.  but my immune
 system, and my computer system, have been hardened from gradual
 desensitization.  i now kind of like being called "anal retentive" - it has
 a nice ring to it.  i also was very impressed by how it just flowed into the
 post - truly classic, worthy of a blue (or maybe brown) ribbon.  i might
 even cross-post it to alt.best.of.internet.  hmmm...
