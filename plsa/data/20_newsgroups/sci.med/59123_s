 limits of azt's efficacy and now suggest using the drug  either sequentially 
 with other drugs or in a kind of aids  treatment "cocktail" combining a number 
 of drugs to fight the  virus all at once.  "treating people with azt alone 
 doesn't  happen in the real world anymore," said dr. mark jacobson of the  
 university of california--san francisco.  also, with recent  findings 
 indicating that hiv replicates rapidly in the lymph  nodes after infection, 
 physicians may begin pushing even harder  for early treatment of hiv-infected 
 patients.

      the center for disease control will launch a worldwide network to track 
 the spread of infectious diseases and detect drug-resistant or new strains in 
 time to help prevent their spread.  the network is expected to cost between 
 $75 million and $125 million but is  an essential part of the clinton 
 administration's health reform  plan, according to the cdc and outside 
 experts.  the plan will  require the cdc to enhance surveillance of disease in 
 the united  states and establish about 15 facilities across the world to  
 track disease.

      the national institutes of health has announced it will start  treating 
 hiv-positive patients as soon as possible after  seroconversion, resulting 
 from recent findings that show hiv is  active in the body in large numbers 
 much earlier than was  previously believed.  anthony fauci, director of the 
 u.s.  national institute of allergy and infectious diseases (niaid),  said, 
 "we must address the question of how to treat people as  early as we possibly 
 can with drugs that are safe enough to give  people for years and that will 
 get around microbial resistance."  he said any delay would signify questions 
 over safety and  resistance rather than a lack of funds.  fauci, who co-
 authored  one of the two papers published last week in nature, rejects the  
 argument by one of his co-authors, cecil fox, that the new  discovery 
 indicates that "$1 billion spent on vaccine trials" has been "a waste of time 
 and money" because the trials were started  too long after the patients were 
 infected and were ended too  quickly.  john tew of the medical college of 
 virginia in richmond claims that the new evidence strongly backs the argument 
 for  early treatment of hiv-infected patients.  aids activists  welcomed the 
 new information but said the scientific community  has been slow to understand 
 the significance of infection of the  lymph tissue.  "we've known about this 
 for five years, but we're  glad it is now in the public domain," said jesse 
 dobson of the  california-based project inform.  but peter duesberg, who  
 believes that aids is independent of hiv and is a result of drug  abuse in the 
 west, said, "we are several paradoxes away from an  explanation of aids--even 
 if these papers are right."

 "risk of aids virus from doctors found to be minimal" washington post 
 (04/14/93), p. a9 
 
      the risk of hiv being transmitted from infected health-care  
 professionals to patients is minimal, according to new research  published in 
 today's journal of the american medical association  (jama).  this finding 
 supports previous conclusions by health  experts that the chance of 
 contracting hiv from a health care  worker is remote.  three studies in the 
 jama demonstrate that  thousands of patients were treated by two hiv-positive 
 surgeons  and dentists without becoming infected with the virus.  the  studies 
 were conducted by separate research teams in new  hampshire, maryland, and 
 florida.  each study started with an  hiv-positive doctor or dentist and 
 tested all patients willing to participate.  the new hampshire study found 
 that none of the  1,174 patients who had undergone invasive procedures by an  
 hiv-positive orthopedic surgeon contracted hiv.  in maryland, 413 of 1,131 
 patients operated on by a breast surgery specialist at  johns hopkins hospital 
 were found to be hiv-negative.  similarly  in florida, 900 of 1,192 dental

 patients, who all had been  treated by an hiv-positive general dentist, were 
 tested and found to be negative for hiv.  the florida researchers, led by 
 gordon  m. dickinson of the university of miami school of medicine, said, 
 "this study indicates that the risk for transmission of hiv from  a general 
 dentist to his patients is minimal in a setting in  which universal 
 precautions are strictly observed."   related story: philadelphia inquirer

 "alternative medicine advocates divided over new nih research  program" aids 
 treatment news (04/02/93) no. 172, p. 6  (gilden, dave) 
 
      the new office of alternative medicine at the national institutes of 
 health has raised questions about the nih's commitment to an  effort that uses 
 unorthodox or holistic therapeutic methods.  the oam is a small division of 
 the nih, with its budget only at $2  million dollars compared to more than $10 
 billion for the nih as  a whole.  in addition, the money for available 
 research grants is even smaller.  about $500,000 to $600,000 total will be 
 available this year for 10 or 20 grants.  kaiya montaocean, of the center  for 
 natural and traditional medicine in washington, d.c., says  the oam is afraid 
 to become involved in aids.  "they have to look successful and there is no 
 easy answer in aids," she said.    there is also a common perception that the 
 oam will focus on  fields the nih establishment will find non-threatening, 
 such as  relaxation techniques and acupuncture.  when the oam called for  an 
 advisory committee conference of about 120 people last year,  the aids 
 community was largely missing from the meeting.  in  addition, activists' 
 general lack of contact with the office has  added suspicion that the epidemic 
 will be ignored.  jon  greenberg, of act-up/new york, said, "the oam advisory 
 panel is  composed of practitioners without real research experience.  it  
 will take them several years to accept the nature of research."   
 nevertheless,  dr. leanna standish, research director and aids  investigator 
 at the bastyr college of naturopathic medicine in  seattle, said, "here is a 
 wonderful opportunity to fund aids  research.  it's only fair to give the 
 office time to gel, but  it's up to the public to insist that it's much, much 
 more [than  public relations]."

 "herpesvirus decimates immune-cell soldiers" science news (04/03/93) vol. 143, 
 no. 14, p. 215   (fackelmann, kathy a.) 
 
      scientists conducting test tube experiments have found that  herpesvirus-
 6 can attack the human immune system's natural killer cells.  this attack 
 causes the killer cells to malfunction,  diminishing an important component in 
 the immune system's fight  against diseases.  also, the herpesvirus-6 may be a 
 factor in  immune diseases, such as aids.  in 1989, paolo lusso's research  
 found that herpesvirus-6 attacks another white cell, the cd4  t-lymphocyte, 
 which is the primary target of hiv.  lusso also  found that herpesvirus-6 can

 kill natural killer cells.   scientists previously knew that the natural 
 killer cells of  patients infected with hiv do not work correctly.  lusso's  
 research represents the first time scientists have indicated that natural 
 killer cells are vulnerable to any kind of viral attack,  according to anthony 
 l. komaroff, a researcher with harvard  medical school.  despite the test-tube 
 findings, scientists are  uncertain whether the same result occurs in the 
 body.  lusso's  team also found that herpesvirus-6 produces the cd4 receptor  
 molecule that provides access for hiv.  cd4 t-lymphocytes express this surface 
 receptor, making them vulnerable to hiv's attack.   researchers concluded that 
 herpesvirus-6 cells can exacerbate the affects of hiv.

      all health-care workers are obligated and responsible for not  only 
 ensuring that politicians understand the dimensions of  certain health 
 problems, but also to be committed to related  policies, write george gellert 
 and dale f. nordenberg of the  orange county health care agency, santa ana, 
 calif., and the  emory university school of public health in atlanta, ga.,  
 respectively.  dr. berkley's editorial on why american doctors  should care 
 about the aids epidemic beyond the united states  details several reasons for 
 the concerted interest that all  countries share in combating aids.  it should 
 be noted that while aids leads in hastening global health interdependence, it 
 is not  the only illness doing so.  diseases such as malaria and many  
 respiratory and intestinal pathogens have similarly inhibited the economic 
 development of most of humanity and acted to marginalize large populations.  
 berkley mentions the enormous social and  economic impact that aids will have 
 on many developing countries, and the increased need for international 
 assistance that will  result.  berkley also cites the lack of political 
 aggressiveness  toward the aids epidemic in its first decade.  but now there 
 is a new administration with a promise of substantial differences in  approach 
 to international health and development in general, and  hiv/aids in 
 particular.  vice president al gore proposes in his  book "earth in the 
 balance" a major environmental initiative that includes sustainable 
 international development, with programs to  promote literacy, improve child 
 survival, and disseminate  contraceptive technology and access throughout the 
 developing  world.  if enacted, this change in policy could drastically  
 change the future of worldwide health.

      every nation should tackle hiv as early and aggressively as    possible 
 before the disease reaches an endemic state, even at a  cost of diverting less 
 attention to some other illnesses, writes  seth berkley of the rockefeller 
 foundation in new york, n.y., in  reply to a letter by drs. gellert and 
 nordenberg.  although it is true that diseases other than aids, such as 
 malaria and  respiratory and intestinal illnesses, have similarly inhibited  
 economic development in developing countries and deserve much  more attention 
 than they are getting, berkley disagrees with the  contention that aids is 
 receiving too much attention.  hiv  differs from other diseases, in most 
 developing countries because it is continuing to spread.  for most endemic 
 diseases, the  outcome of neglecting interventions for one year is another 
 year  of about the same level of needless disease and death.  but with  aids 
 and its increasing spread, the cost of neglect, not only in  disease burden 
 but financially, is much greater.  interventions  in the early part of a 
 rampantly spreading epidemic like hiv are  highly cost-effective because each 
 individual infection prevented significantly interrupts transmission.  berkley 
 says he agrees  with gellert and nordenberg about the gigantic social and  
 economic effects of aids and about the need for political  leadership.  but he 
 concludes that not only is assertive  political leadership needed in the 
 united states for the aids  epidemic, but even more so in developing countries 
 with high  rates of hiv infection and where complacency about the epidemic  
 has been the rule.

         first hiv vaccine therapy trial begins in hiv-infected children
 
 
 the national institutes of health has opened the first trial of experimental 
 hiv vaccines in children who are infected with the human immunodeficiency 
 virus (hiv), the virus that causes aids. 
 
 the trial will compare the safety of three hiv experimental vaccines in 90 
 children recruited from at least 12 sites nationwide. volunteers must be hiv-
 infected but have no symptoms of hiv disease. 
 
 hhs secretary donna e. shalala said this initial study can be seen as "a 
 hopeful milestone in our efforts to ameliorate the tragedy of hiv-infected 
 children who now face the certainty they will develop aids." 
 
 anthony s. fauci, m.d., director of the national institute of allergy and 
 infectious diseases and of the nih office of aids research, said the trial "is 
 the first step in finding out whether vaccines can help prevent or delay 
 disease progression in children with hiv who are not yet sick."  if these 
 vaccines prove to be safe, more sophisticated questions about their 
 therapeutic potential will be assessed in phase ii trials. 
 
 the centers for disease control and prevention estimates 10,000 children in 
 the united states have hiv.  by the end of the decade, the world health 
 organization projects 10 million children will be infected worldwide. 
 
 the study will enroll children ages 1 month to 12 years old.  niaid, which 
 funds the aids clinical trials group network, anticipates conducting the trial 
 at nine actg sites around  the country and three sites participating in the 
 actg but funded by the national institute of child health and human 
 development. 
 
 preliminary evidence from similar studies under way in infected adults shows 
 that certain vaccines can boost existing hiv-specific immune responses and

 stimulate new ones.  it will be several years, however, before researchers 
 know how these responses affect the clinical course of the disease. 
 
 the results from the pediatric trial, known as actg 218, will be examined 
 closely for other reasons as well.  "this trial will provide the first insight 
 into how the immature immune system responds to candidate hiv vaccines," said 
 daniel hoth, m.d., director of niaid's division of aids.  "we need this 
 information to design trials to test whether experimental vaccines can prevent 
 hiv infection in children." 
 
 in the united states, most hiv-infected children live in poor inner-city 
 areas, and more than 80 percent are minorities, mainly black or hispanic. 
 
 nearly all hiv-infected children acquire the virus from their mothers during 
 pregnancy  or at birth.  an infected mother in the united states has more than 
 a one in four chance of transmitting the virus to her baby.  as growing 
 numbers of women of childbearing age become exposed to hiv through injection 
 drug use or infected sexual partners, researchers expect a corresponding 
 increase in the numbers of infected children. 
 
 hiv disease progresses more rapidly in infants and children than in adults.  
 the most recent information suggests that 50 percent of infants born with hiv 
 develop a serious aids-related infection by 3 to 6 years of age.  these 
 infections include severe or frequent bouts of common bacterial illnesses of 
 childhood that can result in seizures, pneumonia, diarrhea and other symptoms 
 leading to nutritional problems and long hospital stays. 
 
 at least half of the children in the trial will be 2 years of age or younger 
 to enable comparison of the immune responses of the younger and older 
 participants.  all volunteers must have well-documented hiv infection but no 
 symptoms of hiv disease other than swollen lymph glands or a mildly swollen 
 liver or spleen.  they cannot have received any anti-retroviral or immune-
 regulating drugs within one month prior to their entry into the study. 
 
 study chair john s. lambert, m.d., of the university of rochester medical 
 school, and co- chair samuel katz, m.d., of duke university school of 
 medicine, will coordinate the trial assisted by james mcnamara, m.d., medical 
 officer in the pediatric medicine branch of niaid's division of aids. 
 
 "we will compare the safety of the vaccines by closely monitoring the children 
 for any side effects, to see if one vaccine produces more swollen arms or 
 fevers, for example, than another," said dr. mcnamara.  "we'll also look at 
 whether low or high doses of the vaccines stimulate immune responses or other 
 significant laboratory or clinical effects."   he emphasized that the small 
 study size precludes comparing these responses or effects among the three

 products. 
 
 the trial will test two doses each of three experimental vaccines made from 
 recombinant hiv proteins.  these so-called subunit vaccines, each genetically 
 engineered to contain only a piece of the virus, have so far proved well-
 tolerated in ongoing trials in hiv-infected adults. 
 
 one vaccine made by microgenesys inc. of meriden, conn., contains gp160--a 
 protein  that gives rise to hiv's surface proteins--plus alum adjuvant.  
 adjuvants boost specific immune responses to a vaccine.  presently, alum is 
 the only adjuvant used in human vaccines licensed by the food and drug 
 administration. 
 
 both of the other vaccines--one made by genentech inc. of south san francisco 
 and the other by biocine, a joint venture of chiron and ciba-geigy, in 
 emeryville, calif.--contain the major hiv surface protein, gp120, plus 
 adjuvant.  the genentech vaccine contains alum, while the biocine vaccine 
 contains mf59, an experimental adjuvant that has proved safe and effective in 
 other phase i vaccine trials in adults. 
 
 a low dose of each product will be tested first against a placebo in 15 
 children.  twelve children will be assigned at random to be immunized with the 
 experimental vaccine, and three children will be given adjuvant alone, 
 considered the placebo.  neither the health care workers nor the children will 
 be told what they receive. 
 
 if the low dose is well-tolerated, controlled testing of a higher dose of the 
 experimental vaccine and adjuvant placebo in another group of 15 children will 
 begin. 
 
 each child will receive six immunizations--one every four weeks for six 
 months--and be followed-up for 24 weeks after the last immunization.

            new evidence that the hiv can cause disease independently
               news from the national institute of dental research
 
 there is new evidence that the human immunodeficiency virus can cause disease 
 independently of its ability to suppress the immune system, say scientists at 
 the national institues of health. 
 
 they report that hiv itself, not an opportunistic infection, caused scaling 
 skin conditions to develop in mice carrying the genes for hiv.  although the 
 hiv genes were active in the mice, they did not compromise the animals' 
 immunity, the researchers found.  this led them to conclude that the hiv 
 itself caused the skin disease. 
 
 our findings support a growing body of evidence that hiv can cause disease 
 without affecting the immune system, said lead author dr. jeffrey kopp of the 
 national institute of dental research (nidr).  dr. kopp and his colleagues 
 described their study in the march issue of aids research and human 
 retroviruses. 
 
 developing animal models of hiv infection has been difficult, since most 
 animals, including mice, cannot be infected by the virus.  to bypass this 
 problem, scientists have developed hiv-transgenic mice, which carry genes for 
 hiv as well as their own genetic material. 
 
 nidr scientists created the transgenic mice by injecting hiv genes into mouse 
 eggs and then implanting the eggs into female mice.  the resulting litters 
 contained both normal and transgenic animals. 
 
 institute scientists had created mice that carried a complete copy of hiv 
 genetic material in l988.  those mice, however, became sick and died too soon 
 after birth to study in depth.  in the present study, the scientists used an 
 incomplete copy of hiv, which allowed the animals to live longer. 
 
 some of the transgenic animals developed scaling, wart-like tumors on their 
 necks and backs.  other transgenic mice developed thickened, crusting skin 
 lesions that covered most of their bodies, resembling psoriasis in humans.  no 
 skin lesions developed in their normal, non-transgenic littermates. 
 
 studies of tissue taken from the wart-like skin tumors showed that they were a 
 type of noncancerous tumor called papilloma. although the papillomavirus can 
 cause these skin lesions, laboratory tests showed no sign of that virus in the 
 animals. 
 
 tissue samples taken from the sick mice throughout the study revealed the 
 presence of a protein-producing molecule made by the hiv genetic material.  
 
 hicnet medical newsletter                                              page 50
 volume  6, number 10                                           april 20, 1993
 
 evidence of hiv protein production proved that the viral genes were "turned 
 on," or active, said dr. kopp. 
 
 the scientists found no evidence, however, of compromised immunity in the 
 mice:  no increase in their white blood cell count and no signs of common 
 infections.  the fact that hiv genes were active but the animals' immune 
 systems were not suppressed confirms that the virus itself was causing the 
 skin lesions, dr. kopp said. 
 
 further proof of hiv gene involvement came from a test in which the scientists 
 exposed the transgenic animals to ultraviolet light.  the light increased hiv 
 genetic activity causing papillomas to develop on formerly healthy skin.  
 papilloma formation in response to increased hiv genetic activity proved the 
 genes were responsible for the skin condition, the scientists said.  no 
 lesions appeared on normal mice exposed to the uv light. 
 
 the transgenic mice used in this study were developed at nidr by dr. peter 
 dickie, who is now with the national institute of allergy and infectious 
 diseases. 
 
 collaborating on the study with dr. kopp were mr. charles wohlenberg, drs. 
 nickolas dorfman, joseph bryant, abner notkins, and paul klotman, all of nidr; 
 dr. stephen katz of the national cancer institute; and dr. james rooney, 
 formerly with nidr and now with burroughs wellcome.

                clinical consultation telephone service for aids

                                  march 4, 1993
 
 
      hhs secretary donna e. shalala today announced the first nationwide 
 clinical consultation telephone service for doctors and other health care 
 professionals who have questions about providing care to people with hiv 
 infection or aids. 
      the toll-free national hiv telephone consulting service is staffed by a 
 physician, a nurse practitioner and a pharmacist. it provides information on 
 drugs, clinical trials and the latest treatment methods.  the service is 
 funded by the health resources and services administration and operates out of 
 san francisco general hospital. 
      secretary shalala said, "one goal of this project is to share expertise 
 so patients get the best care.  a second goal is to get more primary health 
 care providers involved in care for people with hiv or aids, which reduces 
 treatment cost by allowing patients to remain with their medical providers and 
 community social support networks.  currently, many providers refer patients 
 with hiv or aids to specialists or other providers who have more experience." 
      secretary shalala said, "this clinical expertise should be especially 
 helpful for physicians and providers who treat people with hiv or aids in 
 communities and clinical sites where hiv expertise is not readily available." 
      the telephone number for health care professionals is 1-800-933-3413, and 
 it is accessible from 10:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. est (7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. pst) 
 monday through friday.  during these times, consultants will try to answer 
 questions immediately, or within an hour.  at other times, physicians and 
 health care providers can leave an electronic message, and questions will be 
 answered as quickly as possible. 
      health care professionals may call the service to ask any question 
 related to providing hiv care, including the latest hiv/aids drug treatment 
 information, clinical trials information, subspecialty case referral, 
 literature searches and other information.  the service is designed for health 
 care professionals rather than patients, families or others who have alternate 
 sources of information or materials. 
      when a health care professional calls the new service, the call is taken 
 by either a clinical pharmacist, primary care physician or family nurse 
 practitioner.  all staff members have extensive experience in outpatient and 
 inpatient primary care for people with hiv-related diseases.  the consultant 
 asks for patient-specific information, including cd4 cell count, current 
 medications, sex, age and the patient's hiv history. 
      this national service has grown out of a 16-month local effort that

 responded to nearly 1,000 calls from health care providers in northern 
 california.  the initial project was funded by hrsa's bureau of health 
 professions, through its community provider aids training (cpat) project, and 
 by the american academy of family physicians. 
      "when providers expand their knowledge, they also improve the quality of 
 care they are able to provide to their patients," said hrsa administrator 
 robert g. harmon. m.d., m.p.h.  "this project will be a great resource for 
 health care professionals and the hiv/aids patients they serve." 
      "this service has opened a new means of communication between health care 
 professionals and experts on hiv care management," said hrsa's associate 
 administrator for aids and director of the bureau of health resources 
 development, g. stephen bowen, m.d., m.p.h.  "providers who treat people with 
 hiv or aids have access to the latest information on new drugs, treatment 
 methods and therapies for people with hiv or aids." 
      hrsa is one of eight u.s. public health service agencies within hhs.
