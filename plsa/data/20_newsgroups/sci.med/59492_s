 hi all,
 
 my skin is very dry in general. but the most serious part is located
 from knees down. the skin there looks like segmented. the segmentation
 actually happens beneath the skin. i would like to know if there is any
 cure for this.
 
 at the supermarkets or pharmacies, there are quite a lot of stuffs for
 dry skins, but what to chose?
 
 thanks in advance for all advices and hints.
 
 reply by email preferred.
 
 alex
