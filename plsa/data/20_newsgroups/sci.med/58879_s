 it resistant to all creams and powders i have tried, i wonder why
 dermatologists do not use lasers to destroy the fungus. it would
 seem likely to be effective and inexpensive. are there good reasons
 for not using lasers?
 i was told that dermatology had not yet reached the laser age.

 deep ideas are simple.
                       odd groups are even.
                                            even simples are not.
