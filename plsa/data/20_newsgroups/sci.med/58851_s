    i have a new doctor who gave me a prescription today for something called 
    septra ds.  he said it may cause gi problems and i have a sensitive stomach 
    to begin with.  anybody ever taken this antibiotic.  any good?  suggestions 
    for avoiding an upset stomach?  other tips?
 
 i've taken septra.  my daughter has taken it many times for ear
 infections.  it works sometimes.  it is a sulfa drug.  about the only
 problem i found was that i'm sensitive and developed a rash after nine
 days of a ten day course.  no more septra for me.  my doctor was
 remiss in not telling me to watch out for a rash.  i was quite in the
 dark and didn't realize that it could be a drug reaction.  no harm
 done though.
