 my daughter has epilepsy and i attend a monthly parent support group.
 just wednesday night, a mother was telling how she decided to throw
 all the junk food out and see if it made a difference in her 13 year-old's
 seizures.  he was having about one seizure per week.  she reported that
 she did this on thursday (3/11), he had a seizure on saturday and then
 went 4 weeks without a seizure!!  on easter he went to grandma's and ate 
 candy, pop - anything he wanted.  he had a seizure the next day.  she 
 sees sensitivity to nutrasweet, sugar, colors, caffine and corn.  with
 corn she says, he gets very nervous and aggresive.  
 
 with my own daughter (age 7) , i think she is also sensitive and stays
 away from those foods on her own.  she has never had gum, won't eat
 candy, prefers an apple to a cookie, doesn't like chocolate and won't
 even use toothpaste!!!  her brother, on the other hand, is a junk food
 addict!  
 
 hope this helps.  good luck.
