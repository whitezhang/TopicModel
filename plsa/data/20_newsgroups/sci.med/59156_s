 
 a friend has what is apparently a fairly minor case of crohn's
 disease.
 
 but she can't seem to eat certain foods, such as fresh vegetables,
 without discomfort, and of course she wants to avoid a recurrence.
 
 her question is: are there any nutritionists who specialize in the
 problems of people with crohn's disease ?
 
 (i saw the suggestion of lipoxygnase inhibitors like tea and turmeric).
 
 thanks in advance,
