 i have been hearing bad thing about amalgam dental fillings.  some say
 the lead/ mercury leeches into your system and this is bad.  and i have
 recently heard that there is some suspicion that the mercury is a breeding
 ground for bacteria that will be resistant to antibiotics.   
 
 my dentist wants to use an amalgam filling for me in a place where i have
 two cavaties in one tooth and wants to use one filling to cover both.
 he says that composite filling don't hold up well when they are large.
 so, i would like to know if there are any other choices besides amalgam
 and composite.  and, should i really even be worried about amalgam?  i
 heard that some scandanavian country does not even use them any more- 
 is this true.
 
 any information you can give me will be greatly appreciated.
 
 
 thanks!
