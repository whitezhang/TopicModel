 if you do a medline search on "turmeric" you'll see that it is a potent
 lipoxygenase inhibitor which is being investigated in a number of areas.
 i'm in cardiology and about 4 years ago the cardiothoracic surgery lab at my
 hospital compared the effect of a teaspoon of dissolved turmeric vs. a $2000
 bolus of tpa in preventing myocardial reperfusion injury in a perfused
 langendorff sheep heart. the turmeric was more effective :-)
 
 
 a colleague of mine in the school of pharmacy (dr. ron kohen) has a paper "in
 press" on the free radical scavenging activity and antioxidant activity of tea.
