 having been gone for 10 days, i'm way behind on my news reading, so many
 pardons if i am repeating something that has been said already.
 
 i read a good book while i was away, the antibiotic paradox: how miracle drugs
 are destroying the miracle, stuart b. levy, m.d., 1992, plenum press,
 isbn:0-306-44331-7.
 
 it is about drug resistant microorganisms & the history of antibiotics.  it
 is interesting & written at a level which i think many sci.med readers would
 appreciate -- which is:  it assumes an intelligent reader who is capable of
 understanding scientific concepts, but who may not yet have been exposed to
 this particular information. i.e., it assumes you are smart enough to
 understand it, but it does not assume that you already have a degree in
 microbiology or medicine. table of contents:
 
 chapter 1
 	from tragedy the antibiotic age is born
 chapter 2
 	the disease and the cure:  the microscopic world of bacteria and
 	antibiotics
 chapter 3
 	reliance on medicine and self-medication: the seeds of antibiotic
 	misuse
 chapter 4
 	antibiotic resistance:  microbial adaptation and evolution
 chapter 5
 	the antibiotic myth
 chapter 6
 	antibiotics, animals and the resistance gene pool
 chapter 7
 	further ecological considerations:  antibiotic use in agriculture,
 	aquaculture, pets, and minor animal species
 chapter 8
 	future prospects:  new advances against potential disaster
 chapter 9
 	the individual and antibiotic resistance
 chapter 10
 	antibiotic resistance: a societal issue at local, national, and
 	international levels.
 
 includes bibliography and index.
 
 i personally found that it made very good airplane-reading.
