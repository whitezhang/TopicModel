 the case report of the first xenotransplant was published in lancet 1993; 341:65-71.
 i can send you a reprint if you are interested.
 there was  another paper, sort of a tour of the horizon, written by starzl and
 published in the resident's edition of the annals of surgery (vol 216, october 1992).
 it's in the surgical resident's newsletter section, so you won't find it in the regular
 issue of the annals. i don't have any reprints of that one.
 a paper has been accepted for publication by immunology today, though i'm not sure
 when it's coming out, describing our experience with the two xenografts done to date.
 
 
 as for segmental liver transplants from living related donors i must confess to a total
 ignorance of that literature. we are philosophically opposed to those, and i don't keep 
 up with that particular field.
