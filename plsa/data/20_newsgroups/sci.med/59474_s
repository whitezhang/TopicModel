 first off, i would consider the severity of the pain. i had stones
 several years ago, and there's now way i could have made it without
 heavy duty doses of morphine and demerol and a two week stay in the
 hospital. i was told that there was nothing that i could take that would
 dissolve them. if the stones are passible, the best thing she could do
 is drink lots of water, and hope that they pass, but every time they
 move a little, the pain will be excrutiating. i was told by my doctor
 at that time that the pain was comparable to that of childbirth. (yes,
 by a male doctor, so i'm sure some of you women will disagree). i'd
 really like to know the truth in this, so maybe some of you women who
 have had a baby and a kidney stone could fill me in.
