 i've seen people in their forties and fifties become disoriented and
 demented during hospital stays. in the examples i've seen, drugs were
 definitely involved. 
 
 my own father turned into a vegetable for a short time while in the
 hospital. he was fifty-three at the time, and he was on 21 separate
 medications. the family protested, but the doctors were adamant, telling
 us that none of the drugs interact. they even took the attitude that, if
 he was disoriented, they should put him on something else as well! with
 the help of an md friend of the family, we had all his medication
 discontinued. he had a seizure that night, and was put back on one drug.
 two days later, he was his old self again. i guess there aren't many
 medical texts that address the subject of 21-way interactions.
 
 i don't mean this as a cheap shot at the medical profession. it is an
 aspect of hospitals that is very frightening to me. docs seem to believe
 that, because they have close control of you, it's quite all right to
 take your bodily equilibria into their own hands. that control reduces
 the chance that the patient will make a mistake, but health care
 providers can make mistakes too, and mistakes can be deadly under those
 circumstances. 
 
 i grant you that sometimes there's no choice. nevertheless, i suggest
 you procure a list of the drugs your grandmother is getting, and discuss
 it with an independent doc. her problems may not be the effect of haldol
 at all. haldol may have been used validly, or it may have been
 prescribed because other medication confused her, and because the
 hospital normally prescribes haldol for the confused elderly.
 
 just my opinion,
