  speaking from experience, one doesn't need drugs to become disoriented
 during hospital stays. i was in hosp for 5 days in late jan; what with
 general noise at all hours of night, staff coming every time i turned over,
 or whatever, to check me out, i didn't get much sustained sleep at night.
 spent days groggy & dozing, and all it was from my perspective was that i
 was tired!
