 you might look for an allergy doctor in your area who uses sublingual
 drops instead of shots for treatment. (you are given a small bottle of
 antigens; 3 drops are placed under the tongue for 5 minutes.) my
 allergy to bermuda grass was neutralized this way. throughout the treatment
 process i had to return to the doctor's office every month for re-testing
 and a new bottle of antigens. after the allergy was completely neutralized
 a bottle of maintenance antigens lasts me about 4 months (the sublingual
 drops are then taken 3 times per week), and costs $20. so the cost is
 less than shots and it is more convenient just to take the drops at home.
