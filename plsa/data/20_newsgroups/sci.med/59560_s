 this is ridiculous, and your doctor sounds like a nut, if what is
 reported here is what the doctor actually said.  if your wife's
 pancreas stops producing insulin and therefore becomes diabetic, she'll
 need insulin replacement.  that doesn't mean she's "dependent" on
 insulin, anymore than she was beforehand--if her body doesn't make
 enough, she'll have to get it elsewhere.  oral thyroid replacement
 hormone therapy is the cornerstone of treatment for hypothyroidism, and
 it's really the only effective therapy available anyway.  plus, it's
 cheap.  taking thyroid hormone when it isn't needed does cause your
 thyroid gland to reduce its own production of the hormone, but that's a
 _feature_, not a _bug_, and it's irrelevant in any case in the face of
 hypothyroidism, because her problem that her gland isn't producing
 enough.  there isn't a clinical phenomenon of "thyroid insufficiency"
 caused by a sudden discontinuation of exogenous thyroid hormone
 analogous to adrenal insufficiency caused by the sudden cessation of
 prolonged administration of corticosteroids, so there should be no
 worry about inappropriately "suppressing" the thyroid gland.

 homeopathy is nonsense.  tell her to stop wasting her money, health and time,
 and get her to a legitimate doctor who will be in a position to make
 a proper diagnosis and recommend the right therapy.
