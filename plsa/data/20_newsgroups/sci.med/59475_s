 you probably were trying to be facetious but just for the record partial nasal
 obstruction is correlated with a number of chronic disorders such as migraine,
 hyperthyroidism, asthma, peptic ulcer, dysmenorrhea, and lack of libido (:-) )
 [riga in. rev d'oto-neuro-ophthalmol 1957;24:325-335], cardiac symptoms
 [jackson rt. annals of otology 1976;85:65-70  cvetnic mh, cvetnic v. rhinology
 1980;18:47-50     cottle mh. rhinology 1980;18:67-81], and fever, inadequate
 oral intake and electrolyte imbalance [fairbanks dnf. otorhinolaryngology head
 and neck surgery 1986;94:412-415).
 
 so before you post your inane comments it would be nice if you'd run a medline
 search on the topic say back to 1966. there's been extensive literature on this
 for over a 100 years.
 
 i may be in cardiology but i've had a very good working relationship with
 my colleagues from ent.
