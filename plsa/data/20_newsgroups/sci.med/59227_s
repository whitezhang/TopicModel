  nobody is saying that you shouldn't be allowed to use msg.  just
 don't force it on others. if you have food that you want to 
 enhance with msg just put the msg on the table like salt.  it is
 then the option of the eater to use it.  if you make a commerical
 product, just leave it out. you can include a packet (like some
 salt packets) if you desire.
 
 salt, pepper, mustard, ketchup, pickles ..... are table options.
 treat msg the same way.  i wouldn't shove my condiments down your
 throat, don't shove yours down mine.
