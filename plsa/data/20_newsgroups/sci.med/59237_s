 umm, weren't you the one objecting to someone who is a "licensed
 physician" being called a quack?  or is it just that being a licensed
 physician is a good defense against charges of quackery when the
 physician agrees with your system of beliefs?
 
 >lately i've seen the word "quack" bandied about recklessly.
 
 actually, i almost never use the term quack.  when i discuss
 "systemic yeast syndrome", however, i always point out that
 mainstream medicine views this as a quack diagnosis (and i agree
 with that characterization).

 really?  i bet virtually everyone reading these posts understands what
 steve dyer, gordon banks, and i am implying when we have talked about
 systemic yeast syndrome as a quack diagnosis.  would you prefer the
 word "charlatan"?  (i don't happen to think that all quacks are
 charlatans since i suspect that some believe in the "diseases" they
 are diagnosing.)

 why?  is there some reason why you feel that it shouldn't be pointed out
 in sci.med that there is no convincing empirical evidence to support the 
 existence of systemic yeast syndrome?
