                         proper channels, you might consider ther following:..."
                         [diet omitted]
 
 1) ron...what do you consider to be "proper channels"...this sounds suspiciously
 like a blood chemistry...glucose tolerance and the like...suddenly chemistry 
 exists? you know perfectly well that this person can be saved needless trouble 
 and expense with simple muscle testing and hair analysis to diagnose...no
 "confirm" any aberrant physiology...but then again...maybe that's what you meantby "proper channels."
 
 2) were you able to understand dick king's post that "90% of diseases is not thesame thing as 90% of patients" which was a reply to your inability to critically
 evaluate the statistic you cited from the new england journal of medicine. couldyou figure out what is implied by the remark "of course mds are ethically bound to not knowingly dispense placebos..."?
 
 3) ron...have you ever thought about why you never post in misc.health.alterna-
 tive...and insist instead upon insinuating your untrained, non-medical, often 
 delusional notions of health and disease into this forum? i suspect from your
 apparent anger toward mds and heteropathic medicine that there may be an
 underlying 'father problem'...of course i can confirm this by surrogate muscle
 testing one of my patients while they ponder my theory to see if one of their  
 previously weak 'indicator' muscles strengthens...or do you have reservations
 about my unique methods of diagnosis? oh..i forgot what you said in an earlier
 post.."neither am i concerned of whether or not my study designs meet your or
 anyone else's criteria of acceptance."
