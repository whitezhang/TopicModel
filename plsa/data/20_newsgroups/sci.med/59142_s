 good grief; has no one ever heard of biostatistics??  the university of
 washington (plus 3 or 4 others [harvard, unc]) has a department and
 advanced degree program in biostatistics.  my wife has an ms biostat, and
 there are plenty of mds, phds, and postdocs doing biostatistical work.
 people do this for a living.  really bright people study for decades to do
 this sort of study well.
 
 anecedotal evidence is worthless.  even doctors who have been using a drug
 or treatment for years, and who swear it is effective, are often suprised
 at the results of clinical trials.  whether or not msg causes describable,
 reportable, documentable symptoms should be pretty simple to discover.  
 
 the last study on which my wife worked employed 200 nurses, 100 doctors,
 and a dozen ph.ds at one university and at 70 hospitals in five nations.  i
 would think the msg question could be settled by one lowly biostat ms
 student in a thesis.
