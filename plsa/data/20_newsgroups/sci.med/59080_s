 my girlfriend is in pain from kidney stones. she says that because she has no
 medical insurance, she cannot get them removed.
 
 my question: is there any way she can treat them herself, or at least mitigate
 their effects? any help is deeply appreciated. (advice, referral to literature,
 etc...)
 
 thank you,
