 for one week, she probably wants to see how you react to the diet. if it
 changes anything. 
 
 you can live on the diet but you need to up your calories. where before you
 had a pat of butter now you need a medium apple (probably microwave
 cooked).  smaller meals but more of them. not terrific amounts of meat, it's
 hard to digest anyway. 
 
 for comfort and to make the carbohydrate meal "last" longer eat pasta or
 rice which give their calories up slowly rather than bread or corn. maybe
 smaller meals as you may be getting less room in the stomach area. is the
 baby still coming up. is it starting to push or rub under your ribs? how
 tight are your clothes. you shouldn't be wearing any clothing that compresses 
 your middle. be sure not to "suck in" your stomach when sitting, again it
 will put pressure on the digestive tract. 
 
 try laying on your sides, back,
 and stay in reclining positions for the many hours you are being inactive.
 easier on your legs (circulation) as well. you might try letting the baby
 "turn" or at least not be forced under the ribs during the last months.
 when you are shortwaisted it's easy for that baby to end up right under the
 diaphram, especially if you have tight abdominal muscles. if i had my
 second one to do over again i think i'd have tried to loosen up since he
 didn't turn sideways until late and the relief was enormous.
 
 
 maybe this doctor does have a thing about weight gain in pregnancy or maybe
 she just nags all her patients this way. especially if she's young. 
 but this gallbladder/whatever problem that might be coming up is something
 to be avoided if possible. 
 
 nausea, etc. can vary from person to person and with each pregnancy. my
 first pregnancy was miserable. during the second i had very little trouble.
 some articles have said that women with nausea had a statistically better
 chance of carrying their baby. (grain of salt here) 
 
 good luck
