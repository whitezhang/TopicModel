 my wife breast-fed my three boys 12 months, 16 months, and 29 months
 respectively and they are 18, 16, and 10 years old respectively.  so
 far everybody seems fairly normal.  i noticed a negative correlation
 with ear infections and length of time nursed in my very small sample.
 i do notice that the 16 and 18 year old seem to eat a lot, could that
 be from the breast feeding :-)  ?
 
 i don't understand the "unfit mother" charge other than any tactic is
 not too low down for some folks during divorce/child custody battles.
 
 most of the developing nations practice breast feeding to 3 and 4 years
 old.  are they screwed up because of it ?  would they be much better
 off if they could use cow's milk or commercial formula ?  doctors ?
