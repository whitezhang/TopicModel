 a very simple question : it seems to me that the contraceptive
 pill just prevents the ovule to nest in the vagina and forces it to
 fall every month. but it does not prevent the fertilzation of the 
 ovule. is it true ? if yes, is there a risk of extra-uterine
 pregnancy, that is the development of the ovule inside the fallopian
 tube ?
