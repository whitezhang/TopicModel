 hi,
 	i'm an avid dieter and the new miracle drug seems to involve thermo-
 genics. the drug is claimed to stimulate the brown fat to burn food 
 creating eat as opposed to the fat being stored. there are all sorts of
 warnings about fevers, elevated blood pressure and heart rate, ect..
 	the silver lining is that apparently some weight loss does not 
 require a change in diet. is this possible? are the pills dangerous or just
 hoaxes?
