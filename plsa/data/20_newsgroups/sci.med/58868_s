 unfortunately, hep b infection can eventuate in chronic hepatitis and
 subsequent cirrhosis.  although not many patients with hep b go on to
 chronic hepatitis, it does still occur in a good number (20%?) and is
 something to keep in mind.  hepatitis c (was: non-a, non-b hep) much
 more frequently leads to chronic hep and cirrhosis.  there is also an
 autimmune chronic hepatitis that affects mostly younger women which
 also leads to cirrhosis.  
 
 of course, cirrhosis is a most unkind disease.  the most dangerous
 effects relate to portal hypertension and loss of liver function. 
 patients develop life-threatening variceal bleeds and hepatic comas,
 among many other problems, as a result of disturbances in hepatic
 circulation.  less ominously, they can exhibit the effects of
 hyperestrogenemia which often characterize patients with cirrhosis. 
 these effects include telangiactasias (small red skin lesions) and, in
 men, gynecomastia (breast development).  the only real treatment for
 cirrhosis is liver transplant.
 
 keep in mind that cirrhosis is not expected, at least statistically, in
 your friend's case.  nevertheless you might want to bring up the
 subject of chronic disease and cirrhosis with the doctor.  hopefully he
 or she can then carefully explain these sequelae of hep b infection to
 you, and offer you support.
