 :) no...i was one of the lucky ones. very little acne as a teenager. i
 didn't have any luck with clearasil. even though my skin gets oily it
 really only gets miserable pimples when it's dry. 
 
 frequent lukewarm water rinses on the face might help. getting the scalp
 thing under control might help (that could be as simple as submerging under
 the bathwater till it's softened and washing it out). taking a one a day
 vitamin/mineral might help. i've heard iodine causes trouble and that it  
 is used in fast food restaurants to sterilize equipment which might be
 where the belief that greasy foods cause acne came from. i notice grease 
 on my face, not immediately removed will cause acne (even from eating
 meat).
 
 keeping hair rinse, mousse, dip, and spray off the face will help. warm
 water bath soaks or cloths on the face to soften the oil in the pores will
 help prevent blackheads. body oil is hydrophilic, loves water and it
 softens and washes off when it has a chance. that's why hair goes limp with
 oilyness. 
 
 becoming convinced that the best thing to do with
 a whitehead is leave it alone will save him days of pimple misery. any
 prying of black or whiteheads can cause infections, the red spots of
 pimples. usually a whitehead will break naturally in a day and there won't
 be an infection afterwards.
 
 tell him that it's normal to have some pimples but the cosmetic industry
 makes it's money off of selling people on the idea that they are an
 incredible defect to be hidden at any cost (even that of causing more pimples).
