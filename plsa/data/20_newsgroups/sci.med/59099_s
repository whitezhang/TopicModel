 for several years i have been dealing with reccurring corneal  erosion.    there
 does  not  seem  to be much known about the cause of such a problem.  my current
 episode is pretty bad since it is located in the middle of the cornea.  if  it's
 bad  enough, the usual treatment for it is puncture therapy.  however, my doctor
 this time is trying to let it heal by  itself  by  putting  a  contact  lens  to
 protect the area.  apparently the problem is not that common, but i'd be curious
 if anyone else out there has a similar problem, perhaps to see if a cause can be
 found.
