 my wife's ob-gyn has an ultrasound machine in her office.  when
 the doctor couldn't hear a fetal heartbeat (13 weeks) she used
 the ultrasound to see if everything was ok.  (it was)
 
 on her next visit, my wife asked another doctor in the office if
 they read the ultrasounds themselves or if they had a radiologist
 read the pictures.  the doctor very vehemently insisted that they
 were qualified to read the ultrasound and radiologists were not!
 
 my wife is concerned about this.  she saw a tv show a couple months
 back (something like 20/20 or dateline nbc, etc.) where an expert
 on fetal ultrasounds (a radiologist) was showing all the different
 deffects that could be detected using the ultrasound.
 
 should my wife be concerned?  should we take the pictures to a 
 radiologist for a second opinion? (and if so, where would we find
 such an expert in chicago?)  we don't really have any special medical
 reason to be concerned, but if a radiologist will be able to see
 things the ob-gyn can't, then i don't see why we shouldn't use one.
 
 any thoughts?
