 hmmm.  the last time i got stung by a bee i experienced the same reaction
 the first poster's brother did.  we went off to the doctor to see if i
 should worry about the fact that my foot was now about 3 times it's normal
 size.  (and itched!!!  ow!)  he basically said i shouldn't this time, but
 that bee sting allergy was not something you tended to get aclimatized to,
 but were something that each time got progressively worse generally and that
 next time could be the time i go into anaphylactic shock.  admittedly this
 was many years ago when i was young.  since then i just make sure i don't
 get stung.  i also should carry a bee sting kit with me, but i don't.  
 
 this isn't scientific or proof, but this would lead me to believe it's not a
 different reaction, just a different degree of reaction.  allergies work
 that way.  people have various reactions.  sort of like diabetes, some
 people can get by with just monitoring their diet, others have to monitor
 their diet and use insulin sometimes while others have to watch their diet
 like a hawk and use insulin regularly.  
 
 i think msg is probably similar...some people have allergic reactions to
 it.  some people are allergic to fermented things and can't use soy
 sauce...but the chinese have been using it for centuries... that doesn't
 necessarily mean that it's safe for everyone.
