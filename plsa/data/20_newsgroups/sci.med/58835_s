 in myopia the cornea is too curved.  there is too much of a bulge in the
 center.
 
 in prk the laser removes a small amount of material from the center.
 
 in rk the surgeon cuts incisions near the edge.  they heal, and the scarring
 reshapes the cornea.
 
 entirely different mechanisms, and the action is in a different place.
