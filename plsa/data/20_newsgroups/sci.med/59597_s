 that's fine.  these words have multiple meanings.
 
 as a self-proclaimed atheist, i believe that *some* conceptions
 of god are inconsistent or in conflict with fact, and i lack
 belief in other conceptions of god merely because there is no
 reason for me to believe in these.  i usually use the word
 agnostic to mean someone who believes that the existence of
 a god is unknown inherently unknowable.  note that this is a
 positive belief that is quite different from not believing in a
 god; i do not believe in a god, but i also do not believe the
 agnostic claim.
