 where are your references?  i have been unable to find studies that state
 that chromium "cures diabetese".  it can reduce the amount of insulin you
 have to take.  "high blood pressure" - i have never heard of this claim
 before.  "... anabolic steroids" - i have also never heard of this claim
 before.  sounds like you are making things up and stretching the truth
 for god knows what reason.  did somebody piss you off at one time?

 i agree with you that chromium picolinate by itself isn't likely
 to make a fat person thin.  but it can be the decisive component
 of an overall strategy for long-term weight control and make an
 important contribution to good health.  it is important to
 exercise (11, 12) and also avoid fat calories (9, 10).
 
 chromium picolinate has shown to reduce fat and increase
 lean muscle (1, 2, 3).  i will not bore you with the
 statistics.  you wouldn't believe these anyway.
 
 chromium picolinate is an exceptionally bioactive source of
 the essential mineral chromium.  chromium plays a vital role
 in "sensitizing" the body's tissues to the hormone insulin.
 weight gain in the form of fat tends to impair sensitivity
 to insulin and thus, in turn, makes it harder to lose
 weight (4).
 
 insulin directly stimulates protein synthesis and retards
 protein breakdown in muscles (5, 6).  this "protein sparing"
 effect of insulin tends to decline during low calorie diets
 as insulin levels decline, which results in loss of muscle
 and organ tissue.  by "sensitizing" muscle to insulin,
 chromium picolinate helps to preserve muscle in dieters
 so that they "burn" more fat and less muscle.  preservation
 of lean body mass has an important long-term positive
 effect on metabolic rate, helping dieters keep off the
 fat they've lost.
 
 chromium picolinate promotes efficient metabolism by aiding
 the thermogenic (heat producing) effects of insulin.
 insulin levels serve as a rough index of the availability
 of food calories, so it's not at all surprising that insulin 
 stimulates metabolism (4, 7, 8).  note that i did not say
 that chromium picolinate increases metabolism.
 
 in summary, you need to change your life style in order to
 loose weight and stay healthy:
 
   a. reduce dietary fat consumption to no more than 20% of calories.
      - eating fat makes you fat.
 
   b. increase dietary fiber
      - low in calories; high in nutrients.
 
   c. get regular aerobic exercise at least 3 times a week
      - burn calories.
 
   d. take chromium picolinate daily
      - lose fat; keep muscle
