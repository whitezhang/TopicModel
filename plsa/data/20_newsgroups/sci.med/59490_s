 ron, you are absolutely right.  not all kidney stones have calcium and not 
 all calcium stones are calcium-oxalate.  but the vast majority are calcium-
 oxalate.  calcium is just one piece of the puzzle.  i cited that nejm article 
 as a way of pointing out to some of the physicians in this group that 
 conventional wisdom is used in medicine, always has been and probably 
 always will be.  if one uses conventional wisdom, there is a chance that 
 you will be wrong.  as long as the error is not going to cause a lot of 
 damage, what's the big deal(why call a physician who gives anti-fungals to 
 sinus suffers or gi distress patients a quack?).
 
 on the kidney stone problem.  i'd want a mineral profile run in a clinical 
 chemistry lab.  balance is much more important than the dietary intake of 
 calcium.  i know that you use an electrical conductance technique to 
 measure mineral balance in the body.  i know that you don't think that the 
 serum levels for minerals are very useful(i agree).  if i can get a good 
 nutritional assessment lab setup where i can actually measure the tissue 
 reserve for minerals, i'd like to do a collaborative study with you to see 
 how your technique compares with mine.
