 no, there is something called the "delany amendment" which makes carcinogenic
 food additives illegal in any amount.  this was passed by congress in the
 1950's, before stuff like mass spectrometry became available, which increased
 detectable levels of substances by a couple orders of magnitude.
 
 this is why things like cyclamates and red #2 were banned.  they are very
 weakly carcinogenic in huge quantities in rats, so under the act they are
 banned.
 
 this also applies to natural carcinogens.  some of you might remember a
 time back in the 1960's when root beer suddenly stopped tasting so good,
 and never tasted so good again.  that was the time when safrole was banned.
 this is the active flavoring ingredient in sassafras leaves.
 
 if it were possible to market a root beer good like the old days, someone
 would do it, in order to make money.  the fact that no one does it indicates
 that enforcement is still in effect.
 
 an odd exception to the rule seems to be the product known as "gumbo file'".
 this is nothing more than coarsely ground dried sassafras leaves.  this
 is not only a natural product, but a natural product still in its natural
 form, so maybe that's how they evade delany.  or maybe a special exemption
 was made, to appease powerful louisiana democrats.
