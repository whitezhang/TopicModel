 if i remember rightly pku syndrome in infants is about 1/1200 ? they lack
 two genes. and people who lack one gene are supposed to be 1/56 persons?
 those with pku have to avoid naturally occuring phenylalanine. and those
 who only have one gene and underproduce whatever it is they are supposed to
 be producing are supposed to be less tolerant of aspartame. 
 
 the methol, formaldahyde thing was supposed to occur with heating?
 
 i don't drink it. i figure sugar was made for a reason. to quickly and
 easily satiate hungry people. if you don't need the calories it's just as
 easy to drink water.  used to drink a six pack a aday of aspartame soda. don't
 even drink one coke a day when sugared.
