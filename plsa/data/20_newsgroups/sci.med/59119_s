 dr. willian horatio bates born 1860 and graduated from med school
 1885.  medical career hampered by spells of total amnesia.  published in
 1920, his great work "the cure of imperfect eyesight by treatment with-
 out glasses", he made claims about how the eye actually works that are
 simply not true.  aldous huxley was one of the more "high profile"
 beleivers in his system.  mr. huxley while giving a lecture on bates system
 forgot the lecture that he was supposedely reading and had to put the
 paper right up to his eyes and then resorted to a magnifying glass from
 his pocket.  book have been written debunking this technique, however
 they remain less read than the original fraud.  cheers
