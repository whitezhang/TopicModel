 when i was a school boy, my biology teacher told us of an incident
 in which a couple were very passionate without actually having
 sexual intercourse.  somehow the girl became pregnent as sperm
 cells made their way to her through the clothes via persperation.
 
 was my biology teacher misinforming us, or do such incidents actually
 occur?
