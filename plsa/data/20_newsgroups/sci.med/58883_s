 t(>  how do you know that it is?  if you could show this by careful

  if you notice the question mark at the end of the sentence, i was
  addressing that very question to that person (who has a dog named
  sugar) and a few other people who seem to be of the same opinion.
 
  i would love to have anyone come up with a study to support their
  claims that the placebo effect is more prevalent with alternative
  compared to conventional medicine.
  perhaps the study could also include how patients respond if they
  are dissatisfied with a conventional versus an alternative doctor,
  i.e. which practitioner is more likely to get punched in the face
  when the success of the treatment doesn't meet the expectations of 
  the patient!
