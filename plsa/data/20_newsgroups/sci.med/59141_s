 so antihistamines can cause weight gain.  now they tell me. :-)
 is there any way to find out which do & which don't?  my doctor
 obviously is asleep at the wheel.
 
 the original poster mentioned fatigue.  i had that too, but it was
 mostly due to the really bizarre dreams i was having -- i wasn't getting
 any rest.  my doctor said that was a common reaction.  if astemizole
 doesn't cross the blood-brain barrier, how does it cause that side
 effect?  any ideas?
