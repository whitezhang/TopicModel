 
 my 14-y-o son has the usual teenage spotty chin and greasy nose.  i
 bought him clearasil face wash and ointment.  i think that is probably
 enough, along with the usual good diet.  however, he is on at me to
 get some product called dalacin t, which used to be a
 doctor's-prescription only treatment but is not available over the
 chemist's counter.  i have asked a couple of pharmacists who say
 either his acne is not severe enough for dalacin t, or that clearasil
 is ok.  i had the odd spots as a teenager, nothing serious.  his
 father was the same, so i don't figure his acne is going to escalate
 into something disfiguring.  but i know kids are senstitive about
 their appearance.  i am wary because a neighbour's son had this wierd
 malady that was eventually put down to an overdose of vitamin a from
 acne treatment.  i want to help - but with appropriate treatment.
 
 my son also has some scaliness around the hairline on his scalp.  sort
 of teenage cradle cap.  any pointers/advice on this?  we have tried a
 couple of anti dandruff shampoos and some of these are inclined to
 make the condition worse, not better.
 
 shall i bury the kid till he's 21 :)
