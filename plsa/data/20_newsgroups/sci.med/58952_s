 my supervisor is looking for a image analysis software for
 ms dos. we need something to measure lengths and areas on
 micrographs. sometime in the future, we may expand to do
 some densitometry for gels, etc. we've found lots of ads and
 info for the jandel scientific products: sigmascan and java.
 
 but we have not been able to find any competing products. we
 would appreciate any comments on these products and
 
 suggestions / comments on other products we should consider.
 thanks.
