 that's a somewhat overbroad statement.  i'm sure there are hmos in
 which the fees for lab tests are subtracted from the doctor's
 income.  in most, however, including the one i work for, there is no
 direct incentive to under-order.  profits of the group are shared
 among all partners, but the group is so large that an individual's
 generated costs have a miniscule effect.  i don't believe that we
 under-order.  then again, i'm not really sure what the right amount
 of ordering is or should be.  relative to the average british
 neurologist, i suspect that i rather drastically over-order.
