 frequently of late, i have been reacting to something added to
 restaurant foods.  what happens is that the inside of my throat starts
 to feel "puffy", like i have a cold, and also at times the inside of my
 mouth (especially the tongue) and lips also feel puffy.
 
 the situations around these symptoms almost always involve restaurants
 (usually chinese), the most notable cases:  a cheap chinese fast food
 chain, a japanese steak house (i had the steak), and another chinese
 fast food chain where i saw the cook put about a tablespoon or two of
 what looked like sugar or salt into my fried rice.
 
 i am under the impression that msg "enhances" flavor by causing the
 taste buds to swell.  if this is correct, i do not find it unreasonable
 to assume that high doses of msg can cause other mouth tissues to swell.
 
 also, as the many of the occurances (including two of the above)
 involved beef, and as beef is frequently tenderized with msg, this is
 what i suspect as being the cause.
 
 i wouldn't be at all surprised if toxicity studies of msg in animals
 showed it as being harmless, as it would be very startling to hear a lab
 rat or rhesus monkey complain about their throats feeling funny.
 
 anyone who wishes to explain how the majority of food additives are
 totally harmless is welcome to e-mail me with the results of any studied
 they know of.  i will probably respond to them however with a reminder
 of how long it took to prove that smoking causes cancer (which the
 tobacco companies still deny).

 (if i sound grumpy, it's because i had beef with broccoli for lunch
 today, and now it hurts to swallow)
