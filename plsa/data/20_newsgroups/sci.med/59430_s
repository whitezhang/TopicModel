 can anybody out there provide me with any advice concerning the
 following two health problems:
 
 first, i was recently diagnosed (using a ugi series) as having a
 schatzki ring and small sliding hiatal hernia. as i understand it,
 the hernia is a relatively minor problem, though i do occasionally
 have some nasty heartburn that is probably related to it. the schatzki
 ring, on the other hand, is causing swallowing difficulty. in particular,
 if i'm not careful about eating slowly, and thoroughly chewing food,
 food occasionally gets "stuck" before reaching my stomach. this results
 in a period of painful spasms as the food attempts to pass the obstruction.
 fortunately, the food has always managed to pass, but this is annoying,
 and causes frequent discomfort.
 
 my doctor wants to "dilate" the ring using the
 following procedure: use an endoscope to examine the esophagus and stomach
 for any inflammation, then cut through the ring and dilate it by passing
 some kind of balloon or something thru the esophagous. i would like to know
 if anyone out there has had this (or a similar) procedure done-if so,
 was it painful, successful, etc. also, can anyone  comment on
 safety, advisability, and success rate of this procedure? has it become
 a common procedure? i am kind of leery of having such an invasive-sounding
 procedure performed for a (currently) non-threatening condition such as this,
 especially considering the possible side effects (bleeding, perforation,
 reaction to anesthesia).
 
 the second issue: for the past 3-4 years i have had a large number
 of "extra" heartbeats. in particular, during the past month or so there
 has been a dramatic increase-a holter monitor recently showed 50 pvc's in 24
 hrs, along with a few pac's. (many days, there are far more than this,
 however-five to ten per hour). all of them were isolated, and the cardiologist
 indicated that such a number was "normal". it certainly doesn't
 feel normal. in the past there have also been a couple of episodes of
 extended "runs" of these beats, one of which lasted long enough to cause
 severe light-headedness. i am relatively young (30-ish), thin and in good
 health (recent bloodtests were all normal), and do not smoke, use drugs or
 caffeine, etc. i'm willing to accept the extra beats as "normal", but don't
 want to ignore them if they might be some kind of warning symptom. the number
 of pvc's seems to increase throughout the day, and with exercise (or something
 as simple as climbing some stairs). also, if i get up after sitting or lying
 down for a while, i tend to get a couple of extra beats. could they possibly
 be related to the esophagous problems? both seemed to develop at about the
 same time.
 
 thanks for any help/advice!
