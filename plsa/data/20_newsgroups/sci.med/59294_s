 hmm.  this is certainly among the things i would refer to as quack
 therapy and would tend to refer to any practitioner who prescribed
 laetrile (whether licensed or not) as a quack.  there are unethical
 behaviors (such as ordering unneccessary tests to increase fees)
 which i would not lable as quackish, but prescribing known ineffective
 therapies seems to me to be one of the hallmarks of a quack.
