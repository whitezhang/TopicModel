 it would be nice to think that individuals can somehow 'beat the system'
 and like a space explorer, boldly go where no man has gone before and
 return with a prize cure. unfortunately, too often the prize is limited
 and the efficacy of the 'cure' questionable when applied to all
 sufferers.
 
 this applies to both medical researchers and non-medical individuals.
 just because it appears in an obscure journal and may be of some use
 does not make the next cure-all. what about the dozens of individuals
 who have courageously participated in clinical trials? did they have any
 guarentee of cures? are they any less because they didn't trumpet their
 story all over the world?
 
 as a parting note, wasn't there some studies done on gingko seeds for
 meniere's? (to the original poster : what about trying for a trial of
 that? it's probably not a final answer but it certainly may alleviate
 some of the discomfort. and you'd be helping answer the question for
 future sufferers.)
