 
 hello,
 
 i am interested in trying this "desensitization" (?) method
 against hay fever.
 what is the state of affairs about this. i went to a doctor and
 paid $85 for a 10 minute interview + 3 scratches, leading to the
 diagnostic that i am allergic to (june and timothy) grass.
 i believe this. from now on it looks like 2 shots per week for
 6 months followed by 1 shot per month or so. each shot costs
 $20. talking about soaring costs and the health care system, i would
 call that a racket. we are not talking about rare amazonian grasses
 here, but the garbage which grows behind the doctor's office.
 apart from this issue, i was somewhat disappointed to find out
 that you have to keep getting the shots forever. is that right?
 thanks for information.
