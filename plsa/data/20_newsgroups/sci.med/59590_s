 i remember as a kid visiting my relatives on kauai, and one of the things
 that really frightened me was centipedes.  i'd been told they were poisonous
 and infrequently one would pop up and scare the heck out of me.  once
 one came out of the vacuum cleaner and it seemed like it was at least a foot
 long and moving at 35 miles an hour!
