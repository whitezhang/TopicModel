 if she is having problems with fresh vegetables, the guess is that there
 is some obstruction of the intestine.  without knowing more it is not
 possible to say whether the obstruction is permanent due to scarring,
 or temporary due to swelling of inflammed intestine.  in general, there are
 no dietary limitations in patients with crohn's except as they relate
 to obstruction.  there is no evidence that any foods will bring on 
 recurrence of crohn's.  it is important to distinguish recurrence from
 recurrent symptoms.  a physician would think of new inflammation as 
 recurrence, while pains from raw veggies just imply a narrowing of the
 intestine.  
 
 your friend should look into membership in the crohn's and colitis 
 foundation of america.   1-800-932-2423
 
 good luck to your friend.
