 i just went back to the chapter in cecil on chronic hepatitis.  it seems
 that indeed most cases of cph are persistant viral hepatitis, whereas
 there are a multitude of potential and probable causes for cah (viral,
 drugs, alcohol, autoimmune, etc.).  physicians seem to have a variety of
 "thresholds" for electing to biopsy someone's liver.  personally, i think
 that if the patient is asymptomatic, with only slight transaminitis and
 normal albumin and pt, one can simply follow them closely and not add the
 potential risks of a biopsy.  others may well biopsy such a patient, thus
 providing these samples for study.  it would be interesting to see if
 anyone's done any decision analysis on this.
