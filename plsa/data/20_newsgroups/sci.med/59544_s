 hi.
 
 my wife has aquired some thyroidal (sp?) deficiency over the past year
 that gives symptoms such as needing much sleep, coldness and proneness
 to gaining weight. she has been to a doctor and taken the ordinary (?)
 tests and her values were regarded as low. the doctor (and my wife) are
 not very interested in starting medication as this "deactivates" the 
 gland, giving life-long dependency to the drug (hormone?). the last couple of 
 monthes she has been seeing a hoemoepath (sp?) and been given
 some drops to re-activate either her thyroidal gland and/or the 
 'message-center' in the brain (sorry about the approximate language,
 but i haven't got many clues to what the english terms are, but the 
 brain-area is called the 'hypofyse' in norwegian.) 
 
 my questions are: has anyone had/heard of success in using this approach?
 her values have been (slowly but) steadily sinking, any comment on the
 probability of improvement? although the doctor has told her to 'eat
 normally', my wife has dieted vigorously to keep her weight as she feels
 that is part of keeping an edge over the illness/condition, may this
 affect the treatment, development?
 
 i can get the exact figures for her tests for anyone interested, and i
 will greatly value any information/opinion/experience on this topic.
 
 i don't intend this post to be either a flaming of the established
 medical profession or a praise for alternatives, i am just relaying
 events as they have happened.
 
 sincerely,
 
 erik a. wolff
