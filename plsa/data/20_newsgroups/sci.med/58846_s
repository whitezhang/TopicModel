 endometriosis is where cells that would normally be lining the uteris exist
 outside the uteris.  sometimes this causes problems, often it doesn't.
 there is generally no need to remove pockets of endometriosis unless they are
 causing other problems.  one lady i know had endometriosis in an ovary.  
 this caused her a _great_ deal of pain.  another lady i know has an     
 endometrial cyst in her abdominal wall; she is not having it removed.
 
 the american fertility society has information on this and they probably 
 maintain a list of physicians in all parts of the continent that deal with
 endometriosis.  you can reach them at:
