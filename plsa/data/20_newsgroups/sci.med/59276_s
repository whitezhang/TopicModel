 the original poster did not say why his mother had been in hospital
 but i can answer a few general points.
 
 elderly patients may exhibit a marked difficulty in coping after
 being in hospital for a few days. the drastic change of environment
 will often unmask how marginally they have been coping at home. even
 young people find the change unsettling.
 
 though we have thought that this decrement in function after - say -
 anaesthesia and surgery for a fractured hip (a common event in the
 elderly) was due to anaesthesia there is good evidence that the
 change of situation is much more important. some hospitals have
 tried a 'rapid transit' system for hip fractures, aiming to have the
 patient back at home within 24 hours of admission. the selection of
 the anaesthetic has no effect on the ability to discharge these
 patients early.
 
 anaesthetists who work with the elderly (which is almost all of us)
 generally take care to tailor the choice and dose of drugs used to
 the individual patient. even so, there is some evidence that full
 mental recovery may take a surprisingly long time to return. this is
 the sort of thing which is detected by setting quite difficult
 tasks, not the gross change that the original poster noted.
 
 haloperidol (haldol tm) is a long acting drug. the plasma half life
 of the drug is up to 35 hours. if the decanoate (a sort of slow
 release formulation) is used it may be weeks. the elderly are
 sensitive to haloperidol for a number of reasons. without knowing
 more it is hard to comment.
