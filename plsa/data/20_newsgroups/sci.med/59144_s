 my husband woke up three days ago with a small sore spot
 (a spot about the size of a nickel) on one of his testicles. bottom side,
 no knots or lumps, just a little sore spot.  he says it reminds him of 
 how a bruise feels.  he has no recollection of hitting it or anything like
 that that would cause a bruise. (he asssures me he'd remember something
 like that :-) 
 
 any clues as to what it might be?  he's somewhat of a hypochondriac (sp?)
 so he's sure he's gonna die. . .
 
 thanks!!
