 candida can do that to you. :-)  gordon, i think that the best clinical 
 trial for candida blooms would involve giving women with chronic vaginal 
 candida blooms l. acidophilus orally and see it it can decrease the 
 frequency and extent of candida blooms in the vagina since most of the 
 candida seems to be migrating in from the anal region and l. acidophilus 
 should be able keep the candida in check if it can make it through the 
 intestinal tract and colonize in the anus where it will have access to 
 oxygen(just like it does in the vagina).  as much stuff as there is in the 
 lay press about l. acidophilus and vaginal yeast infections, i'm really 
 amazed that someone has not done a clinical trial yet to check it out.
 
 
 the calcium and kidney stone story is not a good reason to throw all 
 conventional wisdom out the window.  where would medicine be if 
 conventional wisdom had not been used to develop many of the standard 
 medical practices that could not be confirmed through clinical trials?
 the clinical trial is a very new arrival on the medical scene(and a very 
 important one).  the lack of proof that reinnoculation with good bacteria 
 after antibiotic use is important to the health of a patient is no reason 
 to dismiss it out-of-hand, especially if reinnoculation can be done cleaply 
 and safely(like it is in animal husbandry).
