 as you note, the research is mixed, so there is no consensus on the
 role of fatty acids in ulcerative colitis.  there is a role for short
 chain fatty acids in patients with colostomies and rectal pouches
 that are inflammed (short is butyrate and shorter).  there may be a role
 for treatment of uc with short chain fatty acids, and i am looking 
 forward to the upcoming aga meeting in boston to see what people are
 doing.  
 
 you raise a hypothesis about the studies and restriction of other
 fatty acids.  you should contact the authors directly about that or
 even write a letter to the editor - it is a good point.  by the way,
 the abbreviation epa is not in general use, so i do not know what 
 fatty acid you are speaking about.
 
 and to brian an u of c ---  there is a physician named stephen hanauer
 there who is a recognized expert in the treatment of ibd.  you might 
 give him a call.  he is interested in new combinations of drugs for 
 the treatment of ibd.  if you call please say hello to him from me,
 i was looking at u of c for a position, and perhaps still am.  and
 be sure to look into joining the ccfa.
 
 best of luck.
