 hello,
 
 i am writing a grant proposal for a developmental genetics class and i
 have chose to look at the neurofibromatosis 1 gene and its variable
 expressivity.  i am curious what has already been done on this subject,
 especially the relationship between specific mutations and the resulting
 phenotype.  my literature search has produce many references, but i want to
 make sure i am proposing new research.  if anyone knows aything that has been
 recently or key peopl doing research to search for using medline, i would
 apprciate being informed.
 
 thank you.
