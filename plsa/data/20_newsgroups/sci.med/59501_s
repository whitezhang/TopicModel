 before more bandwidth gets wasted on this:
 
 i apologize for my flame.
 
 first, because i distributed the message to so many newsgroups; i did
        not check the crosspostings of the article i followed up on.
 
 second, for not making my argument clear enough. i reacted to the tone
         of many of the anti-kirlian posts, not to their content. right
         or wrong, i found the arguments set in arrogant and sneering words
         (that includes "jokes"), which i still think is unwarranted.
 
 and, obviously, i should not have done the same.
