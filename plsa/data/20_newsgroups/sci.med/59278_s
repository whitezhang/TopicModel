 i got this recipe from a watier on the greek island of samos.
 they use it as a spread for bread there butit is excellent on
 gyro's as well. by the way, the actual name is tzatziki.
 here is the recipe:
 
 yoghurt, chopped garlic, peeled chopped cucumber, salt, white
 pepper, a little olive oil and a little vinegar.
 
 i would love to hear of any other good greek recipes out there.
