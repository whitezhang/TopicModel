 
 
 i attended high school in the san jose, california area in the early 1980's,
 and i remember a (smallish) outbreak of a strange illness, in which
 people developed measles-like spots on their bodies.  this condition
 seemed to last only a few days, and i don't recall anyone reporting any other
 symptoms.  i seem to recall reading somewhere that this was believed to have
 been viral in nature, but i don't know for sure.
 
 however, i have been curious since then about this.
 
 anyone have any ideas about what this might have been?
