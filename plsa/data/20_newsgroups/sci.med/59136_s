 yes.
  
 >have you used it for cfs?
  
 it seems to work equally well for cfs, another hint that these may be
 different facets of the same underlying process.
  
 >have you gotten good results with it?
  
 yes.  the benefit is usually evident within a few days of starting it.
 most of the patients for whom it has worked well continued low-dose
 amitriptyline, daily aerobic excersise, and a regular sleep schedule
 (current standard therapy).  because of the cost (usually > $150/mo.,
 depending on dose) and potential for significant side effects like
 corneal injury and birth defects, i currently reserve it for those who
 fail conventional treatment.  it is important that the person
 prescribing it have some experience with it and follow the patient
 closely.

 as far as i know, i am the only person looking at it currently.  i
 should get off my duff and finish writing up some case reports.  i'm not
 an academic physician, so i don't feel the pressure to publish or perish
 and i don't have the time during the work day for such things.
