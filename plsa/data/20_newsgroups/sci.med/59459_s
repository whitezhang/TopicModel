 my opinion(for what it's worth) is that 40 x-rays is *way* too many.  
 guidleines have been set on the number of dental x-rays and chest x-rays 
 that one should have over a given period of time because of all the 
 environmental factors that can cause cancer in humans, ionizing radiation 
 is one of the most potent(splits dna and causes hydroxyl free radical 
 formation in tissue cells).  ultasound(like that used in seeing the fetus 
 in the uterus) has been shown to be extremely good at picking up tumors 
 in the prostate and gallstones in the gallbladder.  but kidney tissue may 
 be too dense for ultrasound to work for kidney stones(any radiologists care 
 to comment?).
 
 most stones will pass(but it's a very painful process).  unlike gallstones, 
 i don't think that there are many drugs that can help "dissolve" the 
 kidney stone(which is probably calcium-oxalate).  vitamin c and magnesium 
 have worked in rabbits to remove calcium from calcified plaques in the 
 aterial wall.  i have no idea if a diet change or supplementation could 
 speed up the process of kidney stone passage(but i'm pretty confident that 
 a diet change and/or supplementation can prevent a reoccurance).  if surgery 
 is being contemplated, the stone must be in the kidney tubule.  a second 
 opinion is a good idea because there are better(less damaging) ways to break 
 up the stone if it's logged within the kidney(sonic blasts).  hmo's are 
 notorious for conservative care and long waits for expensvie treatments.  
 my condolences to your friend.
