 and also better, because a neurologist can make a differential
 diagnosis between migraine, tension-type headache, cluster, benign
 intracranial hypertension, chronic paroxysmal hemicrania, and other
 headache syndromes that all appear normal on a scan.  a neurologist
 can also recommend a course of treatment that is appropriate to the
 diagnosis.

 sigh.  it may never be justifiable, but i sometimes do it.  even
 after i try to show thoroughness with a detailed history, neurologic
 examination, and discussion with the patient about my diagnosis,
 salted with lots of reassurance, patients still ask "why can't you
 order a scan, so we can be absolutely sure?"  aunt millie often gets
 into the conversation, as in "they ignored aunt millie's headaches
 for years", and then she died of a brain tumor, aneurysm, or
 whatever.  if you can get away without ever ordering imaging for a
 patient with an obviously benign headache syndrome, i'd like to hear
 what your magic is.
 
 every once in a while i am able to bypass imaging by getting an eeg.
 mind you, i don't think eeg is terribly sensitive for brain tumor,
 but the patient feels like "something is being done" (as if the
 hours i spent talking with and examining the patient were
 "nothing"), the eeg has no ionizing radiation, it's *much* cheaper
 than ct or mri, and the eeg brings in some money to my department.
