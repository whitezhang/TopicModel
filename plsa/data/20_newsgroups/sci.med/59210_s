 i was there in 1976.  i suppose it must have died out since 1946,
 then.  certainly i never heard of any homeopaths or herbalists in
 the employ of the nhs.  perhaps the law codified it but the authorities
 refused to hire any homeopaths.  a similar law in the us allows
 chiropractors to practice in va hospitals but i've never seen one
 there and i don't know of a single va that has hired a chiropractor.
 there are a lot of britons on the net, so someone should be able to
 tell us if the nhs provides homeopaths for you.
