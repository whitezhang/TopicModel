 i don't think there is a general distinction.  rather, there are
 two classes of chronic hepatitis: chronic active hepatitis and chronic
 persistent hepatitis.  i can't think of any other disease where the
 term persistent is used with or in preference to chronic.
 
 much as these two terms "chronic active" and "chronic persistent"
 sound fuzzy, the actual distinction between the two conditions
 is often fairly fuzzy as well.
