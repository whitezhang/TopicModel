 
 i am writing this to find out the following:
 
 1.)	any information on surgery to prevent reflux esophagitis.
 
 2.)	the name(s) of a doctor(s) who specialize in such surgery.
 
 3.)	information on reflux esophagitis which leads to cancer.
 
 my boyfriend, age 34 and otherwise in good health, was diagnosed with 
 reflux esophagitis and a hiatal hernia about 2 years ago.  at that time he 
 saw a gastroenterologist and has tried acid controllers (mylanta, 
 tagamet), as well as a restricted diet and raising the head of his bed.  
 these treatments were not effective and because the damage was 
 worsening, he opted for a surgical repair 3 months ago.  he was told 
 there were two repair techniques that could fix the problem; a nissen 
 wrap and a "hill repair".  he opted for the "hill repair". he recovered 
 very well from the surgery itself but the pain he had originally is worse 
 and in addition he now has trouble swallowing (including saliva).
 
 the doctor now wants to do an endoscopy and has also informed him 
 that a biopsy might be necessary if he has a pre-cancerous condition 
 which he called "barrett's syndrome". if he can't avoid having reflux will 
 he necessarily get cancer?
 
 basically, if anyone has any information on what he should do now, i'd 
 appreciate it.
 
 thanks,
