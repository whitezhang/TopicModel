 melissa, there is a simpler procedure called a "dorsal slit" that is
 really the first step of the usual circumcision.  it is simpler and
 quicker, but the pain is about the same as circumcision after the
 anesthetic wears off and the aesthetic result post healing is not as
 good.  see your friendly urologist for more details.
