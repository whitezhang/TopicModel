 i don't know anything specifically, but i have one further anecdote. a
 colleague of mine had a child with a serious congenital disease, tuberous
 sclerosis. along with mental retardation comes a serious seizure disorder.
 the parents noticed that one thing that would precipitate a seizure was
 a meal with corn in it. i have always wondered about the connection, and
 further about other dietary ingredients that might precipitate seizures.
 other experiences would be interesting to hear about from netters.
