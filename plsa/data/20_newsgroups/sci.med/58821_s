 
 	i was kind of half watching street stories last night
 	and one of the segments was about this doctor in
 	s.f. who provides a service of investigating treatment
 	for various diseases. i'm pretty sure his name is
 	dr. mark renniger (sp?) or close to that. 
 	did anyone else watch this? i'd like to get his
 	correct name and address/phone number if possible.
 	thanks.
