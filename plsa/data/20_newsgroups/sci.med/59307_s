 one possible reason is that file' is made with sassafras leaves, while root
 beer was made with sassafras bark or root bark.  the leaves contain either
 no
 or less saffrole than the bark.
 
 there is also some sort of treatment which putatively removes saffrole from
 sassafras products.  i have some concentrated sassafras tea extract which
 is
 claimed to have the saffrole removed.

 well, the last time that i went to the store to buy sassafras bark to make 
 root beer, there was a sign saying that it wasn't sold for human
 consumption.
 also, when i asked the person if they had wild cherry bark and wintergreen
 bark,
 she made a point of telling me that i couldn't buy sassafras for human 
 consumption.
 
 i find the fact that some people reckless enough to step into an automobile
 live
 in fear of dropping dead because of a pork rib quite funny, in a sick way.
