 no, he does not exclusively treat ld patients.  however, in some parts of the
 country, you don't need to be known as an ld "specialist" to see a large
 number of ld patients walk through your office.  given the huge problem of
 underdiagnosis, orthopedists encounter late manifestations of the disease just
 about every day in their regular practices.  dr. n. told me that last year,
 he sent between 2 and 5 patients a week to the ld specialists... and he is not
 the only orthopedists in the town.
 
 let's say that only 2 people per week actually have ld.  that means at the
 *very minimum* 104 people in our town (and immediate area) develop late stage
 manifestations of ld *every year*.  add in the folks who were diagnosed by
 neurologists, rheumatologists, gps, etc, and you can see what kind of problem
 we have.  no wonder just about everybody in town personally knows an ld
 patient.
 
 he refers most patients to ld specialists, but in extreme cases he puts the
 patient on medication immediately to minimize the damage (in most cases, to
 the knees).
 
 gordon is correct when he states that most ld specialists are gps.
