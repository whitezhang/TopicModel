 "there's no cure for stupidity of poll on doctors' salaries"
 
 by mike royko

      on a stupidity scale, a recent poll about doctors' earnings 
 is right up there.  it almost scored a perfect brain-dead 10.
      it  was  commissioned by some whiny consumers  group  called 
 families usa.
       the  poll tells us that the majority of  americans  believe 
 that doctors make too much money.
      the  pollsters  also asked what a fair income would  be  for 
 physicians.  those polled said, oh, about $80,000 a year would be 
 ok.
      how generous.  how sporting.  how stupid.
      why is this poll stupid?   because it is based on resentment 
 and envy, two emotions that ran hot during the political campaign 
 and are still simmering.
      you could conduct the same kind of poll about any group that 
 earns $100,000-plus and get the same results.  since the majority 
 of americans don't make those bucks,  they assume that those  who 
 do are stealing it from them.
      maybe  the berlin wall came down,  but don't  kid  yourself.  
 karl marx lives.
      it's also stupid because it didn't ask key  questions,  such 
 as:  do  you  know how much education and training  it  takes  to 
 become a physician?
      if those polled said no,  they didn't know, then they should 
 have  been disqualified.   if they gave the wrong  answers,  they 
 should have been dropped.   what good are their views on how much 
 a doctor should earn if they don't know what it takes to become a 
 doctor?
      or maybe a question should have been phrased this way:  "how 
 much  should  a person earn if he or she must (a)  get  excellent 
 grades and a fine educational foundation in high school in  order 
 to (b) be accepted by a good college and spend four years  taking 
 courses heavy in math, physics, chemistry, and other lab work and 
 maintain a 3.5 average or better,  and (c) spend four more  years 
 of  grinding study in medical school,  with the third and  fourth 
 years in clinical training,  working 80 to 100 hours a week,  and 
 (d) spend another year as a low-pay,  hard-work intern,  and  (e) 
 put  in  another  three to 10 years  of  post-graduate  training, 
 depending  on  your specialty and (f) maybe wind up  $100,000  in 
 debt  after  medical school and (g) then work an  average  of  60 
 hours  a week,  with many family doctors putting in 70  hours  or 
 more until they retire or fall over?"
      as  you have probably guessed by now,  i  have  considerably 
 more  respect for doctors than does the law firm of  clinton  and 
 clinton,  and all the lawyers and insurance executives they  have 
 called together to remake america's health care.
      based  on what doctors contribute to society,  they are  far 
 more useful than the power-happy,  ego-tripping, program-spewing, 
 social tinkerers who will probably give us a medical plan that is 
 to health what clinton's first budget is to frugality.
      but propaganda works.   and,  as the stupid poll  indicates, 
 many americans wrongly believe that profiteering doctors are  the 
 major cause of high medical costs.
      of  course doctors are well-compensated.   they  should  be.  
 americans now live longer than ever.   but who is responsible for 
 our longevity--lawyers,  congress, or the guy flipping burgers in 
 a mcdonald's?
      and the doctors prolong our lives despite our having  become 
 a  nation  of  self-indulgent,   lard-butted,   tv-gaping   couch 
 cabbages.
      ah,  that  is not something you heard president  clinton  or 
 super  spouse  talk  about during the  campaign  or  since.   but 
 instead of trying to turn the medical profession into a  villain, 
 they might have been more honest if they had said:
      "let  us  talk  about medical care and one  of  the  biggest 
 problems we have.   that problem is you, my fellow american. yes, 
 you,  eating  too much and eating the wrong foods;  many  of  you 
 guzzling  too  much hooch;  still puffing away at $2.50  a  pack; 
 getting  your daily exercise by lumbering from the fridge to  the 
 microwave to the couch; doing dope and bringing crack babies into 
 the  world;  filling  the big city emergency rooms  with  gunshot 
 victims;  engaging  in unsafe sex and catching a  deadly  disease 
 while blaming the world for not finding an instant cure.
      "you  and  your habits,  not the  doctors,  are  the  single 
 biggest  health  problem in this country.   if  anything,  it  is 
 amazing that the docs keep you alive as long as they do.
      "in fact,  i don't understand how they can stand looking  at 
 your blubbery bods all day.
      "so as your president,  i call upon you to stop whining  and 
 start living cleanly.   now i must go get myself a triple cheesy-
 greasy with double fries.  do as i say, not as i do."
      but  for those who truly believe that doctors are  overpaid, 
 there is another solution: don't use them.
      that's right.   you don't feel well?   then try one of those 
 spine poppers,  needle twirlers, or have rev. bubba lay his hands 
 upon your head and declare you fit.
      or  there is the do-it-yourself approach.   you  have  chest 
 pains?   then sit in front of a mirror,  make a slit here, a slit 
 there, and pop in a couple of valves.
      you're  going to have a kid?   why throw your money at  that 
 overpaid  sawbones so he can buy a better car and a bigger  house 
 than  you  will  ever  have  (while  paying  more  in  taxes  and 
 malpractice insurance than you will ever earn)?
      just have the kid the old-fashioned way.   squat and do  it.  
 and if it survives,  you can go to the library and find a book on 
 how to give it its shots.
      by  the  way,  has  anyone  ever done a  poll  on  how  much 
 pollsters should earn?
