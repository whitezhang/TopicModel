 
 my insurance company encourages annual physicals, and at my age [42] i'm
 thinking that biannual physicals, at least, might be a good idea.  therefore,
 i'm shopping for a gp.  might as well get a good one.
 
 could the assembled net wisdom suggest things i should look for, or point me to
 the faq archive if on this topic if there is one?  
 
 please email; i suspect that this topic is real net clutter bait.
