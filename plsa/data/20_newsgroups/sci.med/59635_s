 i've seen children do this and wondered about something.  if the
 mucus in one's nose collects (filters) particles going into the
 airway, if a child then picks and ingests this material, might
 it have a vaccinatory effect, since if the body ingests airborne
 diseases or other 'stuff' on the mucus, the body might generate
 antibodies for this small "invasion"?
 
 maybe this is why some children don't get sick very often? :-)
