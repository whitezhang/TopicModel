 sumatriptan(imitrex) just became available in the us in a subcutaneous
 injectable form.  is there an oral form available in ca?  a friend(yes
 really not me!)  has severe migranes about 2-3 times per week.  we
 live right by the ca border and he has gotten drugs for gerd prescribed
 by a us physician and filled in a ca pharmacy, but not yet fda approved
 in the us.  what would be the cost of the oral form in ca$ also if
 anyone would have that info?    
 
 thanks
