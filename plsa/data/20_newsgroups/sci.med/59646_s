 last week i went to see a gastroenterologist. i had never met this
 doctor before, and she did not know what i was there for. as soon as i
 arrived, somebody showed me to an examining room and handed me a gown.
 they told me to undress (from the waist down, to be exact) and wait for the
 doctor. is this the usual drill when you go to a doctor for the first
 time? i don't have much experience going to doctors (knock on wood), but
 on the couple of occasions when i've gone to a new doctor, i met him
 with my clothes on. first, he introduced himself, asked what i was there
 for and took a history, all before i undressed.
  
 are patients usually expected to get naked before meeting a doctor
 for the first time? personally, i'd prefer to meet the doctor on
 something remotely resembling a condition of parity and to establish an
 identity as a person who wears clothes before dropping my drawers. if
 nothing else, it minimizes the time that i have to spend in the self
 conscious, ill at ease and vulnerable condition of a person with a bare
 bottom talking to somebody who is fully clothed.
  
 does anybody besides me regard this get-naked-first-and-then-we-can-talk
 attitude as insensitive? also, is it unusual?
