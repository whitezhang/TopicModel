 
 i am looking for current sources for lists of all the home
 medical tests currently legally available.
 i believe this trend of allowing tests at home where
 feasible, decreased medical costs by a factor of 10 or
 more and allows the patient some time and privacy to
 consider the best action from the results of such tests.
 in fact i believe home medical tests and certain basic
 tests for serious diseases such as cancer, heart disease,
 should be offered free to the american public.
 this could actually help to reduce national medical costs
 since many would have an earlier opportunity to know
 about and work toward recuperation or cure.
