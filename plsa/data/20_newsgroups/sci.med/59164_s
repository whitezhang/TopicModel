 to construct a kirlian device find a copy of _handbook of psychic
 discoveries_ by sheila ostrander and lynn schroeder 1975 library of
 congress 73-88532.  it describes the necessary equipment and
  suppliers for the tesla coil or alternatives, the copper plate and
 setup. i used a pack of sx-70 film and removed a single pack in a
 dark room, then made the exposure, put it back in the film pack and
 ran it out through the rollers of the camera forinstant developing
 and very high quality.  it is a good way to experience what kirlian
 photography is really and what it is not.  as you know all ready,
 it is the pattern in the bioplasmic energy fieldthat is significant.
 variations caused by exposure time, distance from the plate, or
 pressure on the plate, or variations in the photo materials are not
 important.
