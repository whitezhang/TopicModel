 steve, take a look at what you are saying.  i don't see one construvtive
 word here.  if you don't have anything constructive to add, why waste
 the bandwidth - yeah, sure, flame me for doing it myself.  is this
 sci.med or alt.flame?  like it or not, medical science does *not* know
 categorically everything about everything.  i'm not flaming your
 knowledge, just asking you to sit back and ask yourself "what if?"
 
 "minds are like parachutes - they only function when they are open."
 
 oh - and if you *do* want to flame me or anyone else, how about using
 email?
