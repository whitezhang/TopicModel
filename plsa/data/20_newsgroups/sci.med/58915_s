 if you mean "reactive" hypoglycemia, there are usually no symptoms,
 hence there is no disease, hence the dietary recommendations are the
 same as for anyone else.  if a patient complains of dizziness,
 faintness, sweating, palpitations, etc. reliably several hours after
 a big meal, the recommendations are obvious - eat smaller meals.
