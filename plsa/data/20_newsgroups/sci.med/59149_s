    many of these cereals are corn-based. after your post i looked in the
    literature and located two articles that implicated corn (contains
    tryptophan) and seizures. the idea is that corn in the diet might
    potentiate an already existing or latent seizure disorder, not cause it.
    check to see if the two kellog cereals are corn based. i'd be interested.

 a couple of folks have suggested the "corn connection".  in the five month
 period between the two seizures, my daughter had eaten a fair amount of
 kix and berry berry kix in the mornings and never had a problem.  i checked
 the labels and the first ingredient is corn.  she has also never had a problem
 eating corn or corn on the cob but of course, that is usually later in the day
 with a full stomach so the absorption would not be so high.  i do believe that
 frost flakes have corn in them but i will have to check the fruit loops.  but
 the fact that she has eaten this other corny cereal in the morning makes me
 wonder.
 
 thanks for checking into this.  all information at this point is valuable to me.
