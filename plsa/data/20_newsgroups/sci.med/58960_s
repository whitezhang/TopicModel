 from my reading of the popular, and scientific, literature,  i think that the
 benzopyrene-from-burned-fat problem is probably real but very small compared to
 other kinds of risks.  (this type of problem also occurs with stove-top pan
 grilling.)  one possible remedy i have read about is to take some vitamin c with your meal of barbecue (or bacon, e.g.).  this may make sense because vit. c
 is an antioxidant which could counteract the adverse affect of some of the 
 chemicals in question.  bon apetit!
