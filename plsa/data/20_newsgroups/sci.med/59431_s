 we're about to have our first baby, and have a few questions that we
 dont seem to be able to get answered to our satisfaction. 
 
 reguarding having a baby boy circumsized, what are the medical pros
 and cons?  all we've heard is 'its up to the parents'.
 
 how about the pregnant woman sitting in a tub of water?  we've heard 
 stories of infection, etc.  how about after the water has broken?
