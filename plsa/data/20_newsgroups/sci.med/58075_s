 i'll probably get flamed for this, but when i was a kid we would go to
 my uncles cabin on middle bass island on lake erie. we always came home
 with a nasty case of jiggers (large red bumps where the buggers had
 burrowed into the skin). my mother would paint the bumps with clear
 finger nail polish. this was repeated daily for about a week or so. the
 application of the polish is supposed to suffocate them as it seals of
 the skin. all i can say is it worked for us. one word of caution
 though. putting finger nail polish on a jigger bite stings like hell.
 
 (if i do get flamed for this just put jam in my pockets and call me
 toast.:)
