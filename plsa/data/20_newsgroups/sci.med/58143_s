 you can probably get this information by calling your public health
 department in your county (in pittsburgh, they give the shots free,
 as well).  there are bulletins in medical libraries that give
 recommendations, or you could call the infectious diseases section
 of the medicine department of your local medical school.  you also
 will probably want to talk about malaria prophylaxis.  you will
 need your doctor to get the prescription.
