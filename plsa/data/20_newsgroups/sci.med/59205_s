  physician's personalities.  apologies to sci.med readers not
  familiar with the myers-briggs "nt/nf" personality terms.  but,
  in a word or two, the nts (intuitive->thinkers) are approximately your
  philosophy/science/tech pragmatic types, and the nfs (intuitive-feelers)
  are your humanities/social-"science"/theology idealistic types.  they
  hate each others' guts (:-)) but tend to inter-marry.
  the letter "j" is a reference to conscienciousness/decisiveness.]

 please get it right, jon.
 (this ntj has a strong desire to correct semantic mistakes,
  because the nfs of this world are fouling the once-pristine nt
  intellectual nest with their verbal poop.)
 
 the dominant correlation is nt <-> phlegmatic (and _not_ nt <-> choleric).
 one of the semantic roots of "choleric" is the idea of "hot" (emotional)
 and one of the semantic roots of "phlegmatic" is "cold" (unemotional).
 
 here is a thumbnail sketch (taken from hans eysenck, refering to wundt)
 relating the ancient greek quadratic typology with modern terms:
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                  emotional   
                                      ^
      ("melancholic")                 |                     ("choleric")
                                      |              
            thoughtful suspicious     |    quickly-aroused hotheaded
                   unhappy worried    |   egocentric histrionic
                            anxious   |  exhibitonist 
                              serious | active

                          reasonable  |  carefree
               steadfast persistent   |   hopeful sociable
      highly-principled controlled    |    controlled easy-going
                                      |              
     ("phlegmatic")                   |                     ("sanguine")
                                      |

                                non-emotional

 i suspect that your characterisation of nts as "choleric" is what
 you psych-types call a "projection" of your own nf-ness onto us.
 
 > maybe we need more nf doctor's.  :^)
 
 perhaps in serious pediatics and "my little boy's got a runny
 nose, doctor" general practice, but, please god, not in neurology,
 opthamology, urology, etc. etc.  and nf-psychiatry should seperate
 from nt-(i.e. real) psychiatry and be given a new name .. something 
 like "channeling"  :-).
