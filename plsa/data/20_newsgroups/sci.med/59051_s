 infantile spasms have been well understood for quite some time now.  you
 are seeing a pediatric neurologist, aren't you?  if not, i strongly
 recommend it.  there is a new anticonvulsant about to be released called
 felbamate which may be particularly helpful for infantile spasms.  as
 for learning more about seizures, ask your doctor or his nurse about a
 local support group.
