 there's a lot of evidence, it just hasn't been adequately gathered and
 published in a way that will convince the die-hard melancholic skeptics
 who quiver everytime the word 'anecdote' or 'empirical' is used.
 
 for example, dr. ivker, who wrote the book "sinus survival", always gives,
 before any other treatment, a systemic anti-fungal (such as nizoral) to his
 new patients if they've been on braod-spectrum anti-biotics 4 or more times
 in the last two years.  he's kept a record of the results, and for over 
 2000 patients found that over 90% of his patients get significant relief
 of allergic/sinus symptoms.  of course, this is only the beginning for his
 program.
 
 in my case, as i reported a few weeks ago, i was developing the classic
 symptoms outlined in 'the yeast connection' (i agree it is a poorly 
 written book):  e.g., extreme sensitivity to plastics, vapors, etc. which
 i never had before (started in november).  within one week of full dosage
 of sporanox, the sensitivity to chemicals has fully disappeared - i can
 now sit on my couch at home without dying after two minutes.  i'm also
 *greatly* improved in other areas as well.
 
 of course, i have allergy symptoms, etc.  i am especially allergic to
 molds, yeasts, etc.  it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that
 if one has excessive colonization of yeast in the body, and you have a
 natural allergy to yeasts, that a threshold would be reached where you
 would have perceptible symptoms.  also, yeast do produce toxins of various
 sorts, and again, you don't have to be a rocket scientist to realize that
 such toxins can cause problems in some people.  in my case it was sinus
 since that's the center of my allergic response.  of course, the $60,000
 question is whether a person who is immune compromised (as tests showed i was
 from over 5 years of antibiotics, nutritionally-deficiencies because of the
 stress of infections and allergies, etc.), can develop excessive yeast
 colonization somewhere in the body.  it is a tough question to answer since
 testing for excessive yeast colonization is not easy.  one almost has to
 take an empirical approach to diagnosis.  fortunately, sporanox is relatively
 safe unlike past anti-fungals (still have to be careful, however) so there's
 no reason any longer to withhold sporanox treatment for empirical reasons.
 
 btw, some would say to try nystatin.  unfortunately, most yeast grows hyphae
 too deep into tissue for nystatin to have any permanent affect.  you'll find
 a lot of people who are on nystatin all the time.
 
 in summary, i appreciate all of the attempts by those who desire to keep
 medicine on the right road.  but methinks that some who hold too firmly
 to the party line are academics who haven't been in the trenches long enough
 actually treating patients.  if anybody, doctors included, said to me to my
 face that there is no evidence of the 'yeast connection', i cannot guarantee
 their safety.  for their incompetence, ripping off their lips is justified as
 far as i am concerned.
