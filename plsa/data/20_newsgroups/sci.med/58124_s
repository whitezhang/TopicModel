 i'm sure the pittsburgh group has published the baboon work, but i
 don't know where.  in chicago they were doing lobe transplants from
 living donors, and i'm sure they've published.  i don't read the
 transplant literature.  i just see the liver transplant patients
 when they get into neurologic trouble (pretty frequent), so that
 and the newspapers and scuttlebutt is the way i keep up with what
 they are doing.  howard doyle works with them, and can tell you more.
