 be sure to say "chronic" dizziness, not just dizziness.  most
 patients with acute or subacute dizziness will get better.
 the vertiginous spells of meniere's will also eventually go
 away, however, the patient is left with a deaf ear.

 this may have helped you, but i'm not sure it is good general
 advice.  the odds that you are going to find some miracle with
 your own research that is secret or hidden from general knowledge
 for this or any other disease are slim.  when good answers to these
 problems are found, it is usually in all the newspapers.  until
 then, spending a great deal of time and energy on the medical
 problem may divert that energy from more productive things
 in life.  a limited amount should be spent to assure yourself
 that your doctor gave you the correct story, but after it becomes
 clear that you are dealing with a problem for which medicine
 has no good solution, perhaps the best strategy is to join
 the support group and keep abreast of new findings but not to
 make a career out of it.
