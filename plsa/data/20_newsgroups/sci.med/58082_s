 it's got potential.  instead of *.chemistry, how about splitting the
 classification into *.biochemistry (which are probably the topics
 you're thinking of) and *.pharmaceutical (which otherwise might end up
 in *.(bio)chemistry)?
 
 (this is separate from the issue of whether there is sufficient potential
 news volume to support either or both groups.)
 
 i'll add 'em to my medical/health newsgroup wish list (which i'm looking
 forward to posting and discussing -- but not for another 10 days or so).
