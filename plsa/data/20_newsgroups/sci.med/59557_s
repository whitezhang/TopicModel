 i am quite near sighted.
 
 i've recently received laser treatment for both eyes to seal
 holes in the retinas to help prevent retinal detachment. in my
 left eye a small detachment had begun already and apparently the
 laser was used to "weld" this back in place as well.
 
 my right eye seems fine. in my left eye i was seeing occasional
 flashes of bright light prior to the treatment. since the
 treatment (two weeks) these flashes are now occuring more often
 - several each hour.
 
 the opthamologist explained the flashes are caused because the
 vitreous body has attached to the retina and is pulling on it. he
 says this is not treatable and he hopes it may go away on its own
 accord - if it tugs enough i may well face retinal detachment.
 
 i am seeking (via sci.med) additional info on retinal detachments.
 the dr. did not wish to spend much time with me in explanations
 so i appreciate any further details anyone can provide. of most
 interest to me:
 
 if my retina does detach what should be my immediate course
 of action?
 
 if conventional surgery is need to repair the detachment what is
 the procedure like and what kind of vision can i expect
 afterwards.
 
 do the symptoms (fairly frequent flashes) imply that detachment
 maybe near at hand or is this not necessarily cause for alarm.
 
 many thanks
