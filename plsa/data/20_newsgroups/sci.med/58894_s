 phenylketonuria is a disease in which the body cannot process phenylalanine.
 it can build up in the blood and cause seizures and neurological damage.
 an odd side effect is that the urine can be deeply colored, like red wine.
 people with the condition must avoid nutrasweet, chocolate, and anything
 else rich in phenylalanine.
 
 aspartame is accused of having caused various vague neurological symptoms.
 pat robertson's program _the_700_club_ was beating the drum against
 aspartame rather vigorously for about a year, but that issue seems to
 have been pushed to the back burner for the last year or so.  apparently,
 the evidence is not very strong, or pat would still be flailing away.
