 last year, i was totally surprised when my annual physical disclosed an
 inguinal hernia.  i couldn't remember doing anything that would have
 caused it.  that is, i hadn't been lifting more than other people do,
 and in fact probably somewhat less.  eventually the thing became more
 painful and i had the repair operation.
 
 this year i developed a pain on the other side.  this turned out to be
 another inguinal hernia.  so i go back to the hospital monday for
 another fun 8-) operation.
 
 i don't know of anything i'm doing to cause this to happen.  i'm 38
 years old and i don't think i'm old enough for things to start falling
 apart like this.  the surgeon who is doing the operation seems to
 suspect a congenital weakness, but if so, why did it suddenly appear
 when i was 37 and not really as active as i was when i was younger?
 
 does anyone know how to prevent a hernia, other than not lifting
 anything?  it's rare that i lift more than my 16-month-old or a sack
 full of groceries, and you may have noticed that your typical grocery
 sack is fairly small these days.  is there some sort of exercise that
 will reduce the risk?
 
 of course, my wife thinks it's from sitting for long periods of time at
 the computer, reading news...
