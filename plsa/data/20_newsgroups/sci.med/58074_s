 getting back to the original question in this thread:
 
 i experienced breathing difficulties a few years ago similar to those
 described.  in my case, it turned out that i was developing type i
 diabetes.  although i never sought direct confirmation of this from my
 doctor, i think that the breathing problem was associated with the
 presence of ketones due to the diabetes.
 
 i think that ketosis can occur in lesser degree if one is restricting
 their food intake drastically.  i don't know if this relevant in this
 case, but you might ask your daughter if she has been eating
 properly.
