 this is the second post which seems to be blurring the distinction
 between real disease caused by candida albicans and the "disease"
 that was being asked about, systemic yeast syndrome.
 
 there is no question that candida albicans causes thrush.  it also
 seems to be the case that active yogurt cultures with acidophilous
 may reduce recurrences of thrush at least for vaginal thrush -- i've 
 never heard of anyone taking it for oral thrush before (though 
 presumably it would work by the same mechanism).
 
 candida is clearly a common minor pathogen and a less common major
 pathogen.  that does not mean that there is evidence that it causes
 the "systemic yeast syndrome".
