 yes, but typically they *don't*.  not every wild flight of fancy serves
 (or can serve) in the appropriate relation to a hypothesis.  it is
 somewhat interesting that when anyone is challanged to provide an
 example of this sort the *only* one they come up with is the one about
 kekule.  surely, there must be others.  but apparently this is regarded
 as an *extreme* example of a "non-rational" process in science whereby
 a successful hypothesis was proposed.  but how non-rational is it?
 
 of course we can't hope (currently at least) to explain how or why
 kekule had the daydream of snakes in the fire biting their tails.
 surely it wasn't the *only* daydream he had.  what was special about
 *this* one?  could it have had something to do with a perceived
 *analogy* between the geometry of the snakes and problems concerning
 geometry of molecules?  is such analogical reasoning "extra-scientific"?
 or is it rather at the very heart of science (perice's notion of abduction,
 the use of models within and across disciplines)?  upon close examination,
 is there a non-rational mystical leap taking place, or is it perhaps
 closer to a formal (though often incomplete) analogy or model?
