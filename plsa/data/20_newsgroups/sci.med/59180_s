 
 hi,
 
 we are just completing a project on nebuliser performance, and have a
 wealth of data on particle size and output which we are going to use
 to adjudicate a contract next week.
 
 although the output data is easy for us to present, there seems to be
 little concensus on the optimum diameter of the nebulised droplets for
 straightforward inhalation therapy (eg: for asthmatics).
 
 some say that the droplets must be smaller than 5 microns, whilst
 others say that if they are too small they will not be effective.
 
 anyone up on this topic who could summarise the current status ?
 
 cheers,
 pete
