  marty, i personally wouldn't be so quick and take that nejm article 
  on kidney stones as gospel. first of all, i would want to know who
  sponsored that study.
  i have seen too many "nutrition" bulletins over the years from
  local newspapers, magazines, to tv-guide, with disclaimers on the
  bottom informing us that this great health news was brought to us
  compliments of the dairy industries.
  there are of course numerous other interest groups now that thrive
  financially on the media hype created from the supposedly enormous 
  benefits of increasing one's calcium intake.
 
  secondly, were all the kidney stones of the test subjects involved 
  in that project analysed for their chemical composition?  the study
  didn't say that, it only claimed that "most kidney stones are large-
  ly calcium."
  perhaps it won't be long before another study comes up with the exact
  opposite findings. a curious phenomenon with researchers is that they
  are oftentimes just plain wrong. it wouldn't be the first time.
  
  sodium/magnesium/calcium/phosphorus ratios are, in my opinion, still 
  the most reliable indicators for the cause, treatment, and prevention 
  of kidney stones.
  i, for one, will continue to recommend the most logical changes in
  one's diet or through supplementation to counteract or prevent kidney
  stones of either type; and they definitely won't include an increase
  in calcium if the stones have been identified as being of the calcium
  type and people's chemical analysis confirms that they would benefit
  from a phosphorus-raising approach instead!
