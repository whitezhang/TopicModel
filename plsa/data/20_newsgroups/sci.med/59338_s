 point 1:
 
 i'm beginning to see that *part* of the disagreements about the whole
 "yeast issue" is on differing perceptions and on differing meanings
 of words.  medical doctors have a very specific and specialized "jargon",
 necessary for precise communication within their field (which i'm fully
 cognizant of since i, too, speak "jargonese" when with my peers).  for the
 situation in sci.med, many times the words or phrases used by doctors can
 have a different and more specific meaning than the same word used in the
 world at large, causing significant miscommunication.  one example word,
 and very relevant to the yeast discussion, is the exact meaning of "systemic".
 it is now obvious to me that the meaning of this word is very specific, much
 more so than its meaning to a non-doctor.  there is also the observation of
 this newsgroup that both doctors and non-doctors come together on essentially
 equal terms, which, when combined with the jargon issue, can further fan
 the flames.  this is probably the first time that practicing doctors get
 really "beat up" by non-doctors for their views on medicine, which they
 otherwise don't see much of in their practice except for the occasional
 "difficult" patient.
 
 point 2:
 
 i understand the viewpoint among many practicing doctors that they will not
 prescribe any treatments/therapies for their patients unless such treatments
 have been shown to be effective and the risks understood from well-constructed
 clinical trials (usually double-blind), or that such treatments/therapies are
 part of an approved and funded clinical trial.  to these doctors, to do any
 differently would, in this belief system, be unethical practice.  and it
 follows that any therapy not on the "accepted" list is therefore a non-
 therapy - it does not even exist, nor does the underlying hypothesis or
 theory have any validity, even if it sounds very plausible by extrapolation
 of what is currently known.  anecdotal evidence has no value, either, from
 a treatment point-of-view.
 
 and by and large, as a scientist myself, i am glad that medical practice/
 science takes such a rigorous approach to medical treatment.  however, as
 also being a human being (last i checked), and having been one of those people
 that has been significantly helped by a currently unaccepted treatment, where
 "standard" medicine was not able to help me, has caused me to sit back and
 wonder if holding such an extreme and rigid "scientific" viewpoint is in
 itself unethical from humanitarian considerations.  after all, the underlying
 intent of the "scientific" approach to medicine is to protect the health of
 the patient by providing the best possible care for the patient, so the
 patient should come first when considering treatment.
 
 what we need is a slightly modified approach to treatment that satisfies both
 the "scientific" and the "humanitarian" viewpoints.  in an earlier post i
 outlined a crazy idea for doing just that.  the gist of it was to give any
 physician freedom and encouragement by the medical community to prescribe
 alternate, not yet proven therapies (maybe supported by anecdotal evidence)
 for patients who *all* avenues of accepted therapies have been exhausted
 (and not until then).  the patient would be fully informed that such
 therapies/treatments are not supported by the proper clinical trials and that
 there are real potential risks with real possibilities of no benefit derived
 from them.
 
 this approach satisfies the need for scientific rigor.  it also satisfies
 the humanitarian needs of the patient.  and the reality is that many patients
 who have reached a dead-end in the treatment of their symptoms using accepted
 medicine *will* go outside the orthodox medical community:  either to the
 doctors who are brave enough to prescribe such treatments at the risk of losing
 their license, or worse, to non-doctors who have not had the proper medical
 training.  this approach also recognizes this reality and keeps the control
 more within orthodox medicine, with the benefits that the information gleaned
 could help focus limited resources towards future clinical trials in the most
 productive way.  everybody wins in this admittedly rose-colored approach - i'm
 sure there are real problems with this approach as well - it is presented
 more as a strawman to stimulate discussion.
 
 hopefully what i write here may give the sci.med doctors a better idea as to
 why i am "open" to alternative therapies, as well as why i have real
 difficulty (read "apparent hostility") with the "coldness" of the 99.9% pure
 "scientific" approach to medicine.  i believe the best approach to medical
 treatment is one where both the "humanitarian" aspects are balanced with and
 by the "scientific" aspects.  anything else is just not good medicine, imho.
 just my 'nf' leanings, i guess.  :^)
