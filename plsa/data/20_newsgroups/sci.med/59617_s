 i tried prozac a few months ago, and had some insomnia from it, but no
 anxiety or jitters.  i probably could have lived with the insomnia if the
 prozac had done any good, but it only provided a tiny benefit.  maybe
 because the person who prescribed it didn't know much and gave up after a
 20mg dose didn't work.
 
 now i'm seeing a psychiatrist who has put me on zoloft (another serotonin
 reuptake inhibitor like prozac).  one pill/day (50mg) seemed to help some. 
 now i'm trying 100mg/day.  zoloft has fewer and milder side effects than
 prozac.  i think my doctor said that only 4% of the people taking zoloft
 have to discontinue it because of side effects.  the only problem i'm
 having is some minor gi distress, but nothing too annoying.  hopefully the
 zoloft will work.  maybe your friend should try this one next.
 
 my psychiatrist's strategy seems to be to first try one of the serotonin
 drugs, usually prozac.  if that works, great.  if it works but has too many
 side effects, try zoloft or maybe paxil.  if the serotonin drugs don't work
 at all, try one of the tricyclics like desipramine.

 having a doctor who knows something about antidepressants can make a big
 difference.  my psychiatrist claims that most gps and fps don't have much
 experience in this area, and from what i've seen i'm inclined to believe
 him.  i think i know more about antidepressants than the people at my
 family practitioner's office.
 
 disclaimer: i'm not a doctor; what i know about this comes from talking to
 my psychiatrist and reading sci.med.
