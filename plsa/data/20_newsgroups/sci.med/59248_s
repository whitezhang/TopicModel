 secaris is reasonably inexpensive ($6.00 cdn for a tube), and is indeed an
 over the counter medication. why it does not appear to be available in the
 us, i don't know. it's manufactured in montreal.
 
 it's a nasal lubricant, and is intended to help nosebleeds that result from
 dry mucous membranes.
 
 from some of the replies to my original posting, it's evident that some
 people do not secrete enough mucous to keep their nose lining protected
 from environmental influences (ie, dry air). but i've had no responses
 from anyone with experience with rutin. is there another newsgroup that
 might have specifics on herbal remedies?
 
 but thanks to all those who did reply with their experiences.
