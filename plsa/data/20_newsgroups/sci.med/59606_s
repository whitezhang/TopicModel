      i posted about a "pulse of (relaxation) electricity".  i now think
 it more like a pulse of "relaxation" or comfort than a pulse of
 electricity.  it is what you feel if you are overwhelmed by a feeling
 of comfort, such as seeing or thinking about something beautiful.
 
      another thing.  when you sleep, you lie down facing up, with your
 palms aside of you and facing down on the surface of the bed.  then you
 relax, and there start involuntary nerve firings inside your flesh.  so,
 you feel a "shiver" below the surface of the skin (not heart-beat).
 then this shiver increases, and comes up to your head, and the roam you
 hear loudens.  (note that you always hear a high-pitch when you lie down
 in bed; this is just the noise of your blood running in your ear.)  this
 roam is different from the high pitch, but follows the shiver of your
 body.
 
      "shiver" is not the word.  it may be called a mild vibration or quake.
 what is this shiver and roam?  can i use this to induce out-of-body
 experience?
