 
 i use a zygon mind machine as bought in the usa last year.  although
 it's no wonder cure for what ail's you.  it is however very good at
 stopping you thinking!
 
 sound strange?  well suppose you're tired and want to go to bed/sleep.
 but your head is full of niggling problems to resolve, you lay in the
 bed, and quickly they all come to the surface, churning around from one
 unresolved thing to the next and then back again.  been there, bought
 the t-shirt?
 
 i slip on the zygon and select a soothing pattern of light & sound, and
 quickly i just can't concentrate on the previous stuff. your brain's
 cache kinda get's flushed, and you start on a whole new set of stuff.
 
 a useful addition, is the facility to feed the output of a tape player
 or cd through the box, i use new age elevator muzak to enhance the
 overall effect.
 
 deffo better than a pill.
 
 cheers nigel
