 nice to see that some things never change, steve, if you aren't being
 ignorant in one group [*.alternative] you're into another. one positive
 thing came out of it, you are no longer bothering the folks in 
 *.alternative, it's just a shame that these people have to suffer so
 that others may breath freely. 
  
 sorry for wasting bandwidth folks. don't forget to bow down once
 every second day, and to offer your first born to the almight 
 omniscient, omnipotent, mr. steve.
