 well, making a career out of it is a bit strong.  i still believe
 that doing your own research is very, very necessary.  i would
 not have progressed as much as i have today, unless i had spent
 the many hours in stanford's med library as i have done.
 and 5 years ago, it was clear that there was no medicine that 
 would help me.  so should i have stopped searching.  thank
 goodness i didn't.  now i found that there is indeed medicine
 that helps me.  
 
 i think that what you've said is kind of idealistic.  that you
 would go to one doctor, get a diagnosis, maybe get a second
 opinion, and then move on with your life.
 just as an example... having seen 6 of the top specialists in 
 this field in the country, i have received 6 different diagnoses.
 these are the top names, the ones that people come to from all over
 the country.  i have had to sort all of this out myself.  going
 to a support group (and in fact, heading that support group) was 
 helpful for a while, but after a point, i found it very
 unproductive.  it was much more productive to do library research,
 make phone calls and put together the pieces of the puzzle myself.
 
 a recent movie, lorenzo's oil, offers a perfect example of what
 i'm talking about.  if you haven't seen it, you should.  it's not
 a put down of doctor's and neither is what i'm saying.  doctors are
 only human and can only do so much.  but there are those of us
 out here who are intelligent and able to sometimes find a missing
 piece of the puzzle that might have otherwise gone unnoticed.
 
 i guess i'm biased because dizziness is one of those weird things
 that is still so unknown.  if i had a broken arm, or a weak heart,
 or failing kidneys, i might not have the same opinion.  that's because 
 those things are much more tangible and have much more concise 
 definitions and treatments.  with dizziness, you just have to
 decide to live with it or decide to live with it while trying to
 find your way out of it.
 
 
 i have chosen the latter.
