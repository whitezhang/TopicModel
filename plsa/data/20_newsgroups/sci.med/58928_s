 i am looking for information on possible causes and long term effects
 of bone marrow sclerosis. i would also be thankful if anyone reading
 this newsgroup could list some recognized treatment centers if anything
 else than massive blood transfusion can be effective. if you plan on
 a "go to the library"-style reply, please be kind enough to add a list 
 of suggested topics or readings: medicine is not my field.
 
 regards,
 joel malard.
