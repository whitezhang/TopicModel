 1: "90% of diseases" is not the same thing as "90% of patients".
 
    in a world with one curable disease that strikes 100 people, and nine
    incurable diseases which strikes one person each, medical science will cure
    91% of the patients and report that 90% of diseases have no therapy.
 
 2: a disease would be counted among the 90% untreatable if nothing better than
    a placebo were known.  of course mds are ethically bound to not knowingly
    dispense placebos...
