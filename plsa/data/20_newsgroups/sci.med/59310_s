 any rocky mountain spotted fever experts out there ?
 
 the doctor thinks a friend might have this.
 the question is, doesn't the tick have to bite you ?
 
 you frequently find a tick crawling on you after a walk
 in the woods around here, but you tend to notice it before
 it bites you; pulling one out of your skin is something
 you're not likely to forget.
 
 can you get the fever without it biting you ?  do they
 sometimes bite you and then let go so you don't realize
 you were bitten ?  i know they will let go once they've had
 their fill, but you certainly would notice this (arggh).
 
 so how do you get the fever if you never pulled a tick
 off yourself (as opposed to finding one merely crawling
 on you) ?
