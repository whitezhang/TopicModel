 resinfo (research and information) is currently seeking contact
 _in_ the united kingdom with researchers of 'phenylanine', or is
 this amino acid uninspiring?
 
 resinfo is not a regular subscriber to sci.med due to the 
 excessive load of data and regrettably, our limited ability
 to monitor. it would therefore be appreciated if replies
 could be sent direct to;
 resinfo@resinfo.demon.co.uk
 using the ref: mr t.a.t.
