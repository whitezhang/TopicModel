 it is evident you did not read my post carefully. i wasn't
 trying to tell you not to eat msg products and produce, nor was i
 arguing for or against msg. i was simply questioning the logic of
 your statement that simply because
 (a) one is not allergic to something, and
 (b) likes eating that
 it follows that one could keep eating whatever it is. 
 in my post, i had clearly said that i don't know enough about msg.
 the statement "don't eat x because its bad" is just _your_ 
 interpretation of nutritional info out there.
