 in this issue of the newsletter, we learn of the cdc's announced concern for
 the "resurgence of infectious diseases" in the united states.  thanks to
 jonathan lord for sending me the upi release.  the cdc announced they would
 feature a new series of articles in the morbidity and mortality weekly
 report on these infectious diseases (ld is one of them).  we will keep you
 up to date on this series.
 
 in addition, we feature a the wall street journal article on the legal issues
 surrounding ld.  we also look at lyme's effects from the perspective of
 urologists in an abstract entitled "urinary dysfunction in lyme disease."
 
 finally, terry morse asks an intriguing question about a tick's habitat.

 subject: resurgence of infectious disease concerns cdc
 date: thursday april 15, 1993
 
 atlanta (upi) --   a resurgence of infectious diseases blamed on newly
 emerging viruses and bacteria pose a major challenge for the nation's
 health care system, federal health officials said thursday.
 
 the centers for disease control and prevention, reporting its latest
 findings in an investigation of contaminated hamburger meat that
 sickened hundreds in 4 states and killed at least four, said it will
 put renewed emphasis on battling infectious diseases.
 
 part of that emphasis includes a new series titled "emerging
 infectious diseases" to be featured in the cdc's morbidity & mortality
 weekly report, which has a wide circulation in the health community.
 the issue also will top the agenda of a two-day meeting of scientific
 counselors to update the cdc's draft plan for dealing with the growing
 threat of infectious ailments.
 
 "this is an issue that has been coming and we do have a responsibility
 to deal with it," said dr. ruth berkelman, deputy director of the cdc's
 national center for infectious diseases.
 
 there were more cases of malaria in the u.s. in 1992 than in any year
 since the 1960s, and latin america is experiencing a cholera epidemic,
 the first in this century, she said.
 
 resistance of disease-causing agents to antibiotics is also a problem.
 "we are seeing much more antibiotic resistance than we have in the past"
 berkleman said.  she said even common ear infections frequently seen in
 children are becoming resistant to antibiotic treatment.
 
 "despite predictions earlier this century that infectious  diseases
 would soon be eliminated as a public health problem, infectious diseases
 remain the major cause of death worldwide and a leading cause of illness
 and death in the united states," the cdc said.
 
 it  cited  the  emergence since the 1970s of a "myriad" of newly
 identified pathogens and syndromes, such as escherichia coli o157:h7, a
 deadly bacterial infection; the hepatitis c virus; hiv, the virus that
 causes aids; legionnaires disease; lyme disease; and toxic shock syndrome.
 
 "the incidences of many diseases widely presumed to be under control,
 such as cholera, malaria and tuberculosis, have increased in many areas,"
 the cdc said.  it said efforts at control and prevention have been
 undermined by drug resistance.

 headline: lyme-disease ruling raises liability issues
 
 the tick that causes lyme disease may have found a new way to cause
 damage: legal liability.
 
 a federal judge's decision holding a property owner liable for not
 doing enough to protect workers from lyme disease is getting as much
 attention as the latest medical study on the disease, a flu-like
 illness that can cause severe physical and mental disabilities and in
 rare instances death. the decision last week has put property owners
 on notice that they may have to do more than protect themselves from
 the ticks-they also may have to protect themselves from litigation if
 someone becomes infected while on the property.
 
 the decision by u.s. district judge robert j. ward in new york came
 after a week-long trial in a case involving four track workers for the
 long island railroad. judge ward found that the workers contracted the
 disease after they were bitten by ticks while on the job. he ordered
 the new york state-owned commuter line to pay the workers more than
 $560,000 to compensate for pain and suffering, in addition to medical
 expenses and lost wages.
 
 summer camps, schools, companies with facilities in rural or
 semirural areas, and homeowners who rent to vacationers are among the
 groups that need to be worried about this ruling, says stephen l.
 kass, an attorney at new york law firm berle, kass & case, who wrote a
 legal article three years ago warning property owners of the potential
 liability. even a family that invites friends over for a backyard
 barbecue might be potentially liable.
 
 lawsuits for insect bites, while rare, aren't unheard-of. a summer
 vacationer in southampton, n.y., last year sued the owner of the home
 she rented, claiming that a tick on the property gave her rocky
 mountain spotted fever. in 1988, also on long island, a jury ordered
 an outdoor restaurant to pay more than $3 million to a patron who was
 stung by a bee, causing an allergic reaction and permanent
 quadriplegia. the judge later threw out the award, citing no evidence
 that a beehive was near the restaurant.
 
 but lawyers say that the attention to lyme disease throughout the
 country -- it's most prevalent in new england, the middle atlantic
 states, wisconsin, minnesota and the northwest -- may make this
 particular insect bite a particularly litigious one.
 
 the illness already has proved to be a source of controversy in the
 courtroom over such issues as the type of medical care insurers will
 cover and medical malpractice claims against doctors for not
 diagnosing the disease.
 
 lawyers say worker's-compensation claims related to lyme disease
 have become common in some states in recent years. payments in
 worker's-compensation cases, however, are limited to medical costs and
 lost earnings.
 
 the case before judge ward dealt with a potentially much more
 lucrative avenue for damages, because it involved the question of
 negligence. unlike the worker's compensation process, the law governing
 injuries to rail workers allows for a finding of negligence and, as a
 result, for additional payments for pain and suffering. property
 owners and lawyers say that negligence claims can be made in many
 other situations where people are exposed to the ticks that carry the
 disease.
 
 ira m. maurer, a partner at new york law firm elkind, flynn &
 maurer, who represented the rail workers, says the decision will help
 to establish "the duty of all sorts of property owners to protect
 against lyme disease."
 
 lawyers caution that despite judge ward's decision, winning a
 lawsuit for damages caused by lyme disease may prove difficult. for
 one thing, victims have to demonstrate that they have pinned down when
 and where they got the tick bite. judge ward found that the plaintiffs
 in the railroad case got lyme disease while working on property owned
 by the railroad, even though none of the men remembered being bitten.
 the workers, who weren't outdoorsmen likely to be exposed elsewhere to
 the insects, said they saw ticks in the high grass that surrounded
 some work sites.
 
 a spokeswoman for the railroad says that there was no proof that
 the four men were bitten while on the job and that the railroad is
 considering an appeal. the railroad also disputes judge ward's finding
 that it didn't do enough to protect employees. the spokeswoman says
 the railroad provides track workers with insect repellent and special
 pants to protect against bug bites.
 
 debate in the scientific community over lyme disease could open up
 some legal defenses for property owners, such as questioning whether a
 victim actually has the disease rather than some other illness.
 earlier this week, the journal of the american medical association
 reported that doctors overly diagnose patients as having lyme disease.
 and damages awarded to a victim also might be influenced by medical
 disputes over the degree of harm that lyme disease causes.
 
 because of health and safety concerns, some groups and companies
 already take special measures to protect against lyme disease. last
 year, at its headquarters in franklin lakes, n.j., becton, dickinson &
 co. began using damminix, a pesticide made by ecohealth inc. of boston
 that is designed to kill ticks carrying the disease. the medical-
 supply company's headquarters include a 120-acre park, and the company
 was worried that employees who walk on its trails for recreation might
 get infected.
 
 ruth lister, a spokeswoman for the american camping association in
 indianapolis, says that many youth camps accredited by her
 organization also have begun to check children for ticks. and carole
 katz, a member of the board of the fire island pines property owners
 association, says her group spends $30,000 each year to treat their
 100-acre site off the coast of new york with the tick-killing
 pesticide.

 title: urinary dysfunction in lyme disease.
 authors: chancellor mb; mcginnis de; shenot pj; kiilholma p; hirsch ih,
 department of urology, jefferson medical college, thomas jefferson
 university, philadelphia, pennsylvania.
 reference: j urol 1993 jan; 149 (1): 26-30
 
 lyme disease, which is caused by the spirochete borrelia burgdorferi, is
 associated with a variety of neurological sequelae.  we describe 7 patients
 with neuro-borreliosis who also had lower urinary tract dysfunction.
 urodynamic evaluation revealed detrusor hyperreflexia in 5 patients and
 detrusor areflexia in 2.  detrusor external sphincter dyssynergia was not
 noted on electromyography in any patient.  we observed that the urinary tract
 may be involved in 2 respects in the course of lyme  disease: 1) voiding
 dysfunction may be part of neuro-borreliosis and 2) the spirochete may
 directly invade the urinary tract.  in 1 patient bladder infection by the
 lyme spirochete was documented on biopsy.  neurological and urological
 symptoms in all patients were slow to resolve and convalescence was
 protracted.  relapses of active lyme disease and residual neurological
 deficits were common.  urologists practicing in areas endemic for lyme
 disease need to be aware of b. burgdorferi infection in the differential
 diagnosis of neurogenic bladder dysfunction.  conservative bladder
 management including clean intermittent catheterization guided by urodynamic
 evaluation is recommended.

 subject: question on lyme vectors and compost piles
 
   when i visited my sister on long island, ny, i was cautioned to avoid the
 compost heap in her back yard, as she thinks this is where she became
 infected.
 
   a friend of mine here in oregon who has a compost heap would like me to
 back that claim up with documentation.  do lyme-carrying ticks hang out in
 compost heaps?
 thank you.
