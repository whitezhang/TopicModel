 i shot off a response to this last night that i've tried to cancel.  it was 
 only a few minutes later while driving home that i remembered that your 
 message does specifically say cortical.  my first reaction had been to suggest
 the pc12 pheochromocytoma line.  that may still be a good compromise, depending
 on what you're doing.  have you concidered using a mouse cell line from one 
 of the sv40 t antigen transgenic lines?  another alternative might be primary
 cells from bovine adrenal cortex.
