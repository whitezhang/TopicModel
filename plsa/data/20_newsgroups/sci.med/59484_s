 >i do believe that depression can have a dietary component.
 
 depression can also have various chemical (environmental) components.
 i noticed that i became depressed in various buildings, and at home
 when the air conditioning was on. subsequent testing revealed that
 i was allergic to stemphyllium, a mold commonly found in air conditioners.
 after i began taking antigens, that problem disappeared.
