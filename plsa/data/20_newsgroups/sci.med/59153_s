 it made me really bitchy for the first few weeks.  now that i think about
 it i was having some bizarre dreams too.  my doctor said it made him feel
 like he had to be doing something all the time.  but if you keep taking it,
 after a few weeks these symptoms seem to go away, he said hang in there.  
 i did and they did.
