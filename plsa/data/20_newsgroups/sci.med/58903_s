 
 i have between 15 and 25 nosebleeds each week, as a result of a genetic
 predisposition to weak capillary walls (osler-weber-rendu). fortunately,
 each nosebleed is of short duration.
 
 does anyone know of any method to reduce this frequency? my younger brothers
 each tried a skin transplant (thigh to nose lining), but their nosebleeds
 soon returned. i've seen a reference to an herb called rutin that is
 supposed to help, and i'd like to hear of experiences with it, or other
 techniques.
