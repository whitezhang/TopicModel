                     low levels of airborne particles linked
                            to serious asthma attacks
                            american lung association 
 
      a new study published by the american lung association has shown that 
 surprisingly low concentrations of airborne particles can send people with 
 asthma rushing to emergency rooms for treatment.  
      the seattle-based study showed that roughly one in eight emergency visits 
 for asthma in that city was linked to exposure to particulate air pollution.  
 the actual exposure levels recorded in the study were far below those deemed 
 unsafe under federal air quality laws.  
      "people with asthma have inflamed airways, and airborne particles tend to 
 exacerbate that inflammation," said joel schwartz, ph.d., of the environmental 
 protection agency, who was the lead author of the study.  "when people are on 
 the threshold of having, a serious asthma attack, particles can push them over 
 the edge." 
      the seattle study correlated 13 months of asthma emergency room visits 
 with daily levels of pm,,,. or particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter 
 of 10 microns or less.  these finer particles are considered hazardous because 
 they are small enough penetrate into the lung.  cities are considered out of 
 compliance with clean air laws if the 24-hour average concentration of pm10 
 exceeds 150 micrograms per cubic millimeter of air.  
      in seattle however, a link between fine particles and asthma was found at 
 levels as low as 30 micrograms.  the authors concluded that for every 30 
 microgram increase in the four-day average of pm10, the odds of someone with 
 asthma needing emergency treatment increased by 12 percent.  
      the findings were published in the april american review of respiratory 
 disease, an official journal of the american thoracic society, the lung 
 association's medical section.  
      the study is the latest in a series of recent reports to suggest that 
 particulate matter is a greatly under appreciated health threat.  a 1992 study 
 by dr. schwartz and douglas dockery, ph.d., of harvard found that particles 
 may be causing roughly 60,000 premature deaths each year in the united states.  
 other studies have linked particulate matter to increased respiratory symptoms 
 and bronchitis in children.  
      "government officials and the media are still very focused on ozone," 
 says dr. schwartz.  "but more and more research is showing that particles are 
 bad actors as well."      one problem in setting, standards for particulate 
 air pollution is that pmio is difficult to study.  unlike other regulated 
 pollutants such as ozone and carbon monoxide, particulate matter is a complex 
 and varying mixture of substances, including carbon, hydrocarbons, dust, and

 acid aerosols.  
      "researchers can't put people in exposure chambers to study the effects 
 of particulate air pollution," says dr. schwartz.  "we have no way of 
 duplicating the typical urban mix of particles.  " consequently, most of what 
 is known about particulates has been learned through population-based research 
 like the seattle study.  
      given that the epa's current priority is to review the ozone and sulfur 
 dioxide standards, the agency is unlikely to reexamine the pm10 standard any 
 time soon.  until changes are made, there appears to be little people with 
 asthma can do to protect themselves from airborne particles.
      "in some areas, you can get reports on air quality, but the reports only 
 cover the pollutant that is closest to violating its standard, and that's 
 rarely particulate matter," says dr.  schwartz.  "however, pm10 doesn't have 
 to be near its violation range to be unhealthy."

                nih consensus development conference on melanoma
 
 the national institutes of health consensus development conference on 
 diagnosis and treatment of early melanoma brought together experts in 
 dermatology, pathology, epidemiology, public education, surveillance 
 techniques, and potential new technologies as well as other health care 
 professionals and the public to address (1) the clinical and histological 
 characteristics of early melanoma; (2) the appropriate diagnosis, management, 
 and followup of patients with early melanoma; (3) the role of dysplastic nevi 
 and their significance; and (4) the role of education and screening in 
 preventing melanoma morbidity and mortality.  following 2 days of 
 presentations by experts and discussion by the audience, a consensus panel 
 weighed the scientific evidence and prepared their consensus statement. 
  
 among their findings, the panel recommended that (1) melanoma in situ is a 
 distinct entity effectively treated surgically with 0.5 centimeter margins; 
 (2) thin invasive melanoma, less than 1 millimeter thick, has the potential 
 for long-term survival in more than 90 percent of patients after surgical 
 excision with a 1 centimeter margin; (3) elective lymph node dissections and 
 extensive staging evaluations are not recommended in early melanoma; (4) 
 patients with early melanoma are at low risk for relapse but may be at high 
 risk for development of subsequent melanomas and should be followed closely; 
 (5) some family members of patients with melanoma are at increased risk for 
 melanoma and should be enrolled in surveillance programs; and (6) education 
 and screening programs have the potential to decrease morbidity and mortality 
 from melanoma. 
  
 a copy of the full text of the consensus panel's statement is available by

 or by writing to:  office of medical applications of research, national

                          nci-designated cancer centers
 
 the cancer centers program is comprised of 55 nci-designated cancer centers 
 actively engaged in multidisciplinary research efforts to reduce cancer 
 incidence, morbidity, and mortality.  within the program, there are four types 
 of cancer centers:  basic science cancer centers (14), which engage primarily 
 in basic cancer research; clinical cancer centers (12), which focus on 
 clinical research; "comprehensive" cancer centers (28), which emphasize a 
 multidisciplinary approach to cancer research, patient care, and community 
 outreach; and consortium cancer centers (1), which specialize in cancer 
 prevention and control research. 
  
 although some cancer centers existed in the late 1960s and the 1970s, it was 
 the national cancer act of 1971 that authorized the establishment of 15 new 
 cancer centers, as well as continuing support for existing ones.  the passage 
 of the act also dramatically transformed the centers' structure and broadened 
 the scope of their mission to include all aspects of basic, clinical, and 
 cancer control research.  over the next two decades, the centers' program grew 
 progressively. 
  
 in 1990, there were 19 comprehensive cancer centers in the nation. today, 
 there are 28 of these institutions, all of which meet specific nci criteria 
 for comprehensive status. 
  
 to attain recognition from the nci as a comprehensive cancer center, an 
 institution must pass rigorous peer review.  under guidelines newly 
 established in 1990, the eight criteria for "comprehensiveness" include the 
 requirement that a center have a strong core of basic laboratory research in 
 several scientific fields, such as biology and molecular genetics, a strong 
 program of clinical research, and an ability to transfer research findings 
 into clinical practice. 
  
 moreover, five of the criteria for comprehensive status go significantly 
 beyond that required for attaining a cancer center support grant (also 
 referred to as a p30 or core grant), the mechanism of choice for supporting 
 the infrastructure of a cancer center's operations.  these criteria encompass 
 strong participation in nci-designated high-priority clinical trials, 
 significant levels of cancer prevention and control research, and important 
 outreach and educational activities--all of which are funded by a variety of 
 sources. 
  
 the other types of cancer centers also have special characteristics and 
 capabilities for organizing new programs of research that can exploit 
 important new findings or address timely research questions.

 of the 55 nci-designated cancer centers, 14 are of the basic science type.  
 these centers engage almost entirely in basic research, although some centers 
 engage in collaborative research with outside clinical research investigators 
 and in cooperative projects with industry to generate medical applications 
 from new discoveries in the laboratory. 
  
 clinical cancer centers, in contrast, focus on both basic research and 
 clinical research within the same institutional framework, and frequently 
 incorporate nearby affiliated clinical research institutions into their 
 overall research programs.  there are 12 such centers today. 
  
 finally, consortium cancer centers, of which there is one, are uniquely 
 structured and concentrate on clinical research and cancer prevention and 
 control research.  these centers interface with state and local public health 
 departments for the purpose of achieving the transfer of effective prevention 
 and control techniques from their research findings to those institutions 
 responsible for implementing population-wide public health programs.  
 consortium centers also are heavily engaged in collaborations with 
 institutions that conduct clinical trial research and coordinate community 
 hospitals within a network of cooperating institutions in clinical trials. 
  
 together, the 55 nci-designated cancer centers continue to work toward 
 creating new and innovative approaches to cancer research, and through 
 interdisciplinary efforts, to effectively move this research from the 
 laboratory into clinical trials and into clinical practice.

 ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
 
                  the uci medical education software repository 
 
 this is to announce the establishment of an ftp site at the university of 
 california, for the collection of shareware, public-domain software and other 
 information relating to medical education.  
 
 specifically, we are interested in establishing this site as a clearinghouse 
 for personally developed software that has been developed for local medical 
 education programs.  we welcome all contributions that may be shared with 
 other users.  
 
 to connect to the uci medical education software repository, ftp to: 
 
                      ftp.uci.edu
 
 the repository currently offers both msdos and macintosh software, and we hope 
 to support other operating systems (unix, mumps, amiga?).  
 
 uploads are welcome.  we actively solicit information and software which you 
 have personaly developed or have found useful in your local medical education 
 efforts, either as an instructor or student.  
 
 once you have connected to the site via ftp, cd (change directory) to either 
 the med-ed/mac/incoming or the med-ed/msdos/incoming directories, change the 
 mode to binary and "send" or "put" your files.  note that you won't be able to 
 see the files with the "ls" or "dir" commands.  please compress your files as 
 appropriate to the operating system (zip for msdos; compactor or something 
 similar for macintosh) to save disk space.  
 
 after uploading, please send email to steve clancy (slclancy@uci.edu) (for 
 msdos) or albert saisho (saisho@uci.edu) (for mac) describing the file(s) you 
 have uploaded and any other information we might need to describe it.
 
 note that we can only accept software or information that has been designated 
 as shareware, public-domain or that may otherwise be distributed freely.  
 please do not upload commercial software!  doing so may jeopardize the 
 existence of this ftp site.  
 
 if you wish to upload software for other operating systems, please contact 
 either steve clancy, m.l.s. or albert saisho, m.d. at the addresses above.

 "nih set to test multiple aids vaccines" reuters (04/08/93)  (frank, 
 jacqueline) 
 
      washington--the clinton administration will permit the national  
 institutes of health to test multiple aids vaccines instead of  only allowing 
 the army to test a single vaccine, administration  sources said thursday.  the 
 decision ends the controversy between army aids researchers who had hoped to 
 test a vaccine made by  microgenesys inc. and the national institutes of 
 health, which  contended that multiple vaccines should be tested.  health and  
 human services secretary donna shalala said a final announcement  on the 
 therapeutic vaccine trials was expected to be made last  friday.  companies 
 including genentech inc., chiron corp., and  immuno ag have already told nih 
 that they are prepared to  participate in the vaccine tests.  the testing is 
 intended to  demonstrate whether aids vaccines are effective in thwarting the  
 replication of hiv in patients already infected.  shalala refuted last week's 
 reports that the clinton administration had decided  the army's test of the 
 microgenesys vaxsyn should proceed without tests of others at the same time.  
 "the report was inaccurate,  and i expect there to be some announcement in the 
 next 24 hours  about that particular aids research project," said shalala.   
 administration sources subsequently confirmed that nih director  dr. bernadine 
 healy and food and drug administration commissioner david kessler had 
 convinced the white house that multiple  vaccines should be tested 
 simultaneously.  but microgenesys  president frank volvovitz said a test of 
 multiple vaccines could  triple the cost of the trial and delay it by two 
 years.

      azt has become the most widely used drug to fight aids since it  was 
 approved by the food and drug administration in 1987.   burroughs wellcome, 
 the manufacturer of azt, made $338 million  last year alone from sales of the 
 drug.  however, a team of  european researchers recently reported that 
 although hiv-positive patients taking azt demonstrated a slightly lower risk 
 of  developing aids within the first year of treatment, that benefit  
 disappeared two years later.  the lancet published preliminary  findings of 
 the three-year study, which could give more reason  for critics to argue the 
 drug's cost, side effects, and general  efficacy.  even though u.s. 
 researchers concede the study was  more comprehensive than american trials, 
 many argue the european  researchers' suggestion that hiv-positive patients 
 experience  little improvement in their illness before the development of  
 aids symptoms.  in addition, researchers have long been familiar  with the
