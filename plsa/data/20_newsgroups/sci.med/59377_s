 the disease you are talking about is toxoplasmosis.  it is a protozoan that 
 lives and multiplies within cells.  in cats, the protozoan multiplies in the
 intestinal cells and eggs are shed in the cat's feces.  the protozoa can
 cross the placenta to infect the fetus.  the disease may be asymptomatic
 after the baby is born, or it may be very severe.  toxo may cause blindness
 and mental retardation.
 
 having a cat in the same apartment should not be a problem; however, pregnant
 women should not scoop or change the cat's litterbox.  in addition, whoever
 does empty the litterbox should thoroughly wash his/her hands before handling
 anything else, especially food.
 
 information came from _the merck manual, 15th ed._
 
 i hope this information is helpful to you.
