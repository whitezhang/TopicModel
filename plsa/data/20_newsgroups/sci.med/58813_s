 i love the faq.       
 
 the comment about contact lenses not being an option for any remaining
 correction after rk and possibly after prk is interresting.  why is
 this?  does anyone know for sure whether this applies to prk as well?
 
 also, why is it possible to get a correction in prk with involvement of
 only about 5% of the corneal depth, while rk is done to a depth of up to
 95%?  why such a difference?  i thought the proceedures were simmilar
 with the exception of a laser being the cutting tool in prk.  i must not
 be understanding all of the differences.
 
 in the faq, the vision was considered less clear after the surgery than
 with glasses alone.  if this is completly attributable to the
 intentional slight undercorrection, then it can be compensated for when
 necessary with glasses (or contacts, if they can be worn afterall!).  it
 is important to know if that is not the case, however, and some other
 consequence of the surgery would often interfere with clear vision.  the
 first thing that came to my mind was a fogging of the lense, which
 glasses couldn't help. 
 
 would not help.
