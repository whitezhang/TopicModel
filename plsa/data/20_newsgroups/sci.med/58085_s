 
 i have a friend who has just been diagnosed with lupus, and i know nothing
 about this disease. the only thing i do know is that this is some sort of
 skin disease, and my friend shows no skin rashes - in fact, they used a 
 blood test to determine what had been wrong with an on going sacro-
 illiac joint problem. 
 i am finding a hard time finding information on this disease. could
 anyone please enlighten me as to the particulars of this disease. 
 please feel free to e-mail me at

 thanks in advance.
