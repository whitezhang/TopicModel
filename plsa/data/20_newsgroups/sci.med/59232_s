 rousseaua@immunex.com writes about heat shock proteins (hsp's) and dna.
 
 i hate to be derogatory, but in this case i think it's warranted.
 
 hsp's are part of the cellular response to stress.  the only reason they
 are called 'heat shock proteins' is because they were first demonstrated
 using heat shock.  dead tissue (ie. meat) is not going to produce any
 protein- because it's dead!  
 
 also, who cares if the dna you are ingesting is mutated!?  it will be 
 completely digested in your stomach, which is about ph 2.  
 
 some of you worry way too much.  eat a healthy, balanced diet and relax.
 
 my advice is, if you don't know what you are talking about, it is better
 to keep your mouth shut than to open it and remove all doubt about your
 ignorance.  don't speculate, or at least get some concrete information
 before you do!
