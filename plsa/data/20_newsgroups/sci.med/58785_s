 i had a similar reaction to chinese food but came to a completly different
 conclusion. i've eaten chinese food for ages and never had problems. i went
 with some chinese malaysian friends to a swanky chinses rest. and they ordered
 lots of stuff i had never seen before. the only thing i can remember of that
 meal was the first course, scallops served in the shell with a soy-type sauce.
 i thought, "well, i've only had scallops once and i was sick after but that
 could have been a coincidence". that night as i sat on the bathroom floor,
 sweating and emptying my stomach the hard way, i decided i would never touch
 another scallop. i may not be allergic but i don't want to take the chance.
