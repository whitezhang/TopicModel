 sounds to me like someone was pulling your leg.  there is only one way for
 pregnancy to occur: intercourse.  these days however there is also
 artificial insemination and implantation techniques, but we're speaking of
 "natural" acts here.  it is possible for pregnancy to occur if semen is
 deposited just outside of the vagina (i.e. coitus interruptus), but that's
 about at far as you can get.  through clothes -- no way.  better go talk
 to your biology teacher.
