 i think the question is: what is extra-scientific about this?  
 
 it has been a long time since anyone has proposed restrictions on
 where one comes up with ideas in order for them to be considered
 legitimate hypotheses.  the point, in short, is this: hypotheses and
 speculation in science may come from wild flights of fancy, 
 daydreams, ancient traditions, modern quackery, or anywhere else.
