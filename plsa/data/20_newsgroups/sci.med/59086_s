 
 what does a lack of taste of foods, or a sense of taste that seems "off"
 when eating foods in someone who has cancer mean? what are the possible
 causes of this? why does it happen?
 
 pt has stage ii breast cancer, and is taking tamoxifin. also has stage iv
 lung cancer with known cna metastasis, and is taking klonopin (also had
 cranial radiation treatments).
 
 thanks!
