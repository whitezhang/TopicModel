 perhaps i should quit eating mushrooms, soya beans, and brie cheese
 which all have msg in them.  it occurs naturally.
 
 i'm not going to quit eating something that i like just because
 it *might* cause me trouble later or causes problems in *some*
 people.  i would much rather avoid stress by not worrying over
 what goes in my mouth and not spending every day reading conflicting
 reports of what is good/bad for you.
 
 i may eat some things in quantities that may not be good for me.
 fine.  i've made my decision and i don't think it's appropriate
 for anyone to try to 'convert' me.  "it's for your own good" are
 the most obnoxious and harmful words, imo, in the english (or
 any other) language.

 i think it is.  i get tired of people saying 'don't eat x because
 it's bad!'  well, x may not be bad for everyone.  and even if
 it is, so what?  give people all the information but don't ram
 your decisions down their throats.
