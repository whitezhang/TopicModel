 chronic persistent hepatitis is usually diagnosed when someone does a liver
 biopsy on a patient that has persistently elevated serum transaminases months
 after a bout of acute viral hepatitis, or when someone is found to have
 persistently elevated transaminases on routine screening tests. the degree of
 elevation (in the serum transaminases) can be trivial, or as much as ten times
 normal. other blood chemistries are usually normal. 
 as a rule, patients with cph have no clinical signs of liver disease. 
 chronic active hepatitis can also be asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic, at
 least initially, and that's why it's important to tell them apart by means of
 a biopsy. the patient with cph only needs to be reassured. the patient with
 cah needs to be treated.
