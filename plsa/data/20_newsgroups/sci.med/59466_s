 
 my wife has requested that i poll the sages of usenet to see what is
 known about the use of chromium in weight-control diet suppliments.
 she has seen multiple products advertising it and would like any kind
 real information.
 
 my first impulse was "yuck! a metal!" but i have zero data on it.
 
 what do you know?
