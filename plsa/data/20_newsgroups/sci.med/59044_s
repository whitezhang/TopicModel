       a common, budding,  yeastlike, microscopic fungal      
       organism normally present in the mucous membranes of   
       the mouth, intestinal tract, and vagina and on the skin
       of healthy people. under certain circumstances, it may 
       cause superficial infections of the mouth or vagina    
       and, less commonly, serious invasive systemic infection
       and toxic reaction. see also candidiasis.

   another folk remedy receives the blessing of medical study.           
 researchers have found that eating a cup of yogurt a day drastically    
 reduces a woman's chances of getting vaginal candida, a yeast infection.
   for the year-long study, researchers at long island jewish medical    
 center in new hyde park, new york, recruited 13 women who suffered from 
 chronic yeast infections. for the first 6 months, the women each day ate
 8 ounces of yogurt containing lactobacillus acidophilus. for the second 
 6 months, the women did not eat yogurt. the researchers examined the    
 women each month and found that incidents of colonization and infection 
 were significantly lower during the period when the women ate yogurt.   
   the fungus candida albicans can live in the body without doing harm.  
 it is an overproliferation of the fungus that leads to infection. the   
 researchers concluded that the l. acidophilus bacteria found in some    
 brands of yogurt retard overgrowth of the fungus. streptococcus         
 thermophilus and l. bulgaricus are the two bacteria most commonly used  
 in commercial yogurt production. neither one appears to exert a         
 protective effect against candida albicans, however. women who want to  
 try yogurt as a preventive measure should choose a brand that lists     
 acidophilus in its contents.

   candida (monilia)                                                     
   this disease is usually caused by candida albicans, a fungus that we  
 all carry at one time or another. in some circumstances, though, the    
 organisms proliferate, producing symptomatic infection of the mouth,    
 intestines, vagina, or skin. when the mouth or vagina are infected, the 
 disease is commonly called thrush.                                      
   vaginitis caused by candida often afflicts women on birth control     
 pills or antibiotics. there is itching and a white, cheesy discharge.   
 among narcotic addicts, candida infections can lead to heart valve      
 inflammation.                                                           
   diagnosis of candida infections is confirmed by cultures and blood    
 tests. treatment can be with amphotericin b or orally with ketoconazole.
 there is no evidence that candida in the intestine of normal individuals
 leads to disease. all people at one time or another have candida in     
 their intestines. claims for any benefit from special diets or chronic  
 antifungal agents is not based on any solid evidence.
