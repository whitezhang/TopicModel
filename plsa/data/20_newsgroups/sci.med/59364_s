 it isn't bogus.  i had chronic vaginal yeast infections that would go away
 with cream but reappear in about 2 weeks.  i had been on 3 rounds of
 antibiotics for a resistant sinus infection and my husband had been on
 amoxicillin also for a sinus infection.  after six months of this, i went
 to a gynecologist who had me culture my husband seminal fluid.  after 7
 days incubation he had quite a bit of yeast growth (it was confirmed by
 the lab).  a round of nizerol for him cleared both of us.
