 hate to wreck your elaborate theory, but steve dyer is not an md.
 so professional jealosy over doctors who help their patients with
 nystatin, etc., can't very well come into the picture.  steve
 doesn't have any patients.

 yes, everyone who is normal does that.  we use candida on the other arm
 when we put a tuberculin test on.  if people don't react to candida,
 we assume the tb test was not conclusive since such people may not
 react to anything.  all normal people have antibodies to candida.
 if not, you would quickly turn into a fungus ball.

 you've just discovered one of the requirements for a good quack theory.
 find something that no one can *disprove* and then write a book saying
 it is the cause of whatever.  since no one can disprove it, you can
 rake in the bucks for quite some time.

 that is odd, isn't it?  why do you suppose it is that mds with these
 common problems don't go for these crazy ideas?  does the "professional
 jealosy" extend to suffering in silence, even though they know they
 could be cured if they just followed this quack book?
