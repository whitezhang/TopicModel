 this certainly describes my situation perfectly. for me there is
 a constant dynamic between my tendency to eat, which appears to
 be totally limitless, and the purely conscious desire to not
 put on too much weight. when i get too fat, i just diet/exercise
 more (with varying degrees of success) to take off the
 extra weight. usually i cycle within a 15 lb range, but
 smaller and larger cycles occur as well. i'm always afraid
 that this method will stop working someday, but usually
 i seem to be able to hold the weight gain in check.
 this is one reason i have a hard time accepting the notion
 of some metabolic derangement associated with cycle dieting
 (that results in long-term weight gain). i have been cycle-
 dieting for at least 20 years without seeing such a change.
 
 i think a vigorous exercise program can go a long way toward
 keeping the cycles smaller and the baseline weight low.
