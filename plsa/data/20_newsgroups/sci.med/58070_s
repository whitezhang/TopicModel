 the differential diagnosis between migraine and non-migranous pain
 is not *always* important, because some therapies are effective in
 both (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline,
 non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen).  other
 therapies may be more specific: beta-blockers such as propranolol
 work better in migraine than tension-type headache.
 
 the most important thing, from your perspective, is that you got
 relief.  also, please understand that a diagnosis other than
 migraine does not necessarily mean "psychogenic"; i suspect that
 organic factors play as large a role in tension-type headache as in
 migraine.
