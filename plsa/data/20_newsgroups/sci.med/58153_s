 there is a mini-epidemic of coccidiodes that is occurring in,
 i believe, the owen's valley/ bishop area east of the sierras.
 i don't believe there has been any great insight into the
 increased incidence in that area. there is a low-level
 of endemic infection in that region. many people with
 evidence of past exposure to the organism did not have
 serious disease.
