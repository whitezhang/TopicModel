 i've mentioned this study a couple of times now: ingestion of yogurt
 containing lactobacillus acidophilus as prophylaxis for candidal
 vaginitis, annals of internal medicine, 3/1/92 116(5):353-7.  do you
 have a problem with the study because they used yogurt rather than
 capsules of lactobacillus (even though it had positive results)?
 
 the study was a crossover trial of daily ingestion of 8 ounces of
 yogurt.  there was a marked decrease in infections while women were
 ingesting the yogurt.  problems with the study included very small
 numbers (33 patients enrolled) and many protocol violations (only
 21 patients were analyzed).  still, the difference in rates of infection
 between the two groups was so large that the study remains fairly
 believable.
