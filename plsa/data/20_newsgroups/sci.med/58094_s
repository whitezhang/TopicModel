 i just found out about the sublinguals disappearing too.  i don't
 know why.  perhaps because they weren't as profitable as cafergot.
 too bad, since tablets are sometimes vomited up by migraine patients
 and they don't do any good flushed down the toilet.  i suspect
 we'll be moving those patients more and more to the dhe nasal
 spray, which is far more effective.
