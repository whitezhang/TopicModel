 yes, there is such a thing as eye dominance, although i am not sure if
 this dominance refers to perscription strength.
 
 as i recall, if you selectively close your dominant eye, you will percieve
 that the image shifts. this will not happen if you close your other eye.
 
 i believe that which eye is dominant is related to handedness, but i
 can't recall the relation at the moment.
