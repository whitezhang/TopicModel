 i'm interested in this from the other angle: what antihistamine can i
 take at bedtime for relief of allergies, with the assurance that its
 sedative effect will have completely worn off by the next morning, but
 preferably with the anti-allergy effect lasting longer?
 
 i'm thinking mainly of otc products. which has the least duration of
 sedative action: benadryl, chlor-trimeton, or what?
 note that i'm asking about duration, not intensity.
