 
      following a series of miscarriages, my wife was given a transfusion of
 my white cells. (the theory as i understand it is that there is some kind
 of immune blocking that prevents the body from attacking the pregnancy as
 it normally would a "foreign" body. where this blocking is deficient, the
 body evicts the "intruder", resulting in a miscarriage. the white cells
 apparently enhance the blocking capability.) following the transfusion, she
 successfully carried the next pregnancy to term, and jake is now an active
 9 month-old who cannot wait to walk.
      we're now thinking about having another child, but no one (including
 the obgyn who supervised the first transfusion) really seems to know
 whether or not the transfusion process needs to be repeated for successive
 pregnancies.
      is there anyone in net-land who has experience with this?
 thanks...gene (and jane and jake)
 
 p.s. i've also posted this in misc.kids.
