 
 i think you must have the same hygiene teacher i had in 1955.  there 
 is a story about the civil war about a soldier who was shot in the
 groin.  the bullet, after passing through one of his testes, then entered
 the abdomen of a young woman standing nearby.  later,  when she (a young
 woman of unimpeachible virtue) was shown to be pregnant; the soldier did
 the honorable thing of marrying her.  according to this story, they lived
 happily ever after.  
 perhaps the most famous of mr. rau's classes was the time he would come
 into class brandishing an aluminum turning mandrel  (tapering from about
 3/8" to 1/2" over a 10 inch length).  he would say, "boys, do you know
 what this is?  it's a medical instrument called a 'cock reamer' and it's
 used to unclog your penis when you have vd.  they just ram it up there
 without an anesthetic!"  needless to say this had a chilling effect.
 i didn't have lascivious thoughts for at least an hour.  later in life
 as i perused medical instrument catelogs and saw the slender flexible
 urethral sounds that are actually used, i could not escape thinking
 that i might one day see, "reamer, cock (style of rau) ."
