 it is one thing to be open-minded about phenomona that have not
 be demonstrated to be false, and quite another to "believe" in
 something like krilian photography, where *all* the claimed effects
 have be demonstrated to be artifacts.  there is no longer any reason
 to adopt a "wait and see" attitude about krilian photography, it
 has been experimentally shown to be nothing but simple coronal
 discharge.  the "auras" shown by missing leaf parts came from 
 moisture left by the original whole leaf, for example.  
 
 that's what science is, son.
