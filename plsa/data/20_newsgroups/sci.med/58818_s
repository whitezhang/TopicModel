 i think we agree on much.  however the paragraphs above seem to repeat
 uncritically the standard kuhn/lakatos/feyerabend view of "progress" and
 "rationality" in science.  since i've addressed these issues in this
 newsgroup in the not too distant past, i won't go into them again now.
 
 what is wrong with the above observation is that it explicitly gives the
 impression (and you may not in fact hold this view) that the common (perhaps
 even the "correct") approach for a scientist to follow is to sit around
 having flights of fancy and scheming on the basis of his jealousies and
 petty hatreds.  it further at least implicitly advances the position that
 sciences goes "forward" (and it is not clear what this means given the
 context in which it occurs) by generating in a completely non-rational
 and even random way a plethora of hypotheses and theories that are then
 weeded out via the "critical function" of science.  (though why this critical
 function should be less subject to the non-rational forces is a mystery.
 if experimental design, hypotheses creation, and theory construction are
 subject to jealousies and petty hatreds, then this must be equally true
 of the application of any "critical function" concerning replication.
 this is what leads one (ala feyerabend) to an "anything goes" view.)
 
 true, the generation part *can* be totally irrational.  but typically it is
 *not*.  anecdotes concerning instances where a hypothesis seems to have
 resulted in some way from a dream or from one's political views simply
 do not generalize well to the actual history of science.
