 
 i heard a short blurb on the news yesterday about an herb called feverfew (?)
 that some say is good for preventing migraines. i think the news said there
 were two double-blind studies that found this effective.
 
 does anyone know about these studies? or have experience with feverfew?
 i'm skeptical, but open to trying it if i can find out more about this.
 what is feverfew, and how much would you take to prevent migraines (if 
 this is a good idea, that is)? are there any known risks or side effects
 of feverfew? 
 
 thanks in advance for any info!
