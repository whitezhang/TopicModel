 obviously, it wouldn't be of much help to treat one problem by knowingly 
 introducing another.  cancer mestastizes.  my imperfect understanding of 
 the facts are that gonadal cancer is particularly dangerous in this regard. 
 i haven't done the research on it, but i don't recall ever hearing of a 
 case of cancer being transmitted by a blood transfusion.  probably just a 
 common sense kind of arbitrary precaution.  transmissable diseases like 
 malaria though are obviously another story.
