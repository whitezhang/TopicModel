 and to add further fuel to the flame war, i read about 20 years ago that
 the "natural" msg - extracted from the sources you mention above - does not
 cause the reported aftereffects; it's only that nasty "artificial" msg -
 extracted from coal tar or whatever - that causes chinese restaurant
 syndrome.  i find this pretty hard to believe; has anyone else heard it?
