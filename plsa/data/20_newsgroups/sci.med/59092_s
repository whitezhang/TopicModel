 listen: thrush is a recognized clinical syndrome with definite
 characteristics.  if you have thrush, you have thrush, because you can
 see the lesions and do a culture and when you treat it, it generally
 responds well, if you're not otherwise immunocompromised.  noring's
 anal-retentive idee fixe on having a fungal infection in his sinuses
 is not even in the same category here, nor are these walking neurasthenics
 who are convinced they have "candida" from reading a quack book.
