 being a chronic hbsag carrier does not necessarily mean the patient has chronic
 persistent anything. persons who are chronic carriers may have no clinical,
 biochemical, or histologic evidence of liver disease, or they may have chronic
 persistent hepatitis, chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis, or hepatocellular
 carcinoma.
 
 most cases of chronic persistent hepatitis (cph) are probably the result of
 a viral infection, although in a good number of cases the cause cannot be
 determined. the diagnosis of cph is made on the basis of liver biopsy. it
 consists of findings of portal inflammation, an intact periportal limiting
 plate, and on occasion isolated foci of intralobular necrosis. but in contrast
 to chronic active hepatitis (cah) there is no periportal inflammation, 
 bridging necrosis, or fibrosis. 
 
 cph has, indeed, an excellent prognosis. if i had to choose between cah and
 cph there is no question i would also choose cph. however, as david pointed
 out, the distinction between the two is not as neat as some of us would have
 it. the histology can sometimes be pretty equivocal, with biopsies showing
 areas compatible with both cph and cah. maybe it is a sampling problem. maybe
 it is a continuum. i don't know.
