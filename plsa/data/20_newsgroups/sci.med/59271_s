 which points up the "studies" made by amateurs:  did you also check every time
 you did *not* get sick?  "no," you say?  why not check every thing you eat when
 you don't get sick and find out how much msg you're actually consuming?
 
 => all that's needed now is that final step, a double-blind study done
 => on humans.  there isn't even an ethical question about "possible
 => harm", as this is a widely used and approved food additive.

 if you knew enough about what the test was about to decide that you didn't want
 to participate because it involved msg, you'd've already made yourself
 ineligible (since msg is detectable by taste). how can anybody be so clueless
 as to what double blind studies are all about?
