 i saw a lifetime medical television show a few months back on travel
 medicine.  it briefly mentioned some drugs which when started two or
 three days before getting to altitude could assist in acclimitazation.
 
 unfortunately all that i can recall is that the drug stimulated
 breathing at night???  i don't know if that makes sense, it seems
 to me that the new drug which stimulates red blood cell production
 would be a more logical approach, erythropoiten (sp?).
 
 alas, i didn't record the program, but wish i had, since i live
 at over 7000ft. and my mother gets sick when visiting.
 
 please let me know if you get more informative responses.
