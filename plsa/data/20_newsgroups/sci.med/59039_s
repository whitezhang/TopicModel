 absolutely.  unfortunately, most of them have had 3 weeks of neurology
 in medical school and 1 month (maybe) in their residency.  most
 of that is done in the hospital where migraines rarely are seen.
 where are they supposed to learn?  those who are diligent and
 read do learn, but most don't, unfortunately.

 we are the only ones, sometimes, who have enough interest in headaches
 to spend the time to get enough history to diagnose them.  too often,
 the primary care physician hears "headache" and loses interest in
 anything but giving the patient analgesics and getting them out of
 the office so they can get on to something more interesting.
 
 
 >(i am excepting migraine, which is arguably neurologic).  headaches
 
 i hope you meant "inarguably".
