 the acquisition of scientific knowledge is completely scientific.  the
 application of that knowledge in individual cases may be more art than
 science.

 certainly we don't have all the answers.  the question is, what is the
 most reliable means of acquiring further medical knowledge?  the
 scientific method has proven itself to be reliable.  the *only* reason
 alternative therapies are shunned by physicians is that their
 practitioners refuse to submit their theories to rigorous scientific
 scrutiny, insisting that "tradition" or anecdotal evidence are
 sufficient.  these have been shown many times in the past to be very
 unreliable ways of acquiring reliable knowledge.  crook's ideas have
 never been backed up by scientific evidence.  his unwillingness to do
 good science makes the rest of us doubt the veracity of his contentions.
