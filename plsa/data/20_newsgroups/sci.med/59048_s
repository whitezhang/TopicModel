 does the bates method work?  i first heard about it in this newsgroup 
 several years ago, and i have just got hold of a book, "how to improve your
 sight - simple daily drills in relaxation", by margaret d. corbett, 
 ('authorized instructor of the bates method), published in 1953.  it 
 talks about vision improvement by relaxation and exercise.  has there been
 any study on whether this method actually works?  if it works, is it by 
 actually shortening the previously elongated eyeball, or by increasing 
 the lens's ability to flatten itself in order to compensate for the 
 too-long eyeball?
 
 since myopia is the result of eyeball elongation, seems to me the most
 logical approach for correction is to find a way to reverse the process,
 i.e., shorten it somehow (preferably non-surgically).  has there been
 any recent studies on this?  where can i find them?  i know rk works by 
 changing the curvature of the cornea to compensate for the shape of 
 eyeball, but if there is a way to train the muscles to shorten the 
 eyeball back to its correct length that would be even better (bates's 
 idea, right?)
 
 thanks for any information.
