 i hope this is the correct newsgroup for this.
 
 what is the scoop on methanol and its future as an alternative fuel for
 vehicles ?  how does it compare to ethanol ?
 
 there was some news about health risks involved.  anybody know about
 that.  how does the us clean air act impact the use of methanol by the
 year 1995 ?
 
 i think its methyl tertiary butyl ether which the future industries will
 use as a substitute for conventional fuels.
 
 there is company methanex which produces 12% of the world's supply of
 methanol. does anybody know about it ?
 
 please reply by e-mail as i do not read these newsgroups.
 
 thanks in advance.
