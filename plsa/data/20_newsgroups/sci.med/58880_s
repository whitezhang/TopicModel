 i have bad luck and got a vd called <granuloma ingunale>, which involves
 the growth of granules in the groin.  i found out about it by checking medicine
 books and i found the prescriptions.  and i know i can just go to a clinic to
 get it cured.  but unfortunately i am serving my duty in the army right now and
 i think it's impossible to prevent anyone from knowing this if i take leaves 
 every day for two weeks for treatment.  thus i bought the prescribed tablets
 at some drugstore, but to cure it i must get injection of <streptomycin>, with
 a dose of 1g every 12 hours, for at least 10 days.  i can probably buy the 
 tools and this solution somewhere but i don't know how to do injection by myself
 !
 can any kind people here tell me:
 
 if it's possible to do it? can i do it on my arm? or it must be done on the hip
 only??  any info is welcome and please write me or post your help soon!! (i am
 already taking the tablets ..and i can't wait!!)
 
 please don't flame me for posting this, and don't judge me. i've learned a 
 lesson and all i need now is real medical help.
