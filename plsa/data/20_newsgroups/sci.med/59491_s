 
 i have just started taking allergy shots a month ago and is 
 still wondering what i am getting into. a friend of mine told
 me that the body change every 7 years (whatever that means)
 and i don't need those antibody-building allergy shots at all.
 does that make sense to anyone?
 
 btw, can someone summarize what is in the consumer report
 february, 1988 article?
