 a placebo is an accepted treatment at times.

 why should it?  placebos are effective under certain circumstances.  that's
 why they're used.  
 
 actually, i don't know know anyone who has actually gotten a "sugar pill".
 i don't know how it could be done, since prescription drugs are always
 labeled, and it's easy enough to find out what's in a pill if you have the
 name.
 
 it's more common to prescribe a drug which is effective for something, just
 not for what you have.  antibiotics for viral infections are the most
 common such placebo.

 i'm not sure what you mean by this.  what do you think you're paying for?
 you're not entitled to a prescription drug just because you pay for a
 doctor's appointment.
