 greg,
 no flame intended, but i think you just missed one of the rare attempts of
 humor in sci.skeptic.
 "krillean" against "kirilian". get it?
 ;-)
 
 btw, i think you're a bit of base yourself, since, to my knowledge, the
 electromagnetic field around a stone is rather abscent. but still, a stone
 has a nice "aura" on the kirilian photographs.
 
 don't remember excactly, but "corona discharge" i think is a more fitting
 expression than aura. think you'll find something on this in the skeptic-faq.
 
 
 cheers,
