 nutrasweet is a synthetic sweetener a couple thousand times sweeter than
 sugar.  some people are concerned about the chemicals that the  body produces 
 when it degrades nutrasweet.  it is thought to form formaldehyde and known to
 for methanol in the degredation pathway that the body uses to eliminate 
 substances.  the real issue is whether the levels of methanol and formaldehyde
 produced are high enough to cause significant damage, as both are toxic to
 living cells.  all i can say is that i will not consume it.  
 
 phenylalanine is
 nothing for you to worry about.  it is an amino acid, and everyone uses small
 quantities of it for protein synthesis in the body.  some people have a disease
 known as phenylketoneurea, and they are missing the enzyme necessary to 
 degrade this compound and eliminate it from the body.  for them, it will 
 accumulate in the body, and in high levels this is toxic to growing nerve
 cells.  therefore, it is only a major problem in young children (until around
 age 10 or so) or women who are pregnant and have this disorder.  it used to
 be a leading cause of brain damage in infants, but now it can be easily 
 detected at birth, and then one must simply avoid comsumption of phenylalanine
 as a child, or when pregnant.
