 i remember hearing a few years back about a new therapy for hyperactivity
 which involved aggressively eliminating artificial coloring and flavoring
 from the diet.  the theory -- which was backed up by interesting anecdotal
 results -- is that certain people are just way more sensitive to these
 chemicals than other people.  i don't remember any connection being made
 with seizures, but it certainly couldn't hurt to try an all-natural diet.
