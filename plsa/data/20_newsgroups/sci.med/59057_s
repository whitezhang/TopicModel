 can someone tell me whether or not any of the following medications 
 has been linked to rapid/excessive weight gain and/or a distorted 
 sense of taste or smell:  hismanal; azmacort (a topical steroid to 
 prevent asthma); vancenase.
 
 also:
 you may have guessed, i'm an allergy sufferer--but i'm beginning to 
 suspect i'm also the victim of a dr. toliberal with the prescription 
 p. the allergist i went to last oct. simply inquired about my symptons 
 ( i was suffering chronic asthma attacks), gave me a battery of 
 allergy tests, and went down a checklist of drugs (a photocopied 
 sheet).  i've gained out 30 lbs. since then though i haven't eaten 
 more or much differently than before; i'vsuffered depression; , 
 fatigue; and i've experienced a foul smell and sense of taste for 
 about the last two months.  i mentioned the lack of smell and taste to 
 this dr. in feb. and he said my sinuses did look a bit swollen (he 
 just looked up my nose with his little light--the same one used for 
 ears), and prescribed prednisone and sulfatrim ds (severe headaches 
 and a rash resulted, particularly after my week's worth of prednisone 
 ran out).  now he wants to do a rhinoscopy to see if i have a bleeding 
 ulcer or polyps in my sinus cavities.  i'm considering seeing another 
 doctor.  any suggestions/advice?  i'd really appreciate it!
