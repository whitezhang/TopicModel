 no, the neiseria meningococcus is one of the most common
 forms of meningitis.  it's the one that sometimes sweeps
 schools or boot camp.  it is contagious and kills by attacking
 the covering of the brain, causing the blood vessels to thrombose
 and the brain to swell up.
 
 it is very treatable if caught in time.  there isn't much time,
 however.  the rash is the tip off.  infants are very susceptible
 to dying from bacterial meningitis.  any infant with a fever who
 becomes stiff or lethargic needs to be rushed to a hospital where
 a spinal tap will show if they have meningitis.  seizures can also
 occur.

 it can live in the throat of carriers.  don't worry, you won't get 
 it from them, especially if they took the medication.
