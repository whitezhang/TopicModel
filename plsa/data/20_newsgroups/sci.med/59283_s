                rates of cesarean delivery -- united states, 1991
                =================================================
                    source: mmwr 42(15)   date: apr 23, 1993
 
      cesarean deliveries have accounted for nearly 1 million of the 
 approximately 4 million annual deliveries in the united states since 1986 
 (table 1). the cesarean rate in the united states is the third highest among 
 21 reporting countries, exceeded only by brazil and puerto rico (1). this 
 report presents data on cesarean deliveries from cdc's national hospital 
 discharge survey (nhds) for 1991 and compares these data with previous years. 
      data on discharges from short-stay, nonfederal hospitals have been 
 collected annually since 1965 in the nhds, conducted by cdc's national center 
 for health statistics. for 1991, medical and demographic information were 
 abstracted from a sample of 274,000 inpatients discharged from 484 
 participating hospitals. the 1991 cesareans and vaginal births after a prior 
 cesarean (vbac) presented in this report are based on weighted national 
 estimates from the nhds sample of approximately 31,000 (11%) women discharged 
 after delivery. the estimated numbers of live births by type of delivery were 
 calculated by applying cesarean rates from the nhds to live births from 
 national vital registration data. therefore, estimates of the number of 
 cesareans in this report will not agree with previously published data based 
 solely on the nhds (2). stated differences in this analysis are significant at 
 the 95% confidence level, based on the two-tailed t-test with a critical value 
 of 1.96. 
      in 1991, there were 23.5 cesareans per 100 deliveries, the same rate as 
 in 1990 and similar to rates during 1986-1989 (table 1). the primary cesarean 
 rate (i.e., number of first cesareans per 100 deliveries to women who had no 
 previous cesareans) for 1986-1991 also was stable, ranging from 16.8 to 17.5. 
 in 1991, the cesarean rate in the south was 27.6, significantly (p<0.05) 
 higher than the rates for the west (19.8), midwest (21.8), and northeast 
 (22.6). rates were higher for mothers aged greater than or equal to 30 years 
 than for younger women; in proprietary hospitals than in nonprofit or 
 government hospitals; in hospitals with fewer than 300 beds than in larger 
 hospitals; and for deliveries for which blue cross/blue shield * and other 
 private insurance is the expected source of payment than for other sources of 
 payment (table 2). the same pattern characterized primary cesarean deliveries. 
      since the early 1970s, the number and percentage of births to older women 
 increased; however, if the age distribution of mothers in 1991 had remained 
 the same as in 1986, the overall cesarean rate in 1991 would have been 23.3, 
 essentially the same as the 23.5 observed. 
      based on the nhds, of the approximately 4,111,000 live births in 1991, an

 estimated 966,000 (23.5%) were by cesarean delivery. of these, an estimated 
 338,000 (35.0%) births were repeat cesareans, and 628,000 (65.0%) were primary 
 cesareans. since 1986, approximately 600,000 primary cesareans have been 
 performed annually. in 1986, 8.5% of women who had a previous cesarean 
 delivered vaginally, compared with 24.2% in 1991. of all cesareans in 1991, 
 35.0% were associated with a previous cesarean, 30.4% with dystocia (i.e., 
 failure of labor to progress), 11.7% with breech presentation, 9.2% with fetal 
 distress, and 13.7% with all other specified complications. 
      the average hospital stay for all deliveries in 1991 was 2.8 days. in 
 comparison, the hospital stay for a primary cesarean delivery was 4.5 days, 
 and for a repeat cesarean, 4.2 days -- nearly twice the duration for vbac 
 deliveries (2.2 days) or for vaginal deliveries that were not vbacs (2.3 
 days). in 1986, the average hospital stay for all deliveries was 3.2 days, for 
 primary cesareans 5.2 days, for repeat cesareans 4.7 days, and for vbac and 
 non-vbac vaginal deliveries 2.7 and 2.6 days, respectively. 
 
 reported by: office of vital and health statistics systems, national center 
 for health statistics, cdc. 
 
 editorial note: the cesarean rate in the united states steadily increased from 
 1965 through 1986; however, the findings in this report indicate that rates 
 have been stable since 1986 (3). because there is little evidence that 
 maternal and child health status has improved during this time and because 
 cesareans are associated with an increased risk for complications of 
 childbirth, a national health objective for the year 2000 (4) is to reduce the 
 overall cesarean rate to 15 or fewer per 100 deliveries and the primary 
 cesarean rate to 12 or fewer per 100 deliveries (objective 14.8). 
      postpartum complications -- including urinary tract and wound infections 
 -- may account in part for the longer hospital stays for cesarean deliveries 
 than for vaginal births (5). moreover, the prolonged hospital stays for 
 cesarean deliveries substantially increase health-care costs. for example, in 
 1991, the average costs for cesarean and vaginal deliveries were $7826 and 
 $4720, respectively. the additional cost for each cesarean delivery includes 
 $611 for physician fees and $2495 for hospital charges (6). if the cesarean 
 rate in 1991 had been 15 (the year 2000 objective) instead of 23.5, the number 
 of cesarean births would have decreased by 349,000 (617,000 versus 966,000), 
 resulting in a savings of more than $1 billion in physician fees and hospital 
 charges. 
      despite the steady increase in vbac rates since 1986, several factors may 
 impede progress toward the year 2000 national health objectives for cesarean 
 delivery. for example, vbac rates substantially reflect the number of women 
 offered trial of labor, which has been increasingly encouraged since 1982 (7). 
 of women who are offered a trial of labor, 50%-70% could deliver vaginally (7) 
 --a level already achieved by many hospitals (8). trial of labor was routinely 
 offered in 46% of hospitals surveyed in 1984 (the most recent year for which

 national data are available) (9) when the vbac rate (according to nhds data) 
 was 5.7%. the year 2000 objective specifies a vbac rate of 35%, based on all 
 women who had a prior cesarean, regardless of whether a trial of labor was 
 attempted. to reach the overall cesarean rate goal, however, increases in the 
 vbac rate will need to be combined with a substantial reduction in the primary 
 rate. 
      one hospital succeeded in reducing the rate of cesarean delivery by 
 applying objective criteria for the four most common indications for cesarean 
 delivery, by requiring a second opinion, and by instituting a peer-review 
 process (10). other recommendations for decreasing cesarean delivery rates 
 include eliminating incentives for physicians and hospitals by equalizing 
 reimbursement for vaginal and cesarean deliveries; public dissemination of 
 physician- and hospital-specific cesarean delivery rates to increase public 
 awareness of differences in practices; and addressing malpractice concerns, 
 which may be an important factor in maintaining the high rates of cesarean 
 delivery (4).

          malaria among u.s. embassy personnel -- kampala, uganda, 1992
          =============================================================
                    source: mmwr 42(15)   date: apr 23, 1993
 
      the treatment and prevention of malaria in africa has become a 
 challenging and complex problem because of increasing drug resistance. 
 although the risk of acquiring malaria for u.s. citizens and their dependents 
 stationed overseas generally has been low, this risk varies substantially and 
 unpredictably. during may 1992, the office of medical services, department of 
 state (oms/dos), and cdc were notified of an increased number of malaria cases 
 among official u.s. personnel stationed in kampala, uganda. a review of the 
 health records from the embassy health unit (ehu) in kampala indicated that 27 
 cases of malaria were diagnosed in official personnel from march through june 
 1992 compared with two cases during the same period in 1991. ehu, oms/dos, and 
 cdc conducted an investigation to confirm all reported malaria cases and 
 identify potential risk factors for malaria among u.s. embassy personnel. this 
 report summarizes the results of the investigation. 
      malaria blood smears from 25 of the 27 reported case-patients were 
 available for review by oms/dos and cdc. a case of malaria was confirmed if 
 the slide was positive for plasmodium sp. of the 25 persons, 17 were slide-
 confirmed as having malaria. 
      a questionnaire was distributed to all persons served by the ehu to 
 obtain information about residence, activities, use of malaria 
 chemoprophylaxis, and use of personal protection measures (i.e., using bednets 
 and insect repellents, having window and door screens, and wearing long 
 sleeves and pants in the evening). of the 157 persons eligible for the survey, 
 128 (82%) responded. 
      risk for malaria was not associated with sex or location of residence in 
 kampala. although the risk for malaria was higher among children aged less 
 than or equal to 15 years (6/32 19%) than among persons greater than 15 
 years (11/94 12%), this difference was not significant (relative risk 
 rr=1.6; 95% confidence interval ci=0.6-4.0). eighty-two percent of the 
 cases occurred among persons who had been living in kampala for 1-5 years, 
 compared with those living there less than 1 year. travel outside of the 
 kampala area to more rural settings was not associated with increased risk for 
 malaria. 
      four malaria chemoprophylaxis regimens were used by persons who 
 participated in the survey: mefloquine, chloroquine and proguanil, chloroquine 
 alone, and proguanil alone. in addition, 23 (18%) persons who responded were 
 not using any malaria chemoprophylaxis. the risk for malaria was significantly 
 lower among persons using either mefloquine or chloroquine and proguanil (8/88 
 9%) than among persons using the other regimens or no prophylaxis (9/37 
 24%) (rr=0.4; 95% ci=0.2-0.9). twelve persons not using prophylaxis reported 
 side effects or fear of possible side effects as a reason. 
      the risk for malaria was lower among persons who reported using bednets 
 
 hicnet medical newsletter                                              page  5
 volume  6, number 11                                           april 25, 1993
 
 all or most of the time (2/27 7%) than among persons who sometimes or rarely 
 used bednets (15/99 15%) (rr=0.5; 95% ci=0.1-2.0). the risk for malaria was 
 also lower among persons who consistently used insect repellent in the evening 
 (0/16), compared with those who rarely used repellent (17/110 15%) (rr=0; 
 upper 95% confidence limit=1.2). risk for malaria was not associated with 
 failure to have window or door screens or wear long sleeves or pants in the 
 evening. 
      as a result of this investigation, ehu staff reviewed with all personnel 
 the need to use and comply with the recommended malaria chemoprophylaxis 
 regimens. ehu staff also emphasized the need to use personal protection 
 measures and made plans to obtain insecticide-impregnated bednets and to 
 provide window and door screens for all personnel.

 editorial note: in uganda, the increase in malaria among u.s. personnel was 
 attributed to poor adherence to both recommended malaria chemoprophylaxis 
 regimens and use of personal protection measures during a period of increased 
 malaria transmission and intensified chloroquine resistance in sub-saharan 
 africa. the findings in this report underscore the need to provide initial and 
 continued counseling regarding malaria prevention for persons living abroad in 
 malaria-endemic areas -- preventive measures that are also important for 
 short-term travelers to such areas. 
      mefloquine is an effective prophylaxis regimen in africa and in most 
 other areas with chloroquine-resistant p. falciparum; however, in some areas 
 (e.g., thailand), resistance to mefloquine may limit its effectiveness. in 
 africa, the efficacy of mefloquine, compared with chloroquine alone, in 
 preventing infection with p. falciparum is 92% (1 ). mefloquine is safe and 
 well tolerated when given at 250 mg per week over a 2-year period. the risk 
 for serious adverse reactions possibly associated with mefloquine prophylaxis 
 (e.g., psychosis and convulsions) is low (i.e., 1.3-1.9 episodes per 100,000 
 users 2), while the risk for less severe adverse reactions (e.g., dizziness, 
 gastrointestinal complaints, and sleep disturbances) is similar to that for 
 other antimalarial chemoprophylactics (1). 
      doxycycline has similar prophylactic efficacy to mefloquine, but the need 
 for daily dosing may reduce compliance with and effectiveness of this regimen 
 (3,4). chloroquine alone is not effective as prophylaxis in areas of intense 
 chloroquine resistance (e.g., southeast asia and africa). in africa, for 
 persons who cannot take mefloquine or doxycycline, chloroquine and proguanil 
 is an alternative, although less effective, regimen. chloroquine should be 
 used for malaria prevention in areas only where chloroquine-resistant p. 
 falciparum has not been reported.

       fda approval of use of a new haemophilus b conjugate vaccine and a
        combined diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis and haemophilus b conjugate
                        vaccine for infants and children

      haemophilus influenzae type b (hib) conjugate vaccines have been 
 recommended for use in infants since 1990, and their routine use in infant 
 vaccination has contributed to the substantial decline in the incidence of hib 
 disease in the united states (1-3). vaccines against diphtheria, tetanus, and 
 pertussis during infancy and childhood have been administered routinely in the 
 united states since the late 1940s and has been associated with a greater than 
 90% reduction in morbidity and mortality associated with infection by these 
 organisms. because of the increasing number of vaccines now routinely 
 recommended for infants, a high priority is the development of combined 
 vaccines that allow simultaneous administration with fewer separate 
 injections. 
      the food and drug administration (fda) recently licensed two new products 
 for vaccinating children against these diseases: 1) the haemophilus b 
 conjugate vaccine (tetanus toxoid conjugate, acthib trademark), * for 
 vaccination against hib disease only and 2) a combined diphtheria and tetanus 
 toxoids and whole-cell pertussis vaccine (dtp) and hib conjugate vaccine 
 (tetramune trademark), a combination of vaccines formulated for use in 
 vaccinating children against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and hib disease. 
 
                                acthib trademark 
 
      on march 30, 1993, the fda approved a new haemophilus b conjugate 
 vaccine, polyribosylribitol phosphate-tetanus toxoid conjugate (prp-t), 
 manufactured by pasteur merieux serum et vaccins and distributed as acthib 
 trademark by connaught laboratories, inc. (swiftwater, pennsylvania). this 
 vaccine has been licensed for use in infants in a three-dose primary 
 vaccination series administered at ages 2, 4, and 6 months. previously 
 unvaccinated infants 7-11 months of age should receive two doses 2 months 
 apart. previously unvaccinated children 12-14 months of age should receive one 
 dose. a booster dose administered at 15 months of age is recommended for all 
 children. previously unvaccinated children 15-59 months of age should receive 
 a single dose and do not require a booster. more than 90% of infants receiving 
 a primary vaccination series of acthib trademark (consecutive doses at 2, 4, 
 and 6 months of age) develop a geometric mean titer of anti-haemophilus b 
 polysaccharide antibody greater than 1 ug/ml (4). this response is similar to 
 that of infants who receive recommended series of previously licensed 
 haemophilus b conjugate vaccines for which efficacy has been demonstrated in 
 prospective trials. two u.s. efficacy trials of prp-t were terminated early 
 because of the concomitant licensure of other haemophilus b conjugate vaccines

 for use in infants (4). in these studies, no cases of invasive hib disease 
 were detected in approximately 6000 infants vaccinated with prp-t. these and 
 other studies suggest that the efficacy of prp-t vaccine will be similar to 
 that of the other licensed hib vaccines. tetramune trademark 
      on march 30, 1993, the fda approved a combined diphtheria and tetanus 
 toxoids and whole-cell pertussis vaccine (dtp) and haemophilus b conjugate 
 vaccine. tetramune trademark, available from lederle-praxis biologicals (pearl 
 river, new york), combines two previously licensed products, dtp (triimmunol 
 registered, manufactured by lederle laboratories pearl river, new york) and 
 haemophilus b conjugate vaccine (hibtiter registered, manufactured by praxis 
 biologics, inc. rochester, new york). 
      this vaccine has been licensed for use in children aged 2 months-5 years 
 for protection against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and hib disease when 
 indications for vaccination with dtp vaccine and haemophilus b conjugate 
 vaccine coincide. based on demonstration of co mparable or higher antibody 
 responses to each of the components of the two vaccines, tetramune trademark 
 is expected to provide protection against hib, as well as diphtheria, tetanus, 
 and pertussis, equivalent to that of already licensed formulations of other 
 dtp and haemophilus b vaccines. 
      the advisory committee for immunization practices (acip) recommends that 
 all infants receive a primary series of one of the licensed haemophilus b 
 conjugate vaccines beginning at 2 months of age and a booster dose at age 12-
 15 months (5). the acip also recommends that all infants receive a four-dose 
 primary series of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis vaccine at 2, 
 4, 6, and 15-18 months of age, and a booster dose at 4-6 years (6-8). a 
 complete statement regarding recommendations for use of acthib trademark and 
 tetramune trademark is being developed.

      at the second international workshop on the oral manifestations of hiv 
 infection, held january 31-february 3 in san francisco, participants explored 
 issues related to the epidemiology, basic molecular virology, mucosal 
 immunology, and oral clinical presentations of hiv infection. 
      the workshop was organized by dr. john greenspan and dr. deborah 
 greenspan of the department of stomatology, school of dentistry, university of 
 california, san francisco.  an international steering committee and scientific 
 program committee provided guidance. 
      the conference drew more than 260 scientists from 39 countries, including 
 asia, africa, europe, central america, south america, as well as the united 
 states and canada.  support tor the workshop was provided by the national 
 institute of dental research, the national cancer institute, the national 
 institute of allergy and infectious diseases, the nih office of aids research, 
 and the procter and gamble company. 
      among the topics discussed were: the epidemiology of hiv lesions; ethics, 
 professional responsibility, and public policy; occupational issues; provision 
 of oral care to the hiv-positive population; salivary hiv transmission and 
 mucosal immunity; opportunistic infections; pediatric hiv infection; and 
 women's issues. 
 
                                 recommendations
 
      recommendations emerged from the workshop to define the association 
 between the appearance of oral lesions and rate of progression of hiv, to 
 establish a universal terminology for hiv-associated oral lesions, to look for 
 more effective treatments for oral manifestations, to expand molecular biology 
 studies to understand the relationship between hiv infection and common oral 
 lesions, and to study the effects of hiv therapy on oral lesions. 
 
                                  epidemiology
 
      since the first international workshop on oral manifestations of hiv 
 infection was convened five years ago, the epidemiology of hiv infection has 
 
 hicnet medical newsletter                                              page 11

 radically changed.  in 1988, hiv infection was detected and reported largely 
 in homosexual and bisexual males, intravenous drug users, and hemophiliacs.  
 today, more hiv infection is seen in heterosexual males and females and in 
 children and adolescents. 
      while the predominant impact of hiv infection has been felt in africa, a 
 major increase in infection rate is being seen in southeast asia as well.  
 five hundred thousand cases have been reported to date in this region and more 
 are appearing all the time. 
      researchers are continuing to document the epidemiology of oral lesions 
 such as hairy leukoplakia and candidiasis.  they also are beginning to explore 
 the relationships between specific oral lesions and hiv disease progression 
 and prognosis. 
 
                             social/political issues
 
      discussion on the social and political implications of hiv infection 
 focused on changing the public's attitude that aids is retribution for 
 indiscriminate sexual behavior and drug use.  speakers also addressed health 
 care delivery for hiv-infected patients, and the need to educate the public 
 about what aids is, and how it is acquired. 
 
                           saliva and salivary glands
 
      conference speakers described transmission issues and the hiv-inhibitory 
 activity of saliva, the strength of which varies among the different salivary 
 secretions.  whole saliva has a greater inhibitory effect than submandibular 
 secretions, which in turn have a greater inhibitory effect than parotid 
 secretions.  research has shown that at least two mechanisms are responsible 
 for salivary inhibitory activity.  they attributed the hiv-inhibitory effect 
 of saliva to the 1) aggregation/agglutination of hiv by saliva, which may both 
 promote clearance of virus and prevent it reaching a target cell, and 2) 
 direct effects on the virus or target cells. 
      other topics discussed were the manifestation of salivary gland disease 
 in hiv-infected persons and current research on oral mucosal immunity. 
 
                                pediatric issues
 
      pediatric aids recently has emerged as an area of intense interest.  with 
 early and accurate diagnosis and proper treatment, the life expectancy of hiv-
 infected children has tripled.  the prevention of transmission of hiv from 
 mother to child may be possible in many cases, particularly if the mother's 
 sero-status is known prior to giving birth.

      oral health researchers continue to explore periodontal diseases and 
 gingivitis found in individuals with hiv infection.  recommendations made at 
 the workshop include the standardization of terminology, refinement of 
 diagnostic markers, standardization of study design, and proper consideration 
 of confounding variables resulting from periodontal therapy. 
 
                        occupational and treatment issues
 
      occupational issues surrounding the treatment of hiv-infected individuals 
 and treatment rendered by hiv-infected health care professionals still command 
 considerable attention.  factors under consideration include the cost/benefit 
 of hiv testing, patient-to-health care provider transmission of hiv infection 
 and the reverse, and the use of mainstream versus dedicated facilities for the 
 treatment of hiv-infected patients. 
      conference participants anticipate that a third international workshop on 
 the oral manifestations of hiv infection will be held in five years or less.  
 proceedings from the second workshop will be published by the quintessence 
 company in late 1993.
