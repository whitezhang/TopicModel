 disclaimer:  hey, i understand vaxen and vms.  that's what i get paid for.  my
 understanding of astronomy is purely at the amateur level (or below).  so
 unless what i'm saying is directly related to vax/vms, don't hold me or my
 organization responsible for it.  if it is related to vax/vms, you can try to
 hold me responsible for it, but my organization had nothing to do with it.
