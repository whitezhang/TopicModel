 i am looking for some clarification on a subject that i am trying to find some
 information on.
 
 how is hsv-2 (herpes) transmitted?  i currently know that it can be transmitted
 during inflammation but, what i am looking for is if it can be transmitted 
 during in other periods.  also, i want to know if you can be accurately tested 
 for it while you are not showing symtoms?
 
 if you can help i would greatly appreciate it.
