 >hi, we are trying to develop a image reconstruction simulation for the skull.  the problem we are having is that we cannot obtain 3d data for the skull.  we can just video a rotating skull, but that will only give us 2 dimensions.
 
 >anyone out there got any suggestions?
 
 yup, you can get a skull contained in the cyberware_demo from the
 following location:
 
 in order to get the cyberware_demo via ftp do the following:
 
 	1) ftp taurus.cs.nps.navy.mil
 	2) login as anonymous, guest as the password
 	3) cd pub/dabro
 	4) binary
 	5) get cyberware_demo.tar.z
 
 once you get the demo onto your workstation:
 
 	1) uncompress cyberware_demo.tar.z
 	2) tar xvof cyberware_demo.tar
 
 the skull data is called 'phred' and resides in the data directory.
