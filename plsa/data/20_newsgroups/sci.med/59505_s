 i too have had premature ventricular heartbeat, starting in 1974.  (these 
 are not, by the way, "extra" heartbeats.  this is how they feel, and 
 this is how i described them initially to the doctor, but they're 
 actually *premature* heartbeats.  i would sometimes experience a lapse 
 after one of these that went on for a suffocatingly long period of time, 
 making me wonder if my heart were ever going to beat again.) 
 
 i had them persistently for eighteen years.  then i went on a low-fat 
 diet, and they just stopped.  i haven't had a single episode of pvh 
 for almost two years.  i know:  correlation does not imply causation. 
 this is just fwiw.
