 funny about that... my wife (my girlfriend at the time) used to get sick 
 after eating certain foods at various asian restaurants, and never knew 
 why.  she'd go pale, and sweaty and then vomit copiously.  a couple of us 
 ventured a connection with msg, and her response was: "msg?  what's that?".  
 it also happened when she pigged out on some brands of savoury crackers and 
 chips... which i noticed (later) had msg on the label.  don't know about 
 double blinds, but avoiding msg has stopped her being sick at restaurants.
 
 
 cheers, john
