 if this theory were true, the muscle biopsy would show group atrophy
 (evidence of acute loss of enlarged motor units); it doesn't.
 instead, the biopsy shows scattered, angulated, atrophic fibers.
 this is more consistent with load-shedding by chronically overworked
 motor neurons - the neurons survive, at the expense of increasingly
 denervated muscle.
