 i experienced a sudden numbness in my left arm this morning.  just after
 i completed my 4th set of deep squats.  today was my weight training
 day and i was just beginning my routine.  all of a sudden at the end of
 the 4th set my arm felt like it had gone to sleep.  it was cold, turned pale,
 and lost 60% of its strength.  the weight i used for squats wasn't that
 heavy, i was working hard but not at 100% effort.  i waited for a few 
 minutes, trying to shake the arm back to life and then continued with
 chest exercises (flyes) with lighter dumbells than i normally use.  but
 i dropped the left dumbell during the first set, and experienced continued
 arm weakness into the second.  so i quit training and decided not to do my
 usual hour on the ski machine either.  i'll take it easy for the rest of
 the day.
 
 my arm is *still* somewhat numb and significantly weaker than normal --
 my hand still tingles a bit down to the thumb. color has returned to normal
 and it is no longer cold. 
 
 horrid thoughts of chunks of plaque blocking a major artery course through
 my brain.  i'm 34, vegetarian, and pretty fit from my daily exercise
 regimen.  so that can't be it.  could a pinched nerve from the bar
 cause these symptoms (i hope)?
 
 has this happened to anyone else?
 nothing like this has ever happened to me before.  does it come with age?
 
 thanks,
 tom
