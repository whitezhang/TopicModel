 purists often distinguish between "true" clubbing and "pseudo"
 clubbing, the difference being that with "true" clubbing the
 angle of the nail when viewed from the side is constantly
 negative when proceeding distally (towards the fingertip).
 with "pseudo" clubbing, the angle is initially positive, then
 negative, which is the normal situation. "real" internists
 can talk for hours about clubbing. i'm limited to a couple
 of minutes.
 
 whether this distinction has anything to do with reality is
 entirely unclear, but it is one of those things that internists
 love to paw over during rounds. supposedly, only "true" clubbing
 is associated with disease. the problem is that the list of
 diseases associated with clubbing is quite long, and includes
 both congenital conditions and acquired disease. since many of
 these diseases are associated with cardiopulmonary problems
 leading to right to left shunts and chronic hypoxemia, it is
 very reasonable to get a chest xray. however, many of the 
 congenital abnormalities would only be diagnosed with a cardiac
 catheterization. 
 
 the cause of clubbing is unclear, but presumably relates to
 some factor causing blood vessels in the distal fingertip to
 dilate abnormally. 
 
 clubbing is one of those things from an examination which is
 a tipoff to do more extensive examination. often, however,
 the cause of the clubbing is quite apparent.
