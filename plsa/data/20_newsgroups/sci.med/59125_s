 i would like to continue to thank everyone who has sent in a donation for the 
 mednews ocr/scanner fund.  we have reached our goal!  a hewlett packard
 scanjet iip was purchased this week.
 
 thank you to the following individuals whose contributions i just received:
 
 john sorenson
 carol sigelman
 carla moore
 barbara moose
 judith schrier
 
 again, thank you to all who gave!
 
 i have been using wordscan plus for the past couple of weeks and would like to 
 review the product.  wordscan plus is a product of calera recognition systems.  
 it runs under windows 3.1 and supports that accufont technology of the hewlett 
 packard scanners.  
 
 when initially bringing up the software, it lets you select several options; 
 (1) text / graphics (2) input source ie scanner, fax file, disk file (3) 
 automatic versus manual decomposition of the scanned image. 
 
 i like manual decomposition since the software then lets me select which 
 parts of the document i would like scanned, and in what order.
 
 once an image is scanned, you can bring up the pop-up image verification.  the 
 software gives you two "errors" at this point.  blue which are words that were 
 converted reliability, but do not match anything in the built-in dictionary.  
 yellow shade, which are words that wordscan plus doesn't think it converted 
 correctly at all.  i have found that the software should give itself more 
 credit.  it is usually correct, instead of wrong.  if a word is shaded blue, 
 you can add it to your personal dictionary.  the only problem is the personal 
 dictionary will only handle about 200 words.  i find this to be very limited, 
 considering how many medical terms are not in a normal dictionary. 
 
 after a document is converted, you can save it in a multitude of word 
 processor formats.  also any images that were captured can be stored in a 
 seperate tiff or pcx file format.
 
 i was extremely impressed on the percent accuracy for fax files.  i use

 an intel satisfaxtion card, which stores incoming faxs in a pcx/dcx format.  
 while most of my faxes were received in "standard" mode (200x100 dpi), the 
 accuracy of wordscan plus was excellent. 
 
 overall, a very impressive product.  the only fault i could find is the 
 limitations of the size of the user dictionary.  200 specialized words is just 
 too small. 
 
 if anyone has any specific questions, please do not hesitate to send me email.

                                  introduction
 
      despite predictions earlier this century that infectious diseases would 
 soon be eliminated as a public health problem (1), infectious diseases remain 
 the major cause of death worldwide and a leading cause of illness and death in 
 the united states. since the early 1970s, the u.s. public health system has 
 been challenged by a myriad of newly identified pathogens and syndromes (e.g., 
 escherichia coli o157:h7, hepatitis c virus, human immunodeficiency virus, 
 legionnaires disease, lyme disease, and toxic shock syndrome). the incidences 
 of many diseases widely presumed to be under control, such as cholera, 
 malaria, and tuberculosis (tb), have increased in many areas. furthermore, 
 control and prevention of infectious diseases are undermined by drug 
 resistance in conditions such as gonorrhea, malaria, pneumococcal disease, 
 salmonellosis, shigellosis, tb, and staphylococcal infections (2). emerging 
 infections place a disproportionate burden on immunocompromised persons, those 
 in institutional settings (e.g., hospitals and child day care centers), and 
 minority and underserved populations. the substantial economic burden of 
 emerging infections on the u.s. health-care system could be reduced by more 
 effective surveillance systems and targeted control and prevention programs 
 (3). 
      this issue of mmwr introduces a new series, "emerging infectious 
 diseases." future articles will address these diseases, as well as 
 surveillance, control, and prevention efforts by health-care providers and 
 public health officials. this first article updates the ongoing investigation 
 of an outbreak of e. coli o157:h7 in the western united states (4).

             update: multistate outbreak of escherichia coli o157:h7
              infections from hamburgers -- western united states,
                                    1992-1993
             =======================================================
                    source: mmwr 42(14)   date: apr 16, 1993
 
      from november 15, 1992, through february 28, 1993, more than 500 
 laboratory-confirmed infections with e. coli o157:h7 and four associated 
 deaths occurred in four states -- washington, idaho, california, and nevada. 
 this report summarizes the findings from an ongoing investigation (1) that 
 identified a multistate outbreak resulting from consumption of hamburgers from 
 one restaurant chain. washington 
      on january 13, 1993, a physician reported to the washington department of 
 health a cluster of children with hemolytic uremic syndrome (hus) and an 
 increase in emergency room visits for bloody diarrhea. during january 16-17, a 
 case-control study comparing 16 of the first cases of bloody diarrhea or 
 postdiarrheal hus identified with age- and neighborhood-matched controls 
 implicated eating at chain a restaurants during the week before symptom onset 
 (matched odds ratio or=undefined; lower confidence limit=3.5). on january 
 18, a multistate recall of unused hamburger patties from chain a restaurants 
 was initiated. 
      as a result of publicity and case-finding efforts, during january-
 february 1993, 602 patients with bloody diarrhea or hus were reported to the 
 state health department. a total of 477 persons had illnesses meeting the case 
 definition of culture-confirmed e. coli o157:h7 infection or postdiarrheal hus 
 (figure 1). of the 477 persons, 52 (11%) had close contact with a person with 
 confirmed e. coli o157:h7 infection during the week preceding onset of 
 symptoms. of the remaining 425 persons, 372 (88%) reported eating in a chain a 
 restaurant during the 9 days preceding onset of symptoms. of the 338 patients 
 who recalled what they ate in a chain a restaurant, 312 (92%) reported eating 
 a regular-sized hamburger patty. onsets of illness peaked from january 17 
 through january 20. of the 477 casepatients, 144 (30%) were hospitalized; 30 
 developed hus, and three died. the median age of patients was 7.5 years 
 (range: 0-74 years). idaho 
      following the outbreak report from washington, the division of health, 
 idaho department of health and welfare, identified 14 persons with culture-
 confirmed e. coli o157:h7 infection, with illness onset dates from december 
 11, 1992, through february 16, 1993 (figure 2a). four persons were 
 hospitalized; one developed hus. during the week preceding illness onset, 13 
 (93%) had eaten at a chain a restaurant. california 
      in late december, the san diego county department of health services was 
 notified of a child with e. coli o157:h7 infection who subsequently died. 
 active surveillance and record review then identified eight other persons with 
 e. coli o157:h7 infections or hus from mid-november through mid-january 1993. 
 four of the nine reportedly had recently eaten at a chain a restaurant and

 four at a chain b restaurant in san diego. after the washington outbreak was 
 reported, reviews of medical records at five hospitals revealed an overall 27% 
 increase in visits or admissions for diarrhea during december 1992 and january 
 1993 compared with the same period 1 year earlier. a case was defined as 
 postdiarrheal hus, bloody diarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured, 
 or any diarrheal illness in which stool culture yielded e. coli o157:h7, with 
 onset from november 15, 1992, through january 31, 1993. 
      illnesses of 34 patients met the case definition (figure 2b). the 
 outbreak strain was identified in stool specimens of six patients. fourteen 
 persons were hospitalized, seven developed hus, and one child died. the median 
 age of case-patients was 10 years (range: 1-58 years). a case-control study of 
 the first 25 case-patients identified and age- and sex-matched community 
 controls implicated eating at a chain a restaurant in san diego (matched 
 or=13; 95% confidence interval ci=1.7-99). a study comparing case-patients 
 who ate at chain a restaurants with well meal companions implicated regular-
 sized hamburger patties (matched or=undefined; lower confidence limit=1.3). 
 chain b was not statistically associated with illness. nevada 
      on january 22, after receiving a report of a child with hus who had eaten 
 at a local chain a restaurant, the clark county (las vegas) health district 
 issued a press release requesting that persons with recent bloody diarrhea 
 contact the health department. a case was defined as postdiarrheal hus, bloody 
 diarrhea that was culture negative or not cultured, or any diarrheal illness 
 with a stool culture yielding the washington strain of e. coli o157:h7, with 
 onset from december 1, 1992, through february 7, 1993. because local 
 laboratories were not using sorbitol macconkey (smac) medium to screen stools 
 for e. coli o157:h7, this organism was not identified in any patient. after 
 smac medium was distributed, the outbreak strain was detected in the stool of 
 one patient 38 days after illness onset. 
      of 58 persons whose illnesses met the case definition (figure 2c), nine 
 were hospitalized; three developed hus. the median age was 30.5 years (range: 
 0-83 years). analysis of the first 21 patients identified and age- and sex-
 matched community controls implicated eating at a chain a restaurant during 
 the week preceding illness onset (matched or=undefined; lower confidence 
 limit=4.9). a case-control study using well meal companions of case-patients 
 also implicated eating hamburgers at chain a (matched or=6.0; 95% ci=0.7-
 49.8). other investigation findings 
      during the outbreak, chain a restaurants in washington linked with cases 
 primarily were serving regular-sized hamburger patties produced on november 
 19, 1992; some of the same meat was used in "jumbo" patties produced on 
 november 20, 1992. the outbreak strain of e. coli o157:h7 was isolated from 11 
 lots of patties produced on those two dates; these lots had been distributed 
 to restaurants in all states where illness occurred. approximately 272,672 
 (20%) of the implicated patties were recovered by the recall. 
      a meat traceback by a cdc team identified five slaughter plants in the 
 united states and one in canada as the likely sources of carcasses used in the

 contaminated lots of meat and identified potential control points for reducing 
 the likelihood of contamination. the animals slaughtered in domestic slaughter 
 plants were traced to farms and auctions in six western states. no one 
 slaughter plant or farm was identified as the source. 
      further investigation of cases related to secondary transmission in 
 families and child day care settings is ongoing.

 editorial note: e. coli o157:h7 is a pathogenic gram-negative bacterium first 
 identified as a cause of illness in 1982 during an outbreak of severe bloody 
 diarrhea traced to contaminated hamburgers (2). this pathogen has since 
 emerged as an important cause of both bloody diarrhea and hus, the most common 
 cause of acute renal failure in children. outbreak investigations have linked 
 most cases with the consumption of undercooked ground beef, although other 
 food vehicles, including roast beef, raw milk, and apple cider, also have been 
 implicated (3). preliminary data from a cdc 2-year, nationwide, multicenter 
 study revealed that when stools were routinely cultured for e. coli o157:h7 
 that organism was isolated more frequently than shigella in four of 10 
 participating hospitals and was isolated from 7.8% of all bloody stools, a 
 higher rate than for any other pathogen. 
      infection with e. coli o157:h7 often is not recognized because most 
 clinical laboratories do not routinely culture stools for this organism on 
 
 hicnet medical newsletter                                              page  7
 volume  6, number 10                                           april 20, 1993
 
 smac medium, and many clinicians are unaware of the spectrum of illnesses 
 associated with infection (4). the usual clinical manifestations are diarrhea 
 (often bloody) and abdominal cramps; fever is infrequent. younger age groups 
 and the elderly are at highest risk for clinical manifestations and 
 complications. illness usually resolves after 6-8 days, but 2%-7% of patients 
 develop hus, which is characterized by hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, 
 renal failure, and a death rate of 3%-5%. 
      this report illustrates the difficulties in recognizing community 
 outbreaks of e. coli o157:h7 in the absence of routine surveillance. despite 
 the magnitude of this outbreak, the problem may not have been recognized in 
 three states if the epidemiologic link had not been established in washington 
 (1). clinical laboratories should routinely culture stool specimens from 
 persons with bloody diarrhea or hus for e. coli o157:h7 using smac agar (5). 
 when infections with e. coli o157:h7 are identified, they should be reported 
 to local health departments for further evaluation and, if necessary, public 
 health action to prevent further cases. 
      e. coli o157:h7 lives in the intestines of healthy cattle, and can 
 contaminate meat during slaughter. cdc is collaborating with the u.s. 
 department of agriculture's food safety inspection service to identify 
 critical control points in processing as a component of a program to reduce 
 the likelihood of pathogens such as e. coli o157:h7 entering the meat supply. 
 because slaughtering practices can result in contamination of raw meat with 
 pathogens, and because the process of grinding beef may transfer pathogens 
 from the surface of the meat to the interior, ground beef is likely to be 
 internally contaminated. the optimal food protection practice is to cook 
 ground beef thoroughly until the interior is no longer pink, and the juices 
 are clear. in this outbreak, undercooking of hamburger patties likely played 
 an important role. the food and drug administration (fda) has issued interim 
 recommendations to increase the internal temperature for cooked hamburgers to 
 155 f (86.1 c) (fda, personal communication, 1993). 
      regulatory actions stimulated by the outbreak described in this report 
 and the recovery of thousands of contaminated patties before they could be 
 consumed emphasize the value of rapid public health investigations of 
 outbreaks. the public health impact and increasing frequency of isolation of 
 this pathogen underscore the need for improved surveillance for infections 
 caused by e. coli o157:h7 and for hus to better define the epidemiology of e. 
 coli o157:h7.

      consumption of moist snuff and other smokeless tobacco products in the 
 united states almost tripled from 1972 through 1991 (1). long-term use of 
 smokeless tobacco is associated with nicotine addiction and increased risk of 
 oral cancer (2) -- the incidence of which could increase if young persons who 
 currently use smokeless tobacco continue to use these products frequently (1). 
 to monitor trends in the prevalence of use of smokeless tobacco products, 
 cdc's 1991 national health interview survey-health promotion and disease 
 prevention supplement (nhis-hpdp) collected information on snuff and chewing 
 tobacco use and smoking from a representative sample of the u.s. civilian, 
 noninstitutionalized population aged greater than or equal to 18 years. this 
 report summarizes findings from this survey. 
      the 1991 nhis-hpdp supplement asked "have you used snuff at least 20 
 times in your entire life?" and "do you use snuff now?" similar questions were 
 asked about chewing tobacco use and cigarette smoking. current users of 
 smokeless tobacco were defined as those who reported snuff or chewing tobacco 
 use at least 20 times and who reported using snuff or chewing tobacco at the 
 time of the interview; former users were defined as those who reported having 
 used snuff or chewing tobacco at least 20 times and not using either at the 
 time of the interview. ever users of smokeless tobacco included current and 
 former users. current smokers were defined as those who reported smoking at 
 least 100 cigarettes and who were currently smoking and former smokers as 
 those who reported having smoked at least 100 cigarettes and who were not 
 smoking now. ever smokers included current and former smokers. data on 
 smokeless tobacco use were available for 43,732 persons aged greater than or 
 equal to 18 years and were adjusted for nonresponse and weighted to provide 
 national estimates. confidence intervals (cis) were calculated by using 
 standard errors generated by the software for survey data analysis (sudaan) 
 (3). 
      in 1991, an estimated 5.3 million (2.9%) u.s. adults were current users 
 of smokeless tobacco, including 4.8 million (5.6%) men and 533,000 (0.6%) 
 women. for all categories of comparison, the prevalence of smokeless tobacco 
 use was substantially higher among men. for men, the prevalence of use was 
 highest among those aged 18-24 years (table 1); for women, the prevalence was 
 highest among those aged greater than or equal to 75 years. the prevalence of 
 smokeless tobacco use among men was highest among american indians/alaskan 
 natives and whites; the prevalence among women was highest among american 
 indians/alaskan natives and blacks. among both men and women, prevalence of 
 smokeless tobacco use declined with increasing education. prevalence was 
 substantially higher among residents of the southern united states and in 
 rural areas. although the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use was higher among

 men and women below the poverty level, * this difference was significant only 
 for women (p less than 0.05) (table 1). 
      among men, the prevalence of current use of snuff was highest among those 
 aged 18-44 years but varied considerably by age; the prevalence of use of 
 chewing tobacco was more evenly distributed by age group (table 2). although 
 women rarely used smokeless tobacco, the prevalence of snuff use was highest 
 among those aged greater than or equal to 75 years. 
      an estimated 7.9 million (4.4% 95% ci=4.1-4.6) adults reported being 
 former smokeless tobacco users. among ever users, the proportion who were 
 former smokeless tobacco users was 59.9% (95% ci=57.7-62.1). among persons 
 aged 18-24 years, the proportion of former users was lower among snuff users 
 (56.2% 95% ci=49.4-63.0) than among chewing tobacco users (70.4% 95% 
 ci=64.2-76.6). among persons aged 45-64 years, the proportion of former users 
 was similar for snuff (68.9% 95% ci=63.1-74.7) and chewing tobacco (73.5% 
 95% ci=68.9-78.1). 
      among current users of smokeless tobacco, 22.9% (95% ci=19.9-26.0) 
 currently smoked, 33.3% (95% ci=30.0-36.5) formerly smoked, and 43.8% (95% 
 ci=39.9-47.7) never smoked. in comparison, among current smokers, 2.6% (95% 
 ci=2.3-3.0) were current users of smokeless tobacco. 
      daily use of smokeless tobacco was more common among snuff users (67.3% 
 95% ci=63.2-71.4) than among chewing tobacco users (45.1% 95% ci=40.6-
 49.6).

 editorial note: the findings in this report indicate that the use of smokeless 
 tobacco was highest among young males. adolescent and young adult males, in 
 particular, are the target of marketing strategies by tobacco companies that 
 link smokeless tobacco with athletic performance and virility. use of oral 
 snuff has risen markedly among professional baseball players, encouraging this 
 behavior among adolescent and young adult males and increasing their risk for 
 nicotine addiction, oral cancer, and other mouth disorders (4). 
      differences in the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use among 
 racial/ethnic groups may be influenced by differences in educational levels 
 and socioeconomic status as well as social and cultural phenomena that require 
 further explanation. for example, targeted marketing practices may play a role 
 in maintaining or increasing prevalence among some groups, and affecting the 
 differential initiation of smokeless tobacco use by young persons (5,6). 
      in this report, one concern is that nearly one fourth of current 
 smokeless tobacco users also smoke cigarettes. in the 1991 nhis-hpdp, the 
 prevalence of cigarette smoking was higher among former smokeless tobacco 
 users than among current and never smokeless tobacco users. in a previous 
 study among college students, 18% of current smokeless tobacco users smoked

 occasionally (7). in addition, approximately 7% of adults who formerly smoked 
 reported substituting other tobacco products for cigarettes in an effort to 
 stop smoking (8). health-care providers should recognize the potential health 
 implications of concurrent smokeless tobacco and cigarette use. 
      the national health objectives for the year 2000 have established special 
 population target groups for the reduction of the prevalence of smokeless 
 tobacco use, including males aged 12-24 years (to no more than 4% by the year 
 2000 objective 3.9) and american indian/alaskan native youth (to no more 
 than 10% by the year 2000 objective 3.9a) (9). strategies to lower the 
 prevalence of smokeless tobacco use include continued monitoring of smokeless 
 tobacco use, integrating smoking and smokeless tobacco-control efforts, 
 enforcing laws that restrict minors' access to tobacco, making excise taxes 
 commensurate with those on cigarettes, encouraging health-care providers to 
 routinely provide cessation advice and follow-up, providing school-based 
 prevention and cessation interventions, and adopting policies that prohibit 
 tobacco use on school property and at school-sponsored events (5).
