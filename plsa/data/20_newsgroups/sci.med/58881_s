    well, if that's the case in your practice, i have a hard time 
    figuring out how you even managed to make it into the bottom half
    of your class, or did you create your diplomas with crayons?
  
    if someone runs a medical practice with only a 10% success rate,
    they either tackle problems for which they are not qualified to
    treat, or they have no conscience and are only in business for
    fraudulent purposes.
 
    otoh, who are we kidding, the new england medical journal in 1984
    ran the heading: "ninety percent of diseases are not treatable by
    drugs or surgery," which has been echoed by several other reports.
    no wonder mds are not amused with alternative medicine, since
    the 20% magic of the "placebo effect" would award alternative 
    practitioners twice the success rate of conventional medicine...
