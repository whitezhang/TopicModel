 call for employers to keep  information about the hiv status of health-care 
 workers  confidential.  but doctors who know of an hiv-positive colleague  who 
 has not sought advice must inform the employing authority and the appropriate 
 professional regulatory body.  the guidelines  also emphasize the significance 
 of notifying all patients on whom an invasive procedure has been done by an 
 infected health-care  worker.  a model letter to patients who have come into 
 contact  with such an individual is provided, along with suggestions for  
 health officials on how to deal with the media.  in addition, a  u.k. advisory 
 panel on hiv infection in health-care workers has  been formed to provide 
 specific occupational recommendations to  those treating such patients.

 (volvovitz, franklin and smith, gale) 
 
      the questions raised by moore et al. about recombinant gp160  envelope 
 glycoprotein precursor from hiv-1 produced by  microgenesys are advantages 
 rather than disadvantages, write  franklin volvovitz and gale smith of 
 microgenesys in meriden,  conn.  moore et al. says that gp160 in a baculovirus 
 expression  system does not bind strongly to the cd4 receptor, and that this  
 recombinant gp160 does not stimulate the same antibodies as the  hiv-1 virus 
 does in natural infection.  but vaccination with  recombinant gp160 in 
 patients infected with hiv-1 broadens hiv-1  specific envelope-directed immune 
 responses, including  crossreactive antibodies to gp160 epitopes and cd4 and 
 cd8  cytotoxic t-cell responses.  volvovitz and smith claim that they  never 
 intended their gp160 molecule to be identical to the native protein.  antibody 
 responses against native hiv-1 proteins,  including the types described by 
 moore et al., exist in nearly  all aids patients but do not prevent

 progression of hiv disease.  in addition, the binding of gp120 or gp120-
 antibody complexes to  cd4 has been shown to interfere with antigen specific 
 activation  of cd4 cells and trigger programmed cell death in vitro, which  
 may contribute to the pathogenesis of hiv infection.  the absence of cd4 
 binding by the microgenesys gp160 vaccine may therefore be viewed as an added 
 safety feature.  phase i studies have  demonstrated stable cd4 counts, 
 stimulation of cytotoxic t cells, and the suggestion of restoration of immune 
 function.  based on  these and other clinical results, microgenesys gp160 was 
 chosen  by researchers at the karolinska institute in sweden for the  first 
 phase iii vaccine therapy studies, conclude volvovitz and  smith.

 twelve months, with 90 percent of total  iga in milk being secretory iga.  
 breastfeeding protects infants  against gastrointestinal and respiratory 
 illnesses, in both  normal and uninfected children born to hiv-positive 
 mothers.  the italian national registry of aids discovered that breastfed hiv-
 1 infected children had a longer median incubation time (19 months) than

 progression to aids.  there is no agreement on which  antibodies offer 
 protection against hiv-1 infection.  studies of  the biological properties of

 antibodies against envelope  glycoproteins, as well as iga antibodies against 
 core antigens.   binding of hiv-1 to the cd4 receptor can be inhibited by a 
 human  milk factor.  in the developing world, where infectious disease  and 
 malnutrition contribute significantly to infant mortality,  breast milk is 
 still the best food for infants, regardless of the mother's hiv status.  
 transmission might be restricted by  breastfeeding after colostrum and early 
 milk have been expressed  and discarded.  the possibility remains that breast 
 milk could  protect the infant who is already infected with hiv at birth and  
 may even delay progression to aids, concludes mok.

 et al. of the university of miami  school of medicine in miami, fla.  the 
 researchers contacted all  patients treated by a dentist with aids and 
 attempts were made to contact all patients for hiv testing.  living patients 
 with newly detected hiv infection were interviewed, and dna sequence  analysis 
 was performed to compare genetic relatedness of their  hiv to that of the 
 dentist.  death certificates were obtained for deceased patients, and the 
 medical records of those with  diagnoses suggestive of hiv disease or drug 
 abuse and those dying under the age of 50 years were examined in detail.  
 there were  1,192 patients who had undergone 9,267 procedures, of whom 124  
 were deceased.  an examination of the death certificates of  patients 
 identified five who had died with hiv infection, all of  whom were either 
 homosexuals or iv-drug users.  the researchers  were able to detect 962 of the 
 remaining 1,048 patients, and 900  agreed to be tested.  hiv infection was 
 reported in five of the  900 patients, including four who had clear evidence 
 of risk  factors for the disease.  one patient who had only a single  
 evaluation by the dentist denied high-risk behavior.  comparative dna sequence 
 analysis showed that the viruses from the dentists  and these five patients 
 were not closely related.  the study  suggests the potential for hiv 
 transmission from a general  dentist to his patients is minimal in a setting 
 in which  universal precautions are strictly observed, conclude dickinson  et

 "aids patients are susceptible to recurrences of tb, study says" washington 
 post (04/22/93), p. a13 
 
      tuberculosis can strike aids patients more than once, which makes the 
 resurging health hazard harder to control, according to a  study published in 
 today's new england journal of medicine.   people who contract tb usually 
 develop an immunity that protects  them if they are exposed to the bacteria 
 again.  but a person  whose immune system is depleted may not be able to fight 
 off a  new tb infection, doctors found.  peter m. small of the howard  hughes 
 medical institute at stanford university, director of the  study, said that in 
 order to protect against reinfection, it may  be necessary for some people to 
 use tb medicines permanently.   the study examined the genetic makeup of tb 
 bacteria and how the  germs changed over time in 17 patients at kings county 
 hospital  in new york.

      because there is no proof that hiv is the cause of aids, the  hypothesis 
 that drug use leads to aids will hopefully become a  hindrance to the 
 physiologically (azt) and psychologically  (positive aids test) toxic public 
 health initiatives, writes  peter duesberg of the university of california--
 berkeley.  in the lancet's march 13 issue, schechter et al. call duesberg's  
 hypothesis that injected and orally used recreational drugs and  azt lead to 
 aids, "a hindrance to public health initiatives."   however, their hypothesis 
 that hiv is the cause of aids has not  attained any public health benefits.  
 the u.s. government spends  $4 billion annually, but no vaccine, no therapy, 
 no prevention,  and no aids control have resulted from work on this 
 hypothesis.   schechter et al. conclude that hiv has a key role in cd4  
 depletion and aids based on epidemiological correlations with  antibodies 
 against hiv and with self reported recreational drug  use among homosexuals 
 from vancouver.  however, their survey  neglects to disprove duesberg's drug-
 aids hypothesis, because it  does not provide controls--i.e., confirmed drug-
 free aids  cases--and because it does not quantify drug use and ignores azt  
 use altogether.  to refute duesberg's hypothesis schechter would  have to 
 produce a controlled study demonstrating that over a  period of up to 10 years 
 hiv-positive patients who use  recreational drugs or azt or both have the same 
 aids risks as  positives who do not do so.  the 10 year period is claimed by

 proponents of the hiv hypothesis to be the time needed for hiv to cause aids.  
 alternatively, they could show that hiv-free  individuals who have used drugs 
 for 10 years never get  aids-defining illnesses, concludes duesberg.

 "rapid decline of cd4+ cells after ifna treatment in hiv-1  infection" 
 lancet (04/10/93) vol. 341, no. 8850, p. 959   (vento, sandro et al.) 
 
      interferon (ifn), which induces autoantibodies and autoimmune  diseases 
 in some settings, may hasten cd4 t-cell loss in some  hiv-1 infected 
 individuals through the amplification of harmful  "autoimmune" reactions, 
 write sandro vento et al. of the a.  pugliese hospital in catanzaro, italy.  
 the researchers report  three asymptomatic hiv-1 infected individuals with 
 hepatitis c  virus related chronic active hepatitis (cah) who had a rapid,  
 profound decline of cd4 cells after ifn.  all three patients  throughout the 
 observation were consistently negative for serum  hiv p24 antigen and had 
 circulating antibodies to p24.  sera from all three patients, obtained at the 
 end of ifn treatment and  testing in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, 
 contained high  titres of antibodies reacting to a sequence located in the  
 aminoterminal of the beta chain of all human hla class ii  antigens, 
 homologous to a sequence located in the carboxy  terminus of hiv-1 gp41.  
 these autoantibodies, which also  recognize "native" class ii molecules and 
 may contribute to the  elimination of cd4 t cells "in vivo", were at low tires 
 (50-100)  in all three patients six months after stopping ifn.  such  
 autoantibodies were not detected in 28 other patients with hiv  infection and 
 hcv related cah treated with ifn and who did not  experience cd4 t-cell loss 
 in some hiv-1 infected individuals  through the amplification of harmful 
 "autoimmune" reactions.  the subjects had a1; b8; dr3; and b35, dr1 hla 
 antigen combinations  which are linked with a more rapid fall in cd4 cell 
 counts and  clinical progression of hiv-1 disease.  ifn can induce a very  
 rapid decline of cd4 cells and should be used cautiously in  patients with 
 these hla haplotypes, the researchers conclude.

 "tb makes a comeback" state government news (04/93) vol. 36, no. 4, p. 6   
 (voit, william and knapp, elaine s.) 
 
      although tuberculosis was once believed to be eliminated in the  united 
 states, it is emerging again among the homeless, aids  patients, immigrants, 
 minorities, and prisoners.  dr. lee b.  reichman, professor of medicine at the 
 university of new jersey  medical school and president of the american lung 
 association,  said, "right now, it's a big city problem, but potentially it's  
 everyone's problem."  the ala predicts that 10 million americans  are infected 
 with tb, and about 10 percent of them will develop  the disease because their 
 immune systems are depressed,  especially those with aids or hiv.  gene

 tammes, a centers for  disease control expert, said that is why the cdc has 
 issued  guidelines warning hospitals and institutions not to mix aids  with tb 
 patients.  state health officials believe the tb is also  spreading because 
 those who are most susceptible are the least  likely to follow through with 
 treatment.  in addition, the  increase is attributed to a shortage of public 
 health services.   in new york city, tb is an epidemic "because the number of 
 cases  is increasing faster than we can treat people," said dr. george  
 diferdinando, director of the new york state tb control.   according to 
 diferdinando, curbing the spread of tb entails  keeping 85 percent or more of 
 diagnosed tb cases in treatment.   about 40 percent of infected new york city 
 residents don't  complete therapy.  when tb patients don't finish taking their  
 medication, multi-drug resistant tb can develop, which requires  taking more 
 expensive drugs and can take two years instead of the normal six months to 
 treat.

  "increasing frequency of heterosexually transmitted aids in  southern 
 florida: artifact or reality?" american journal of public health (04/93) vol. 
 83, no. 4, p. 571  (nwanyanwu, okey c. et al.) 
 
      the alarmingly high rate of heterosexually acquired aids cases in 
 southern florida was partially related to misclassification of  risk, write 
 okey c. nwanyanwu et al. of the centers for disease  control in atlanta, ga.  
 the researchers investigated 168 such  aids cases from broward and coastal 
 palm beach counties.  all of  these cases attributed to heterosexual 
 transmission reported  sexual contact with bisexual men, injecting drug users, 
 or  persons born in countries where heterosexual contact is the  primary route 
 of hiv transmission.  medical records of patients,  in addition to records 
 from social services, hiv counseling and  testing centers, and sexually 
 transmitted disease (std) clinics  were reviewed.  if no other hiv risk factor 
 was found from  medical record review, patients were interviewed using a  
 standardized questionnaire.  once std clinic and other medical  records were 
 reviewed, 29 men and 7 women were reclassified into  other hiv transmission 
 categories.  after adjustments were made  for the reclassification, the 
 percentage of aids cases reported  from palm beach and broward counties 
 between january 1, 1989, and march 31, 1990, that was attributed to 
 heterosexual transmission  decreased from 10 percent to 6 percent among men 
 and from 33  percent to 28 percent among women.  while the percentage of  
 heterosexually transmitted aids cases in southern florida  decreased after 
 adjustment was made for reclassified cases, it  still remained above the 
 national average, the researchers  conclude.
