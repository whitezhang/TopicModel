 this request goes out to medical students who have done
 or are planning to sit the usmle (or national boards) part 1.
 
 my wife is sitting this examination in early june this year and would
 like to have a look at some old national boards, part 1 questions
 found in the following books. these books are currently out of print.
  
 
 the books are:
 
 (1) retired nbme basic medical science test items, nbme;
     published by nbme in 1991
 
 (2) self-test in the part 1 basic medical sciences, nbme;
     published by nbme in 1989
 
 i would appreciate if anyone who has these books is willing
 to loan it to her for a couple of days. obviously, i would
 reimburse for you all postage and related charges. failing
 that it would be beneficial if anyone could point to any
 library in the ny, nj or pa area that may have these books.
 
 please respond by e-mail since i do not read this newsgroup
 regularly.
 
 thanks in advance.
