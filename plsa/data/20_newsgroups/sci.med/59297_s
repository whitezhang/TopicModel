 hi,
 
 thought i'd add something to the conversation. 
 
 my girlfriend used to work in a lab studying different natural carcinogens.
 she mentioned once about the cancerous effect of barbecued food.
 basically, she said that if you eat barbecued foods with strawberries
 (a natural carcinogen) the slight carcinogenic properties of both
 cancel out each other.
