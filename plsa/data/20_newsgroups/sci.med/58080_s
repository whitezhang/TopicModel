 there were a few people who responded to my request for info on
 treatment for astrocytomas through email, whom i couldn't thank
 directly because of mail-bouncing probs (sean, debra, and sharon).  so
 i thought i'd publicly thank everyone.
 
 thanks! 
 
 (i'm sure glad i accidentally hit "rn" instead of "rm" when i was
 trying to delete a file last september. "hmmm... 'news?' what's
 this?"....)
