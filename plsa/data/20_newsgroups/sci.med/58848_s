    it's worse than that -- there *is* no such thing as

    a characteristic way that is detectable by the subject and
    that cannot be duplicated by a placebo.
 
 common! you can easily disguise  to flavor of  msg by putting  it in a
 capsule. then,  the  study  becomes  a  double  blind of  msg capsules
 against control  capsules (containing exactly  the same contents minus
 the msg).
