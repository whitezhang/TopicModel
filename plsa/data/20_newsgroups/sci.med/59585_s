 i beg to differ.  chronic *active* hepatitis implies that the disease
 remains active, and generally leads to liver failure.  at the very
 minimum, the patient has persistently elevated liver enzymes (what some
 call "transaminitis").  chronic *persistant* hepatitis simply means that
 the patient has hbsag in his/her blood and can transmit the infection, but
 shows no evidence of progressive disease.  if i had to choose, i'd much
 rather have the persistant type.
