 i tend to disagree- i think anecdotal evidence, provided there is a lot of it,
 and it is fairly consistent, will is very important.  first, it points to the
 necessity of doing a study, and second, it at least says that the effects are
 all psychological (or possibly allergy in this case).  as i've pointed out 
 before, pyschological effects are no less real than other effects.  one       
 person's "make-believe" can easily be another person's reality.  using 
 psychadelic drugs in a bizarre and twisted example, the hallucinations one
 person experiences on an acid trip cannot be guaranteed to another person on
 an acid trip- there is no clinical evidence that those effects are always going
 to happen.  anyhow, that was a pretty lame example, but hopefully i made my
 point- it's all a matter of perception, and as long as someone ingesting msg
 perceives it as causing bad effects, then s/he can definitely experience those
 affects.  on the other hand, it could just be an allergy to the food it's in,   or something.  still, anecdotal evidence is not worthless- it's the stuff that
 leads to the study being done.
