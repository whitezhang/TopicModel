 how long ago was this?  when i said you'd get counselling, i meant if
 you did it now.  long ago, practices varied and agencies had to gear
 up to provide the counselling.

 good for her.  what we don't need is everyone suing community service
 agencies that provide blood that people need.  testing is not fool proof.
 the fact that he got aids from a transfusion (if he really did) does
 not mean the red cross screwed up.  prior to 1983 or so, there wasn't
 a good test and a lot of bad blood got through.  this wasn't the fault
 of the red cross.  when did he get the transfusions?
