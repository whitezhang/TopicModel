 all your friend really has to do is find a registered dietician(rd).  while 
 most work in hospitals and clinics, many major cities will have rd's who 
 are in "private practice" so to speak.  many physicans will refer their 
 patients with crohn's disease to rd's for dietary help.  if you can get 
 your friend's physician to make a referral, medical insurance should pay for 
 the rd's services just like the services of a physical therapist.  the 
 better medical insurance plans will cover this but even if your friend's 
 plan doesn't, it would be well worth the cost to get on a good diet to 
 control the intestinal discomfort and help the intestinal lining heal.
 crohn's disease is an inflammatory disease of the intestinal lining and 
 lipoxygenase inhibitors may help by decreasing leukotriene formation but 
 i'm not aware of tea or turmeric containing lipoxygenase inhibitors.  for 
 bad inflammation, steroids are used but for a mild case, the side effects 
 are not worth the small benefit gained by steroid use.  upjohn is developing 
 a new lipoxygenase inhibitor that should greatly help deal with 
 inflammatory diseases but it's not available yet.
