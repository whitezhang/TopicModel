 as nobody in the food industry has even bothered to address my previous
 question "why do you need to put msg in almost every food?" i must assume
 that my wife's answer is closer to the truth than i hoped it was.
 
 she believes that msg is added to food to cause people to eat more of it
 and not quit when they shoud be sated.  to put it a different way, she 
 believes that for some people msg causes them to act toward food like an addict.  
 (eat all the chips, chow down on several packages of noodle soup .... you get the
 idea! }  if she is right, then the moral and ethical standards of the 
 food, chemical and regulatory groups need to be addressed!!!  can msg
 be considered a conditioning substance (not addictive but sort of habit
 forming) ?
 
 this brings up a side question of mine.   i have noticed that cats (my
 children's and my parent's) seem to fixate on a particular brand of pet
 food. the cat will eat any product within one brand and not any other
 brand.  i have wondered if this is not a case of preference, but, some
 sort of chemical training or addiction. my questions, for the net, are:
 does the fda regulate the contents of pet food?  is it allowed for pet
 food to contain addictive or conditioning substances?  is msg put in 
 pet food?
