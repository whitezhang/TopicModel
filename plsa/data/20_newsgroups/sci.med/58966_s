 these effects are a very real concern in conducting studies of new
 treatments.  researchers try to limit this kind of effect by 
 performing studies that are "blind" in various ways.  some of these
 are:
 
   o  the subjects of the study do not know whether they receive a 
      placebo or the test treatment, i.e., whether they are in the
      control group or the test group.
 
   o  those administering the treatment do not know which subjects 
      receive a placebo or the test treatment.
 
   o  those evaluating individual results do not know which subjects
      receive a placebo or the test treatment.
 
 obviously, at the point at which the data is analyzed, one has to 
 differentiate the test group from the control group.  but the analysis
 is quasi-public: the researcher describes it and presents the data on
 which it is based so that others can verify it.  
 
 it is worth noting that in biological studies where the subjects are
 animals, such as mice, there were many cases of skewed results because
 those who performed the study did not "blind" themselves.  it is not
 considered so important to make mice more ignorant than they already
 are, though it is important that in all respects except the one tested,
 the control and test groups are treated alike.
