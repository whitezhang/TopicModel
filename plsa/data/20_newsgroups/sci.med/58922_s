 probably because most of them come packaged with some absurd theory
 behind them.  e.g. homoeopathy: like cures like.  the more you dilute
 things, the more powerful they get, even if you dilute them so much
 there is no ingredient but water left.  chiropractic: all illness
 stems from compressions of nerves by misaligned vertebrae.  such
 systems are so patently absurd, that any good they do is accidental
 and not related to the theory.  the only exception is probably herbalism,
 because scientists recognize the potent drugs that derive from plants
 and are always interested in seeing if they can find new plants
 that have active and useful substances.  but that isn't what 
 is meant by alternative medicine, usually.  if you get into the qi,
 accupuntunce charts, etc, you are now back to silly theories that
 probably have nothing to do with why accupuncture works in some cases.
 
 perhaps another reason they are reluctant is the rhine experience.
 rhine was a scientist who wanted to investigate the paranormal
 and his lab was filled with so much chacanery and fakery that 
 people don't want to be associated with that sort of thing.
