 	serum, actually, but plasma numbers are the same.  whole blood
 	numbers for humans tend to be somewhat lower (roughly 5 to 10 
 	percent lower).  i find the following range for whole blood in
 	fundamentals of clinical chemistry: n. w. teitz, editor; w. b.
 	saunders, 1987:
 
 	human glucose (whole blood, fasting levels) --> 60 - 95 mg./dl.
 
 >which are the strips calibrated for?  (obviously they measure whole blood)
 
 	indeed, they do measure whole blood levels, although they are not
 	as accurate as a serum test done in a laboratory.  one problem is
 	that cells in the sample continue to metabolize glucose after the
 	sample is drawn, reducing the apparent level.  according to teitz,
 	however, results compare "reasonably well" with laboratory results,
 	although "values below 80 mg./dl. tend to be lower with strip tests,
 	whereas values above 240 mg./dl. can be very erratic."

 	as stated above, whole blood levels tend to be roughly 5 to 10 
 	percent lower than serum levels.  sample freshness will affect
 	whole blood levels, however.  i don't believe there is a well-
 	defined "conversion factor," since cell metabolism will affect
 	samples to varying degrees.  the serum/plasma test is much 
 	preferred for any except general "ball park" testing.
