 this is a lovely area for anecdotes, but i am sure you are on to something.
 as a physician, i almost never get sick: usually, when something horrendous
 is going around, i either don't get it at all or get a very mild case.
 when i do get really sick, it is always something unusual.
 
 this was not the situation when i was in medical school, particularly on
 pediatrics. i never had younger siblings myself, and when i went on the
 pediatric wards i suddenly found myself confronting all sorts of infectious
 challenges that my body was not ready for. pediatrics for me was three solid
 months of illness, and i had a temp of 104 when i took the final exam!
 
 i think what happens is that during training, and beyond, we are constantly
 exposed to new things, and we have the usual reactions to them, so that later
 on, when challenged with something, it is more likely a re-exposure for us,
 so we deal with it well and get a mild illness. i don't think it is that
 the immune system is hyped up in any way. also, don't forget that the
 hospital flora is very different from the home, and we carry a lot of that
 around.
