 the acetaminophen is the agent of concern in overdose of this
 otc medication.  a single dose of acetaminophen of 10 grams or greater
 can cause hepatotoxicity, and doses of 25 grams or more are
 potentially fatal from hepatic necrosis.  if i recall
 correctly, the metabolism of acetaminophen at high doses
 involves n-hydroxylation to n-acetyl-benzoquinoneimine, which
 is a highly reactive intermediate, which then reacts with
 sulfhydryl groups of proteins and glutathione.  when hepatic
 glutathione is used up, this intermediate then starts
 attacking the hepatic proteins with resulting hepatic
 necrosis.  the insidious part of acetaminophen toxicity is the
 delay (2-4 days) between ingestion and clinical signs of liver
 damage.  this is not a nice way to die.
 
 as to taking 20-30 of these tablets, that comes to 5-7.5 grams
 of acetaminophen.  in a normal adult, this would probably
 cause nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and loss of appetite.
