 in fairness, we should note that if you look up "speculum" in the
 dictionary (which i did when this question first surfaced), the first
 definition is "a mirror or polished metal plate used as a reflector in
 optical instruments."
 
 which doesn't mean the name fits in this context, but it's not as far
 off as you might think.
