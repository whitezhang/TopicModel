     recurrent volvulus
     -------------------
     
  this is regarding recurrent volvulus which our little boy
  has been suffering from ever since he was an infant. he had
  a surgery when he was one year old. another surgery had
  to be performed one year after, when he was two years old.
  he turned three this february and he is still getting
  afflicted by this illness, like having to get hospitalised
  for vomitting and accompanying stomach pain.he managed
  not having a third surgery so far.
  
  *  	one thing me and my wife noticed is that his affliction
  	peaks around the time he was born, on nearabouts, like in
  	march every year.  any significance to this?
  
  *	why does this recur? me and my family go through severe pain
  	when our little boy have to undergo surgery. why does surgery
  	not rectify the situation? 
  
  *	also, which hospital in us or canada specialize in this malady?
  
  *	what will be a good book explaining this disease in detail?
  
  *	will keeping a particular diet keep down the probability of 
  	recurrence?
  
  *	as time goes on, will the probability of recurrence go down
  	considering he is getting stronger and healthier and probably
  	less prone to attacks? or is this assumption wrong?
  
  *	any help throwing light on these queries will be highly appreciated.
  	thanks very much!
