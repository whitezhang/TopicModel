 dyer, you're rude. medicine is not a totallly scientific endevour. it's
 often practiced in a disorganized manner. most early treatment of
 non-life threatening illness is done on a guess, hazarded after anecdotal
 evidence given by the patient. it's an educated guess, by a trained person,
 but it's still no more than a guess.
 it's cheaper and simpler to medicate first and only deal further with those
 people who don't respond.
 
 there are diseases that haven't been described yet and the root cause of many
 diseases now described aren't known. (read a book on gastroenterology
 sometime if you want to see a lot of them.) after scientific methods have
 run out then it's the patient's freedom of choice to try any experimental
 method they choose. and it's well recognized by many doctors that medicine
 doesn't have all the answers.
 
 this person said that they had relief by taking the medicine. maybe it's a
 miracle cure, maybe it's valid. how do you know?  
 
 you might argue with the reasoning, the conclusions. but your disparaging
 attack is unwarranted. why don't you present an convincing argument for you
 r beliefs, instead of wasting our time in an ad hominem attack.
