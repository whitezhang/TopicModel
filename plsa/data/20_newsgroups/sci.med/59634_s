 my doc handed me 10mg samples of claritin (brand of ioratadine tablet
 from schering corp.)  i tried to find it in the pdr to no avail. i
 do remember she mentioned this drug was relatively new to the us but
 available overseas for quite some time.
 
 looking mostly for side-effect, contraindications, and mode of action 
 such that it differs from seldane and hismanal.
 
 email or newsgroup is fine. thanx in advance.
