 the fantasy was that he had found something of fundamental importance to
 one of the hot questions of the day ('77).  he really had very little
 reason to believe it, other than raw hope.  by fantasy, i certainly don't
 mean velikovskian manias.

 i'm not familiar with the history of this experiment, although, arguably,
 i should be.

 i think that it is enough if his contemporaries found the result surprising.
 that's not what i'd quibble about.  what i'd like to know are toricelli's
 reasons for doing his experiment; not the post hoc _constructed_ reasons,
 but the thoughts in his head as he considered the problem.  it may be
 impossible to know much about toricelli's thoughts; that's too bad if
 it is so.  one of root-bernstein's services to science is that he has gone
 rooting about in pasteur's and fleming's (and other people's) notes, and has
 discovered some surprising clues about their motivations.  pasteur never
 publicly admitted his plan to create mirror-image life, but the dreams are
 right there in his notebooks (finally public after many years), ready for
 anyone to read.  and i and my friends often have the most ridiculous
 reasons for pursuing results; one of my best came because i was mad at
 a colleague for a poorly-written claim (i disproved the claim).
 
 of course, toricelli's case may be an example of a rarety: where the
 fantasy not only motivates the experiment, but turns out to be right
 in the end.
