      i am doing a term paper on steroids, actually the scientist who
 helped crate the drug. i discovered that joseph fruton is one of the
 researchers who helped create anabolic steroids. the only information on 
 this person i know is he was a biochemist that did research in the 1930's.
 i already did research at my local libraries, but i still need more
 information. my instructor is requiring resources from the computer
 networks. please write back concerning my subject, any books, articles,
 etc., will be appreciated.
