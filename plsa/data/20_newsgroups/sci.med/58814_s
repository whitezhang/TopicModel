 hello to everybody,
 i write here because i am kind of desperate. for about six weeks, i've been
 suffering on pains in my left head side, the left leg and sometimes the left 
 arm. i made many tests (e.g. computer tomography, negative, lyme borreliosis,
 negative, all electrolytes in the blood in their correct range), they're
 all o.k., so i should be healthy. as a matter of fact, i am not feeling so.
 i was also at a neurologist's too, he considered me healthy too.
 
 the blood tests have shown that i have little too much of hemoglobin (17.5,
 common range is 14 to 17, i unfortunately do not know about the units).
 could these hemi-sided pains be the result of this or of a also possible
 block of the neck muscles ?
 
 i have no fever, and i am not feeling entirely sick, but neither entirely 
 healthy. 
 
 please answer by direct email on <ghilardi@urz.unibas.ch>
 
 thanks for every hint
 
 nico
