 the following 4 addresses are on the lymenet mailing list, but are rejecting
 mail.  since the list server originally accepted these addresses successfully,
 i assume these addresses have since been eliminated.  improperly functioning
 mail gateways might also be responsible.
 
 if you are listed here and would still like to remain on the list, please
 write to me.  otherwise, i will remove these addresses from the list before the
 next newsletter goes out.
 
 as a general rule, please remember to *unsubscribe* from all your mailing
 lists before your account is closed.  this will save the listserv maintainer
 from many headaches.
