 we know that sermon.  it is posted roughly every month or so by different
 persons, and that doesn't make it any better.
 
 how did you get the idea that skeptics are closed-minded?  why don't you
 consider the possibility that they came to their conclusions by the
 proper methods?  besides, one can come to a conclusion without closing
 one's mind to other possibilities.
 
 i you don't agree with a person, please ask him why he thinks like that,
 instead of insulting him.  perhaps he's right.  follow your own advice,
 be open-minded.
 
 if you don't post a bit of evidence for your claims, i'll complain that
 it's always those "neither a real believer, nor a disbeliever" types who 
 narrow-mindedly judge others without knowing their motives.

 the extraterrestrials don't even know this planet has native inhabitants.
 their government doesn't tell them.
