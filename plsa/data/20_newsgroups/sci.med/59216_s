 do you believe that any quacks exist?  how about quack diagnoses?  is
 being a "licensed physician" enough to guarantee that someone is not
 a quack, or is it just that even if a licensed physician is a quack,
 other people shouldn't say so?  can you give an example of a
 commonly diagnosed ailment that you think is a quack diagnosis,
 or have we gotten to the point in civilization where we no longer
 need to worry about unscrupulous "healers" taking advantage of
 people.
