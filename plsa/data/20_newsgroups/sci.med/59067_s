 there is a person on the fido cfs echo who claims that he was 
 cured of cfs by taking accutane.  he also claims that you are 
 using it in the treatment of fibromyalgia syndrome.  are you 
 using accutane in the treatment of fibromyalgia syndrome?  have 
 you used it for cfs?  have you gotten good results with it?  are 
 you aware of any double blind studies on the use of accutane in 
 these conditions?  thank you in advance for all replies.
 
 ... i think they should rename waco tx to wacko tx!
