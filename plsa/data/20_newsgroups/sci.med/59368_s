 i pity those who hope that medical knowledge can resolve issues
 such as this.  this issue has been rehashed in sci.med time and
 time again.  the bottom line is this: in normal circumstances,
 both the medical advantages of and the medical risks of
 circumcision are minor.  this means that the decision is left to
 the religious, cultural, ethical, and aesthetic mores of the
 parents, at best, or to the habit of the concerned hospital or
 caregivers, at worst. 
 
 as (prospective) parents, you should do what you want in this
 regard and not worry about it too much.  in terms of decisions
 you make for your child, it will have far less importance than
 many -- such as which schools you choose -- that most parents
 think about only a little. 
 
 this question will undoubtedly push the buttons of people who
 feel that the decision to circumcise your infant or not is a
 momentous medical decision.  it is not.
