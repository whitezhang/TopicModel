 i was part of a study a few years ago at the university of arizona to
 see whether cross dominant individuals (those with a particular handedness
 but who had dominance in the opposite eye) were better hitters than
 those with same side dominance of hand and eye.  i was picked from
 my softball class because i was cross dominant (right hand, left eye)
 which put me in a small minority (and the grad student was trying to get
 an equal number of cross dominant and same side dominant people).  to
 control the study, she used a pitching machine - fast pitch.  since
 i was used to slow pitch, i didn't come close (actually i think
 i foul tipped a few) to hitting the ball.  if there were a lot of people
 like me in her study (i.e., those who can't hit fast pitch, or are
 not used to hitting off a machine),  i would seriously question the
 results of that study!!  i think there have been some studies of major
 league players (across a fairly large cross section of players) to test
 whether eye dominance being the same or opposite side was "better" -
 but i don't know the results.  (the woman who ran the study i was in
 said that there was a higher incidence of crossdominance in major
 leaguers than across the general population - but i'm not sure
 whether i'd believe her.)
