 recently, i completed a 2 week juice fast (with 3 days of water) and had
 two colonics as part of it.  my motivation was primarily spiritual, to
 de-toxify from all the crap i've been putting in my body (not like thats
 enough to clean it all out but it did have an effect).  personaly, i
 didn't find it an uncomfortable experience (the colonic), lost about
 15lbs of beer belly (which hasn't come back over the last month), and
 feel great.  one of the things that prompted me to get the colonic was
 seeing my 90 year old grandmother chair ridden from colitis (?) from
 years of indulgence.
 
 not everything that goes in comes out, and personaly i don't mind giving
 my body a hand once in a while.
 
 just my experience,
