 greeting
 
 i am starting work on a project where i am trying to make strain gages
 bond to bone in vivo or a period of several months.  i am currently
 using hydroxyapaptite back gages, and i have tried m-bonding the gages
 to the bone.  apart from those two application methods there doesn't
 seem to be much else in the literature.  i have only an engineering 
 background not medical or biological.  i would be interest in any
 ideas about how to stimulte bone growth on the surface of cortical bone.
 
 thanks for oyur help in advance.
