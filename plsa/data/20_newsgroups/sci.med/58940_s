    from the tufts university guide to total nutrition: stanley gershoff, 
    ph.d., dean of tufts university school of nutrition; harperperennial, 1991
    (isbn #0-06-272007-4):
 
 	"the greatest hazard of barbecuing is that the cook will not use
 	 enough caution and get burned.  some people suggest that the
 	 barbecuing itself is dangerous, because the smoke, which is 
 	 absorbed by the meat, contains benzopyrene, which, in its pure form,
 	 has been known to cause cancer in laboratory animals.  however,
 	 in order to experience the same results, people would have to
 	 consume unrealistically large quantities of barbecued meat at a
 	 time."
