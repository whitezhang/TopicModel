 imho, the original poster has no business soliciting diagnoses off the net,
 nor does dr./mr.  o'donnell have any business supplying same. this is one
 major reason real physicians avoid this newsgroup like the plague. it is
 also another example of the double standard: if i as a physician offered
 to diagnose and treat on the net, i can be sued. but people without
 qualifications are free to do whatever they want and disclaim it all with
 "i'm not a doctor."
 
 get and keep this crap off the net. period.
