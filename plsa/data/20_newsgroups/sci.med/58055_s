 ron, you're an endless source of misinformation!  there are no sacral
 vertebrae.  there is a bone called the sacrum at the end of the spine.
 it is a single, solid bone except in a few patients who have a
 lumbarized s1 as a normal variant.  how do you adjust a solid bone,
 break it?  no, don't tell me, i don't want to know.
