 well, i think you might want to visit a doctor who is familiar with
 sleep disturbances, because antihistamines only help induce sleep when
 they're used intermittently; they lose their sedative effect if they're
 used on a nightly basis.  their anticholinergic effects (drying of secretions,
 relaxing effects on smooth muscle) can be problematic in some people, such as
 those with glaucoma or prostate enlargement.
 
 antihistamines like diphenhydramine (benadryl) or doxylamine (unisom)
 are potent sedatives which are useful occasionally.  chlorpheniramine
 (chlor-trimeton) is said to be less sedative, but 8mg seems to work
 well in some people.  both chlorpheniramine and doxylamine have long
 half-lives compared to diphenhydramine, and so may produce a residual
 hangover or "drugged" feeling the next morning.
