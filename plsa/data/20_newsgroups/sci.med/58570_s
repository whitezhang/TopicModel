 as usual, you are missing the whole point, russell, because you are not
 willing to even consider questionning your basic article of faith, which
 is that science is merely a matter of methodology and that the highest
 purpose of science is to avoid making mistakes.  
 
 this is like saying that the most important aspect of business management
 is accurate bookkeeping.  
 
 if science were no more than methodology and not making mistakes, it
 would be a poor thing indeed.  what was the methodology of darwin?  what
 was the methodology of einstein?  what was, for that matter, the
 methodology of jenner and pasteur?

 first of all, i think you are arguing against a straw man, because i
 don't think that anyone here is arguing that quackery, pseudo-science,
 homeopathy, chiropracty, and traditional chinese medicine should be
 accepted as science.  i, in particular, think the basic ideas of
 homeopathy and chiropracty seem extremely flaky.  
 
 what some of us do believe, however, is that some of these things
 (including some of the flaky ideas) are deserving of serious scientific
 attention.  
 
 if in fact it were true, as you have stated above, that those who do not
 use the currently fashionable methodology can have no idea what is
 effective and what is not, then science today would not exist.  for all
 of current science is based on the past work of scientists whose
 methodology, by current standards, was seriously flawed.  
 
 it is certainly true that as methodology improves, we need to re-examine
 those results derived in the past using less perfect methodologies.  it is
 also true that the results obtained by people today who still rely on 
 those early methodologies needs to be re-examined in a more rigorous 
 fashion by those qualified to do so credibly.  
 
 but to say that nobody who fails to do elaborate double-blind studies is
 capable of knowing their ass from a hole in the ground and to say that no
 ideas that come from outside the scientific establishment could possibly
 be worthy of serious investigation ... this truly marks one's attitude as
 doctrinaire, cultist.  this attitude is not compatible with a belief in
 reason.
