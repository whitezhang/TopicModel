 see the rec.pets.cats faq or any doctor or vet for more information.
 
 i am not any of the above, but we do have a couple of cats.
 
 it is transmitted through the fecal matter, so a pregnant woman should
 avoid cleaning the cat tray and you should both wash hands before
 preparing or eating meals.  the latter is sound advice at any time of
 course.
 
 apart from that, its no great problem.  you certainly do not need to
 get rid of your cats.
