 
 some recent postings remind me that i had read about risks 
 associated with the barbecuing of foods, namely that carcinogens 
 are generated. is this a valid concern? if so, is it a function 
 of the smoke or the elevated temperatures? is it a function of 
 the cooking elements, wood or charcoal vs. lava rocks? i wish 
 to know more. thanks.
