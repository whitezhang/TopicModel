 assuming that the wax is causing hearing loss, congestion or popping
 in the ears, you can try some cautious tepid water irrigation with a
 bulb syringe, but it is awkward to do for oneself and may not work or
 may even make things worse.  (my wife would disagree, she does it
 successfully every six months or so.)  in any case do not attempt
 anything with q-tips!!!
 
 my experience has been that this is initially best handled by a
 ear/nose/throat person.  i say initially, because an ent can evaluate
 whether or not you might have success on your own with a little
 instruction.
 
 i am not a physician (obviously, because i eschew the term
 otolaryngologist); this posting is based only on personal experience.
