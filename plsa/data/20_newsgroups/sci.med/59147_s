 	then let me ask you for a "workable" solution.  we have a name
 here that implies certain things to many people.  rather than trying
 to educate each and every person that comes to the group -- is there
 some "name" that would imply what this group was originally
 intended for?  
 
 	my dad was a lawyer -- as such i grew up with being a stickler
 for "meaning".  in my "reality", psychoactives *technically* could 
 range from caffeine to datura to the drugs you mention to more
 standard recreational drugs.  in practice i had hoped to see it
 limited to those that were above some psychoactive level -- like
 some of the drugs you mention, but also possibly including *some*
 recreational drugs -- but with conversation limited to their psychoactive 
 effects -- the recent query about "bong water", i thought was a bit
 off topic -- so i just hit "k".
 
 	but back to the original question -- what is a workable solution --
 what is a workable name that would imply the topic you with to
 discuss?  it sounds like there should be a alt.smartdrugs, or something
 similar -- i don't feel psychoactives would generally be used to
 describe alot of those drugs.  there is a big difference between a
 drug that if taken in "certain doses, over a period of days may have
 a psychoactive effect in some people", vs. many of the drugs in
 pihkah which *are* psychoactive.
