 i've heard of no studies, but speculation:
 
 why on _earth_ would there be any effect on women's health?  that's about 
 the most absurd idea i've heard since ted kaldis's claim that no more than 
 35,000 people would march on washington.
 
 ok, _one_ point:  greatly reduced chance of pregnancy.  but that's it.
