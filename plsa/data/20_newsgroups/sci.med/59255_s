 the body will make fat out of carbohydrates if it needs them. third, your
 body, like most peoples, wasn't bred to live on a high fat, modern diet.
 if you read texts about ancient and primative people you will read about
 the luxury of eating fat, how people enjoyed it. this was because it was so
 rare. even cows didn't put out nearly the amount of butterfat in milk that
 they do now.

 are pregnant. if you are lucky you can work on getting rid of it after the
 baby. (it is said that doctors have less gallbadder surgery than the rest
 of the population, a good part of it is that they are willing to do the
 dieting, etc that helps them avoid surgery. also, i don't think the surgery
 lets a person go back to eating a high fat diet. )
