 there has been no hard info provided about msg making people ill.
 that's the point, after all.

 that's because these "peer-reviewed" studies are not addressing
 the effects of msg in people, they're looking at animal models.
 you can't walk away from this and start ranting about gloom and
 doom as if there were any documented deleterious health effects
 demonstrated in humans.  note that i wouldn't have any argument
 with a statement like "noting that animal administration has pro-
 duced the following [blah, blah], we must be careful about its
 use in humans."  this is precisely not what you said.

 it most certainly is for neurotoxicology.  you know, studies of
 glutamate involve more than "food science".

 so, point us to the studies in humans, please.  i'm familiar with
 the literature, and i've never seen any which relate at all to
 olney's work in animals and the effects of glutamate on neurons.

 well, actually, they have to tolerate some phenylalanine; it's a
 essential amino acid.  they just try to get as little as is healthy
 without producing dangerous levels of phenylalanine and its metabolites
 in the blood.

 goodness, i'm not saying that it's good to feed infants a lot of
 glutamate-supplemented foods.  it's just that this "projected safety
 margin" is a construct derived from animal models and given that,
 you can "prove" anything you like.  we're talking prudent policy in
 infant nutrition here, yet you're misrepresenting it as received wisdom.

 you mean "asserting".  you're being intellectually dishonest (or just
 plain confused), because you're conflating reports which do not necessarily
 have anything to do with each other.  olney's reports would argue a potential
 for problems in human infants, but that's not to say that this says anything
 whatsoever about the use of msg in most foods, nor does he provide any
 studies in humans which indicate any deleterious effects (for obvious
 reasons.)  it says nothing about msg's contribtion to the phenomenon
 of the "chinese restaurant syndrome".  it says nothing about the frequent
 inability to replicate anecdotal reports of msg sensitivity in the lab.

 probably one of the dumber remarks you've made.
