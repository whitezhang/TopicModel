 thanks to all those who responded to my original post on this question.  the
 final diagnosis was stress.  i did not take her for a chiropractic adjustment.
 (rachel receives all her medical care at keller army hospital since she is a
 military dependant, and the army does not yet provide chiropractic adjustments
 as part of its regular health care.)  i am hoping that the arrival of (1)
 spring break, and (2) college acceptance letters, will help.  *unfortunately*
 she was wait-listed at the college she most dearly wanted to attend, so it
 seems as though that stressor may just continue for a while.  :-(
 
 meanwhile she is going on a camping trip with her religious youth group for
 spring break, which seems like a good stress-reliever to me.
 
 thanks again for everybody's help/advice/suggestions/ideas.
