 no, there's no evidence that would convince any but the most credulous.
 
 the "evidence" is identical to the sort of evidence that has been
 used to justify all sorts of quack treatments for quack diseases
 in the past.

 i like the implication here.  it must not be that the quacks making
 millions off such "diseases" are biased -- rather that those who
 doubt their existence don't understand the real world.  it seems
 easy to picture a 19th centure snake oil salesman saying the same
 thing.
 
 however, i have been in the trenches long enough to have seen multiple
 quack diseases rise and fall in popularity.  "systemic yeast syndome"
 seems to be making a resurgence (it had fallen off a few years ago).
 there will be new such "diseases" i'm sure with best-selling books
 and expensive therapies.

 well this, of course, is convincing.  i guess i'd better start diagnosing
 any illnesses that people want so that i can keep my lips.
