 	this is true, but it's not quite the whole story.  there were 
 	actually some people who were more careful in their methodology
 	who also replicated the 'phantom leaf effect.'
 
     one of the most influential critics of kirlian electrophotography
     is a theosophist (and threfore presumably willing to entertain the
     hypothesis of scientific evidence for a human aura, electromagnetic
     or otherwise), professor of electrical engineering at london's
     city university, and a past president of the society for psychic research 
     named a. j. ellison.
 
     after years of studying the method and the claims, ellison
     came to the conclusion that the photographic images are what we
     calls 'lichtenberg figures,' an effect of intermittent ionization of
     the air around the object.  it's a bit more complicated than
     'not wiping off the plates,' but it comes down to the same thing
     in the end, kirlian electrophotography has much more limited
     value (if any) than was previously widely thought.  electrical and
     magnetic fields generated by the body are much too small to be
     of much use diagnostically without very elaborate equipment and
     usually also tracer chemicals.
