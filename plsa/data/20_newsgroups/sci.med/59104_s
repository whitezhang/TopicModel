 dyer is beyond rude. 
 
 there have been and always will be people who are blinded by their own 
 knowledge and unopen to anything that isn't already established. given what 
 the medical community doesn't know, i'm surprised that he has this outlook.
 
 for the record, i have had several outbreaks of thrush during the several 
 past few years, with no indication of immunosuppression or nutritional 
 deficiencies. i had not taken any antobiotics. 
 
 my dentist (who sees a fair amount of thrush) recommended acidophilous:
 
 after i began taking acidophilous on a daily basis, the outbreaks ceased.
 when i quit taking the acidophilous, the outbreaks periodically resumed. 
 i resumed taking the acidophilous with no further outbreaks since then.
