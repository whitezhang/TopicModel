 what does "dc" stand for?  couldn't be an antichiropractic posting
 from a chiropractor, could it?  my curiosity is piqued.
 
 prostate ca is an especially troublesome entity for chiropractors.
 it so typically causes bone pain due to spinal metastases that it
 gets manipulated frequently.  manipulating a cancer riddled bone
 is highly dangerous, since it can then fracture.  i've seen at
 least three cases where this happened with resulting neurologic
 damage, including paraplegia.  this is one instance where knowing
 how to read x-rays can really help a chiropractor stay out of trouble.
 do chiropractors know what bony mets from prostate look like?
