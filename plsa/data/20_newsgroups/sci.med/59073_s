 have you ever met a chemist?  a food industry businessman?  you must
 personally know a lot of them for you to be able to be so certain that they
 are evil mosters whose only goal is to inflict as much pain and disease
 as possible into the general public.  gimme a break.

 because it makes the food taste better!  why does it put salt in food?
 same reason.

 obviously.

 of course not!  (although i would think that a person like you would be a
 big fan of such recycling if that were the case).

 on occasion that's probably the case, but in general the idea is that msg
 improves the flavor of certain foods.

 no.

 no.

 as i recall, these are natural by-products of heating up certain foods.
 they don't "put it in there".
  
  
 have a number of criteria in choosing how to process food.  they want to
 make it taste good, look good, sell for a good price, etc.  the fact that they
 use it tells me that they think that it contributes to those goals they are
 interested in.  one of those goals is not "making people sick".  such a goal
 woud quickly drive them out of business and for no benefit.

 warning of what?  in california there is a law requiring that anything which
 contains a carcinogen be labeled.  that includes every gasline pump, most
 foods, and even money cleaning machines (because nickel is a mild carcinogen).
 the result is that now nobody pays any attention to any of the warnings.

 why?  what if not 30% of people wanted to buy this ugly, rotten, not-as-tasty
 food?  i guess it will just be wasted, huh?  how terribly efficient.
  
 >3) while at it outlaw yellow dye #5.  for that matter why dye food?
  
 because it makes food look better.  i like food that looks good.
 if vitamin companies want to do that it is fine, but who are you to
 tell them how to make vitamins?  who are you to tell me whether i should
 buy flavored vitamins for my kids (who can't swallow the conventional ones
 whole).
  
 >keep food food!  quit putting in junk!
  
 how do you define "junk"?  is putting "salt" in food bad?  what about
 pepper?  what about alcohol as a preservative?  what about sealing jars
 with wax?  what about vinegar?  you seem to think that "chemicals" are
 somehow different than "food".  the fact is that all foods are 100% chemicals.
 you are just expressing an irrational prejudice against food processing.
