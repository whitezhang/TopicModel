  include small amounts of hot, spicy foods with your meals. it's
  not a cure, but many people find it helpful to create extra mucus.
  you may also consider taking a few drops of iodine in juice or water 
  (consult your doctor first!), which is available otc in canada.
  if you have a sedentary lifestyle, exercising sometimes helps.

  i tried to e-mail you, but our board is having internet problems,
  so i'm not sure whether you got the information on rutin or not.
  
  rutin is not a herb, but part of the bioflavonoid complex. you should
  generally *not* take rutin by itself, but take the whole bioflavonoid 
  complex instead. if you don't (and there are some exceptions to that)
  you'll eventually create a hesperidin deficiency, which is the other
  major component of the bioflavonoid complex.
  i found out the hard way years ago when i recommended rutin, after it
  showed deficient in patients who were not deficient in hesperidin be-
  fore. a later retest almost always showed a subsequent deficiency in 
  hesperidin, which, from then on, made me always *add* bioflavonoids 
  to anyone that had *very* low levels of rutin.
  most of the time people are equally low in rutin *and* hesperidin, so
  there is really no reason to take rutin by itself, but use the whole
  bioflavonoid complex instead.
 
  i have several thousand patients taking them with many claiming that 
  they had been helped with hemorrhoids, varicose veins, chronic nose 
  bleeds, aneurysms, gastro-intestinal bleeding (due to drugs), etc...
  one patient in desperation took a whole bottle (100's) in one day
  for his painful, bleeding hemorrhoids, without any ill effects.
   
  they are also non-toxic in very high amounts, that's why they can
  be safely recommended. if you are allergic to citrus fruit (they are
  made from their peels), pine bark sources are available as well.
 
  about 90% of patients tested show a bioflavonoid deficiency, 
  with the average daily dosage needed being about 1 - 2,000mg.
  for major complaints, 4 - 6,000mg+/day is common.
  
  in case they cannot be taken, because of their size and taste (they
  are big, and they don't taste that great), a product made from pine 
  bark extract gives you the same effect and the tablets are quite
  small and taste much better, however the cost is about seven times
  higher for the equivalent effect. one 25mg tablet of the pine bark
  extract gives you about the same effect as 1,000mg of bioflavonoids.
  the name for the pine bark product is 'pycnogenol.'
   
    some canadian brands carrying bioflavonoids are:
  
    quest.............1,000mg   big, bitter, not chewable
    swiss herbal........600mg   smooth, easier swallowing 
    jamieson............500mg   medium, bitter, chewable 
 
    sisu.................25mg   (pycnogenol) small, easy swallowing
  
    give them a try and see what happens.....and good luck!
