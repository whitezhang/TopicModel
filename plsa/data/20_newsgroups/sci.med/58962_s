 i know that there is msg sensitivity.  when i eat foods with msg i get
 very thirsty and my hands swell and get a terrible itchy rash. i first
 experienced this problem when i worked close to chinatown and ate chinese
 food almost everyday for lunch.  now i can't tolerate msg at all.  i can
 notice immediately when i have eaten any.  i try to avoid msg completely.
 
 interesting fact though is that all three of my children started experiencing
 the exact same rash on their hands.  i couldn't understand why because i
 don't msg in cooking and we ask for no msg when we do eat chinese (i still
 love it).  after some investigation i knew that oodles of noodles where
 one of their favorite foods.  one of the main ingredients in the flavor
 packets is msg.  now i look at all labels.  you would be surprised at
 places you find msg.
