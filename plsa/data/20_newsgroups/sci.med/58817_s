 sjogren's syndrome has been known to induce dryness in vaginal tissue as well
 as induce primary biliary cirrhosis. otherwise the abdominal swelling could be
 due to a complication of sjogren's known as pseudolymphoma which *can* produce
 a splenomegaly (enlarged spleen). she should definitely see a rheumatologist.
 
 since you don't mention skin disorder, anemia, or joint pain you'd probably
 rule out erythema nodosum or scleroderma.
