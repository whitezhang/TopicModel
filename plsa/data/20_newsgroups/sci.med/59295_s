         just one quick question:
         my father has had a back problem for a long time and doctors
         have diagnosed an operation is needed. since he lives down in
         mexico, he wants to know if there is a hospital anywhere in
         the united states particulary famous for this kind of surgery,
         kind of like houston has a reputation for excellent doctors
         in eye surgery. any additional info or pointers will be
         appreciated a whole lot!...
 
 
                 thanks in advance.
