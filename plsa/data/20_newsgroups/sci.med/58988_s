 i think that's the correct spelling..
 	i am looking for any information/supplies that will allow
 do-it-yourselfers to take krillean pictures. i'm thinking
 that education suppliers for schools might have a appartus for
 sale, but i don't know any of the companies. any info is greatly
 appreciated.
 	in case you don't know, krillean photography, to the best of my
 knowledge, involves taking pictures of an (most of the time) organic
 object between charged plates. the picture will show energy patterns
 or spikes around the object photographed, and depending on what type
 of object it is, the spikes or energy patterns will vary. one might
 extrapolate here and say that this proves that every object within
 the universe (as we know it) has its own energy signature.
