 there's been extensive discussion on the compuserve cancer forum about dr. 
 burzynski's treatment as a result of the decision of a forum member's father 
 to undertake his treatment for brain glioblastoma.  this disease is 
 universally and usually rapidly fatal.  after diagnosis in june 1992, the 
 tumor was growing rapidly despite radiation and chemotherapy.  the forum 
 member checked extensively on dr. burzynki's track record for this disease.  
 he spoke to a few patients in complete remission for a few years from 
 glioblastoma following this treatment and to an nci oncologist who had 
 audited other such case histories and found them valid and impressive.  
 after the forum member's father began dr. burzynski's treatment in 
 september, all subsequent scans performed under the auspices of his 
 oncologist in chicago have shown no tumor growth with possible signs of 
 shrinkage or necrosis.
 
 the patient's oncologist, although telling him he would probably not live 
 past december 1992, was vehemently opposed to his trying dr. burzynski's 
 treatment.  since the tumor stopped its rapid growth under dr. burzynski's 
 treatment, she's since changed her attitude toward continuing these 
 treatments, saying "if it ain't broke, don't fix it."
 
 dr. burzynski is an m.d., ph.d. with a research background who found a 
 protein that is at very low serum levels in cancer patients, synthesized it, 
 and administers it to patients with certain cancer types.  there is little 
 understanding of the actual mechanism of activity.
