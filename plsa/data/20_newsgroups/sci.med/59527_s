 i agree with this consensus that it should not have been written the way
 it was.  my doctor - who claims to have introduced dr. crook to the
 possibility of candida overbloom causing diffuse symptoms way back in
 1961 (i have no reason to doubt him on this) - does not like the book
 because 1) it makes too many unfounded claims, and 2) is horribly written
 from a scientific viewpoint.  on the other hand, my doctor has always kept
 an open mind on the subject and does believe in aspects of the "yeast
 connection".
 
 but, i believe there is some truth to the book.  hopefully the right
 clinical studies can be done to separate the fact from the fiction.  in
 the meantime, i'd still encourage people who have "incurable" chronic sinus
 problems (especially if they overused antibiotics), to find a doctor to
 administer a systemic-type anti-fungal such as itraconazole (along with
 liver panels before, during and after treatment just to play it safe).  it
 is an empirical approach for sure, but when all else fails, and your ent
 says "sorry, you'll just have to live with it", it is time to step out and
 try an empirical approach backed up with significant anecdotal evidence
 (dr. ivker), supported by plausible theories (outlined by marty).  at
 this stage you have little to lose, particularly if you use itraconazole and
 have the proper monitoring - the health risk has been shown through extensive
 clinical studies both in europe and the u.s. to be very minimal with
 relatively healthy (i.e., non-aids) patients.  i'm glad i did this, since i
 saw remarkable results after only one week on sporanox (itraconazole).  of
 course, your mileage may vary a lot - everyone is different so it may not
 work for you.  talk to your doctor.
