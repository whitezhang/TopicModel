 a relative of mine has recently been diagnosed with "stage 3 papillary cell
 ovarian cancer".  we are urgently seeking the best place in the country for
 treatment for this.
 
 does anyone have any suggestions?
 
 as you might suspect, time is of the essence.
 
 thanks for your help.                                      bob
