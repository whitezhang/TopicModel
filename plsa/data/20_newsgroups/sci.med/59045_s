 are you arguing that the lyme lab test is accurate?
 the books that i've read say that in general the tests
 have a 50-50 chance of being correct.  (the tests
 result in a large number of both false positives and
 false negatives.  i am in the latter case.)
 
 we could get those same odds by "rolling the dice".
