 it sounds as though you might want to try a product such as "super-glue".
 the active ingredient is cynoacrylate, the same compound used to reconstruct
 bones.  i have successfully used superglue for a number of procedures on many
 different species of animal. if you are simply trying to adhear something
 to bone for several months, this would be ideal. it bonds almost immediatly,
 is resistant to infection, and is non-irritating to surrounding tissue.
