 dear netters:
 
 maybe one of you can explain this.  from time to time i experience 
 a strange kind of feeling (i have all kinds of weird feelings) which 
 can be best described as the feeling of "losing gravity", like that one 
 experiences in a descending elevator.  needless to say, it is not 
 enjoyable.  it sometimes comes with shortness of breath and extreme 
 fatigue.  it lasts from a few minutes to an hour and when it lasts 
 that long, it makes me sweatening.
 
 initially i called it "palpitation (spelling?)" until i later learnt that 
 the terminology has been reserved for the self-awareness of heart beats.
 
 so, is there a specific term for this feeling, or am i a stragne person?
 i always believe i am unique. 
 
 thanks.
