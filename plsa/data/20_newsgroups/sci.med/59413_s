 i have a receipe at home that was posted to me by one of our fellow
 netters about a month ago.  i am recalling this from memory but
 i think i'm fairly close (by the way it was great!)
 
 1 	pint of plain yogurt 
 1/2	med. sized cucumber finely shredded
 3	cloves of garlic (more or less by taste)
 1/4 tsp	dill weed
 
 the yogurt is dumped into a strainer lined with a coffee
 filter and allowed to drain at least 2 hours (you can
 adjust the consistancy of the sauce by increasing this time
 up to 24 hours)
 
 the shredded cuc is drained the same way
 
 mix it all together and let it steep for at least
 2 hours (it's better the next day) and enjoy!
