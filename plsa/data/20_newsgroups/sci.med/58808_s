 a(> a woman i know is tapering off klonopin. i believe that is one of the
 a(> benzodiazopines. she is taking a very minimal dose right now, half a tablet
 a(> a day. she is also pregnant. my question is are there any known cases where
 a(> klonopin or similar drug has caused harmful effects to the fetus?
 a(>  how about cases where the mother took klonopin or similar substance and had
 a(> normal baby. any information is appreciated. she wants to get a feel for
 a(> what sort of risk she is taking. she is in her first month of pregnancy.
 
 klonopin, according to the pdr (physician's desk reference), is not a
 proven teratogen.  there are isolated case reports of malformations,
 but it is impossible to establish cause-effect relationships.  the
 overwhelming majority of women that take klonopin while pregnant have
 normal babies.
