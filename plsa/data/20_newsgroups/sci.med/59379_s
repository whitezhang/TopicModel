 i'm very surprised that medical schools still push routine circumcision
 of newborn males on the population. since your friend is not a man, she
 can't imagine what it's like to have a penis, much less a foreskin. i
 guess if american medicine did an artistic job of circumcising every
 male, then the visual result would be somewhat more natural in
 appearance...
 
 the penile cancer thing has been *completely* debunked...she must be
 going to school on a south pacific island. tell her to check the journal
 or urology for circumcision articles. i remember at least 1 on an old
 jewish man (cut at birth) who developed penile cancer....i mean, if the
 cancer risk was that great, the europe who have been circumcising like
 crazy, too. teaching a boy how to keep his cockhead clean is the issue: a
 little proper hygiene goes a long way - americans are just too hung up on
 the penis to consider cleaning it: that's just way too much like
 mastubation. so you have surgical intervention that is basically
 unnecessary.
