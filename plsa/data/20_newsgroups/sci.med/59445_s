 
 my wife had hives during the first two months
 of her pregnancy.  my son (3 months old), breast-fed,
 now has the same symptoms.  she has been to a skin-specialist,
 but he has merely prescribed various medicines (one
 each visit as though by trial and error :-))
 
 anti-histamines worked on both of them, but looks like
 becoming less effective.
 
 are there other solutions?  thanks.
