 given the choice, i would rather argue <g>.
 
 no arguments about migranous aura; in fact, current best evidence is
 that aura is intrinsicially neuronal (a la spreading depression of
 leao) rather than vascular (something causing vasoconstriction and
 secondary neuronal ischemia).
 
 migraine without aura, however, is a fuzzier issue.  there do not
 seem to be objectively measurable changes in brain function.  the
 copenhagen mafia (lauritzen, olesen, et al) have done local cbf
 studies on migraine without aura, and (unlike migraine with aura,
 but like tension-type) they found no changes in lcbf.
 
 from one (absurd) perspective, *all* pain is neurologic, because in
 the absence of a nervous system, there would not be pain.  from
 another (tautologic) perspective, any disease is in the domain of
 the specialty that treats it.  neurologists treat headache,
 therefore (at least in the usa) headache is neurologic.
 
 whether neurologic or not, nobody would disagree that disabling
 headaches are common.  perhaps my fee-for-service neurologic
 colleagues, scrounging for cases, want all the headache patients
 they can get.  working on a salary, however, i would rather not fill
 my office with patients holding their heads in pain.
