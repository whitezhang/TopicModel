 just had the opportunity to watch this flick on a&e -- some 15 years
 since i saw it last.  
 
 i was very interested in the technology demonstrated in this film
 for handling infectious diseases (and similar toxic substances).
 clearly they "faked" a lot of the computer & robotic technology;
 certainly at the time it was made most of that was science fiction
 itself, let alone the idea of a "space germ".  
 
 quite coincidentally [actually this is what got me wanted to see
 the movie again] i watched a segment on the otherwise awful _how'd
 they do that?_ dealing with a disease researcher at the cdc's top
 lab.  there was description of the elaborate security measures taken
 so that building will never be "cracked" so to speak by man or
 nature (short of deliberate bombing from the air, perhaps).  and
 the researchers used "spacesuits" similar to that in the film.
 
 i'm curious what people think about this film -- short of "silly".
 is such a facility technically feasible today?  
 
 as far as the plot, and the crystalline structure that is not life
 as we know it, that's a whole 'nother argument for rec.arts.sf.tech
 or something.
