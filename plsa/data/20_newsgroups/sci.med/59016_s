 it is not true that dermatologists gave not reached the laser age, in
 fact, lasers in dermatological surgery is a very new and exciting field.
 
 it probably won't be effective in tinea pedis because the laser is
 usually a superficial burn (to avoid any deeper damage). limited tinea
 pedis can be cured albeit sometimes slowly by topical antifungals as
 well as systemic medication i.e. tablets. finally, a self-diagnosis is
 not always reliable, lichen simplex chronicus can look like a fungal
 infection and requires very different treatment.
