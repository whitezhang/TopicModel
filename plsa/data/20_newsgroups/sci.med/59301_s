 the principle underlying these devices is a well establish principle in
 psychology called 'entrainment,' whereby external sensory stimuli
 influence gross electrical patterns of brain function.
 
 they are 'experimental' in that people experiment with them and they
 are _not_ widely (if at all) used in medicine for therapeutic purposes.  
 given the exception of tens and similar units used for external electrical 
 stimulation, usually for pain relief, not really a light and sound machine.
 
 they are _not_ experimental in the sense of a specific medical 
 category to that effect, as with experimental drugs, as the fda does not 
 specifically regulate medical devices in the way it does pharmaceuticals.   
 
 >i would think that if they work as reported they would be incredibly useful,
 
 there are few reliable studies of therapeutic or enhancement effects
 for mind machines, other than those relaxation-related effects found with 
 meditation or self-hypnosis as well.  reported benefits are mostly anecdotal and
 subjective so far, so it's hard to generalize about their potential value.
 
 a pretty good general non-technical introduction to a wide variety
 of these devices may be found in "would the buddha wear a walkman ?"
 some interesting background material, names of suppliers, and capsule reviews
 of specific equipment.

 a more important question might be whether they have enough additional
 value to be worth investing in.  'biofeedback' was found to be a legitimate
 and reliable effect experimentally under certain conditions, (in that
 it demonstrated that we can influence physiological processes previously 
 considered purely autonomic) but never panned out as a particularly valuable 
 therapeutic tool because of the skill level required and the subtlety and
 temporary nature of the effects in most cases.   maybe someone else 
 has more, there used to be a whole mailing list devoted to mind machines,
 somewhere on the net.
