 first, i'm sorry to hear that you have had to see your grandmother go
 through this.  i know it has to have been tough.
 
 there are many things that can cause long term confusion in elderly
 adults.  the change in environment can cause problems.  anesthetic agents
 can cause confusion because the body cannot clear the medicines out of
 the body as easily.  in addition, medications and interactions between
 medications can cause confusion.
 
 as far as whether or not haldol can have long lasting effects even after
 the drug has been discontinued, i do not know.  i have not _seen_ anything
 to that effect.  however, i also had not been looking for that information.
 i can see what i can find...
 
 i can tell you that haldol is an antipsychotic drug, and, according to
 the nursing93 drug handbook, it is "especially useful for agitation
 associated with senile dementia"  (p. 400).  it also should not be 
 discontinued abruptly.  it did not say anything about long lasting
 effects.
 
 because so many things can cause confusion, it is hard for me to know
 what else was going on at the time; if i had more history, i might be able
 to answer you better.  if you want to send me e-mail with more information,
 i would be happy to try to  help you piece together what might have
 happened.
