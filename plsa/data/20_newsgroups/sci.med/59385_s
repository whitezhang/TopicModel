 i saw the same thing happen to my father, and i can more or less validate your
 take on hospitals.  it seems to me that medical science understands precious
 little about taking care of the human machine.  drugs are given as a
 response to symptoms (and i guess that makes sense since all the studies that 
 validate the effectiveness of those drugs are based on a narrow
 assessment of the degree of particular symptoms).  but there seems
 to be very little appreciation for the well-being of a person
 outside of the numbers that appear on a test.  i watched my dad
 wither away and lose huge amounts of body fat and muscles tissue
 while in the hospital.  there is something a little crazy about a
 system in which there is more attention paid to giving you every
 latest drug available than there is attention paid to whether you
 have had enough to eat to prevent loss of muscle tissue.  it is
 really, really bizarre.
