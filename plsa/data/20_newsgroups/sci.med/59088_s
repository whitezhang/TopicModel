 fyi...i just posted this on alt.psychoactives as a response to
 what the group is for......
 
 
 a note to the users of alt.psychoactives....
 
 this group was originally a takeoff from sci.med.  the reason for
 the formation of this group was to discuss prescription psychoactive
 drugs....such as antidepressents(tri-cyclics, prozac, lithium,etc),
 antipsychotics(melleral(sp?), etc), ocd drugs(anafranil, etc), and
 so on and so forth.  it didn't take long for this group to degenerate
 into a psudo alt.drugs atmosphere.  that's to bad, for most of the
 serious folks that wanted to start this group in the first place have
 left and gone back to sci.med, where you have to cypher through
 hundreds of unrelated articles to find psychoactive data.
 
 it was also to discuss real-life experiences and side effects of
 the above mentioned.
 
 oh well, i had unsubscribed to this group for some time, and i decided
 to check it today to see if anything had changed....nope....same old
 nine or ten crap articles that this group was never intended for.
 
 i think it is very hard to have a meaningfull group without it
 being moderated...too bad.
 
 oh well, obviously, no one really cares.
