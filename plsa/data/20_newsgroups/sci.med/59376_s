 recently i've come upon a body of literature which promotes colon
 cleansing as a vital aid to preventive medicine through nutrition.  in
 particular, dr. bernard jenssen in his book "colon cleansing for
 health and longevity" -- the title actually escapes me, but it is very
 similar to that -- claims that regular self-administered colonics,
 along with certain orally ingested "debris-loosening agents", boosts
 the immune system to a significant degree.
 
 he also plugs a unique appliance called the "colema board", which
 facilitates the self-administration of colonics.  it sells for over
 $100 from a california-based company.  he also plugs vitra-tox
 products as his chemical agents of choice: these include volcanic ash,
 supposedly for its electrical charge, and psyllium powder, for its
 bulkiness.
 
 if anyone knows anything about colon cleansing theory, its
 particulars, or the colema board and related products, i'd be very
 interested to hear about research and personal experience.
 
 this article is crossposted to alt.magick as the issue touches upon
 fasting and cleansing through a "ritual" system of purification.
