 i am looking for statistics on the prevalence of disorders that are
 treatable with botulinum type a.  these disorders include: facial
 dyskinesia, meige syndrome, hemifacial spasm, apraxia of eyelid openeing,
 aberrant regeneration of the facial nerve, facial paralysis, strabismus,
 spasmodic torticollis, muscle spasm, occupational dystonia (i.e. writers
 cramp, etc.), spasmodic dysphonia, and temporal mandibular joint disease.
 
 i realize many of the disorders i listed (such as "muscle spasm" !!) are
 vaguely defined and may encompass a wide range of particular disorders.  my
 apologies; the list was provided to me as is.  i have some numbers, but not
 reliable.  
 
 any ideas on sources or, even bbetter, any actual figures (with source
 listed)?
 
 many thanks,
