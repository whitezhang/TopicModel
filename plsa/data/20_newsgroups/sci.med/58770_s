      if the nose culture shows staph, then ceftin or even ceclor
      are better. suprax does not kill staph. treating bacterial
      infections involves a lot of try-and-fail because the
      infections often involve multiple organisms with many resistant
      strains. some 60% of hemophilus influenza strains are now
      resistant. what works for me and my organisms may not work
      for you and yours. keep experimenting.
