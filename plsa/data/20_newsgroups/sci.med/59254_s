 could some please refer me to someone who can perform prk (photo refractive 
 keratostomy) in canada (preferably eastern portion).  i've looked in
 the yellow pages with little success, and if someone has had a good (or
 bad, for that matter) experience, that would be especially helpful if you
 could please let me know.
 
 thanks,
