 first off, if i'm not mistaken, only hibernating animals have brown fat,
 not humans.
 
 secondly, your description sounds just like 2,4-dinitrophenol.  this is an
 uncoupler of respiratory chain oxidative phosphorylation.  put in layman's
 terms, it short-circuits the mitochondria, causing food energy to be
 turned into heat.
 
 2,4-dnp was popular in the 1930's for weight reduction.  in controlled
 amounts, it raises body temperature as the body compensates for the
 reduced amount of useful energy available.  it is very dangerous.
 it would be wiser to adjust to your present body form, rather than
 play around with 2,4-dnp.
 
 but if you insist, i suggest you look up the literature in your own
 university library.  you can obtain 2,4-dnp by taking a first year
 organic chemistry lab course and swiping it from the supplies (it's
 a commonly-used reagent).
