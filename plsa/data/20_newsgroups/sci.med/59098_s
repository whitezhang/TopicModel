 if it were my wife, i would insist that a radiologist be involved in the
 process.  radiologist are intensively trained in the process of
 interpreting diagnostic imaging data and are aware of many things that
 other physicians aren't aware of.  would you want a radiologist to
 deliver your baby?  if you wouldn't, then why would you want a ob/gyn to
 read your ultrasound study?
 
 
 in my opinion the process should involve a ob/gyn and a radiologist.
