 about two years ago i posted the following:
  
 i am planning to write a new book called "great canadian scientists."
 please forward your nominations to me: shell@cs.sfu.ca
  
 the rules are that the person must be a canadian citizen. they don't have
 to be born in canada or even live in canada, but they must have (or have
 had, if they are dead) canadian citizenship while they are/were great
 canadian scientists.
  
 about 70 people have been nominated already and they are listed at the
 end of this posting.
  
 i'm not quite sure what should constitute greatness, and there may be a
 gray area here. if you have any ideas on criteria for greatness, i would be
 pleased to hear them. in any event, please nominate people even if you are
 not sure they are great. i would like as big a list as possible.
  
 please give me a name and email address, phone number or mail address, so
 that i can contact the person. if you don't know any of the above, then
 give me their last known whereabouts. also please give your reason for why
 you think the person should be considered a great canadian scientist.
  
 after i have the list, i will choose about six of the most interesting ones
 and do in-depth biographies of those individuals in the style of tracy
 kidder's "soul of a new machine" or some other dramatic technique.
 the rest of the great canadian scientists will appear in an appedix with 
 one paragraph biographies.
  
 if you have any other ideas about this project, i am interested to hear
 them.
  
 so far, i have received 68 nominations as follows:

 the list is growing nicely. it's amazing to see just how much was discovered
 by canadians. actually there are many more who were born in canada, but
 became americans after graduate school.
  
 please note: a lot of people have nominated alexander graham bell but i
 feel he was really a scottish/american with a summer home in canada. now
 i know this is debatable, but please don't nominate him again.
  
 if anyone can fill in some of the question marks on the list, please drop
 me a line.
 ==================================================
  
 that was two years ago. since then, i have received a grant from science
 culture canada, a division of supply and services canada to research the
 book. since my old posting the book has evolved into an educational book
 for kids aged 9 - 14 (though this may change again) it will have about
 40 two-page spreads with a large graphic in the middle and text/graphic
 boxes all around on the following subjects: vital statistics and photo of
 the scientist, personal statement from the scientist, narrative of a few
 moments in the life of the scientist, "what i was doing when i was 12",
 so you want to be a <insert kind of scientist>, experiment you can do. there 
 will be an appendix with 100 - 200 more scientists with one paragraph
 biographies who didn't quite make it to the double spreads. the whole thing
 will then be published on cd-rom with video and sound clips for added
 richness. i am looking for a cd-rom publisher as well. the text part may
 also be available on the canarie electronic highway being developed in
 canada as well.
  
 i am still looking for a publisher though penguin canada came close 
 to being it. hope to find one soon. 
  
 i would like to again ask for more nominations, especially in the
 pure sciences of physics, chemistry and biology. also criticisms of 
 the list are welcomed. also women and french-canadian scientists are needed.
  
 i hope this posting will get others to nominate more great canadian
 scientists, and to discuss what is "great" what is "canadian" and what is
 "scientist".
