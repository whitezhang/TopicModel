 i don't have any evidence against water from lourdes curing ms --
 i'm sure there is anecdotal evidence that it does.  do you really think
 that in the absence of a double-blind study i should be indifferent
 to the hypothesis that water from lourdes cures ms?
 
 for what it's worth, i know of only one double blind study of nystatin
 for "candida hypersensitivity syndrome."  it was published in the 
 new england journal (i think 1990) and showed no benefit on systemic
 symptoms (though i think it reduced vaginal yeast infections, not
 surprisingly).  as i recall, the yeast crowd had some major objections
 to the study, though i don't remember what they were.
