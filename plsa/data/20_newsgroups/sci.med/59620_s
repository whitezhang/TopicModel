 without restating the thread going here.....
 
 zoloft is a stimulating antidepressant.
 
 it is unfortunate that antidepressant therapy is trial and error, but
 if it is any help, there are a lot of people using the side effects of
 the many medications to help manage other conditions.
 
 hang in there, maybe someday a "brain chemistry set" will be available
 and all the serotonin questions will have answers.
 
 please, no flames........i have enough to deal with   :)
