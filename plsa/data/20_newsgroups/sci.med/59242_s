 i read a great book about eye dominance several years ago. so there is one
 book out there..at least one :).
 
 there were several types of eye dominance. where a person looks in their
 memory usually indicates a type of eye dominanc another type is related to
 coordination activities like hitting a ball. another for reading. 
 
 i didn't read one that discussed prescription strength. although people
 with bad vision, near or far sighted would tend to depend on the stronger
 eye.
