 yeah, the "feingold diet" is a load of crap.  children diagnosed with add
 who are placed on this diet show no improvement in their intellectual and
 social skills, which in fact continue to decline.  of course, the parents
 who are enthusiastic about this approach lap it up at the expense of their
 children's development.  so much for the value of "interesting anecdotal
 results".  people will believe anything if they want to.
