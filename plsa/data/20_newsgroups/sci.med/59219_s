 i hope gordon banks did not mean to imply that notions such as
 hard-to-see candida infections causing various problems should not
 be investigated.  many researchers have made breakthroughs by 
 figuring out how to investigate things that were previously thought
 "virtually impossible to test for."
 
 indeed, i would be surprised if "candida overbloom" were such a
 phenomena.  i would think that candida would produce signature
 byproducts whose measure would then set a lower bound on the 
 extent of recent infection.  i realize this might get quite 
 tricky and difficult, probably expensive, and likely inconvenient
 or uncomfortable to the subjects, but that is not the same as 
 "virtually impossible."
