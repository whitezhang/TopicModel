 nothing unisual.

 this was known long ago.  brain produces and uses some msg naturally,
 but not in doses it is served at some chinese places. 
 having said that, i might add, that in mho, msg does not enhance
 flavor enoughf for me to miss it.  when i go to chinese places,
 i order food without msg.  goos places will do it for you.
 a prerequisite for such a service would be a waiter, capable of
 understanding, what you want.
 
 
 good luck.
