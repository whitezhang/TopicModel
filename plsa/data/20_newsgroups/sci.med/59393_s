 the use of shock waves (not ultrasound) to break up stones has been
 around for a few years.  depending on the type of machine, and intensity
 of the shock waves, it is usually uncomfortable enough to require
 something...  the high-power machines cause enough pain to require
 general or regional anesthesia.  afterwards, it feels like someone
 slugged you pretty good!
