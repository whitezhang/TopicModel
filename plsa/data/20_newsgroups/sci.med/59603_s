 i am reluctant to summarize it, for then you will have my opinion of what the
 article says, rather than your own opinion.  i think it is important enough
 for you to take the trouble to go to the library and get the article.  the
 title is "the shot doctors" and it appears on pages 96-100 of the february,
 1988 issue of consumer reports.  the following excerpt from the article may
 entice you to read the whole article:
      too often, shots are overused....."when you put a patient on
      shots, you've got an annuity for life," a former president of
      the american academy of allergy and immunology told cu. [page 97]
