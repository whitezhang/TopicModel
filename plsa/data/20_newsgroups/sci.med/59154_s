                            purpose
 this, the first international conference on intelligent systems 
 for molecular biology, is the inaugural meeting in a series 
 intended to bring together scientists who are applying the 
 technologies of artificial intelligence, robotics, machine 
 learning, massively parallel computing, advanced data modelling, 
 and related methods to problems in molecular biology.  the scope 
 extends to any computational or robotic system supporting a 
 biological task that is cognitively challenging, involves a 
 synthesis of information from multiple sources at multiple levels, 
 or in some other way exhibits the abstraction and emergent 
 properties of an "intelligent system."  
 
                           facilities
 the conference will be held at
    lister hill center 
    national library of medicine
    8600 rockville pike
    nih, building 38a
    bethesda md 20894
 seating in the conference center is strictly limited, so 
 registrations will be accepted on a first-come, first-serve basis. 
 accomodations, as well as a reception and poster session, will be 
 at the
    bethesda ramada hotel 
    8400 wisconsin avenue
    bethesda md 20814
 a special room rate has been negotiated with the hotel, of $92/day 
 (expires 6/21).  attendees must make their own reservations, by 
 writing the hotel or calling (800)331-5252 and mentioning the 
 ismb conference.  to participate in a roommate-matching service, 
 e-mail opitz@cs.wisc.edu.
 
                          transportation
 the two facilities are within easy walking distance, convenient to 
 the subway (metro red line, medical center stop), and from there 
 to the amtrak station.  nearby airports include dulles, national, 
 and baltimore-washington international. 
 
                            proceedings
 full-length papers from both talks and posters will be published in
 archival proceedings.  the citation is:

                       tutorial program
 tutorials will be conducted at the bethesda ramada hotel on 
 tuesday, july 6.
 
 12:00-2:45pm "introduction to molecular biology for computer 
  scientists"  prof. mick noordewier (rutgers university)
 
 this overview of the essential facts of molecular biology is 
 intended as an introduction to the field for computer scientists 
 who wish to apply their tools to this rich and complex domain.  
 material covered will include structural and informational 
 molecules, the basic organization of the cell and of genetic 
 material, the "central dogma" of gene expression, and selected 
 other topics in the area of structure, function, and regulation as 
 relates to current computational approaches.  dr. noordewier has 
 appointments in both computer science and biology at rutgers, and 
 has extensive experience in basic biological research in addition 
 to his current work in computational biology.
 
 12:00-2:45pm "introduction to artificial intelligence for 
  biologists"  dr. richard lathrop (mit & arris corp.)
 
 an overview of the field of artificial intelligence will be 
 presented, as it relates to actual and potential biological 
 applications.  fundamental techniques, symbolic programming 
 languages, and notions of search will be discussed, as well as 
 selected topics in somewhat greater detail, such as knowledge 
 representation, inference, and machine learning.  the intended 
 audience includes biologists with some computational background, 
 but no extensive exposure to artificial intelligence.  dr. 
 lathrop, co-developer of ariadne and related technologies, has 
 worked in the area of artificial intelligence applied to 
 biological problems in both academia and industry.
 
 3:00-5:45pm "neural networks, statistics, and information theory 
  in biological sequence analysis" dr. alan lapedes (los alamos 
  national laboratory) 
 
 this tutorial will cover the most rapidly-expanding facet of 
 intelligent systems for molecular biology, that of machine 
 learning techniques applied to sequence analysis.  closely 
 interrelated topics to be addressed include the use of artifical 
 neural networks to elicit both specific signals and general 
 characteristics of sequences, and the relationship of such 
 approaches to statistical techniques and information-theoretic 
 views of sequence data.  dr. lapedes, of the theoretical 
 division at los alamos, has long been a leader in the use of such 
 techniques in this domain.
 
 3:00-5:45pm "genetic algorithms and genetic programming" 
  prof. john koza (stanford university)
 
 the genetic algorithm, an increasingly popular approach to highly 
 non-linear multi-dimensional optimization problems, was originally 
 inspired by a biological metaphor.  this tutorial will cover both 
 the biological motivations, and the actual implementation and 
 characteristics of the algorithm.  genetic programming, an 
 extension well-suited to problems where the discovery of the size 
 and shape of the solution is a major part of the problem, will 
 also be addressed.  particular attention will be paid to 
 biological applications, and to identifying resources and software 
 that will permit attendees to begin using the methods.  dr. koza, 
 a consulting professor of computer science at stanford, has taught 
 this subject since 1988 and is the author of a standard text in 
 the field.
 
 3:00-5:45pm "linguistic methods in sequence analysis" 
  prof. david searls (university of pennsylvania) 
  & shmuel pietrokovski (weizmann institute)
 
 approaches to sequence analysis based on linguistic methodologies 
 are increasingly in evidence.  these involve the adaptation of 
 tools and techniques from computational linguistics for syntactic 
 pattern recognition and gene prediction, the classification of 
 genetic structures and phenomena using formal language theory, the 
 identification of significant vocabularies and overlapping codes 
 in sequence data, and sequence comparison reflecting taxonomic and 
 functional relatedness.  dr. searls, who holds research faculty 
 appointments in both genetics and computer science at penn, 
 represents the branch of this field that considers higher-order 
 syntactic approaches to sequence data, while shmuel pietrokovski 
 has studied and published with prof. edward trifinov in the area 
 of word-based analyses.
