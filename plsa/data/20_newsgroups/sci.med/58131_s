 several years ago i tried to commit a patient who was growing salmonella out of his
 stool, blood, and an open ulcer for treatment. the idea was that the guy was a
 walking public health risk, and that forcing him to receive iv antibiotics for
 a few days was in the public interest. i will make a long story short by saying
 that the judge laughed at my idea, yelled at me for wasting his time, and let
 the guy go.
 
 i found out that tuberculosis appears to be the only medical (as oppsed to psychiatric)
 condition that one can be committed for, and this is because very specific laws were
 enacted many years ago regarding tb. i am certain these vary from state to state.
 
 any legal experts out there to help us on this?
