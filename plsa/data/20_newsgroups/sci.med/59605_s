 nice explanation except that it isn't n-hydroxylation that causes the
 formation of the n-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (napqi), but rather a
 direct two-electron oxidation. in addition, there is one school of thought
 that contends that oxidative stress rather than arylation of protein
 is the more critical factor in the hapatotoxcity of acetaminophen.  
 
 as far as drug toxicities go, acetaminophen has and continues to be one
 of the most intensely scrutinized. an excellent recent review of the topic
 can be found in: 
 
 	vermeulen, bessems and van de straat. 	
 	molecular aspects of paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity and its
 	mechanism-based prevention. drug metabolism reviews, 24(3) 367-
 	407 (1992).
 
 	(acetaminophen is known as paracetamol in europe)
 
 i couldn't agree with you more about what an awful way to die a toxic
 dose of acetaminophen causes.  i've heard a number of descriptions by
 physicians associated with poison control centers, and they describe a
 lingering very painful death.
