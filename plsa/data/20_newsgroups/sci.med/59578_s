 about six years ago my ears clogged up with wax, probably as a
 result of to much headphone use.  anyway, the clinic that cleaned
 them out used the following procedure:
 
 1. inject olive oil into ears.
 2. prevent leakage of oil with cotton.
 3. come back in an hour.
 4. rinse ears with warm vater, forcefully injected
    into ear (very strange sensation).
 5. done.
 
 they had special tools to do this, and were evidently quite
 familiar with the problem: very large steel syringe.  special
 bowl with cutout for ear to take the grime coming out without
 spillage.
