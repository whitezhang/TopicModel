 i don't think that's a problem.  my face is quite oily too.  i had a moderate
 acne problem for many years.  i then found that if i vigorously scrub my face
 with a nail brush and soap (irish spring) twice a day the acne was not a 
 problem.  i can still leave a pretty health nose print on a mirror after 45 min
 (don't ask ;->) but acne is not a real problem anymore.
