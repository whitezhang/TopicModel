 msg is mono sodium glutamate, a fairly straight forward compound. if it is
 pure, the source should not be a problem. your comment suggests that 
 impurities may be the cause.
 my experience of msg effects (as part of a double blind study) was that the
 pure stuff caused me some rather severe effects.

 soya bean, fermented cheeses, mushrooms all contain msg.

 the symptoms i had were numbness of jaw muscles in the first instance
 followed by the arms then the legs, headache, lethargy and unable to keep
 awake. i think it may well affect people differently.
