 no wonder he became confused!  with so many drugs, it is almost impossible
 to know which one is causing the problem.  and because some drugs 
 potentiate the effect of each other, they can make the side effects
 all the worse, and even dangerous.  (kinda like mixing alcohol and 
 antihistamines!)

 unfortunately, doctors prescribe drugs to treat the side effects of
 the drugs a patient is receiving.  if one drug they are taking causes
 the patient's blood pressure to go up, many times an antihypertensive
 is prescribed instead of re-evaluating the need for the original drug.
 this is why many older adults are trying to take a dozen or so drugs
 at home!!!!

 i fully agree.  in addition, she proably should be examined by another
 doctor who can re-evaluate the need for the medications she is taking.
 i can't remember the guidelines i either saw in a text or heard during
 a lecture, but any elderly adult who is receiving medications should have
 the need for the drug re-evaluated regularly.  if her current physician
 is unwilling to do this, find one who will.  either check the phone 
 book for a physician who specializes in geriatric medicine or gerontology, 
 or contact a physician referral line or the american medical society.
 by finding a geriatric specialist, he (she) will more likely be in tune
 with the special needs of elderly adults and maybe can help.
