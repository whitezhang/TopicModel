 
 i was wondering if anyone had any information about molluscous contagiosem.
 i acquired it, and fortunately got rid of it, but the question still lingers
 in my mind: where did it come from?  the little bit of info that i have 
 received about it in the past states that it can be transmitted sexually, but
 also occurs in small children on the hands, feet and genitalia.
 
 any information will be greatly appreciated.
