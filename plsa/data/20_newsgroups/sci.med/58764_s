 and has been rather thoroughly demolished as myth by robert scott root-
 bernstein.  see his book, "discovering".  ring structures for benzene
 had been proposed before kekule', after him, and at the same time as him.
 the current models do not resemble kekule's.  many of the predecessors
 of kekule's structure resemble the modern model more.
 
 i don't think "extra-scientific" is a very useful phrase in a discussion
 of the boundaries of science, except as a proposed definiens.  extra-rational
 is a better phrase.  in fact, there are quite a number of well-known cases
 of extra-rational considerations driving science in a useful direction.
 
 for example, pasteur discovered that racemic acid was a mixture of
 enantiomers (the origin of stereochemistry) partly because he liked a
 friend's crank theory of chemical action.  the friend was wrong, but
 pasteur's discovery stood.  a prior investigator (mitscherlich), looking
 at the same phenomenon, had missed a crucial detail; presumably because he
 lacked pasteur's motivation to find something that distinguished racemic
 acid from tartaric (now we say: d-tartaric) acid.
 
 again, pasteur discovered the differential fermentation of enantiomers
 (tartaric acid again) not because of some rational conviction, but because
 he was trying to produce yeast that lived on l-tartaric acid.  his notebooks
 contained fantasies of becoming the "newton of mirror-image life," which
 he never admitted publically.
 
 perhaps the best example is the discovery that dna carries genes.  avery
 started this work because of one of his students, and ardent anglophile
 and francophobe canadian, defended fred griffiths' discoveries in mice.
 most of griffiths' critics were french, which decided the issue for the
 student.  avery told him to replicate griffiths' work in vitro, which the
 student eventually did, whereupon avery was convinced and started the
 research program which, in 15 or so years, produced the famous discovery
 (avery, macleod, and mccarty, jem 1944).
