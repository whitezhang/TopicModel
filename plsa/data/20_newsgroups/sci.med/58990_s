 i have a long sighted eye and a short sighted eye. my right eye tends
 to cut out when i look at distant things, my left eye when i am close
 up.  i had specs to balance things up a bit but could do without them.
 i thought that, one way or another, i would always be able to see
 clearly.  unfortunately middle age is rearing its ugly head and i can
 no longer see close up objects clearly.  maybe it's just that my arms
 are getting shorter :-)
