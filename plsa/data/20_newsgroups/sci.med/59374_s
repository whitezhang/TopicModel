 my (then) wife used to get recurrent yeast infections. one day, her
 doctor sent her home with medication for her and a pill for me. i took
 the pill, upon her insistence, and was very relieved the next day when i
 looked it up in the pdr. it only rarely causes testicular atrophy...
 
 anyway, men apparently do get yeast infections.
