 
 	my brother's affine has recently been diagnosed with sweet's
 syndrome. also called steroid resistant sweet's syndrome.
 
 	this syndrome started after she had had iodine 131 treatment for
 hyperthyroidism. she'd been reluctant to have treatment for the
 hyperthyroidism for many years and apparently started to show exaustion
 from it. 
 
 	i understand that she may still be testing high in thyroid level
 but she's isn't being treated by an endocrinologist. her previous
 endocrinologist bowed out when she entered the hospital. she entered the
 hospital because of the sweet's syndrome symptoms (skin lesions).
 
 i've looked through the last two years of medline and didn't find an
 abstract mentioning a correlation between thyroid and sweets. . 
 
 i checked a handbook which said that sweet's was associated with leukemia.
 
 i'd like a reccomndation for experts who are in new york city or who travel
 to new york city. for the sweets and perhaps for the endocrinology.
 
 any information that might help. apparently there hasn't been much
 improvement in her condition over the past several months.
