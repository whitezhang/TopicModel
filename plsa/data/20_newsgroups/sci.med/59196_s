 dear netters,
 
 i am not sure whether this is the right place to post my query, but i
 thought there may be some bilingual physicians in this newsgroup that
 could help. please, excuse me for overloading the bandwidth.
 
 i am trying to build a resource allocation program for managing a
 surgical operating unit in a hospital. the user interface is in
 english, however the terms of medical specialties i was given are in
 french :-( i have no medical dictionary handy, mine is a technical
 university :-((
 
 i need to get the translation into english (when there is one) of the
 following words. they refer to medical categories of operating rooms
 (theaters). i admit they may not be universally "used".
 
 1- sceptique
 2- orl
 3- brulure/brule'
 4- ne'onatal
 5- pre'natal
 6- pre'mature'
 7- neurochirurgie (neuro-surgery??)
 8- chirurgie ge'ne'rale
 9- chirurgie plastique
 10- urologie (urology??)
 
 thank you for you help.
 cheers,
