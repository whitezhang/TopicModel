 that is the standard advice in dermatology texts.
 the soak part greatly increases the inconvenience.  don't bother unless
 it doesn't work otherwise.

 exactly, but it adds to the "ritual" aspect, which is important for
 us suggestible patients.  (posters, don't bother to repeat the 
 rationale for the soak.)

 greasy no matter what. vaseline (generically, petrolatum) is 
 famous for that.  one text states that the more greasy a dry-skin
 cream is, the more effective.

 try usp lanolin, at least for maintenance (preventive) therapy.  usp
 lanolin is natural and much less greasy and cheap (don't buy the more
 expensive perfumed lanolin mixture).  as i've commented before, petrolatum
 is a poorly characterized mixture of hydrocarbons which are not found in
 biological systems (that is not inherently bad, but smell it up close,
 even on your hand), are partially absorbed into the body and remain there
 for months or more, and have associations with cancer.  don't panic, but
 also don't believe it's god's gift to the human skin.
