 the diarrhea problem?  what diarrhea problem?  first, candidal overgrowth is
 not a frequent problem during antibiotic therapy, and not all cases of
 antibiotic-related diarrhea have anything to do with candida.  but a case
 of vaginal candidiasis or oral thrush after antibiotic therapy isn't going
 to surprise anyone either.  that's not what people are disagreeing with.

 oh, really?  where'd you come up with this?  you know, it's really
 appalling to see you try to comment authoritatively on clinical matters
 in a bizarre synthesis from reading reports in the literature.
 bobbing for citations in the research literature isn't medicine.
 i hope you're not giving the wrong idea to your medical students.
