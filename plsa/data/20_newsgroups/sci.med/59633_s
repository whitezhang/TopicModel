 and where do you advise people to turn for cancer information?

 it seems to me you've offered a circular refutation of moss's organization. who
 has shown the information in the latest book of pac to be questionable? could
 it be those 'regulatory' agencies and medical industries which moss is showing
 to be operating with *major* vested interests. whether one believes that these
 vested interests are real or not, or whether or not they actually shape medical
 research is a seperate argument. if one sees a possibility, however, that these
 interests exist, then the 'fact' that some of the information put out by pac
 has been refuted by the medical industry doesn't hold much weight.
 
 as for the ineffectiveness of antineoplasteons, the fact that the nih didn't
 find them effective doesn't make much sense here. of course they didn't! i
 tend to have more faith in the word of the patients who are now alive after
 being told years ago that they would be dead of cancer soon. they are fighting
 like hell to keep that clinic open, and they credit his treatment with their
 survival. anyone who looks at the nih's record for investigation of 'alterna-
 tive' cancer therapies will easily see that they have a strange knack for find-
 ing relatively cheap and nontoxic therapies dangerous or useless.
