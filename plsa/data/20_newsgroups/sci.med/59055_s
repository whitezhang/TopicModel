 hello,  i am not sure if this is the right conference to ask this
 question, however, here i go..  i am a commercial fisherman and i 
 fell about 3 weeks ago down into the hold of the boat and broke or
 cracked a rib and wrenched and bruised my back and left arm.
   my question,  i have been to a doctor and was told that it was 
 best to do nothing and it would heal up with no long term effect, and 
 indeed i am about 60 % better, however, the work i do is very 
 hard and i am still not able to go back to work.  the thing that worries me
 is the movement or "clunking" i feel and hear back there when i move 
 certain ways...  i heard some one talking about the rib they broke 
 years ago and that it still bothers them.ÿ.  any opinions?
 thanx and cheers
