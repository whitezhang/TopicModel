 i had allergy shots for about four years starting as a sophomore in high
 school.  before that, i used to get bloody noses, nighttime asthma attacks,
 and eyes so itchy i couldn't get to sleep.  after about 6 months on the
 shots, most of those symptoms were gone, and they haven't come back.  i
 stopped getting the shots (due more to laziness than planning) in college.
 my allergies got a little worse after that, but are still nowhere near as
 bad as they used to be.  so yes, the shots do work.
