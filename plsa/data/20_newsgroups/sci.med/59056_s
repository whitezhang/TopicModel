 	ask the practitioner whether he uses the pre-sterilized disposable
 needles, or if he reuses needles, sterilizing them between use.  in the
 former case there's no conceivable way to get aids from the needles.  in
 the latter case it's highly unlikely (though many practitioners use the
 disposable variety anyway).
