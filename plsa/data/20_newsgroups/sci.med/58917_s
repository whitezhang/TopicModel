 okay mr. dyer, we're properly impressed with your philosophical skills and
 ability to insult people. you're a wonderful speaker and an adept politician.
 however, i believe that all you were asked to do, was simply provide scientific
 research refuting the work of olney. i don't think the original poster sought
 to start a philisophical debate. she wanted some information. given a little
 effort one could justify that shooting oneself with a .45 before breakfast is a
 healthy practice. but we're not particularily interested in what you can
 verbally prove/disprove or rationalize. where's the research? where are the
 studies?
 
 i appoligize if this sounds flamish. i simply would like to see the thread get
 back on track.
