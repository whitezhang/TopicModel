 isn't this what hiv is about - the "normal immune response" to an exposure?

 i had electrical pulse nerve testing done a while back.  the needles were taken
 from a dirty drawer in an instrument cart and were most certainly not
 sterile or even clean for that matter.  more than likely they were fresh
 from the previous patient.  i was concerned, but i kept my mouth shut.  i
 probably should have raised hell!
 
 any comments?  no excuses.
