 
 i have become involved in a project to further develop and 
 improve the performance of spect (single photon emission
 computerized tomography) imaging.  we will eventually have
 to peddle this stuff somewhere, and so as i move this thing
 along, i would like to know --
 
 what is the current resolution of spect imaging?  what kinds
 of jobs is spect used for, specifically?  what kind of specific jobs
 could i hope
 that spect could be used for, if its resolution improved,
 say, to close to that of pet (positron emission tomography)?
 and how much does a spect machine cost?  how much does a single
 spect image cost?  
 
 if anyone knows the answer to any or all of these questions, or
 where i could find that answer, i would be very grateful, indeed.  
 thanks in advance for any replies
