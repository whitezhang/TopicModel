 first off, use some decent terms if ya don't mind.  this is sci.med, not
 alt.sex.
 
 secondly, how absolutely bogus to assume that "american's are just too hung
 up on the penis....blah,blah".  i think most american's don't care about
 anything so comlicated as that.  they just think it "looks nicer".  ask 
 a few of them and see what response you get.  others still opt for
 circumcision due to religious traditions and beliefs.  some think it is
 easier to clean.  still others do it because "daddy was".
 
 dont' be so naive as to think american's are afraid of sexuality. 
 
 my son is not circumcised, and i can vouch for the argument that it is
 more difficult to keep clean than a circumcised kids'.  not so much that
 the foreskin is difficult to pull back (it isn't) but because my son
 doesn't want to wait long enough for a thorough check for smega or misplaced
 feces.  so, many times it just gets a once over dab.  it worries me
 that he might get an infection due to his lack of cooperation.  i am
 sure, however, that he will be able to handle cleaning under the foreskin
 himself once he is old enough.  until, there is always the decision at
 each diaper change...is this the time to clean or can we wait till next
 time.
