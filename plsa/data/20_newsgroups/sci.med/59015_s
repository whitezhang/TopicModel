 i suspect you mean laparoscopic instead of orthoscopic.

 by far the (still) best method to diagnose a hernia is old fashioned
 physical examination. if you have an obvious hernia sac coming down 
 into your scrotum, or a bulge in your groin that is brought about by
 increasing intra-abdominal pressure....
 sometimes is not that obvious. the hernia is small and you can only 
 detect it by putting your finger into the inguinal canal. 
 whether you have a recurrent hernia, or this is related to the previous
 operation, i can't tell you. the person that examined you is in  the best
 position to make that determination.
 
 are there non-invasive ways of diagnosing a hernia? every now and then 
 folks write about ct scans and ultrasounds for this. but these are far
 too expensive, and unlikely to be better than a trained examining finger.
