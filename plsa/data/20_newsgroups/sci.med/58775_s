 ok, just for grins:
 - kekule hypothesized a resonant structure for the aromatic benzene
 ring after waking from a dream in which a snake was swallowing his tail.
 - archimedes formalized the principle of buoyancy while meditating in
 his bath.
 
 in neither case was there "no connection to prior theories, concepts, etc."
 as you stipulated above. what there was was an intuitive leap beyond
 the current way of thinking, to develop ideas which subsequently proved
 to have predictive power (e.g., they stood the test of experimental
 verification).
 
 pardon my kibbutzing...
