  as far as i can see if your obstetrition has an ultrasound in his rooms
 and is expirienced its use and interpretation, he should be just as
 capable of reading it as any radiologist. all doctors are "qualified" to
 read x-rays, u/s, ct scans etc. it is just that a radiologist does nothing
 else, and thus, is only better at reading them because of all this time
 spent doing this (skill in reading x-rays etc. just comes from plenty of
 practice). if your obstetrition reads heaps of obstetric ultrasounds he
 should be able to pick up any abnormalities that can be demonstrated by
 this technique.
