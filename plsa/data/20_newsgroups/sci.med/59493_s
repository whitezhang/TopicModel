 the millipede's around here (austin) have no sting.  some of the
 centipedes do.  the question rebecca snyder asks is much like
 asking "how venomous are snakes?"  one either wants to ask "which
 snake?" or point to some reference on the many different species
 of snake.  similarly, there are many different species of
 millipede and centipede.  (these are different families;
 millipedes have two pairs of legs per body segment, while
 centipedes have but one pair.)
 
 sorry if this information is not useful.
