 i've had cold sores in the past.  but they have always been in the 
 corner of my mouth.  recently,  i've had what appears to be
 a cold sore, but on my lower lip in the middle (above the chin).
 
 can cold sores appear anywhere around the mouth (or body)?
 
 is there a medical term for cold sore?
