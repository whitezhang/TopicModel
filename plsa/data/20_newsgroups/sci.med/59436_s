    news advisory:
 
    results of the largest heart attack study ever undertaken,
 the global utilization of streptokinase and t-pa for occluded
 coronary arteries trial (gusto), will be presented friday, april
 30, at the clinical research meeting.
    a press conference will be held at 12:30 p.m.
    gusto evaluates the most aggressive emergency-room treatment
 strategies available to clear blocked heart arteries and restore
 blood flow to the heart, a process called thrombolysis.  the
 thrombolytic strategies compared in gusto use powerful drugs to break
 up blood clots in heart vessels quickly and prevent clots from
 recurring.  these strategies have never been compared directly in a
 large-scale clinical trial until gusto.  the results are expected to
 have an important impact on heart attack treatment worldwide.
    the press conference will be held at two locations: live at the
 national press club, main lounge, 13th floor, 529 14th st., n.w.,
 washington d.c., and via satellite at the hotel macklowe, 145 w. 44th
 street, 4th floor, new york city, between broadway and 6th avenue.
    gusto results will be presented by eric topol m.d., gusto study
 chairman, professor and chairman of the department of cardiology at
 the cleveland clinic foundation; robert califf, m.d., clinical
 director, gusto coordinating center and associate professor of
 medicine at duke university medical center; and allan ross, m.d.,

 director of the division of cardiology at the george washington
