 :cph has, indeed, an excellent prognosis. if i had to choose between cah and
 :cph there is no question i would also choose cph. however, as david pointed
 :out, the distinction between the two is not as neat as some of us would have
 :it. the histology can sometimes be pretty equivocal, with biopsies showing
 :areas compatible with both cph and cah. maybe it is a sampling problem. maybe
 :it is a continuum. i don't know.
 
 darn.  just when i think i understand something someone who knows the
 pathology has to burst my bubble :-(  we'd better not start talking about
 glomerular diseases, then i'll really get depressed.
 
 seriously though, i wonder how someone with cph would end up getting a
 biopsy in the first place?  my understanding (and feel free to correct me)
 is that the enzymes are at worst mildly elevated, with overall normal
 hepatic function.  i would think that the only clue might be a history of
 prior hepb infection and a positive hepb-sag.  or is it indeed on a
 continuum with cah, and the distinction merely one of pathology and
 prognosis, but otherwise identical clinical features?
