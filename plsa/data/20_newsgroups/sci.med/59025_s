 fmgs who are not citizens are, like all aliens, in a difficult
 situation. only citizens get to vote here, so non-citizens are of
 little or no interest to legislators. also, the non-citizen may well
 be in the middle of processing for resident alien status. there is a
 stron sense that rocking the boat (eg. suing a residency program)
 will delay the granting of that status, perhaps for ever.
