 a person has crohns, raw vegetables cause problems (unspecified)
 steve holland replies:  patient may have mild obstruction.  avoid things
 that would plug her up.  crohn's has no dietary restriction in general.

 the feeling obout this has changed in the gi community.  the current
 feeling
 is that inflammation is not induced by food.  there is even evidence that
 patients deprived of food have mucosal atrophy due to lack of stimulation
 of
 intestinal growth factors.  there is now interest in providing small
 amounts
 of nasogastric feeding to patients on iv nutrition.  but i digress.  
 symptoms can be drastically enhanced by food, but not inflammation.

 the low residue diet is appropriate for you if you still have obstructions.
 again, it is not felt that food causes inflammation.  these foods are
 avoided because they may get stuck.  i'd go ahead and have the
 fudge, though ;-)  .

 spencer makes an especially good point in having an observant and
 informed patient.  would that many patients be able to tell what
 causes them problems.  the digestive processing idea is changing, but
 if a food causes problems, avoid them.  be sure that the foods are 
 tested a second time to be sure the food is a real cause.  crohn's
 commonly causes intermittent symptoms and some patients end up with
 severly restricted diets that take months to renormalize.
 
 there was a good article in the ccfa newsletter recently that discussed
 the issue of dietary restriction of fiber.  it would be worth reading
 to anyone with an interest in crohn's.
 
 and, as i always say when dealing with crohn's, as does spencer, good luck!
