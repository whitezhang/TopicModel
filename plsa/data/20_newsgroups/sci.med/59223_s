 ihave had a frozen shoulder for over a year or about a year.  it is still
 partially frozen, and i am still in physical therapy every week.  but the
 pain has subsided almost completely.  until last week when i mowed the
 lawn for twenty minutes each, two days in a row.  i have a push type power
 mower.  the pain started back up a little bit for the first time in quite
 a while, and i used ice and medicine again.  can anybody explain why this
 particular activity, which does not seem to stress me very much generally,
 should cause this shoulder problem?
 
 thanks.
