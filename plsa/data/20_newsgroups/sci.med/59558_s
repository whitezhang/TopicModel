 i would like to know if their is any medical consensus
 (or consensus within this group) regarding the ethics
 of the following:
 
   1: prescription of placebo medications when the patient
      did not specifically request any sort of treatment.
 
   2: selling a placebo medication for a profit.
 
   3: prescribing homeopathic remedies without advising
      a patient of their "controversial nature".
 
   4: representing homeopathic remedies as "over the counter"
      medications.
 
 thanks,
 nick ingegneri
