 i live at sea-level, and am called-upon to travel to high-altitude cities
 quite frequently, on business.  the cities in question are at 7000 to 9000
 feet of altitude.  one of them especially is very polluted...
 
 often i feel faint the first two or three days.  i feel lightheaded, and
 my heart seems to pound a lot more than at sea-level.  also, it is very
 dry in these cities, so i will tend to drink a lot of water, and keep
 away from dehydrating drinks, such as those containing caffeine or alcohol.
 
 thing is, i still have symptoms.  how can i ensure that my short trips there
 (no, i don't usually have a week to acclimatize) are as comfortable as possible?
 is there something else that i could do?
 
 a long time ago (possibly two years ago) there was a discussion here about
 altitude adjustment.  has anyone saved the messages?
 
 many thanks,
 
 vida.
