 yeah, it might, if you only read the part you quoted.  you somehow left 
 out the part about "we all ate the same thing."  changes things a bit, eh?
 
 you complain that people blame msg automatically, since it's an unknown and
 therefore must be the cause.  it is equally (if not more) unreasonable to
 defend it, automatically assuming that it can't be the culprit.
 
 pepper makes me sneeze.  if it doesn't affect you the same way, fine.
 just don't tell me i'm wrong for saying so.
