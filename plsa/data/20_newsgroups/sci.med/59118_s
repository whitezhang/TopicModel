 ever heard of something called the placebo effect? i think dyer is
 reacting because it looks to be yet another case of the same old
 quackery over and over again.
 
 it true that current medical knowledge is limited, but do you realize
 just how many quacks exist eager to suck your $$$$. it's playing the
 lottery at best.
 
 if the results you got were so clear and obvious, would you mind
 trying a little experiment to see if it is true? it would be quite
 simple. have sugar pills and have real pills.  take one set for one
 week and the other set for another week without knowing which ones are
 the real pills. then at the end of the 2 weeks compare the results.
 let's say you're wife would know which are the real ones. if what you
 are experiencing is true there should be a marked difference between
 each week.
