 my wife and i are in the process of selecting a pediatrician for our
 first child (due june 15th).  we interviewed a young doctor last week
 and were very impressed with her.  however, i discovered that she is
 actually not an medical doctor (m.d.) but rather a "doctor of 
 osteopathy" (d.o.).  what's the difference?  i believe the pediatrician
 *i* went to for many years was a d.o. and he didn't seem different from
 any other doctor i've seen over the years.
 
 my dictionary says that osteopathy is "a medical therapy that emphasizes
 manipulative techniques for correcting somatic abnormalities thought
 to cause disease and inhibit recovery."
 
 jeez, this sounds like chiropractic.  i remember getting shots and
 medicine from *my* pediatrician d.o., and don't remember any 
 "manipulative techniques".  perhaps someone could enlighten me as to
 the real, practical difference between an m.d. and a d.o.  also, i'm
 interesting in hearing any opinions on choosing a pediatrician who
 follows one or the other medical philosophy.
 
 readers of sci.med:  please respond directly to sbrenner@attmail.com;
 i do not read this group regularly and probably won't see your response
 if you just post it here.  sorry for the cross-posting, but i'm hoping
 there's some expertise here.
