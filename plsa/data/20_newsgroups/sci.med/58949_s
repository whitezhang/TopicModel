 i am 35 and am recovering from a case of chicken pox which i contracted
 from my 5 year old daughter.  i have quite a few of these little puppies
 all over my bod.  at what point am i no longer infectious?  my physician's
 office says when they are all scabbed over.  is this true?
 
 is there any medications which can promote healing of the pox?  speed up
 healing?  please e-mail replies, and thanks in advance.
