 gt> hi, we are trying to develop a image reconstruction simulation for the skull
 
 you could do high resolution ct (computed tomographic) scanning of
 the skull.  many ct scanners have an algorithm to do 3-d
 reconstructions in any plane you want.  if you did reconstructions
 every 2 degrees or so in all planes, you could use the resultant
 images to create user-controlled animation.
