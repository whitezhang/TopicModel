 perhaps the listlessness caused by thyroid deficiency could mimic
 depression, or feeling unable to do anything could cause one to get
 depressed, but i know of no specific effect on the brain caused by the
 thyroid that would cause depression. note that weight gain is usually
 a symptom of both. simple blood tests would indicate if a thyroid
 condition is present.
 
 i don't know if depression would cause a reduction in thyroid output,
 but i would tend to doubt it. as far as i know clinical depression is
 caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain, and that chemical
 imbalance has no direct effect on any other part of the body. a regular
 everyday depression imho should not cause a chemical imbalance in the
 body at all.
 
 the pituitary bases its secretions of thyroid stimulating hormone (tsh)
 on the level of circulating thyroxin (there are two types t3 and t4 -
 one is used as a reserve and is changed into the other -active- form in
 the liver). the ratio of t3 & t4 can be affected by a number of other
 hormones (estrogen, for example). naturally, changing activity of the
 body's cells would cause changes in availabilty of free thyroxin, but
 the liver and a healthy thyroid should be able to balance things out in
 short order.
 
 good sources for info on the thyroid are the merk manual (a physician's
 reference book ) although reading it is enough to get one depressed :-)
 and the encyclopedia brittanica (should be available in your local
 library).
 
 i hope this has been of some help.
