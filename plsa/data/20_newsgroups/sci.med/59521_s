 my girlfriend just started taking this drug for her migranes.  it really
 helped her get through the rebound withdrawl when she got off analgesics. 
 she doesn't have a mail account, but asked me to forward this:
 
 "glaxo is the distributor; imitrex is the drug's brand name.  it works. 
 she can call her pharmacy for more info. the "miracle" drug has been used
 for years in europe and for some time in canada.  trials in the u.s. were
 completed and the drug hit the us market at the end of march.  some
 pharmacies don't stock it yet.  presently it needs to be injected
 subcutaneously; although testing is starting with a nasal spray form.  it
 mimics serotonin (its molecular structure that fits onto pain receptors
 looks identical to serotonin on a model i saw)"
 
 opinions are mine or others but definately not mda's!
