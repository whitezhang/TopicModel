    a good source of information on burzynski's method is in *the cancer industry*
    by pulitzer-prize nominee ralph moss.
 
 interesting. what book got moss the pulitzer nomination? none of the
 flyers for his books mention this, and none of the cancer chronicle
 newsletters that i have mention this either.
 
    also, a non-profit organization called "people against cancer,"
    which was formed for the purpose of allowing cancer patients to
    access information regarding cancer therapies not endorsed by the
    cancer industry, but which have shown highly promising results (all
    of which are non-toxic).
 
 moss is people against cancer's director of communications. people
 against cancer seems to offer pretty questionable information, not
 exactly the place a cancer patient should be advised to turn to. most
 (maybe all) of the infomation in their latest catalogue concern
 treatments that have been shown to be ineffective against cancer, and
 many of the treatments are quite dangerous as well.
