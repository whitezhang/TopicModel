 (type ii, i guess--no insulin). 
 
 
 i've been trying to read up on these two conditions, and what really
 surprises me is how few experiments have been done and how little is known. 
 losing weight appears to be imperative for diabetes and advisable for
 arthritis (at least, for -women- with arthritis), but, of course, the very
 conditions that make weight loss advisable are part of the reason for the
 weight gain. 
 
 for myself, i'm almost afraid to lose weight, because no matter how gentle
 and sensible a diet i use (the last one was 1800-2000 calories, in about
 eight small meals), the weight won't go off gradually and stay off. 
 instead, it drops off precipitously, and then comes back on with much
 interest, like bread on the waters.
 
 
 with this experience, it's hard to be encouraging to my husband.  all i can
 suggest is to make it as gradual as possible.
 
 meanwhile, some experts recommend no sugar, others, no fat, others, just a
 balanced diet.  it's almost impossible to tell from their writings -which-
 parts of their recommendations are supposed to help the condition, and
 which are merely ideas the expert thinks are nifty.
 
 is it my imagination, or are these very old conditions very poorly
 understood?  is it just that i'm used to pediatrician-talk ("it's strep;
 give him this and he'll get well.") and so my expectations are too high?
