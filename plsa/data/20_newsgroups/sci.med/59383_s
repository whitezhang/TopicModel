 i saw this a few years ago on "tomorrow's world" (low-brow bbc
 technology news program).  the patient is lowered into a bath of
 de-ionized water and carefully positioned.  high intensity pressure
 waves are generated by an electric spark in the water (you don't get
 electrocuted because de-ionised water does not conduct).  these waves are
 focused on the kidneys by a parabolic reflector and cause the stone to
 break up.  this is completely painless.
 
 of course, you then have to get these little bits of gravel through
 the urethra.  ouch!
