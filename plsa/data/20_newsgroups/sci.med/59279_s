 credited with inventing the syringe per se.  i don't know much about the
 needles; however, i do know of a southwest virginia country doctor who
 some thrity or more years ago invented, patented, used, and sold a syringe/
 hypodermic needle combination that retracted, injected with the flip of a
 trigger, then retracted, giving a near-painless injection.  the fellow was
 dr. daniel gabriel, and it was termed the gabriel--somebody else syringe. 
 did you come across that one.  (plastic, disposable syringes came onto the
 market about that time and his product went by the wayside, to my knowledge.)
