 i am interested in finding out how the 4runner and pathfinder have
 been updated in the past few years.  like new engine, suspension and
 the like.  i noticed that the 1993 and 1992 4runners are identical,
 for example, and was looking into buying a used one.
 
 any info would be appreciated, esp. models/years to check out or
 avoid.
 
 thx, andy (brandt@cs.unc.edu)
