 this must vary from state to state, because our old company kemper wanted
 to drop me (keeping my wife) or tripple our premium because i had 1 ticket.
 only 2 points for 10 mph over speed limit.  well i called geico, and they
 insured both my wife and i for less then we were previously paying
 kemper.
 
 generally i hate the whole insurance game. i realize that it is necessary
 but the way that a person can get dicked around doesn't make any sense.
 
 one good thing about geico is that everything can be handled over
 the phone.

             the fact that i need to explain it to you indicates
             that you probably wouldn't understand anyway!
