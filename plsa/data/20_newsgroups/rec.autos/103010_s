 i remember this happening on the i-75 through michigan and ohio several
 years back. a group of guys in an old beater would rear end a car,
 usually out of state or canadians. you stop and they smack you with a bb
 bat. at least they didn't kill you for the sake of a car.
 i think the cops put out decoys and this calmed down for a while.
 
 vlasis, are you safe walking through germany if you are a refugee ?
