 my t-bird sc's manual says to replace the platinum plugs every 60,000mi.
 wal-mart has autolite platinum plugs for $2.00 each. are these "real"
 platinum plugs? (i had bosch platinums in my '80 fiesta and my dad
 had 'em in his '84 bronco--note the keyword "had." they didn't last
 very long (much less than 50,000mi) before they had to be replaced.
 i agree that they weren't the greatest.)
