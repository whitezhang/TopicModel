 i have been for a fairly hard run in an mx5, what they lack in power they
 surely make up for in handling.  great for back streets with heaps of corners.
 they are a fairly light car with a low center of gravity and a quite free
 revving dohc engine, a fun car.  have you driven a turbo converted
 mx5?  now they are starting to perform!  i've often thought a mazda rotary
 would go well in the xm5 too....anyone done it?
 
 regards scott.
