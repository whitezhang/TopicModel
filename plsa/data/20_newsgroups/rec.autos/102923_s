 	i'm no mustang head, but don't the early ones have a simple
 strut suspension (that is, with no upper a-arm)?  just a strut
 going down to a lower control arm (single bushing: not an a-arm), with a
 tension/compression rod locating it in the forward/backward direction?
 
 	anyway, simple strut suspensions like this can be lowered just by using
 shorter springs, cutting the springs, lowering the spring perch or shortening
 the strut below the perch.  in each of these cases, the suspension geometry
 will suffer because the lower control arms will not be at the
 intended angle.  a spacer placed between control arm and the bottom
 of the strut (roughly the height of the reduction) will restore
 the suspension geometry.  imho, the kit that includes the spacer
 is the only way to go...
