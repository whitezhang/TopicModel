 makes sense, since the new mercedes benz engines go from 2.2l-4 to a 2.8l-6.
 nothing in between.  btw, i beleive the numbers on those mb engines are
 156 and 225 hp respectively.  the one-upmanship in hp might induce bmw
 to create a larger six.  also, the 2.6 190e has lagged behind the 3-er
 2.5 for some time wrt hp.   i am sure the bavarians wouldn't want to be
 "shown-up" by the schwabians.
 
 ps- those mb engines haven't been released over here yet.
