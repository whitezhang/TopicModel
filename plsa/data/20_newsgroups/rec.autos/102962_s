 while i don't read normally read this group, i was looking for valentine radar
 information (sigh, maybe in the faq) and came across your posting..
 
 i bought a '93 probe gt with the pep 263a last july (now at 9500 miles)
 after debating over the sentra se-r/nx2000, mx6, mr-2, stealth, prelude, 
 and celica.
 
 check this month's consumer reports for previous probe records.  
 
 my criteria: a "fun" car with abs, airbag, over 130hp, and less than $25k.
 i thought about a turbo, but checking with insurance people ruled that out.
 the tri-star cars (eclipse/talon/etc) were out since they don't have an air bag.
 ditto for the mustang(also no abs).
 the se-r/nx2000/m20 fell into the pocket-rocket category.  a good used car buy.
 the mx-6 was almost there but rolled more than i liked.  
 i didn't like the prelude dash/instrumentation at all.  too weird for me.
 the mr2 has a much smaller non-passenger space than i needed, so out that went.
 the celica was "ok" but underpowered when loaded with options (and somewhat
 overpriced too) in non-turbo form.
 i never considered the 240sx since it didn't have an airbag.  i did look at it
 for its rwd virtues but that's it.  the corolla never entered my mind.
 i should have looked at the mitsubishi vr4/dodge stealth more.
 since my list was exhausted, i bought the probe.  :-)
 
 the car design is different than earlier years, so it's too early to see its
 reliability so far.  for what it's worth, my comments:
 
 my dislikes:
 shutting door with windows up from inside rarely makes good wind seal.
 headlights have "stuck" up a few times (weather?)
 air conditioning broke ~4000 miles (pressure cycling switch)
 condensation around rear washer fluid container doesn't drain completely.
 crammed engine; little hope for do-it-yourselfers (typical)
 parts somewhat more expensive than normal ford parts
 underside plastic doesn't like sharp driveways and speedbumps (typical).
 assembly gripes: tape on radiator, screw fell out of dash, seat seams not 
 stitched properly.  hopefully just a fluke.
 ford only gives 1 key with the car.  c'mon ford, spend an extra few pennies!
 rear hatch has no padding on corners when up.  i'm waiting for the day when
 i bash my head on the corner.
 horn buttons behind air bag in spokes and not in center (personal preference)
 tires fling dirt/mud onto side of car 
 
 my likes:
 engine (design/valves/sounds/smoothness/power/mileage/torque) -- definitely #1
 handling (very good for fwd; understeer only at limits)
 transmission (the 5 speed is a must)
 usable instrumentation (lovely readable analog everywhere)
 very little torque steer at full power (much better than the '90 sho i drive)
 stability at 100+mph (high gearing though)
 low cowl (good visibility in front)
 heated outside mirrors (nice in fog, never tested in freezing weather)
 abs/air bag (see above)
 rear seats fold down (i have few rear seat passengers so a trunk not important)
 no shake/rattle noises when going over bumps/potholes (still!)
 tires: 225/55vr16 goodyear eagles (70% left; hoping for 30k :-)
 
 as you can see, i'm primarily interested in the engine.  while it doesn't
 have the uummmph of a big-liter car or the turbo rush, the big selling
 point for me was the all-aluminum 24 value 2.5 liter engine.  
 
 the overall car is a good buy for the money.  that market segment hasn't changed
 much since july (prelude vtec, honda del sol??).  i drive it to and from work
 each day on relatively smooth roads, and most noticable thing is that the
 probe's suspension doesn't like potholes.  when you test drive one, find a 
 potholed road somewhere around town and see if the jarring you get is tolerable.
 if you have 3+ passengers, by all means bring them along too.  they'll find
 that they have no room in the back and you'll find that the car rides
 differently (if that's "better" is up to you).  also, there's a lot of glass
 around you which i wasn't expecting; the temperature inside the car gets pretty
 hot in the summer.  my back seat passengers (now very few) complain about
 the lack of ventilation; you may want to consider that when combined with
 the heat.  i've heard that the exhaust system has trouble, but mine works fine.
 leather and the keyless entry system weren't available when i got the car so
 i can't comment on them (i got the car before it was officially announced).  
 i prefer cloth to leather anyway.  
 
 i wouldn't want this car in the snow:  the suspension is too rough for the
 inevitable surprise potholes, tires aren't meant for snow, and the seats assume
 that you're not wearing lots of thick clothing.  rain is much better:  water 
 generally beads off the windshield at freeway speed, the windshield wiper
 controls are easy and understandable, and i barely hydroplaned once with the
 eagles (and i was really trying).  
 there is also a definite lack of cup holder/small storage places.  the gt
 has map holders below the speakers in the door, but they're rigid plastic
 that could fit two cassettes or cd's max.  the center console/storage bin/arm
 rest has *1* cup holder and the back of the front seats have a cloth "pouch"
 but that's it.  no change holders.  quite a let-down from the sho.
 and the probe is definitely not a people-mover car or an econo-box car!
 
 lastly, don't store wet car covers in the back.  the foam will soak the 
 water up and the result will *not* smell pleasant :-(.
