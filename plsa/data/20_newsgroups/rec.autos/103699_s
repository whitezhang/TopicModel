 
 a question for any high-mileage audi owners out there: i am
 interested in buying a 1989 audi 5000s for $5500 cdn.  the
 reason the car is selling for so little is that is has
 155000 km on it (just under 100000 mi.).  the car's owner
 claims the car is in good condition.  my question is: how
 reliable are audi 5000s with mileage that high?  would it
 be worthwhile for me to buy the car?  any problem areas that
 i should look out for?
 
 any help would be greatly appreciated.  post responses and/or
 e-mail me.
 
 thanks
 
 steve hui
