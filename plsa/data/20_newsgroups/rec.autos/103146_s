 i hadn't heard of the valentine-1 before. car&driver and other auto
 magazines
 recommend bel detectors.  i was considering their latest - the 966sti -
 which picks up super wideband ka and laser as well.  it also avoids 
 radar detector detectors (although i really don't care about this since i
 doubt i'll be driving in virginia anytime soon - or have any other states
 also made detectors iilegal?)
 
 how does the valentine-1 compare with the bel products?
