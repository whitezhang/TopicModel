 james, i really hate to do this, but try reading the damn posts!
 never was a t'bird mentioned.  the discussion was about sho's and
 'stangs not being up to spec.  i do not know about t'birds.  i
 only know that the specs quoted for the sho by previous poster sounded
 a little anemic for me to say that it was up to snuff.  this does not
 in any way  disencourage* me from wishing to own one, nor does it make it
 a bad car.  it merely means that i think ford could have added that extra
 bit of safety  and tossed in larger brakes, as the wheels are plenty large
 enough for them to fit (if memory serves right, which it may very well not)
 and the motor plenty powerful enough to need it.
