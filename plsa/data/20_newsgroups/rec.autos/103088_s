 sorry, but *neither* 'dictates' the cost. it's a negotiation.
 whether it's up front at a honda dealership in an all out 
 dickering war, or more removed on a larger economic scale
 (ie, if saturn can't sell at it's price, the price drops,
 or the company stops building them), it remains a negotiated
 value controlled by market forces. to think that the consumer 
 controls price is ludicrous. if the consumer controled
 price, then cars would be *free*...and no one would build 
 cars.
