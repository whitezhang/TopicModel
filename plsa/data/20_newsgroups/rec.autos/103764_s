 i can't tell if matt is being sarcastic here or not, but to be honest, many
 automobiles are worth far more to their owners (in $$ value and $$ investment)
 than the people that would take them.  i don't have figures on average property
 tax in the u.s. or how much of it is allocated for housing projects, inferior
 public schools, jails, or the like, but i have a feeling that the amount the
 government steals from an honest, productive citizen to breed this trash is 
 significantly less than the value of many automobiles.  and for those who will
 argue that the animals out there stealing cars and everything else (not to
 mention committing completely senseless acts of violence, such as rape) cannot
 be valued in terms of money because they are human beings, i submit that they
 are not human beings.  jim callison, i think, is on the right track.  and 
 chintan amin remarked earlier that we cannot blame environment for the actions
 of a single criminal.  i couldn't agree more.  one could trace any crime back
 to the environment/upbringing of the criminal; should we let all of them out,
 from pickpockets to rapists to inside traders, because what they did wasn't
 their fault?  where does one draw the line?
