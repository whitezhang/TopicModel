 #	it sounds crazy, but it's true.  one of the best r-12 subsitutes,
 #ghg-12, is currently a commercial product.  unfortunately, the sae committee
 #on mobile air conditioning is comprised almost exclusively of macs members.
 #such being the case, no papers about any alternative refrigerant other than
 #r-134a have been accepted for review/publication.

     we here are *very* interested in info on r12 substitutes (in fact i
  think we really need all the info on this we can get).
 
     i would really appreciate technical, supply, and hardware-upgrade
  details.  
 
    also, r12 is a useful solvent/reagent in the extraction/production of
  certain pharmaceuticals.  any info on the substitutes' corresponding
  usefullness?
 
     i am currently working with the local engineers who are making sure
  we are compliant with the regulations.  the trouble with regulations is
  that they only tell you what you are no longer permitted to do, not what
  you should do instead.
 
      i think the cause of the new regulations is the montreal protocol
  which has a definite cfc-phase-out schedule.  (of course the cause of
  the montreal protocol was all the research done on the causes of the
  ozone depletion problem.)
 
      someone asked earlier about why the governments were working so fast
  to ban the ozone-depleting (cfc) chemicals and not gasolines and other
  greenhouse-gas-producing compounds.  the greenhouse effect (produced by
  infrared-trapping gasses like co2 and methane) and the ozone-hole problem
  (produced by long-lived, chlorine-containing molecules) are not the same
  thing.  it is a lot easier to do something about not using the cfc's
  (chloro-fluorocarbons) than it is to stop producing co2 and methane which
  are natural byproducts of combustion and of living (animal) organisms.
  planting more trees and not destroying so many existing trees would help
  the greenhouse-gas problem, but would do nothing for the ozone problem.
