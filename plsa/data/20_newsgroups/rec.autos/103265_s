 i've got an 89 gt.  it has the smoked taillight assembly.  i think this is where
 the water is getting in.  when i first got it (had it for a month), one of the rear
 taillights fogged up with moisture.  i took it in to the dealer and they replaced
 the entire assembly.  it happened to the other one about 3 months later.  this time
 i happened to look in the spare tire well and noticed water standing in there.  the
 dealer was more reluctant this time to replace it.  but i convinced them to
 fix it.  (they must have had to deal with a number of other probes with the same
 problem.)  i haven't noticed water in the taillamps (or the trunk) for the last 2.5
 years, but just last month, the taillamp just fogged up again.  i'm going to try
 to take it back to get them to fix it again.  i'm real tempted to drill some vent
 and drain holes in the tops and bottoms of the assembly and forget about it.  this is
 getting very annoying. (almost every other `89 gt i've seen has had this problem.)
