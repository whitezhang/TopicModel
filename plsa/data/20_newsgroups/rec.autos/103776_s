 
 eve'.
 
 i am looking to buy 4 new p195-50r15 tires.. (r or hr). i don't
 have much to spend, but i would like a tire that will last. does
 anyone have any experience with the following brands?
 
 	riken
 	falken	
 	bfg	
 	general	
 
 there are others, but these i can find here for under $70.. like
 i said, i am mostly interested in threadwear then speed, since i
 hardly get to drive them over 80 or 90 mph. also, is it true that
 "noone will give you warranty on such tires", according to
 a tire dealer?
 
 finally, do hr tires last longer than r tires (threadwear again),
 or is that strictly a speed factor?
 
 thanks for any replies..
