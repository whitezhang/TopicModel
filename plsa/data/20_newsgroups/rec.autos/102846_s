 in fact, they make some ,but they just don't sell them here in u.s.
 
 sunny california is a 1.6l wagon based on sentra.
 avenil is a 2.0l 4wd/2wd wagon .(it looks like infinity g20 
 but actually it's independently designed to be a wagon.i mean, it's 
 not based on any sedans.) 
  
 nissan had better consider to sell them here.

 sounds nice. but i doubt they have a plan. coz avenil was introduced 
 to replace any sedan based wagon.
