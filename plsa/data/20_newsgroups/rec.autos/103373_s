 -> the current 4.9l v-8 will soldier on for about two years.  a version
 -> of the 32 valve modular v-8 in the mark viii could be offered then.
 
 how unfortunate for anyone who loves the simplicity with which 302 and
 351 fords and 305 and 350 chevys can be built up. still, it will provide
 a needed punch for the ford to stay up with the new firebird/camaros. it
 wouldn't surprise me if ford called the engine a 5.0 litre in the
 mustang. (we all know that the current 5.0 is really 4.9 litres anyway)
 
 -> undisguised, the car looks ok, but not nearly as exciting as the new
 -> camaro/firebird, imo.
 
 i must agree. i don't think i've seen anything as impressive looking as
 the new firebird since my friend back home sold his 1970 formula 400
 firebird (for a paltry $2000, without even telling me. the bastard.)
