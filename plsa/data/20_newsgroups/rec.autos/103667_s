 
 before we get into another discussion on the relative merits of a car alarm,
 let's go on the assumption that one is desired.  the question then remains,
 which one?  i've owned a hornet, and was satisfied, but not enough to get
 another for my new car.  the alpine has been highly recommended, but what about
 clifford and vse's derringer 2?  any others?  i want all of the standard stuff;
 door lock interface, starter kill, light flash, led, valet mode, passive/active,
 shock/motion sensor, etc...  thanks for the advice!
