 
 
 
 a list of options that would be useful. they can be existing
 options on a car, or things you'd like to have...
 
 1) tripmeter, great little gadget. lets you keep rough track of
    mileage, makes a good second guesser for your gas gauge...
 
 2) full size spare
 
 3) built in mountings and power systems for radar detectors.
 
 4) a fitting that allows you to generate household current with
 the engine running, and plug ins in the trunk, engine compartment
 and cabin.
 
 feel free to add on...
 
 regards, charles
