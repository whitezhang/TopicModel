 xassuming you don't have a russian car with opposite threads, then

  this reminds me of the first time my cousin did an oil change on his
 car. he crawled under, removed a bolt, drained the fluid, replaced the
 bolt, then carefully poured in 5 quarts of oil. didn't bother to
 check the dip stick, just drove off. didn't get too far till me found
 out that he'd drained the 4-speed trans and dumped an extra 5 quarts
 into the engine.:( moral: as craig said don't be ashamed to get some
 *in person* help the first time.
