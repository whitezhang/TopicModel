 oh, really?  
 here's what you posted earlier in another thread.  before you thrash
 others for making simple mistakes or flaunt your wonderful "vi skill",
 think about how you make them feel as well as how you look (you spelled
 it right). ;-}
 for years you have assaulted others with offensive language, etc.  from
 the content of many of your posts, you appear to have a lot of useful
 information to share with people, but it gets overshadowed when you come
 across as an abusive smart-ass.
