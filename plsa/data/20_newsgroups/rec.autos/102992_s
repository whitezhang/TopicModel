 hmmm....i was listening to the local radio expert (who is, amazingly
 enough, an honest-to-god expert(tm); it's amazing what he knows...),

 slick50 (who is no longer with the comapny, due to some kind of 
 conflict), he avoids it like the plague.  he does recommend other 
 teflon-based/type oil additives, though.
