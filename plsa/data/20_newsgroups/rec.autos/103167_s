 
 i have tested both vehicles (identically
 equipped), both for week-long periods.
 curiously (and consider these are test
 vehicles), i found the mercury higher
 in build quality than the nissan.
 
 either choice is good, but beware that
 i did not experience reasonable mileage
 with the v6.  average city driving was
 <15mpg, with about 21 avg. on the highway.
 
 both were optioned to the hilt (the nissan
 had leather!).  the villager was in the
 $24k range and the nissan was over $26k.
