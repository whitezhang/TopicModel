 	yes.  but the point is that prices are competetive.  saturn may
 well be selling a car intended on giving the dealer a $2000 profit, but 
 since a comperable honda with $500 profit is more expensive, it may be well
 worth it to buy the saturn.

 	not necessarily.  it seems to me that saturn salesdroids, who don't 
 make a commision, whereas their counterparts at other dealerships generally
 do, make more $$ per hour or whatever.  this means that saturn doesn't give up
 the profit to their employees through commision, which is taken out of per-
 car profits.  they just pass it along to less pressureing salesmen/women.
 
 >isn't that saving money?
 
 	maybe.  maybe not.  depends on accounting practices.  i'd rather pay
 more for dealer service that doesn't cut corners to contain costs...
