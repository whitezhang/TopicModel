 i am in the process of looking for a half decent aftermarket sport exhaust
 for my 1981 bmw 320i. so far, i have found a pacesetter exhaust for $219
 and an ansa exhaust for $190 (canadian funds). i was wondering if anyone
 could tell me anyhting about either of these exhausts or any other possible
 exhausts that i may be interested in. my main priorities are a decent horse
 power increase (5-30%) and a nice low note to go along with that added power.
 i was also thinking of looking into both remus and leistritz exhausts.has 
 anyone got anything to say about these? i am mainly looking for the muffler
 only but if anyone can find a good deal on a whole kit i would be willing to
 go after that. i also would like to know how much these would cost me in the 
 states.please mail me back if you have any information.
