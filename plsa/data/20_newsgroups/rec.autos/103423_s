 to anyone with experience about honda civic (ex or dx) or saturn sl1:
 
 i would be interested in knowing how reliable these cars are, how expensive
 they are to own and operate (parts, maintenance, gas, insurance), if the
 dealers are good, and if they actually live up to their economy image.
 
 another question:  what would i expect to pay for a civic ex coupe with
 automatic, air, and an am/fm radio?
 
 mail to the address below or post to this group.
 
 thanks, 
 
 rob
