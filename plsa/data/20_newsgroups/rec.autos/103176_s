 i don't have any written data but i know what i have experienced.  i use  
 s-50 in everything including my lawnmowers.  in my car it smoothed the idle
 and reduced the operating temp by 5 degrees.  i havent used it long enough 
 to test for wear, but some people i know have.   
  a farmer that lives near by used to have to overhaul his big deisel tractors
 at least every other year if not every year.  since he has been using s-50
 he has went 5 years without an overhaul.
 
 also a friend at a machine shop has in the past rebuilt engines with 200k
 miles on them because the coustomer thought it was time.  these coustomers
 had ran s-50 since almost new.  it was found when measuring the internals
 of the engine that they showed only about the amount of wear that would be
 expected of 30k miles not 200k.
 
 in my opinion it works.
