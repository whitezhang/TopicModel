 anyone else experiencing a similar problem?
 
 this concerns the clutch on a 92 honda accord 5 speed. when the clutch
 is first used in the morning, about the first 4 miles of shifting, there
 is a significant amount of clutch chatter until things warm up.  then the
 clutch shifts smoothly.  this chatter started when i moved to the san 
 francisco bay area from a low-humidity environment.  the dealer stated
 that this is known to happen since honda changed from an asbestos to
 non-asbestos clutch material.  no remedy!! seems that moisture on clutch
 surface causes slipping until the moisture evaporates.
 
 any comments out there?
