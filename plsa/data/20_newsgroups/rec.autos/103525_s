 one of the reasons i sold my '92 civic vx was the chattery-grabby clutch
 although i din't notice it being any worse in humid weather, perhaps because
 its always humid around here.  i was told by honda that it has to do with
 changing from asbestos to non-asbestos linings, which began around 1990.
 someone could make some good money selling the old-fashion variety if it's
 legal to manufacture them these days.  my feeling is that since many other
 car makers do not have this problem, that it's a poor design or engineering
 problem on the part of honda.  three things to look out for on all honda
 products - clutch chatter, bad brake rotors, and rusty exhaust systems.
