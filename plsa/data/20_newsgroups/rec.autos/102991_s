 that reminds me of one of texas's ads...you hear a guy speaking in
 french (like it's a letter home), then the french moves to the 
 background, and a french-accented voice come to the foreground, talking
 about how he went walking on the beach, and it felt so much like
 home that he decided to take his shoes off...and the rest of his
 clothes. it ended with "please send bail." :-)

 i normally have an unloaded colt delta in my glove box with a loaded
 magazine handy (which is perfectly legal in oklahoma). for those
 times that i'm travelling inter-state, i keep an unloaded 
 s&w .44 magnum revolver in the glove box, with a speed-loader
 in my pocket (which is legal everywhere, under federal law, illinois
 state police be hanged).
 
 as i've said before, this is stricly for defense; my insurance
 will pay to replace my car, but i only have one life...
