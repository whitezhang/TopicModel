 in the past few years i have owned 3 mustang gts and now own a 91 t-bird sc. 
 they all have had this problem. there was a recall on the t-bird for the brake 
 problem. the ford dealer replaced the rotors and pads but the rotors warp 
 after about 10k miles. between this problem and the fit and finish problems on 
 the t-bird i'll never buy a ford again.
