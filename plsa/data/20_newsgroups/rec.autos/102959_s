 it did it again.  this morning, my 88 ford ranger was idling at 10,000 rpm.
 ok, so i exaggerated a little, but it was idling very fast.  it has a 2
 liter carburated engine in it, and no blipping of the throttle would
 cause the idle to drop back to normal (i don't think the linkage is stuck).
 what can i do to fix this problem?  this has been a problem from time to
 time, but has straightened itself out - until now.  i don't have a tach,
 but by gauging by the sound of the engine, it is idling about twice as fast
 as it should be.  this is down from what it was idling at when i pulled up
 at a stop light.
 
 many thanks for any suggestions.
