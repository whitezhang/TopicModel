 i have a few questions about the tax on  a used car purchase.
 i live in new york state, and i am going to buy a used car.
 i know that i will have to pay tax when i go to register the car.
 but i would like to know of tax is payed on the book value of the car, or
 on the purchase price.  also, what tax rate is used ?  the owner lives in
 albany (8% tax), and i will be living in saratoga with 7% tax.  
 do i pay albany tax or saratoga tax ?  (the difference is a whole $50)
 one more thing, how much does it cost for the usual 2 year registration ?
 
 did i leave anything out ? what else might i have to know to purchase and
 register a used car ?  (i've never done this before.)
 
 thank you,
 peter volpe
