 after a tip from gary crum (crum@fcom.cc.utah.edu) i got on the phone
 with "pontiac systems" or "pontaic customer service" or whatever, and
 inquired about a rumoured production hold on the formula firebird and
 trans am.  btw, talking with the dealer i bought the car from got me
 nowhere.  after being routed to a "firebird specialist", i was able
 to confirm that this is in fact the case.
 
 at first, there was some problem with the 3:23 performance axle ratio.
 she wouldn't go into any details, so i don't know if there were some
 shipped that had problems, or if production was held up because they
 simply didn't have the proper parts from the supplier.  as i say, she
 was pretty vague on that, so if anyone else knows anything about this,
 feel free to respond.  supposedly, this problem is now solved.
 
 second, there is a definate shortage of parts that is somehow related
 to the six-speed manual transmission.  so as of this posting, there is
 a production hold on these cars.  she claimed part of the delay was
 not wanting to use inferior quality parts for the car, and therefore
 having to wait for the right high quality parts...  i'm not positive
 that this applies to the camaro as well, but i'm guessing it would.
 
 can anyone else shed some light on this?
