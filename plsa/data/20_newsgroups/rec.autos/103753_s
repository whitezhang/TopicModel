 	tony,  i believe, first of all, that max's car is an austrailian
 built car.  i don't think its a chopped up u.s. unit.  it may be called a
 kangaroo or roo or something similar-not sure.  but, i do recall reading
 that austrailian cars used ford v-8 engines.  the ford v-8 interceptor
 is, i think, a 428 c.i. cop car motor.  whatever the case that small car
 with a screaming big block ford 428 would probably smoke the tires for
 miles/kilometers.  i hope someone out there can elaborate on the subject.
