 for a reasonable sum, you can get a bmw with traction control:
 a torque-sensing (limited slip) rear differential.  since no
 fwd car, including the saab, has this kind of front differential,
 since it would exacerbate torque steer, a bmw with traction control
 should have the theoretical advantage on snow.  of course weight
 distribution and skinny tires could affect this...
