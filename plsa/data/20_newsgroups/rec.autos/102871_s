 for those that are interested i got my fully optioned (air, abs,
 sunroof) '92 se-r in september 1991 for $13,555 in sacramento, ca. it
 was one of the 1st '92s sold, few of the dealers had any, no local
 dealer had an abs equipped se-r.  i went straight to the fleet manager
 at the dealership i liked, told him what i wanted, made him aware that i
 knew what his price should be.  he called me back with exactly what i
 wanted from a dealer 125mi away, i took delivery the next day.
