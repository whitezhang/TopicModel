 i just ordered a saturn sl1 after considering a few imports. frankly, the saturn
 way of doing business and service was a *very* big plus. i hadn't bought a new
 car since i bought my honda 4wd back in '85, and i was unbelieveably offended by
 most salespeople i met.
 
 saturn was indeed very different. i made three different visits to the dealer where
 i bought my car, and was never pressured. saturn also had the best after-sales
 support, and the fixed pricing made it *very* easy for me to decide exactly what
 i wanted to buy. another big selling point was running into my mechanic at the
 dealer. he's been fixing imports for 20 years...and bought a saturn, based on
 what he's seen and heard from his customers. 
 
 saturn also has a good extended warranty program; $675 for 6 year/60k miles, 
 fully refunded if you don't use it. that works out to an actual cost of $170 or
 so, based on the 6 year treasury rates. using savings account rates it's more
 like $120. in the first three years it also buys you free rental during any
 warranty work, without counting against the refund.
