 '63 to '82 vettes had the same basic chassis. 1980 add aluminum (weaker) 
 rear 'axle' housing.  all these years used same brakes, similar springs etc
   late 70's was a bad year for gm reliability.  catastrophic converter was 
 added in 1975.
 
 cheapest corvette '78 to '79 low end about 4k tops out about $12k except 
 for those morooons that think there '78 indy / 25th aniversity vette is 
 special.  these guys have been known to ask 25k.  i don't think they get it
 .
 
 best buy: convertables 69 - 74.  i got my 69 for 5k - needs body work but 
 i'm willing.  
 
 parts for all are readily avail at swap meets and mail order etc.
 
 v-8 reliability / looks / independant suspension / 4 wheel disk and all 
 under 10k.  and they thought a miata was a good deal.

 my origional inquires to my insurance agent: i can drive my '69 convertable 
 for 3000 miles or less per year, i must keep it in a locked garage and it 
 will cost me 2% of the stated value per year (does this sound right?).

 get an appraiser to look at the car. he will check serial numbers and look 
 for origional equipe.  depending on what mods have been done the car could 
 be worth only 10k.  problems like wrong engine / trans.  wrong paint type (
 vetts used lacquer)  an modification would reduce tthe value.  but your 
 looking for a car to drive right?
 
 this sounds like a ball park price for a small-block (327 cu in.) / manual 
 / no air car.  a 427 would put it closer to $30k.
 
 get it appraised!!!  for insurance purposes also.
