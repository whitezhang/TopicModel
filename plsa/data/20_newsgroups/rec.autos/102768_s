 automotive mailing lists (electronic mail, that is):
 
 [last updated 3/17/93; new lotus, exotic cars list subscription info;
    added portland, or motorsports list, corvair list, triumph tr8 list -- rpw]
 
 there are a number of electronic mailing lists on the network devoted to
 various special automotive topics.
 
 to the best of my knowledge, all the lists appearing here have open
 membership policies.  it is my policy not to list `closed' mailing lists
 here.
 
 most mailing lists provide separate addresses for administrative
 queries and for general mail; where separate administrative
 addresses exist, i have listed those below, as the general addresses
 are not appropriate for inquirys and requests.
