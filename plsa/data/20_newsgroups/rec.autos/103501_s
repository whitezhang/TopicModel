 could someone explain how to make sense of drag coefficients (i.e cd) mentioned in magazines.  i understand that lower numbers signify better aerodynamics but
 what does this mean in the real world.  is there a way to calculate new top speeds(assuming the car is not rev limited at top speed) or mileage benefits if a identical car had the cd reduced from .34 to .33.
 
 thanx
