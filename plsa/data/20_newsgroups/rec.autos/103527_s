 it isn't that bad.  at least the bugatti eb110 has compound curves compared
 to the slab sides on the consulier.  and the bugatti has a quad turbo v-12
 (thing of it as 4 three cylinder turbo engines tied together).  also ettore
 bugatti's nephew is on the board of directors and had a hand in the
 development.  so that's about as much bugatti as you are likely to get in
 today's world.  much like enzo ferrari's illegitamate son being allowed to
 take over part of ferrari as well...

 that's funny.  i have motorcylclist friends who say the same about `cages'. 
 :-)
 
 most gp 500cc motorcycles are v-4s, and the vf line of hondas were all v-4s
 (from the vf-400f through the vf-1000f, including the rc30 race bike and
 the present vfr-750f).  it should be noted that lancia built a v-4 in
 recent history in the fulvia hf, a very pretty italian coupe.
