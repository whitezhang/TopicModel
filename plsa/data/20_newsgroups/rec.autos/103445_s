 limited tort option will lower your rates. if you choose it, you can't
 sue others for pain & suffering, but you still can sue for economic loss.
 so you can sue for your wrecked car and for medical bills, but you can't
 sue for $1000000 for pain and suffering.
 
 at least, that's how i understand it.
