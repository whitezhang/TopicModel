 i just visited the ny auto show, and saw two lh cars on the floor: eagle 
 vision and dodge intrepid. 
 
 really nice i must say. very attractive styling, lots of features and room, 
 at a competitive price.  
 
 unfortunately, the workmanship is quite disappointing. on both cars,
 the rubber seals around the window and door fell off. it turns out
 the seals are just big grooved rubber band. it goes on just by pressing
 the groove against the tongue on the door frame. surely it would come
 off easily.
 
 i am not sure how many of this kind of pooring engineering/assembly
 problems that will show up later.
 
 i may still consider buying it, but only when it establishes a good
 track record.
