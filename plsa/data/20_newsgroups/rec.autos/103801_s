 that's probably true but it's the closest to it that you're going to get.  
 the actual dealer cost depends on a lot of things and even the dealer  
 probably doesn't know exactly what it will be until all the factory   
 kick-backs, incentives, etc. are paid and that often depends on his volume  
 at the end of the month/quarter/whatever. it might be a funny munber but  
 it's all you have to start with, except the sticker, and anyone who pays  
 sticker price is really being ripped off.
