 first off, the correct spelling of nissan's luxury automobile division
 is "infiniti" not "infinity."  i would also like to clear up the question
 of what kind of engines power lexus and infiniti automobiles, since a
 person had remarked in earlier posts that most lexus and infiniti models
 had v6 engines, while at the same time saying that several of each
 manufacturer used v8 engines.
 
 lexus:
   ls400- v8
   gs300- v6
   es300- v6
   sc400- v8
   sc300- v6
 
 infiniti:
   q45- v8
   j30- v6
   g20- inline 4 (i must admit that i cannot remeber for sure here)
 
 i hope this helps.
