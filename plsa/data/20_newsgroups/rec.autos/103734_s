 here we go again...
 now these are just rumors.. so dont quote me.
 
 new integra supposedly wedge shaped again.  175 hp and all-wheel drive
 in top models.  then a variant called the zx-r comes later. (roadster?).
 
 i think it gets unveiled at end of summer.
 
 nothing about an airbag was mentioned, but im sure it'll have one.
 along with a nice hefty increase in sticker... ???
