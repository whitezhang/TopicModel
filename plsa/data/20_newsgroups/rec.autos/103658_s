 as you can see, i have two 1987 cars, both worth about $3000 each.
 the problem is that maintenance costs on these two cars is
 running about $4000 per year and insurance $3000 per year.
 
 what am i doing wrong?
 
 within the last two months, the follows costs have occured:
 
 dodge 600 se (dodge's attempt at the american german car!)
 
 $1,000 - replace head gasket
 $300   - new radiator
 
 chevy nova cl (chevy's attempt at a japan import!)
 
 $500 - tune-up,oil change,valve gasket,middle exhaust pipe, misc.
 
 note also that the chevy nova cl (1987) has only 70 horsepwer!
 does anyone out there have a chevy nova with enough power
 to get up even a small hill without knocking? is there
 something wrong with my car, i even use 93 octane gas!
 (i have consider going to 110 octane if i can find it!)
 
 anyway, what are the best maintenance items to do-it-yourself,
 and what equipment is needed? 
 
             thanks,
             -doug (2 car doug from wayne,nj)
