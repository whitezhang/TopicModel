 
 it's great that all these other cars can out-handle, out-corner, and out-
 accelerate an integra.
 
 but, you've got to ask yourself one question: do all these other cars have
 a moonroof with a sliding sunshade?  no wimpy pop-up sunroofs or power
 sliding roofs that are opaque.  a moonroof that can be opened to the air,
 closed to let just light in, or shaded so that nothing comes in.
 
 you've just got to know what's important :^).
