 i was worried about someone stealing my oil once also. i finally 
 decided to just have my drain plug welded shut. it works great !
 i figure that when i add three or four quarts when the oil light
 comes on every month or so that it's just as good or better than
 the old wives tale of changing the oil and filter every 3000 miles.
 works for me, i must say.
