 there is a known problem with the seals on the taillights of <93 probes.
 complain loudly to your dealer and get them to install new seals.  it is
 a known problem, present on most (if not all) pre-93 probes, so you 
 shouldn't have to pay them to fix it.  in my case, they fixed it on
 my extended warranty (i just had to pay a $50 deductable) (the
 work was valued at something like $185 with labor and parts).  having
 removed the tail lamps myself on other occasions, i think their estimate
 was fair.
