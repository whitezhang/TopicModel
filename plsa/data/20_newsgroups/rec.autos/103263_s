 interested in the pontiac bonneville. my budget is between 7-
 8 thousand. would i be able to afford an 88 or 89. what
 engines were available at this time. i know they didn't
 redesign until the 1992 model year. how is the reliability of
 past models. i would appreciate any advice or information.
