 
      chances are that this has been discussed to death already, and
 if so could someone who has kept the discussion mail me or direct me 
 to an archive site. basically,
 i am just wondering if slick 50 really does all it says that it does.
 and also, is there any data to support the claim.  thanks for any info.
