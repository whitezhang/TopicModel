 while it's being mentioned, i personally prefer the moonroof/sunroof/t-top/
 targa thing as well.  i simply don't like cloth tops, nor the extra insurance,
 nor the s**** color matching alot of companies do.  if i chose a convertible,
 it'd be:
 
 a) mazda rx7 ii.  i just like the way they look.  it'd have to be in black,
 with color matched black top(they look good!)
 
 b) vw cabriolet.  they do a suberb job of matching colors too.  also, last year
 for them!  {***collector's item****}
 
 c) mustang gt droptop...they look ok too.
 
 i know this doesn't help, but i thought i'd do it anyway...:-)
 
 good luck to your wife.(and you :-)
