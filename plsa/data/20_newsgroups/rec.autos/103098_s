 you'll have fun looking for the rear-end gears on an sho--the taurus
 is a front-wheel-drive vehicle...
 
 i went back and checked the article again; the sho wagon is quicker
 than the sho automatic, but significantly slower than the real sho.
 
 why anyone would order an sho with an automatic transmission is
 beyond me; if you can't handle a stick, you should stick with a
 regular taurus and leave the sho to real drivers. that is not to
 say that there aren't real drivers who can't use the stick (eg
 disabled persons), but they aren't in any position to use an
 sho anyway. 
 
 i would be willing to bet that if we removed the automatic
 transmissions from all "performance-type" cars (like the 5.0l
 mustangs, camaros, and the like) we'd cut down on the number of
 accidents each year. autos are fine for sedate little sedans,
 but they have no business in performance cars, imho.
