 i have a '71 buick skylark with 148k on it.  i bought it in california, and if
 it'll let me, i'd like to keep it for another year.  the only problem is these
 indiana winters--my heater controls don't work.
 
 the car has vacuum operated control switches for the vents.  right now it is
 stuck in the "vent" mode.  it will blow warm air, but i can't switch the air
 flow to either the floor (i can live without this) or the defrost (i can't 
 live without this).  i probably could just jam the air deflector to the 
 defrost position, but this blows a lot of air in my face and is, well,
 kind of like putting a vacuum cleaner in reverse.
 
 i have taken parts of the dash off and looked at the vacuum system and i think
 the problem (or part of it) is with the two diaphragms which control up/down
 and outside/inside air flow.  the diaphragm which controls outside(vent)/in-
 side(no vent) air is cracked most of the way around, and the other one is
 probably damaged too, considering the advanced age of the car.
 
 two questions:
 
 	1)  is there anything i should be aware of about this (other than
 	the fact that i should move from indiana) ?
 
 	2)  in the event that replacement diaphragms aren't available, is there
 	a way to "fix" this?
 
 thanks for any advice/info
