 japan is _much_ more open than korea.
 
 yes.  a pontiac grand am suffers a factor of _2_ increase in price
 when it is exported to japan.
 
 however, a dodge vehicle (the one that congressman gephardt mentioned)
 suffers a factor of _4_ increase in price when it is exported to korea.
 a ford taurus suffers the same problem.  a honda accord costs--i am
 not making this up--$48,000 in korea.
 
 just how many people would want to buy a honda accord for $48,000?
 
 solution:  all ships carrying korean-made vehicles should be returned
            to seoul.  pronto.  until as such time as korea decides
            that it wants to abide by the rules of free and fair trade
            with the usa and japan.
