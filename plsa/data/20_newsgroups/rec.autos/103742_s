 i'm certainly no engineer and really have no scientific basis
 on which to make this argument, but don't you answer your own
 question?  is the reflected signal "shifted" at all from the
 act of being reflected?  if so, wouldn't it then be easy for
 the detector to discriminate between reflections and direct
 sources?
