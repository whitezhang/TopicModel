 	wasn't the original intent of the reverse lights for the driver, so he
 could see where he was backing up???  although reverse lights on the sides
 are useful for telling whether cars are backing up out perpendicular to the
 path of the car, i don't think warnings were their original intents, since they
 are colored white.
