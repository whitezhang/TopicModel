 yes this is a common problem.  the leaks occur through the seal of the 
 taillights.  unfortunately, ford has this with most probes and does
 not have a recall for it.  very dissatisfying to say the least.
 
 >2) where are the drain holes located for the hatch?
 
 there is no drain holes that i know of.  i used a margine tub to drain it
 regretably i waited three months as i was short cash and they wouldn't fix it
 under warrantee.  then i paid dearly as it messed up my electrical system
 including a balance/motion sensor which is located near the fuel shutoff in 
 the trunk.  this resulted in my passive restraints malfunctioning--they would
 not retract.  so i ended up paying about $200 to have the sensor replaced; 
 $90 to have the tail lights resealed (they firts replaced the hatch gasket
 which i insisted was not the problem so they did not charge me for that
 when i proved to be right.); not to mention the water damage to the 
 covers to the trunk/spare com partment and algae in the taillights.
 
 very annoying.  don't let the water problem go--get it fixed or you'll pay
 more later.  considering how common a problem it is i hope every one
 complains to ford.
