 
 hello netters,
 
 i would like to find out information about a device that is used on vans and
 trucks. this device is a step that hooks onto the tire and folds up for
 storage. i've seen this device on tnn's shady tree mechanic. i would like to
 know if it is a good product and i would also like the price and address
 of where i can purchase this product.
 
 thanks,
 
 george chan
