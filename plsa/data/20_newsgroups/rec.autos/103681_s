 i had a '82 saab 900 turbo, and now have a '87 bmw 325is
 
 there is no comparison for handling, reliability, or overall quality of
 engineering. the bmw wins hands down. after 5 years i was sick and tired
 of the all the little problems and entropic decay of the saab. the 6-year
 old bmw is still as sweet as it was new.
 
 but i see you are posting from western ma. bmw's **suck** in the snow.
 i have aggressive snows, plus a hundred pounds of sand in the back, and i
 still try to avoid driving in the snow. i happily took the saab through
 blizzard conditions without a worry. i would say this is the single design
 flaw in the bmw.
