 >could someone explain how to make sense of drag coefficients (i.e cd) mentioned in magazines.  i understand that lower numbers signify better aerodynamics but
 >what does this mean in the real world.  is there a way to calculate new top speeds(assuming the car is not rev limited at top speed) or mileage benefits if a identical car had the cd reduced from .34 to .33.
 
 it's pretty complex, and cd isn't the whole story either.  cd for cars is
 usually calculated based on the frontal area of the car.  so a large car
 with a good cd could get the same drag force as a smaller car with a
 poorer cd. 
 
 to calculate drag use this formula:
 
 d = 1/2 * rho * v^2 * cd * s
 
 where d is the drag force (lbs), rho is the local air density (slugs/ft^3),
 v is the velocity (ft/s), and s is the frontal area (ft^2).  note that the
 pieces called 1/2 * rho * v^2 are sometimes called qbar or dynamic pressure
 (a fancy aero term for air pressure or force). 
 
 note that power is:
 
 p = f * v
 
 where p is power (lbf-ft/s), f is the force, drag in this case (lbf) and v
 is velocity (ft/s). 
 
 note that if you put the whole equation into one (by substituting d for
 force) you get a velocity _cubed_ term.  that's why huge increases in power
 result in little increases in speed.  ditto for decreases in cd. 
 
 so if you have a 100 mph car and reduce cd from .34 to .33, your new top
 speed is:  (sound of trumpet fanfare)
 
 101 mph
 
 sorry to dissappoint.
