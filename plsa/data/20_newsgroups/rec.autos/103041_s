 my boss is interested in a new 300 series mercedes benz wagon.
 does anyone have any testimonial evidence and/or strong opinions
 on this car (or line)?
 
 particularly, i would like to hear about power (manual t. only)
 reliability, feel, and any unusually good or bad features of the
 line.
 
 she currently drives a vw passat, and is being plagued by its
 electrical problems.  the dealer claims there is nothing wrong,
 even though the doors have a habit of locking and unlocking them-
 selves while you are driving down the road.  the automatic shoulder
 restraints also like to move back and forth as you move along.
 she does not have the new, larger engine and is quite
 dissatisfied with its lack of power.
 
 the mb wagon would have to have more power and no peculiar problems
 such as the passat's electrical system.  she is also considering
 a saab 9000 (add some letters).  any comparisons between the 9000
 line and the mercedes would be helpful.
 
 price is not an impediment.
