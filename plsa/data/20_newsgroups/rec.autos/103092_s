 here in houston last year a woman heard the sound of someone in her
 garage, so she went to investigate with a gun in her hand.  she
 found a guy in the process of stealing her bicycle.  she quite
 reasonably asked him to stop.  he refused, began taunting her, and
 as the woman was quoted in the police report, "he told me to go
 ahead and shoot him, so i did."  the moron survived, and no
 charges were filed against the woman.
