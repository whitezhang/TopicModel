 	i just went through this mess in new jersey (i'm still waiting for a
 refund as well), namely, that the original company made a mistake and left me
 in the lurch.  my recourse was through nj's insurance dept. office of consumer
 protection.  you should have a similar office in your state.  make use of it.
 
 good luck,
