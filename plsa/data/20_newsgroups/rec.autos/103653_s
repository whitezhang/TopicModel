 i prefer a manual to an automatic as it should be.  i believe that automatics
 should only be manufactured for people with physical disabilities who otherwise
 would not be able to drive.  automatic transmissions allow drivers to be lazy.
 more time is available to fiddle with the radio or to look at the scenery
 instead of concentrating on the road.  the manual transmission keeps the drive
 always doing something, granted it isn't a large movement.  plus, driving should
 be fun!  driving a manual is fun, driving an automatic is a chore.
 	in the case of shift speed, automatics can be made to shift far faster
 that any human could move a stick.  if i was racing, i'd want and automatic.  for
 normal driving go with the manual.
