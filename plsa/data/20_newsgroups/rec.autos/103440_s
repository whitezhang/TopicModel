 which western states have laws that charge sales tax on the difference between
 a new car's price and the trade-in's value?  i know california charges you on 
 the full value of the new vehicle regardless of trade-in.
 
 if you are a california resident, is it legal to buy a car in a state other than
 california without also paying california sales tax?  how does california 
 enforce any law that requires you to also pay california sales tax (on top of 
 the out-of-state tax)?
