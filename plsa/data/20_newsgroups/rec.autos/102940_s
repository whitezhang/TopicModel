 gm, at least, is heading in that direction.  one of the post-sale
 questions they asked me was if i'd like the choice of a cigarette
 liter or an accessory plug, and another whether i'd like the choice of
 an ashtray or a cup holder.
 
 the '93 geo storms have the cigarette lighter vs accessory plug option
 (which did not exist in the '92 i bought) -- i'm not sure about the
 ash tray vs cup holder.  it's a step in the right direction.
 
 the ashtray does make a convenient change-holder so it's not
 completely useless.
