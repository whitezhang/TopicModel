 geico has purchased radar guns in several states, i know they have done
 it here in ct.
 
 i have also heard horror stories about people that have been insured by geico
 for years and then had 1 accident and were immediately dropped.  and once
 you've been dropped by any insruance company you become labled a high
 risk, and end up forking out 3 or 4 times what you should be for insurance.
 
 my suggestion, stay where you are, or shop around but stay away from geico!
