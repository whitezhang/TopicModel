  this is from the same people who make the claim that our minivan is outsellin
 theirs.... implying that the nissan quest/ murcury villager are out-selling
 the chrysler mini-vans.... not only is this not true at all, but it was a stupid
 claim to make... the commercial was part of the introduction campaign for the 
 vans.  kind of a bold statement to make when you haven't even sold one yet, eh?
 
 
 and i thought buick and oldsmobile where bad.  shame on you nissan and 
 mercury!
