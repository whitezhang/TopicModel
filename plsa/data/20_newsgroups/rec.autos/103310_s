 actually the company, and the product was rovac - which stood for
 rotary air conditioning..it used a rotary compressor with what
 was effectively an air/air heat exchanger, and worked pretty well.
 the negatives were mostly that it was about 5-10% less efficient than
 using freon, and noise problems from the high velocity/pressure air,
 all of which were solved by the time the company went bankrupt.  it
 is still a legal entity in florida, but i believe completely "dead"..
 and there's a heck of an opurtunity to buy up it's patents and restart
 the operation...
