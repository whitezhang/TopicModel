 i rented an oldsmobile achieva (is that a yuppie name or what?) and a
 nissan stanza.  they both had automatics.  i'm a manual transmission
 bigot but i have to admit that the transmissions on these cars were
 better shifters than i am.  and yes, they responded very quickly to
 kickdown requests.  the nissan had a tachometer so i was able to figure
 out which gear i was in.  (the olds may have also, but i don't
 remember.)  i believe it shifted all the way down to second at about 50
 mph when my foot told it, "no i really want to accelerate quickly."
 
 i would still prefer a manual, but i won't delude myself into thinking
 that i can out-accelerate a modern automatic.  and i'm very smooth at
 shifting but certainly not as good as an automatic.
