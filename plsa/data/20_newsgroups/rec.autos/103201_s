 ahhh yes, andrew, we meet again...
 
 ...no, not 'stealing' the oil, just draining it as to leave me stranded.
 
 >c'mon, you think a vandal'll do that?!
 
 let me guess, you're from hudson ohio??
 
 >that's absolutely ridiculous!
 
 get out and see the world.
 
 
 "if" i were the vandal, and i really hated someone, maybe someone who knew
 something about cars, of course i would look for any types of valves i could
 undo.  especially, special oil drain plugs, and radiator petcocks.
 
 as well as putting bad things in the gas...
 
 while i would never vandalize someone's car, if i were to, it would probably
 be the 'time bomb' approach, and i'm sure i'm not the only one who thinks
 that way...
