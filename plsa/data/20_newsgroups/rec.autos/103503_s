 i dont know about saabs but whenever there is a 'long temr tset' in a magazine
 they always say that tehy're are little annoying niggles which keep on occuring
 every so often... i wouldn't expect that from such a 'quality' car.... why 
 doesn't anything like this ever happen on bmws? maybe coz they're 'quality'
 cars ;-)
