 yo! watch the attributions--i didn't say that!
 
 again, this isn't an appropriate forum for discussions on whether you
 should shoot someone for property damage/vandalism/theft, but every
 responsible gun owner realizes that there are limits, and the punishment
 must fit the crime. i mean, think about it--is a (really) harmless
 prank worth killing over?
 
 as i said, the situation described (punks setting off alarms and
 taunting people to come out) could turn very ugly very quickly, and
 it is worth being prepared when your life is potentially on the line.
