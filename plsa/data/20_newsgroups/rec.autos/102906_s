 this seems to be a popular scam with dealers.  last month my brother bought 
 a new audi 90 series quatro from a local dealer.  they came back with the 
 final price, tax and all, and he added it up for himself.  there happened to 
 be an extra $300 tagged on under the tax part. he pointed out their error 
 and asked them to re-think their addition.  they came back with the right 
 price the next time.
