 i dont know about the car comparison but as far as the price goes rest
 assured that the street prices for the mx-3 and escort and (maybe) even
 the honda will be lesser than that of the saturn you're talking about.
 all price comparisons i've seen are based on msrp and of course the
 saturn dealer will sell the car for sticker price whereas the others
 will do it way below sticker.
