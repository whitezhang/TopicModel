 because greyhound has apparently gotten around to installing their
 radar collision-prevention system. they use radar to monitor how close
 other vehicles are and how fast their relative speeds are, and signals
 a warning to the driver if they're coming up on something too fast
 or are getting too close.
 
 this is all i remember from the news reports a few months back; at
 the time, they were only talking about the possibility of installing
 the system. (they didn't mention how it worked in bumper-to-bumper
 traffic, or how it discriminated between a camaro approaching at
 120mph and ye olde bridge support in the median being approached 
 at 60mph on a curve.)
 
 i do recall something about progressive stages of warnings, from
 flashing lights to audible warnings--ie, it goes from a red "too
 close" light to hysterically screaming "we're all going to die!!!!"  :-)
