 	yes, there are still alot of mgbs out there.  the earlier cars (pre
  74-1/2) are usually more desirable due to certain things that went with having 
 chrome bumpers (ride height, generally more power).  the older cars are 
 appreciating... slowly.  the newer ones seem to be at a stable level at the 
 moment.  $6 to $8k would require extremely good condition and low miles.
 if the car is in good shape and regular maintenance is kept up on it, the car 
 should last for a long time.  there are still plenty of parts sources ouththere. 
  the mgb is a great, fun little car.  if she is keeping it solely in the hopes 
 that it is going to appreciate, tell her to sell it.  it is not worth waiting 
 the time it would take to appreciate to a real profitable level.
