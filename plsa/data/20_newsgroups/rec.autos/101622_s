 	my gs came with xgt v4s and they are not all weather tires.  i took
 out my right front bumper sliding on packed snow (not ice), before i learned
 this fact.  i immediately bought xgt h4s which are definately all-weather.
 a carrera 4 i walk by everyday has xgt v4s on it even.  the michelin dealer
 where i bought my new tires said the v4s were made out of a different 
 rubber that gets really hard and slick when the weather gets near feezing.  
 said he'd only try to sell me those tires during the winter if we were in
 texas and not colorado.
 
 thanks,
 eric
