 my honda accord just hit the magic 100,000 mile mark and now
 all sorts of things are beginning to go bad. the latest problem
 i am experiencing is with my brakes.  they still stop the
 car fine, but once i am stopped completely, my brake pedal
 will sink another 2 or 3 inches all by itself.  if feels really
 strange, and i am worried my brakes will quit working one of
 these days.
 
 i checked my brake fluid, and the reservoir was full, but the
 fluid itself looked really dirty (like dirty oil).  i called
 my mechanic and he told me i need a new brake master cylinder,
 which will cost me a whopping $250-300.
 
 i was just wondering if anyone out there has experienced this
 sort of thing.  if so, is my mechanic being honest? or do i
 simply need to have my brakes bled and new fluid put in?
 
 any help you could provide would be appreciated.  please send
 replies directly to me, as i rarely have a chance to read this
 list.  i will post the responses if there is any interest.
 
 thanks,
