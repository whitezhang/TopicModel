 if your buying a compact pickup do yourself a favor and wait a few months
 for the 1994 gmc sonoma.  magazines are saying it is day and night over the
 current truck.  it's georgeous, solid, and fast (200hp vortec 4.3 v-6).
 should whip the ranger in every area too (accept maybe payload).  and always
 pick a gmc over a chevy.  gmc's are always so much better looking.  man, i 
 miss the comanche.
