 because some people like them (and some people actually need them).

 yeah, right. real muscle cars had a manual transmission, and their
 clutches aren't that heavy. shelby-american used plenty of
 high-powered, high-torque engines, and carroll only put autos in
 his cars because people wanted them. (blasphemers! heretics!
 burn them, burn them for defiling a shelby with an auto! ;-)
 real cobras (and they were the ultimate sports car at the
 time) had big-block fords which turned out prodigious amounts
 of power and torque, and _none_ of them had automatics. 
 
 >and also, an automatic with a v8 engine can be real fun to drive.
 
 yeah, if you call a gear shift in the middle of a curve "fun." :-)
 
 i personally would _love_ to have a '66 galaxie 500 7-liter coupe,
 with a fire-breathing 427 and four-onna-floor (to go along side
 my '66 galaxie 500 pillarless hardtop with a fire-breathing 390
 with three-onna-tree; i love the sound of dual exhaust in the
 morning! :-). there's no comparison between a real american
 muscle car and a car with a big engine and an automatic, imho.
