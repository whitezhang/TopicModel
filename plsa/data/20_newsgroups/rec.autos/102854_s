 i have the eurowiper boots in white and had to throw away the first pair
 since i found no way of cleaning them after they looked almost black. now
 i have my second pair of white ones and once again they are dirty. i need
 a way to clean them w/o removing them since i had to cut them to remove
 them, is there a way? or should i just buy black ones? 
 thanks
 -joel
