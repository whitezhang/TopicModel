 	hahahahahaha.  *gasp*  *pant*  hm, i'm not sure whether the above
 was just a silly remark or a serious remark.  but in case there are
 some misconceptions, i think henry robertson hasn't updated his data
 file on korea since...mid 1970s.  owning a car in korea is no longer
 a luxury.  most middle class people in korea can afford a car and do
 have at least one car.  the problem in korea, especially in seoul, is
 that there are just so many privately-owned cars, as well as taxis and
 buses, the rush-hour has become a 24 hour phenomenon and that there is
 no place to park.  last time i heard, back in january, the kim administration
 wanted to legislate a law requireing a potential car owner to provide
 his or her own parking area, just like they do in japan.
 
 	also, henry would be glad to know that hyundai isn't the only
 car manufacturer in korea.  daewoo has always manufactured cars and
 i believe kia is back in business as well.  imported cars, such as
 mercury sable are becoming quite popular as well, though they are still
 quite expensive.
 
 	finally, please ignore henry's posting about korean politics
 and bureaucracy.  he's quite uninformed.
