 i have owned my sprint from the beginning and that sensor light comes on every
 30k to let you know it's time for a check up.  when that light goes on, i just
 take it to the delaer tell them "it's that time" and they work on it for 4 hou
 and you pay $5 for parts and $100 for labor. (ahh...what they get for labor)
 i currently have about 95k on my sprint and of all the times i took it in for
 service, i never say on the payment sheet anything about the replacement of the
 oxygen sensor.  what the heck is an oxygen sensor?  as far an i know of, i have
 never had that thing replaced in my car and the car is purring like a kitten.
 now, i don't have a/c (mother nature does that for me :-) ) and that might have
 something to do with it, but i still never heard of an oxygen sensor.  the only
 major service job i have had on my car (besides getting the tires replaced
 if you want to call that a service job) was getting the rotor, distributor and
 gasket replaced.  and that was all done within the past 2 months.  
 
 what i do at 30k is have a good tune-up, let them replace what ever they need
 to, pay the bill (about $125) and go home and don't worry about the car for
 another 30k.  oh, i just remembered something.  if that little sensor light
 bothers you, in the fuse box right below the turn-signal lever up against
 the dash, there is a swith on the right side.  flip that switch and the light
 will go off.  i do that so that little light won't annoy me.  if you can't
 find it, look it up in the car manuel.  i hope that i have helped a little
 and good luck with the _oxygen sensor_?
