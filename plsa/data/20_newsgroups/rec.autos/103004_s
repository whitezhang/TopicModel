 sounds more like an opel gt.  neat cars, fun to drive.  sold through
 buick from 196? through 1973 (if i remember correctly).  i believe it
 was in '72 that there were some engine mods made such that parts
 were not interchangeable with the older models.  parts are thus much
 harder to come by for the later models.  parts in general are not
 too difficult to find.  at one time jc whitney carried some stuff
 including a brand new (not remfg) long block.  either a gt or a
 kharman ghia (hmm that spelling looks hosed) will be my next project.
