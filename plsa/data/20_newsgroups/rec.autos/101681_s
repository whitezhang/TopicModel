   the funny thing about the digital dash (87 t-bird) with the 85mph speedo 
 limit was that if you pressed the button to convert to kilometers it would 
 read all the way up to 187kph.  at this point the stock anemic 302 would get 
 short of breath.  this of course was equivalent to about 116mph (hehe).i bet 
 i really coulda confused this thing if i'd toyed with the engine and rolled
 the stupid thing (the digits were limited to 199). 
 
   i've gotta agree with ya on the analog clock w/digital dash though.  my
 girlfriend had a '85 turbocoupe with a digital clock and analog gauges/radio.
 go figure...

   i had a great feature on my t-bird....  i could pull the key out and 
 leave the ignition on.  this scared the hell out of me the first time it
 happened but i kinda grew to like it.  musta been a bad key copy or 
 something.
