 according to _the complete guide to specialty cars_, 7th edition, from
 crown publishing, it's the vw kubelwagen (w/ 2 dots over the 'u').
 the company is:
 
    wolfkam
    p.o. box 1608, vika
    0119 oslo 1, norway
 
    011-47-30-26601 voice line
    011-47-2-166138 fax line
 
 
 an excerpt from the blurb:
 
    ...this fine kubel clone from wolfkam is a very close copy of
    the original, and offers the same all-weather and cross-country
    capabilities as its wwii forebears.  the robust fiberglass body
    kit is very complete, and includes all the hardware you will
    need, except for your own vw donor car.  the phone number [...]
    is the entire at&t dialing sequence; call and ask for karl
    torum, or send $5 cash or _international money order_
    for a complete literature package.

 p.s., i'd be happy to share what info i have on other kit cars and
       kit car manufacturers.
 
 p.p.s., i'm looking for a used or partially completed porsche 356
         speedster convertible d replica from intermeccanica.  i'd
         appreciate any leads or advice/stories from any owners
         out there.
