 perhaps it is because witnesses who have left the compound have all
 testified that the batf shot first, they they did not identify themselves
 before tossing in concussion grenades (not that anyone inside could have
 _heard_ such identification after being near a concussion grenade) and
 the announcement from the batf that they have sealed the warrant under
 which they were operating - which was a _search_ warrant, by the way,
 _not_ an arrest warrant.  in short, perhaps because the batf is wildly
 out of control and perhaps calmer heads have realized that bombing a
 compound full of woman and children will not improve their position.
 there is a real chance that koresh will be able to prove self-defense
 in court.  that will leave - what? - four officers dead and no one to
 blame but the batf.
 
 followups directed to alt.activism, where the discussion has raged nearly
 as long as the seige, and which shows every sign of not giving up nearly
 as soon.
