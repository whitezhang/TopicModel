         check out the shocks where they mount, at both ends. if you have
     the type that have a loop?,from lack of a better term, and a bolt like
    piece sticking through, there should be a rubber bushing between the loop
    and the bolt. is it there ? is it crushed and allowing metal to metal
     contact?  i hope you can make some sense of this. good luck.>
