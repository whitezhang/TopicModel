 
 i would gladly spend twice the money for insurance, rather than using
 geico.  not only do they supply radar guns to the police they also want
 to make radar detectors illegal.  they also ask if you have a detector
 (probably to put you in a high risk group or just refuse to insure you).
 
 i know a few people who were droped by geico due to an accident that
 was not their fault.
