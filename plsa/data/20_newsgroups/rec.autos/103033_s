 just an comment:  i don't like it when people decide what's good for me...
 if you think you're going to decide anything for me, you'd better be 
 carrying a badge and a gun.  who made you capable of determining if there
 is "no way in hell that anybody is going anywhere"?  why do you find 
 it necessary to add to the problem instead of just minding your own 
 business?  if someone is minding their own business, i will give them
 all the room they want, and i'll try to make things easy for them, even
 letting them in in front of me if they ask politely (with a directional).
 on the other hand, if someone like you decides they want to block me and
 be a general asshole, you can bet your ass that i'll make life as 
 miserable as possible for you, as long as it doesn't affect anyone else
 who's minding their own business.  
 they have a phrase to describe someone like you:
 self appointed traffic police.
 just mind your own business and stay in the right lane where you belong.
