 	yeah.  i don't use the clutch all the time either.  i've done it
 with fords, bmw, datsun, and chevy and it works fine.  i can't think of
 any reason that it would damage the tranny.  essentially you are just
 doing what the synchros do anyhow - match the engine speed with the
 tranny speed and slip it into gear.

 	sounds about right.  i usually slip it out during throttle-down
 and then blip the throttle and wait until it feels like things are right
 (usually about a second) and then slip it into gear...
