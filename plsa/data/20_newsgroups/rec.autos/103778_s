 it was also the worst engine that ford (europe) have ever made - bloody
 awful reputation. it's most successful application being the transit
 van.
 
 saab gave up with this motor and then made the triumph 1854 (half a stag v8) under license (i believe), but with 2-litre capacity and perhaps a different
 arrangement for the cylinder head studs, before developing their own straight 
 four from the triumph.
