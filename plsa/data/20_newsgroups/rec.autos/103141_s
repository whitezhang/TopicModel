 i've had a valentine for about 9 months now and i agree that it is the best det
 ector available. the point here is trust and reliability. i've been able to "tr
 ust" the valentine more than any other detector i've owend. if the valentine sa
 ys that there is a moderate to strong radar source in front of me, then it's mo
 re than likely to be a speed trap. with my other detectors, i've gotten so many
  falses that i've begun to ignore someo of the warnings because i didn't want t
 o drive like i had one foot on the brake and one on the gas pedal.
 
 that directional indicator really, really helps. plus, more info is almost alwa
 ys better than less info. no matter how smart radar detectors get, the human br
 ain is usually smarter. so, if i'm going to make a decisio based on information
  at hand, i want all the info i can get. plus, if you divide the overall streng
 th of the radar signal by the number of bogeys reported, you'll find that each
 bogey is pretty weak and therefore not a radar threat. with other detectors, yo
 u'll just get one strong warning. my logic may be faulty on this, but i think i
 t works okay.
 
 although, i must admit that i haven't really noticed the reflection problem of
 one radar souce.
