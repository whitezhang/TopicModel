 which flat 4 engines have i4 style cranks?

 i am 99.99% sure that subaru (and porsche) use the boxer configuration
 and not the inline 4 crank that you analyzed and compared. would you
 care to re-evaluate the other case of a flat four?  i think that this
 configuration is perfectly balanced as far as primary, secondary
 forces and couples are concerned.  i have an article in front of me
 that says so.

 the flat four is also shorter than an inline 4, so even if it is mounted
 longitudinally it will not take up lots of length.. and a longitudinal
 placement is easier for a 4 wheel drive drivetrain.
 
 i think that subaru's ads hold water.  in practice, their flat fours
 are noticeably smoother than inline 4s and completely buzz free,
 though some may not like its peculiar note.  but as alfa has shown, a
 boxer four can produce a spine tingling scream that only the likes of
 recent hondas can approach.
