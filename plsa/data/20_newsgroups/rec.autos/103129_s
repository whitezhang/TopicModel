 well, this isn't the right group for this, but i have to say that i don't
 think violence is any more socially acceptable now, by any means.  how
 can you say that when we used to have of pistol-toting gunslingers as 
 heros, or even gangland thugs being considered romantic.  do you think
 our great grandparent got yelled at by their parents for playing cowboys
 and indians?  i don't think so.  that behavior was somewhat encouraged
 back then, in fact.
 i think the only difference between now and then is that nowadays, when
 some teenager kills another one in a classroom in california, we here 
 about it in ma the same day.  back in the old days, they'd never hear 
 about something like that, period. 
 
 sorry about posting to rec.autos, but this is where it came up...
