 something that happened in south africa about a year ago: a dealer sold a 
 mercedes with an odometer reading of 150k kilometers to a lady. turned out 
 that the actual reading should have been 160k. court case followed because
 lady said she wouldn't have bought a car with that much km's. dealer found 
 quilty, fined and had to take back the car.
 
 i think you have a case if you can get a sworn statement from the previous
 owner. take the car back to the dealer and threaten him or something.
