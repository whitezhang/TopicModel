 justify all you want.  extended warranties are a ripoff, high profit item for
 the dealer.  and you didn't buy 5yr/60k, you get 3yr/36k *free*, so what you
 bought is 2yr/24k.  and you still have to pay $50 every time you use this 
 great 'warranty'.  better to put your money in the bank and use it for repairs
 if/when you need it.  considering that your last car was only 1.5 years old,
 are you sure you will even keep this new one past it's *free* warranty period?
 btw, typical profit on extended warranties is around 80%.  that's right, only
 20% of the money needs to go into the collective pot to pay for any future
 repairs that the group of extended-warranty-people collect.
