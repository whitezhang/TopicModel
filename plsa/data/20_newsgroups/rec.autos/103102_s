 on the cars mentioned - 3 series from the late 80's the "electronic"
 odometer is really a mechanical drum type odometer, that is driven
 by pulses from a speed sensor on the rear axle.  these pulses are 
 converted into mechanical pulses that turn the odometer - and speedometer.
 no way changing or erasing an eprom is going to change the mileage
 reading.  it also means the odometer is just as easy (or hard) to
 change as any other mechanical odometer.
 
 on the other hand it is a bit easier to disconnect the speed sensor
 and run the car with no speedometer or odometer reading...a simple
 switch will do the job.  it also will disable the speed limiter,
 which will enable the car to reach it's full speed.  ;-)
