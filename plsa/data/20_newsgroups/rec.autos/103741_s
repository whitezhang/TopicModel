 	my neighbor runs a viper(r) distributorship and installs them on all
 saturns sold in my area (anne arundel county, md).  he has an sc with the
 viper voice alarm installed.  the alarm does everything, turn on the car, 
 the radio, the heater, roll down windows, unlock the doors...  the alarm goes
 off more frequently on hot days when a person walks by.  it gets sensitive up
 to about 5 feet in 85degree heat.  it isn't as bad as convetional siren alarms,
 because it doesn't continue to wail, it just says "protected by viper, please
 stand back!"  and shuts up...  (mainly because the person walks away 
 befuddled!!!")
