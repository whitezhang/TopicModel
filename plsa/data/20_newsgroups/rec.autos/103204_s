 a mileage chart should be available in the book.  it usually goes by
 the class of car you own and year.  usually you will end up adding a few
 hundred dollars to the retail price or subtracting it...  consumer
 reports also has a number you can call and get a quote for your area.
 a friend of mine used it, and was quite happy with the service.  i
 believe it cost about $10.00.
