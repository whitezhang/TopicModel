 grass roots motorsport [3/93] has a long article about mg/b's this month.
 as far as collectivity/speculation is concerned they think it is a 
 waste of time, especially the later rubber bumpered models are the least
 desirable, a 1962 original model the most. the reasons for its low
 value are easy availability and the fact that it just was not a very good
 car.
