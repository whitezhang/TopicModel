 on the subject of the v4,ford in the uk used v4 engines exstensively in
 their ford transit vans.this brings back a memory from the seventies.i
 played in a band at the time and for something like 180 pounds four of
 us bought a 1967 "tranny" to cart the gear around in.it was in terrible
 shape (cosmetically) because it's last owner was a pig farmer.we spent
 days cleaning it up and putting in a partition and more seating but 'til
 the day it died everytime you turned on the fan to the defroster dried
 pig shit came flying out the vents!!!.
     back to the engine if i remember right it was a 1600cc v4 and that
 thing could haul,we could fill it with equipment and up to 8 people and
 it went like a bat out of hell,of course there were no pollution controls
 on the engine and the gas was leaded and higher octane than we get now.
     when the mechanical fuel pump quit we put in an electric one from a 
 morris minor that worked great. ah fond memories.
