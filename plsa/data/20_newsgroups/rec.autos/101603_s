 oh pulleeze!
 
 it's not biology at all, it's clothing design.  women's clothing is
 generally designed to be as non-functional as possible.  it's only been
 in the last five years or so that you could buy women's pants with
 pockets deep enough to carry anything in.  previously, deep pockets were
 virtually unknown in women's clothing.  skirts generally have better
 pockets now, too.  dresses, espcially fancy dresses, are still pretty
 hopeless.  i often hand my driver's license over to my husband if we're
 dressed up to go out somewhere, so i don't have to be encumbered by a
 purse.
 
 if women consistently bought functional clothing, and boycotted the
 manufacturers who refuse to make functional women's clothing, i think
 manufacturers would tend to bow to market pressures.  there's
 an interesting chapter in susan faludi's backlash that described
 what happened the last time clothing manufacturers ignored the
 need for functional women's clothing.  the manufactuing industry
 lost millions.
 
 from a woman who would rather buy men's clothing with decent pockets and
 long legs and high waists than women's clothing without....
