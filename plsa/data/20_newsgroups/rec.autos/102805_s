 
 i'm plannig to trade my sentra se-r in with a nx2000.  my car has 11,500
 miles on it and is a '92 model.  the nx2000 the dealer is selling is a '91
 model with 23,000miles on it.  it has a t-bar roof, a/c, and an airbag,
 which my sentra does not have.  they are asking for $1500.  is that a fair
 deal?  the only thing i noticed about the nx2000 is that the engine did not
 seem to have as much torque as my sentra which has the same identical
 engine.  i presume that the last lady owner did not really push the engine
 to it's limits occassionaly while i did that on mine, thuis the nx2000's
 engine is a little "tight."  so, if i buy the nx2000 and "excercise" it
 well, should that slight power problem go away?  any advice on this will be
 much appreciated.  thanks.  please reply via e-mail if possible.
