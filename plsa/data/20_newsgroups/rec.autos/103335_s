 hi all,
 i have available to me a set of metric wheels (came off a mustang or t-bird)
 which are wearing nearly-bald michelin trx 220-55r390 tires.  the only place
 i have found these tires is the tire rack mailorder place for $121 a pop.
 is there a cheaper source, or another manufacturer of this size tire?  thanks
 for any info...please e-mail responses and i will post a summary if there is
 any interest.
