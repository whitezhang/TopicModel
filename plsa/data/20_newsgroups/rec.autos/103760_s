 hi, i was looking for some helpful advice.
 i'm a university student with about $7000 to spend, and i'm looking for a 
 used car. does anyone have any useful advice they could offer to a first-
 time buyer? i'm not looking for anything sporty, just something functional 
 and reliable (less maintenance costs). anybody have any ideas on what models 
 might suit me?
 
 thanks
