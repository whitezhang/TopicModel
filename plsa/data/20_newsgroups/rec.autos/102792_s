 
 i don't know if some lemons are out there, but from personal experience
 my brother's has been trouble free.  not one single repair, only 
 regular maintainance.  the only work he had done on it was a result
 of his stupidity... he stopped suddenly in the middle of a left turn 
 on a busy intersection, and was rear-ended.  he has a 1989 plymouth
 sundance.  i would recomend it, but i would also like to say that if
 you can wait about six months, chryco is coming out with a new car
 called the neon, that is built in the same way as the lh's where.
 good luck with your desiscion.
