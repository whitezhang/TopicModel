 especially the '68 shelby-american gt-500kr (king of the road, so named
 to steal gm's planned camaro king of the road's thunder :-)

 some gt-40s are street legal, some aren't.

 i found my shelby-american guide. there were a grand total 126 gt-40s
 built:
 		gt-40 coupes		55
 		gt-40 road cars		31
 		gt-40 mk ii		13
 		gt-40 mk iiis		 7
 		gt-40 roadsters		 5
 		mirages			 3
 		gt-40 mk ivs		12
 		   	total:	       126
 		additional uncompleted mk iiis	6-12
 
 twelve of these cars were prototypes; 48 racing coupes; 31 road coupes;
 eight mk ii coupes; 4 lhd mk iiis; and 3 rhd mk iiis. the other 
 breakdowns follow the above list (eg, 12 were mk ivs). the lhd/rhd
 breakdown is only given on the mk iiis.
 
 the prices (for those which can be bought) are around the $1 million
 mark, last i heard, with a projection of some $3.5 million (or
 thereabouts) in 2000. it was second only to some penny-ante ferarri ;-).
 
 shelby won the fia world manufacturer's cup with his cobras in '65; that
 was also the year that he retired them from the shelby-american racing
 team (in favor of the ford gt program the next year). that victory
 broke a 13(?) year ferarri winning streak.
 
 well, there's lotsa info i could spout, but i'll refrain. much of
 this information comes from "hot rod" magazine's "shelby american
 cobra/mustang guide," which has more info on the shelby-american 
 fords than you could _ever_ want to know.
