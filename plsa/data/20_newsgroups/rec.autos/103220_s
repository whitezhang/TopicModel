 hi:
 
 i am looking for tires.  i would like to hear your experience on the 
 bf goodrich radial t/a tires and/or the touring t/a especially for
 size p185/70r13.
 
 for radial t/a: how do they do in snow, and wet weather?  are they quiet tires?
 
 for touring t/a: how many miles can they last?  i believe they are in
                  every way equal/better than radial t/a.  am i right?
 
 -chan.
