 hello again, another question.  :)
 
 i just got my hands on 2 quarts of readline gear oil (at $7 a quart)
 now i need to know how to throw it into my car.
 
 i own an 89 nissan maxima se, any ideas?
 can i mix the oil in there with this stuff, or should i drain first, then
 	only use this stuff.
 if you know where (if there is one) the drain plug on the manual transmission
 	on the maxima is, i would really appreciate any comments.
 also have any of you maxima owners, thied this stuff in your cars?
 
 thanks in adv.
 sammy
