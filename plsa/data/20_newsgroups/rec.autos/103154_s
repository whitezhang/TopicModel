 well, it depends on what kind of locking lugnuts you have.  my previous
 car had locking lugnuts that weighed about 2.5oz. more than the others. 
 the locking lugnuts were factory equipment, and according to the factory
 service manual, after tire balancing the technician/mechanic was
 supposed to put a 1/2 oz. counterweight on the rim opposite the locking
 nut.  i always had vibration problems with those stupid lugnuts since no
 one ever did the service correctly. i eventually got rid of the locking
 lugnuts and replaced them with the standard lugnuts.  unfortunately, i
 found out about the counterweighting technique 6 months after i got rid
 of the locking nuts. :-(
 
 my present car, a saturn sc, has locking lugnuts that i bought at the
 dealer and are made specifically for the saturn.  they have been made to
 be exactly the same weight as the non-locking lugnuts (said so on the
 package and i verified it myself).  i haven't had any vibration problems
 with the tires at all (due to the nuts) in 12,000 of ownership.  i did
 have some other vibration problems, but it was due to a poor job of tire
 balancing.
