 i still can't understand all the hype about the impalla ss, it still has
 the ugly caprice body (orca on wheels).  the caprice was the worst new
 body style to come out of detroit ever! now just because the lt1 engine
 and a few suspension tweeks are being added.
 
 its still ugly, its still a barge.  gm's answer to everything is "throw in
 a v8 and someone will buy it."  or "add some plastic ground affects
 and a few stickers and call it a gt, gtz or ss, and someone will buy it."
 
 imho gm needs to scrap the caprice body completely and start over with a
 blank sheet of paper.  no minor modification (wheel well treatments, tail
 amp modification, or nose re-design or even the lt1 engine) will help
 the existing caprice.
