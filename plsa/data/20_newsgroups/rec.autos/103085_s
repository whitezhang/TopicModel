 this suggestion isn't as far-fetched as it sounds.  years ago in another
 time and place, i used to do oil changes in boats powered by automotive
 engines.  in many cases, there was no way to get any sort of a tray under
 the oil pan because it was boxed in by the bottom of the hull and various
 floation chambers on each side.  and if you *did* get something there, you'd
 spill all the oil out of it for sure trying to get it back out again.
 
 so we used a small pump powered by an electric drill to suck the oil out
 the dipstick hole.  there was a long/thin hose on the inlet side designed
 to fit down the dipstick tube, and another, thicker/shorter hose on the
 outlet side that you put into any convenient container.  i'm sure these
 gadgets are still available from marine hardware suppliers if you want one.
