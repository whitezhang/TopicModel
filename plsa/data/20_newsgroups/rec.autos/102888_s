 the mustang is a much worse case of design irresponsibility than the

 yes. when i think mustang, i think school-bus +  f16 motor. in
 my mind the mustang should be fitted with a speed limiter at 80-90
 or so. it just isn't safe, check out your local junkyard, mustangs
 outnumber other cars by a proportion way in excess of sales in
 junkyards.
 
 i find it astonishing the cu or somesuchlike has not jumped on the
 mustang for poor brakes in relation to power. ford should at least
 standardize on the svo rear brakes for all 5.0's.

 true of northern europe, latin countries are something else.

 yes.

 "autobahn" is the german word for freeway. other countries have
 different names for loose equivalents; autostrada, autoroute, motorway
 etc.

 europe did seem on the brink of a 130kmh limit. it hasn't passed as
 far as i know. typical speeds in western europe are much higher than
 the us. law enforcement is negligible in my experience (comapred
 to the us) as there is no revenue enhancement motivation. the things
 you really notice are the higher speed differentials, and the more
 professional attitude to driving. you just never see two cars
 running parallel at 55.1 mph oblivious to all around them.

 you're wrong. gti's  go this fast. just kind of noisy, not the ideal
 
 autobahn car. a lot of times you see cars being driven with the drivers
 foot on the floor. how do i know? - when you're not making any ground
 on the identical car in front of you!
 
 >have no respect for their own lives.
 
 if something happens at 130-150 you're dead, but the same goes for much
 over 35. driving at high speed forces you to concentrate. i feel much
 safer driving 130+ on the autobahn than 60-80 in typical us traffic
 because most people seem to be awake. i've never seen any driver reading
 a book on an autobahn, i see it all too often in the us.

 it just doesn't *seem* fast after 30 minutes or so of aclimation. everybody
 drives that fast, no big deal.
