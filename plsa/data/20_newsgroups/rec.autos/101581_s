 car and driver rated the 325is (1988) at 7.2 0-60 , 1/4 at 15.2 (after 30k miles) last time i checked 8#}.
 
 automobile magazine rated new 325is 1/4 mile@16.2.

 sounds like we need a race.  i'll let you have the newer version.  can someone out there lend me a 1988 325is for a day 8-].  i wont hurt it, i promise.

 >but don't take my word for it.  go drive it.
 
 actually i will take your word on it.  i refuse to test it (new 325is) because
 i love bmw's and would probably want to buy it.  problem is, my income just doesn't support that.
