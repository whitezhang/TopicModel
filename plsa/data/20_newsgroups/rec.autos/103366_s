 the best auto-shifters on the street (and not the track) are those from 
 porsche... they wont change if you floor the gas during a turn.... a few 
 years back a was in a 200sx auto (you guys call it a 240sx [without turbo])
 and was going round a corner.... i floored it and next thing i know i was 
 pointing backwards! the other drivers seemed quite amused ;-)
 
 						....shaz....
