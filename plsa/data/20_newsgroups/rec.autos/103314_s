 not alone at all. my old 83 accord (now in the hands of a sibling) has a much
 better engagement of the clutch. even the old 84 civic we keep as a beater 
 feels better in this aspect. note that these are cars with 250,000 kms and
 140,000 kms respectively. my 90 prelude blows both of them away in every 
 respect except smooth clutch engagement. of course the kawasaki is the best
 of the bunch but i need more than 2 wheels most of the time.
 
 the prelude has had a dud clutch from day 1, and after three years and 67,000
 kms is no better. best of luck and feel free to add this to your collection.
