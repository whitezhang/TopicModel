 i used to have a '67 galaxie convertible, was sitting at a light waiting
 for it to turn green. it turned green, but i hesitated a little (sleeping i
 guess) and a bird bombed me, it landed directly in front of me at eye
 level, i guess the bird miscalculated and thought i was going to take off
 right away.
 
 and i'm still trying to figure out the one i got under my rear bumper as
 well ?!?!?! was the bird flying up and doing fancy acrobatics at my car and
 decided to drop one while executing a perfect loop??
