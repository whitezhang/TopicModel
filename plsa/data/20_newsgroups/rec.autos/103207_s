 carrying in the glove box is not covered...i'm not sure what i was 
 thinking there. it _is_ legal in oklahoma. 
 
 on inter-state travel, as long as it is legal for you to own
 at your point of origination and destination, the gun is carried
 in a locked compartment/box (glove box specifically excluded) separate
 from the ammo, it is legal under title 19, chapter 44, section 94(9? i
 forget, and my copy of the regs is at home) of the us code. this,
 unfortunately, has not prevented the theft by state troopers of a
 certain state (which shall remain nameless to protect the hopelessly
 stupid) under that state's law.
 
 gee, and i thought federal law overrode state law...
