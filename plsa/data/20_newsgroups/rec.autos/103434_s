 having driven both, and having owned an sc300 for 14 months now, all i can
 say is "it depends".  they're both great cars.  in fact, my wife and i
 are saving our pennies so we can get her the 300zx convertible in a year.
 the 300zx handles like a dream, while the sc300 rides like a dream.
 fit and finish on both are excellent, but the lexus gets the nod in
 customer satisfaction.  they're both very attractive, and hideously
 expensive.  the resale value of the sc is better than the zx.  the
 300zx isn't available with traction control, which makes it a handful
 on slippery surfaces.
