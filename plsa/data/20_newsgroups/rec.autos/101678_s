 i'm sorry, as i have never heard of any of this.  guess they don't think
 it's important enough for a classroom, and i was going on what i've seen
 in pics.(some movies--real nice scource there, huh?)  i just always 
 recall thinking that good roads of asphalt didn't come around til the
 interstate hiway act, or whatever they called it(60's?), and that wood and
 cobblestone roads were fairly rare up through the depression, except in
 overpopulated places like england and us cities.  obviously netwisdom
 says i am wrong.

 i knew it was almost always done, but i knew of no reason that it might not
 be done the other way by desoto for their car.  seems like they had some
 other deviations from the norm too, at times :-)
