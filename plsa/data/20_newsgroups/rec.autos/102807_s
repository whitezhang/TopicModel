   this last comment was obviously a bit cynical, but a true statement of
  the attitude of some drivers (there's your "autos" content), i would say.
 
   what law-abiding (not "low-abiding" as above (talk about freudian slips!))
  citizens have the right and responsibility to do is try to prevent this
  type of behaviour in children.  a doctor may have to use "deadly force"
  against a part of a body (like amputating it) when an infection/disease
  has gone too far.  but his real desire would have been to *prevent* the
  disease in the first place or at least nip it in the bud.

  these are my opinions, which should only make you read, think, and question.
  they do not necessarily reflect the views of my employer or fellow workers.
