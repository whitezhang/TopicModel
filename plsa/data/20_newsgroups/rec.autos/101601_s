   i won't argue too much about anything.  i am probably one of those that 
 think that we can't have enough safety on the roads.  i would gladly 
 sacrifice distractions (as you call it), than someone having trouble seeing
 danger earlier.  one saved life justifies more than my lifetime of "distractions"
 for me.

    problem is that, i may just kill the guy. i agree that i would be at fault,
 and i will have my license revoked, why, i might even go to the gas chamber.
 but the fact still remains that the guy is dead.  someone died because i
 was too stingy to put on my lights.

    the ratio of the probability of fallen trees/rocks on the roads to 
 oncoming traffic is too low to even be considered.  the difference is also
 working on what we *know* could happen, to what *might* happen.

   compared to the number of gallons of gas consumed by those 200 million cars,
 it is miniscule! 
 
   whatever.....  'tis a pity i have to share the same roads with a person
 not concerned with safety.
