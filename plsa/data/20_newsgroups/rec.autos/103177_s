 yeah, people act really shocked about violence, as though it were new
 to our species...
 
 what about the holocaust? the crusades? the salem witch trials? the
 religious persecutions of the middle-ages? 
 
 what about violent acts carried out in the name of religion all over
 the world? what about the early christians put to death by the romans?
 the jews persecuted by christians?
 
 there are a lot more humans today than there have ever been. i do not
 know the stats, but there are far more people on the planet than there
 were 2 or 3 hundred years ago! the per capita acts of violence are
 probably not significantly different than they were a hundred or a
 thousand years ago!
 
 there is nothing new about violence.
