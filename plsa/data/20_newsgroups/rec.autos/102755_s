 do you have a ziebart dealer in your area? they've offered spray
 on bed liners around here for several years. if you do, see what
 kind of a warranty they have. ( unfortunately, i don't know anyone
 who has gotten one so i can't help you there.) also ask if they
 can give you a list of references.
