 i know this is the wrong place to post this, but i couldn't find any
 relevant newsgroups in my area.
 
 for those of you who are from pa, where is vascar (where the cops
 measure your speed from the time it takes you to cross the distance
 between two white lines on the road, right?) most commonly used?  i'm
 especially interested in the pittsburgh area (specific locations, prior
 experiences, if possible).  for those pa and non-pa, if they use vascar
 in your state, is it most common in rural, city, highway areas, etc. 
 what i'm interested in mainly is where i can speed with the least risk
 of being caught.  you can always detect radar, but there's no way to
 fight vascar unless you know where all the white lines are.
 
 thanks a lot,
