 these substitutes exist, and at this time are available. its the future
 availability that is in doubt.
 
 1) ghg-12
 
 get it from people's welding supply 800-382-9006
 
 
 2) butane/propane  
 
 you can mix this yourself so no one can ever regulate it away.
 just make sure you use good quality (dry) gases.
 
 
 i don't know of any 200mpg carb distributors :-)
