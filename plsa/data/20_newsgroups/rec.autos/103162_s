 on the other hand, if it can be proven, it's possible the changed 
 terms could be thrown out.  the question will be whether the 
 agreement contains a merger clause.  see ucc @ 2-202 (parol 
 evidence).  if we're talking about warranties, then, of course, 
 ucc @ 2-316 should be looked at.
 
 but we have so little information that none of us can say anything 
 conclusive.
