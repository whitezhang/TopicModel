 carrying a pistol, loaded or unloaded, in the glove compartment, is
 considered carrying a concealed weapon in colorado and is illegal without
 a concealed weapons permit.  unless the law has been changed recently,
 carrying a weapon openly is legal in colorado but concealing it is illegal.
 i read a newspaper account last year where police stopped a car on a
 traffic infraction and observed a .357 magnum revolver sitting on the
 seat.  the driver could not be cited for possessing or carrying the weapon
 because it was not concealed.  the article stated that if the gun had
 been discovered in the glove box, it would have been considered a crime.
