 	as a stong self-defense advocate, you're 'statement', does littel
 but irk me.  of course shooting someone because they throw a rock at your
 car is out of the question, but what if they disabled your car with their
 rock and then wanted to come kill/rape/rob/beat/ or otherwise harm you,
 your wife, kids?  
 	i think you would like the power to defend yourself in this situation,
 wouldn't you?  or is it that you value the lives of such rock throwers
 more than your own or those of your family?  
 	don't think it couldn't happen to you.  from the sounds of it here
 it has happened to a few people.  
 
 	please do not misunderstand.  the only justification for using
 deadly force on someone, is that if you don't, it will mean your own 
 death or grave bodily harm.  i am far far away from supporting
 vilante justice or anything like that..
 
 	oh, and if you mean to be funny, please add the appropriate :-)
 	
 followups to talk.politics.guns please...  we're getting a bit off track
 here....
