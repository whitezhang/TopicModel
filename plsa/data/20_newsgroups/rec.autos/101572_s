 this has me thinking.  is there a biological reason why women can't put
 their keys in their pants pockets like men do?  i have two pockets on the
 back of each of my pants.  i put my keys in one and wallent in another.
 many of the pockets even have a botton on them so i can close them securely.
 everything is that much simpler for me.  why can't women do the same?
 is is biological (ie, not enough room for a bigger bottom plus keys and
 a wallet) or is it the way they are raised by the parents?
