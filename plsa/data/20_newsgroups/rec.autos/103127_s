 i went to a place called american car care centers to check my car for a/c
 leak.  after "checking", i was told that there is a leak in the compressor
 seal.  at the end, in addition to the labor for the check, i was charged 12
 dollars for a pound of freon, although they evacuated my a/c afterwards
 because of the leak.  first, is it fair for him to charge me for a pound of
 freon ($12 plus tax) ?  second, what can i do about this if this is unfair ?
