 of course it releases radiation! thats why your car goes faster when
 you punch the holes in it. all that radiation gets on your engine
 and gives it "pep" (scientific term). you get more horsepower &
 torque too! if you don't know what hp & torque are, you can read
 mile long threads on the subject, but they are all wrong. horsepower
 is how much power a horse can make pulling a subaru, and torque is
 a name invented by craftsman for a wrench.
