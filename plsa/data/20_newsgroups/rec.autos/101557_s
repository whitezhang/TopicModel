 i'm looking for a replacement radio/tape player for a 1984 
 toyota tercel.  standard off-the-shelf unit is fine, but 
 every place i've gone to (service merchandise, etc.) doesn't 
 have my car in its model application book.  i want to just 
 take out the old radio, and slide in the new, with minimal time
 spent hooking it up and adjusting the dashboard.
 
 if you have put in a new unit in a similar car, i'd like to hear
 what brand,  how easy it was to do the change, and any other 
 relevant information. 
 
 please answer via e-mail.
 thanks,  tom ostrand
