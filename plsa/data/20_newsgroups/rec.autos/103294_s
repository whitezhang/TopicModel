  remember roads in america are not designed for speeds above 80 meaning they
 would be safe at 55-65. roads like the autobahn are smoother, straiter,
 wider and slightly banked. 
 
 example: a few months back i was traveling late at  night ( 3:00 am or so)
 and i was changing highways at a bent crosssing. it  curved off to the south
 east becoming hidden by trees after about 1,000 ft and continued to the
 left strait north. i wanted to turn north, checked the south lane, rolled
 into the crossing and checked the north lane. nevertheless there wasn't 
 a car in sight, so i took one last look and pulled into the left hand lane.
 now my car isn't a 5 sec 0-60 performer but i was in the corect lane and 
 over 40 in decent time, even at 3:00 i wasn't wasting time. it was then
 that i checked my mirror and saw a mustang closing in my lane *fast*, he 
 had just turned the corner and was just noticing me. luckly he saw me and 
 changed lanes in time, i estamate he was moving in excess of 90 or so.
 i was just a by stander, i had no chance of runing from him, or moving out 
 of his way. i'm glad he saw my brake lights in time. i shudder to 
 think of what would have happened had i wainted to pull out and not 
 left the time he needed to dodge me.
 
 rule: just because your car can do 100+, and  your way is clear,
 don't assume it will stay that way.
