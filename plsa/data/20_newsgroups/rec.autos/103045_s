 assuming yours is a non turbo mr2, the gruffness is characteristic of
 a large inline 4 that doesn't have balance shafts.  i guess toyota
 didn't care about "little" details like that when they can brag about
 the mid engine configuration and the flashy styling.
 
 myself, i automatically cross out any car from consideration (or
 recommendation) which has an inline 4 larger than 2 liters and no
 balance shafts..  it is a good rule of thumb to keep in mind if you
 ever want a halfway decent engine.  
 
 if the noise really bugs you, there is nothing else that you can do
 except to sell it and get a v6.
