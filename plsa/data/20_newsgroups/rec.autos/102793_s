 is clear coat really worth it?  yes, on the showroom floor, the cars
 have this deep, lustrous shine that just can't be found on paint jobs
 that aren't clear coated.  on the other hand, it seems that every clear
 coated car that i've seen on the road (in a parking lot, etc.) has
 fine scratches throughout the paint job.  as does, alas, my 1992 laser.
 
 several weeks ago i had my car professionally polished and waxed.
 when i picked it up, it had that same showroom shine that i remember
 from a year ago when i bought it.  several days ago i took my car
 to the dealership for some work.  as an added bonus, they washed my
 car.  unfortunately, whoever washed it either didn't get the roof
 (which is black, the rest of the car is red) completely clean before
 he dried it, or he used a dirty towel.  now my showroom shine is a
 haze of fine scratches that aren't really visible until the light
 hits the roof at a particular angle.
 
 i am, to put it mildy, somewhat peeved about this.  do i have any 
 chance of getting the dealership to do something about this?
 my guess is 'no'.  is there any product on the market that provides
 a solution to this problem?  or am i faced with the prospect of
 having the car professionally polished again to hide the scratches?
 information, commiseration, and sympathy all greatly appreciated . . .
