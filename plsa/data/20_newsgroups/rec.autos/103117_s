 one i saw had vented rears too...it was on a lot.
 of course, the sales man was a fool..."titanium wheels"..yeah, right..
 then later told me they were "magnesium"..more believable, but still
 crap, since al is so m uch cheaper, and just as good....
 
 
 i tend to agree, tho that this still doesn't take the sho up to "standard"
 for running 130 on a regular basis.  the brakes should be bigger, like
 11" or so...take a look at the  ones on the corrados.(where they have
 braking regulations).
