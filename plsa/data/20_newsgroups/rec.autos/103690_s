 and didn't you also say that it was easier to add masses than to
 add balance shafts?  the sad truth is that some makers don't
 bother to put balance shafts on their big shaky 4's..

 how about:

 if this is ridiculous, kindly explain why.. it's been more than 10 years
 since i studied this stuff.  :-)

 the point that they are trying to make is that while everybody settles
 for the orthodox inline 4, they are using a horizontally opposed 4,
 which is unique in that market segment.  and porsche also uses a flat
 six in their 911, so what's the problem?  i don't see any claim that
 their engine is as good as a porsche's.. they are simply pointing out
 that they use the same configuration as a porsche.. if you want to
 nitpick ad campaigns, i think there are far more blatant excesses than
 this.
