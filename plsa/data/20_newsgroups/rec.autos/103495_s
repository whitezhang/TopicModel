 
 hi everybody ...
 
 well i don't know if this is a known problem
 to you in the big state but over here in europe
 it is in some places ...
 it just happened to me and i payed a lot to get my 
 new honda civic repaired.
 a marten choose my car to stay one night in and this
 damn little animal damaged almost everything which
 was plastic/rubber ..
 i never thought that these little #@%##@ could do that
 much damage.
 
 so to all you car owners out there :
 
 is there a good known method of gettin' rid of  this animal ???
 except for waiting all night long beneath my car with a gun ???
 
 help in any form would be appreciated very very much !!!!
