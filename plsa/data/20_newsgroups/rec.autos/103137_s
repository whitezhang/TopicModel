 i'll pick up that pm and have a look -- maybe the picture in there is not
 the actual car, but a prototype?
 
 i saw the mach iii and was not all that impressed -- it looked way too
 japanese for me... the tear drop headlights reminded me of a nissan nx...
 
 glad i didn't hold out for the '94 and bought a '93.  maybe they'll work on
 the design a little bit, listen to consumers and come out with nice-looking
 '95 or '96.  it always takes a while to work out the kinks in a new design,
 e.g. the f-body camaro/firebirds (btw, the new camaros look like shit too).
