 alright gm!!!! finally my wishes have come true, moby dick with a corvette
 engine.  don't you think they should maybe spend the money doing something
 about the lousy build/quality/design of their bigger selling cars?  this is
 another example of why gm is in so much trouble.  if you're going to stick
 the lt-1 or zr-1 engine in a car, at least make it a nice looking one.
 sheesh
