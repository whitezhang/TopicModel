 i recently saw a particular third party antenna on a new camry (not mine,
 but it caught my interest) and a new 626.  it seems to replace the
 factory power antenna and is about a foot long made of plastic tubing.  i
 have seen them on quite a few cars, but i can't find anything more about
 them in previous r.a.c articles nor in r.a articles.
 
 i'd like to know all i can, so any feedback is greatly appreciated.
