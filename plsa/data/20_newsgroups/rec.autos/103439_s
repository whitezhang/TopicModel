 my son is considering the purchase of a 71 mgb, which has been substantially
 restored.  the odometer has rolled over, but we can't be sure of the actual
 mileage.  the engine and drive train apparently weren't touched in the
 restoration, except for a new carb and a few hoses.  he plans to do vacuum and
 compression checks to see what they might tell us about the engine.  the body
 and undercarriage have no visible rust, the interior is new, as are tires,
 front brakes (not sure about the back), battery, bumpers and other misc parts.
 the paint is checked in a few places, and scuffed here and there, allegedly by
 a wind-blown car cover.  it seemed to handle ok, except for soft front shocks.
 questions:
 
 are there problem areas common to mgbs we should check out?
 
 the brakes seem soft and rather ineffective; what should we expect in the way
 of braking action?
 
 it seemed to be "doggy" when accelerating from a stop.  what should we expect
 it to do, given the 4-cylinder engine?
 
 the top is in place, but will not reach a number of the snaps.  the weather
 was cold.  should the vinyl stretch and fit when it warms up, or is it forever
 shrunk?
 
 is it normal for the wire wheels to be painted, or are they usually chromed?
 
 given this rather limited description, what would be a reasonable price?
 
 gee, this turned out to be a little long--sorry.  while my brother once owned
 an xk120 jag (what a car!) we're obviously not into sports cars.  any help with
 these questions, or suggestions on other things to investigate would surely be
 appreciated.
