 no, of course porsche doesn't have a patent on the "targa" name.  if that were
 the case, what would fiat do?  i suppose that technically my del sol is not a
 "convertible" in the literal sense, but it certainly classifies as an open-
 topped car.  in addition, the rear section behind the removable top is what
 makes my car _infinately_ safer than a convertible.
