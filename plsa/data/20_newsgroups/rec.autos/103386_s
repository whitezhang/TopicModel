 
 i purchased a used 1988 nissan 300zx (non-turbo) last year.  i had a 
 question on gear/rpm ratios.  right now in 5th @65mph i'm at 
 2600-2700 rpms.  @70mph i'm at about 2900rpms.  is this about the
 norm?  i'm an auto neophyte so i'm just wondering if these are
 the proper ranges?  somehow the rpm figures seem high.  a friend of mine
 just told me he can hit 60mph in 3rd on his 88 chevy beretta (2.8l v6.)
 also, anyone know the top speed attainable (@redline???) for this model z?
 (not that i would try it but it would be an interesting factoid. :)
  
 				thanx!
