 whoa!  watch your terminology.  "dealer invoice" is *not* "dealer cost".
 you'll hear lots of ads screaming "two dollars over dealer invoice!!!"
 sounds like a real deal, huh?  no.  you know what the "dealer invoice"
 (also called factory invoice) is?  it's a piece of paper with numbers
 on it that the factory sends the dealer.  what do the numbers
 signify?  absolutely nothing.  it's a marketing gimmick that the
 salesman can wave in your face to impress you.  note that nowhere
 on the "invoice" does it claim to be the real price of the car, and
 most ads which mention dealer invoice will end with a very fast,
 low voice saying something like "invoice may not reflect actual
 dealer cost".  actually, i *guarantee* it does not reflect actual
 dealer cost.
 
 also, the reasonable profit for dealer is usually around three percent.
 adjust according to the dealer cost of the car and any options that
 you want.  haggle like hell with the salesman over the cost of
 "dealer prep" and "protection package" (i.e. a few squirts of
 paint and fabric protectant).  while you're at it, ask the salesman
 to toss in a thing or two that doesn't cost him any cash.  my 
 wife and i got a joyride in a twin-turbo mitsubishi 3000gt when
 we bought our mitsubishi mini-van.
