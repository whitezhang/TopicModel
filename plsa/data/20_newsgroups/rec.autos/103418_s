 now, now, before we get too carried away here....
 
 keep in mind that owning any car in korea is a luxury that only the ruling
 class can afford.  every government agency worth its salt finds some reason
 to levy a tax on car ownership; last i heard, there were seven different
 fees to pay to own a car.  i believe this is the sort of petty bureaucratic
 inefficiency that new president kim young sam wants to eradicate.  basically,
 i think the rules came into place as bureaucrats from plebian backgrounds
 wanted to wreak revenge on the ruling class.  in exchange, zaibatsu's like
 hyundai screwed over smaller companies, perpetuating a vicious cycle.
 i have faith that korean people can potentially build cars as well as anyone
 else, but for now hyundai cars seem to reflect the tensions within society,
 of screwy components that won't work together.  stubborn like a mule, the
 car either won't go forward or won't stop at all.
