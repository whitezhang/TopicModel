 in des moines, iowa, about a year ago, some kid dropped a rock from an 
 overpass and hit car just behind the windshield.  it put a dent in the roof, 
 so i guess i was lucky it hit metal.
 
 it's frustrating that we can't do much.  bother the city government to put
 covers on all overpasses?  slow down/speed up a bit when driving under all
 overpasses in the city?  i like the first better, but that will take time
 and lots of people talking to the city governments.
 
 just another .02...
