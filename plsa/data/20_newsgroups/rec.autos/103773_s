 the european version is called 200 sx and have a 1.8 liter engine with
 turbo and have more power than the us version ( 169 hp ); it goes from
 0 to 100 km/h in 7.5 sec and have a top speed of 225 km/h ( 140 miles/h ).
 i just purchased one ( new ) and i am looking for a repair book. i could
 not find one in france and germany; does anybody knows where to find one ?
 is there one in the uk ?
 probabaly no use to look in the us as the 240 sx have here a different motor.
 i am very pleased with the car and have no problem with it; but like to have
 good technical documentation about the car i own.
 
                                regards
