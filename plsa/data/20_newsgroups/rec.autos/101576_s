 one of the local dealers has a used (7k miles) '93 probe gt
 on the lot with a photocopy of a document taped to the
 window saying the dealership bought the car back from
 the previous owner because of "engine noises", but that
 the ford district rep had ok'ed the car saying those
 noises were "normal".  i thought it was worth looking
 into (the car seems otherwise clean) and mentioned this
 to a co-worker, who proceeded to tell me a horror story
 about her son's '93 probe gt, which had several problems,
 ending with engine noises which she said "was something
 with the heads", that ford acknowledged the noise, said
 they were working on it, but didn't have a cure as of
 yet.  her son traded the car in (and i checked -- not
 the same car).  so i have some evidence of a reoccuring
 problem with the v6 in the probe gt's, and by extension
 with the madza 626 and mx-6.
 
 anything to this?  i'd love to consider buying the gt (i'm
 turning 40 -- time for my scheduled mid life crisis :-)
 but i'd hate to find out i just became the proud owner
 of a lemon.
