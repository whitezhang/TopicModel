 the bricklin was a car manufactured by a company started by malcolm
 bricklin, who, i believe, was canadian.  he was the first one to import
 subarus, and later was responsible for importing yugos, i believe. 
 anyway, he had this idea that what would really sell would be a sports
 car, but one incorporating a bunch of innovative safety features.  the
 bricklin was built to be that queerest of beasts, the safety sports car.
  if any of you remember the early 70s movement among car makers to
 design "experimental" safety cars, you will recognize the general
 appearance of the bricklin - big 'ol bumpers, etc.  anyone recall other
 safety features?  the engine was an american v-8, ford i think is right.
 
 personally, i kinda like the way they look, and if i remember from the
 old magazine articles, the performance was only half-bad.  the choice of
 colors, though, tended towards the 1970s lime green - yech - but highly
 visible, i suppose.  
 
 the delorean, on the other hand, was a dog - nice looking (imo) but no
 motor at all.
