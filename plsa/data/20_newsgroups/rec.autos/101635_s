 we had those f*****g photo-radar things here in sweden a while ago.
 there was a lot of fuzz about them, and a lot of sabotage too (a spray-can
 with touch-up paint can do a lot of good...).
 
 eventually they had to drop the idea as there were a lot of court-cases
 where the owner of the car could prove he didn't drive it at the time
 of speeding.
 
 i especially recall a case where it eventually proved to be a car-thief that
 had stolen a car and made false plates. he, ofcourse, chose a license number
 of a identical car, so the photo seemed correct...
 
 in conclosion: photo-radar sucks, every way you look at it!
