 : shaz,

 : hmm.. but the service indicators that i have works this way:
 :   there are 5 green,1 yellow, 1 red indicators.
 :   initially all green indicators will be on for few minutes when you start
 :   your car. the computer will actually "sense" how you drive your car and
 :   as time goes by the green indicators will start to go off one by one and
 :   then the yellow indicator will turn on and then the red indicator will go
 :   on. and you should get service when by the time green indicators are off.
 :   
 :   after service the mechanic(or you) will reset the service indicators and the
 :   computer starts counting again.
 : 
 : so i expect to have a tool(or a procedure) to reset it so the green lights will 
 : come on and the yellow and red lights will go off.
 : 
 : i wonder how people can do oil change themself without knowing how to reset the
 : indicator.
 : 
 : it's the first european car i have and changing oil at 15,000 miles is a 
 : surprise to me. and it's a big plus :-). but i wonder how that could happen
 : since the oil lose its lubrication ability over time, i thought it's the oil and
 : not the vehicle that determines how often we should change oil.
 : 
 : any bmw owner on the net? response welcomed.
 : 
 : ps.  my initial question is "how do you seset the service indicator of a bmw"
 : 
 : derek 
 
 there is a perfectly legal tool available to reset the bimmer service lights.
 it will cost you 45$ from a mailorder, and buying one far outweighs
 the possible consequences of destroying all the electronics if you try
 di it yourself. 
 you wonder how people do an oil change without knowing how it reset.
 why is reseting so important? the only reason for doing
 it is stop the annoyance of a red light staring at you. 
 forget this 'in european cars you only need to change the oil every
 15000' crap. anyone serious about keeping their engine in good shape, and
 extending its life, will change it every 3000, (inc filter). don't wait
 for the servive lights to come on before servicing the car. 
 i bought a bmw about 6 months ago, it had 3 green lights on. i have changed
 the oil every 3000, completly flushed brake fliud, changed all filters(oil,
 air and fuel, changed transmission and drive oils
 and done almost all of the other things req for service 1
 and a service 2. after nearly 6000 miles, i am still on 2 green lights.
 after a winter in burlington (and it is snowing today!!) that is not bad.
 
 good luck!
