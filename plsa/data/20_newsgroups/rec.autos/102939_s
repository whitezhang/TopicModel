 hello netters!
 
 i'm visiting the us (i'm from sweden) in august. i will probably rent a chevy
 beretta from alamo. i've been quoted $225 for a week/ $54 for additional days. 
 this would include free driving distance, but not local taxes (baltimore). 
 they also told me all insurance thats necessary is included, but i doubt that,
  'cause a friend rented a car last year and it turned out he needed a lot more
 insurance than what's included in the base price. but on the other hand he didn't
 rent it from alamo.
 
 does anyone have some info on this?
 
 is $225 a rip-off? 
 probability that i'll be needing more insurance?
 is the beretta a good rental car?
 
 thanx
 
 markus
