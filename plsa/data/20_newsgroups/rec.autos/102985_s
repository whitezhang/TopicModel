 i think vw got caught out on the airbag thing.  it's only been in the last
 year or two that airbags have become a significant selling feature.
 vw assumed that  automatic belts would satisfy govt. requirements for
 passive restraint, but didn't guess that the 'merican consumer would
 actually make buy decisions based on the presence of an airbag.
 
 vw is really hurting right now in the us market.  check out the
 article in last week's autoweek about the crisis at vw.  golfs and
 jettas will be coming from the plant in mexico, but they don't have
 the quality at that facility.  as per normal vw practice, the us
 launch of the jetta iii is delayed again and again, until a good chunk
 of the useful life of the design is spent.
 
 i think that passats come from germany, so there is not the same
 quality and availability issue.  it's a nice car with a nice engine.
 whether vw will be a player in the us market in two year's time is a
 different question...
 
 i'll leave the passat / camry flamewar for someone else.
