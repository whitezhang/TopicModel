 i am the original owner of the seats and the original poster. 
 i take very serious offence in your statement. 
 i see a lot of computers advertized on the net, and my friend just had been
 releived of his machine = all the net-computer ads are for stolen computers?
 where did you learn logic?
 
 as for the seats, they were replaced by a much harder (literally) celica gts
 seats due to my back problem. that is why i had to reuse the mr2 brackets
 and that's why the mr2 seats i sell are attached to celica brackets.
 
 please in the future think before you make allegations like the above.
 it hurts.
