 i have a 90 eagle talon and i wanted a pair of gts 
 headlight covers.  actually, they are turning signal
 covers since the talons that year had pop-up lights.
 i went to a auto shop and bought the tail-light 
 blackouts for $45, but they did not have the turning
 signal covers in stock.  i asked how much it would be
 and he told me it would cost me another $40.  i thought
 this was a bit high for two small pieces of plastic.
 can anyone find me a cheaper pair or even a used one?
