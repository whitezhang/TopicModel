 my honda has a cable release that can be locked out with the ignition key.
 the valet key can be left with someone and will not unlock the trunk
 or enable the cable release.
 
 i remember my mothers '86 corvette that had an electronic hatch release
 located on the drivers door, which was always active.  the fact that the
 car had no real trunk makes the security measure of beign able to 
 dis-able the hatch release unnecessary.
