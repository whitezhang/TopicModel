 just to clear things up (as to why i posted the question that way)...
 i was debating with a co-worker about diesels.  i claimed they were
 cleaner-burning than gas engines.  he said the extra "junk" put out by them
 was offset by the savings in greenhouse gasses.   i made all the same claims
 you did.  but, one question of his was what about the carbon?  i said it
 was harmless, but he wanted to know how to get rid of it.  i suggested
 scrubbers.  (i figured it would be no harder or more expensive to install
 than "cats".)  does there exist any designs for a scrubber?  (i'd like
 to know just to answer his final question.)  i convinced him that diesels
 are cleaner otherwise.
 
 btw, (i named my subject "dirty diesels" because i knew it would get a reaction
 out of people who knew they were cleaner than gas engines and that they'd
 read it...)
