 hi netters,
 
 my friend is seriously thinking of getting the subaru svx. there is
 a local dealer here in seattle selling them for $22600, with
 touring package, that's $7400 off from msrp. he thinks it's a 
 very good deal (and i think so too). since he knows i have access to
 the net, he would like to get anyone's opinion about this car, especially
 in the area of reliability and maintenanability.
 please send e-mail to me as my friend doesn't have access to the net.
 
 my opinion about this car is, you get a lot for $22600:
 auto everything (tranny, climate control, windows, locks, folddow rear seet),
 full wheel drive, 2+2, fast (143 top spped), heavy (3580lb);-)
 
 thanks in advacne!
