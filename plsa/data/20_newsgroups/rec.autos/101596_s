 your passat vr6 is designed to run on premium gasoline, however the
 engine electronics will retard the timing so that no harm wil be done
 to the engine with lower octane fuel.
 
 you will likely, however, get somewhat more power and fuel mileage
 (especially in hot weather) out of this particular engine if you do
 run it on premium.
