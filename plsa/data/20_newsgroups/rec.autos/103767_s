 w/r/t performance, converter lockup is purely irrelevant.  the lockup only
 occurs at light throttle settings and serves only to improve mpg.  mind you,
 a converter clutch does a lovely job of improving mpg, but the additional
 mechanical advantage of the converter gives you more acceleration (vs. locked
 converter clutch) than its inherent losses take away.
