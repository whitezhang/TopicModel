 perhaps a nice used '88 pontiac fiero gt?  2.8 liters.
 
 does anyone know if the motor mounts for the 2.8 and the twin-dual-cam 3.4
 liter match?  the 3.4 is supposedly derived from the pushrod 3.1, which was
 a punched out 2.8 liter.  should be a drop-in replacement, eh?  205 horses in
 a mid-engine the size of a fiero?
 
 larry smith (smith@ctron.com)  no, i don't speak for cabletron.  need you ask?
