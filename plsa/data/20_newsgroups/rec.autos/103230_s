 in general extended warranties are a ripoff.  this 6yr/60k is really only
 3yr/24k because you get the 3yr/36k one *free* with the car.  also, is there
 perhaps a deductible you pay each and every time you use the warranty?
 also, are certain items excluded from coverage on the extended warranty?
 and if you use it at year 4 for some 60 buck job and pay a 50 deduct and then
 you have used it so no refund ever!
 again, extended warranties are ripoff, high profit items for the dealer.
