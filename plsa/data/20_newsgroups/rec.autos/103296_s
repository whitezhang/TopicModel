 i'm wondering if anybody else out there is a clutchless shifter? i've been
 doing it my self over 200,000 miles, on my current toyota truck i've got
 over 150k. i've heard people talk about how doing this can damage a
 transmission. my experiences suggest otherwise. what techniques do you use?
 
 on some old pieces of junk i drove, the transmission was so
 worn that pumping the clutch was the only way to shift, except clutchless.
 to date i've driven rabbits, datsuns, comets, fords & a chevy. some where
 harder than others to shift but generally the higher the milage the smoother
 quicker & easier they where to shift.
 
 my technique is to ease back off the throttle and at the same time gently
 wrist back on the shift lever. if for some reason i miss the shift window,
 i lightly press the accelerator & try agian. i've found that clutchless
 shifting is eaiser/quicker at high rpms (4000-7000). i also skip gears some
 times using 1-3-5 ,1-2-4-5.
