 	several chemists already have come up with several substitutes for
 r12.  you don't hear about them because the mobile air conditioning society
 (macs), that is, the people who stand to rake in that $300 to $1000 per
 retrofit per automobile, have mounted an organized campaign to squash those
 r12 substitutes out of existence if not ban them altogether (on very shaky
 technical grounds, at best, on outright lies at worst).
 
 	does this piss you off?  yes?  write a letter to your congressman, to
 your senator, to the president, to the epa, and to the dot and complain.
 
 later,
