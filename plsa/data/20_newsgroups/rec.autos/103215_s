 i bought a set of are's a few months back and decided to add locks
 so that i could keep my new rims. i haven't had a balance problem 
 yet so i assume that it might be just particular to your type of
 stock nuts. my rims were balanced with new bfg t/a's at a speed 
 shop to the finest setting on their bal. machine, so that helps too.
