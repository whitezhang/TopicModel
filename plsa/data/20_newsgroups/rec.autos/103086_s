 this isn't anything new.  back in 1985 i was driving under a high
 overpass at night on i-805 in san diego when i caught a glimpse of
 someone on the overpass.  as i passed under a rock slammed against the
 metal between the winshield and right front window.  my girlfriend was
 in the seat next to it.  i called the police from the next exit, but i
 doubt if they were found.
 
 about five years ago in san diego someone was put into a coma from a
 brick being thrown through his sunroof as he was driving and
 subsequently crashed.  i don't think he ever came out of the coma, and i
 haven't heard anything about it for a couple years.

 probably because there are many children there.  also the minor fact
 that other than defending themselves from 100 some people attacking them
 they haven't threatened or attacked anyone outside the compound in
 years.  being a promiscuous religious nut does not constitute grounds
 for a mass murder of koresh and his followers.
 
 sorry for posting this to this group, but i thought the previous post
 needed a rebuttal.  if you follow-up to this portion please cross-post
 and direct follow-ups to a more appropriate newsgroup.
