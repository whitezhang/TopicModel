  my friend brought a subaru svx recently.  i had drove it for couples times and i
 think its a great car, esp on snow.  however when she took it to a local subaru
 dealer for a oil change, the bill came out to be about 80 dollars.  the dealer
 told us it is because to change the oil filter on a svx it is necessary to
 disassemble a metal cover under the engine and that took an hour of labour.
 at first, we think we are being ripped off so she phone to a dealer in toronto
 but found out the they are charging roughly the same price.  so is there any
 svx owner out there that has the same problem ?  and if the oil change story is
 true, then the engineer of subaru looks pretty stubid to me. by the way, the car
 looks great.
