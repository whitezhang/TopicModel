 i have no experience with state farm, but i think it's important to
 differentiate your experience from a typical "accident."
 
 hail damage is clearly not the fault of the owner, and also tends to
 be well publicized in the media, so it's to the ins. co.'s benefit
 to respond promptly and helpfully.  damage like this doesn't imply
 anything about the likelihood of future claims (unless you live in an
 area that gets frequent damaging hail storms), so there's no reason
 for them to stop covering you.
 that's a lot different from at-fault accidents or theft-related claims,
 which may be more indicative of claim patterns.
