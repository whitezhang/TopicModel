 rich,
 	first of all you might want to join the vettenet (vettes@chiller.compaq
 	.com)  during your search/acquisition of the 67.  $20k sounds about 
 	right for a wrong engine, condition 3 car.  this means that the car may
 	not have significant investment value but could be an excellent driver
 	and or hobby car.  you will also want to get a copy of the corvette
 	black book immediately.  don't leave home (to look at vettes) without it.
 	since you are contemplating spending >$20k, you might want to invest a
 	few hours in reading the "corvette buyer's guide" and purchase noland
 	adams' tape "how to buy a corvette."  the tape shows you how to check
 	for damage, etc..  there are many many factors that will affect the
 	value, road worthiness, and repair expense of your proposed 67.  the
 	list is much too long to go into here.  join the vettenet where
 	there are over 100 current corvette owners (many with 60s vintage
 	vettes) that are available to help you.  the pubs i mentioned above
 	are available from mid-america designs (800) 637-5533 and several
 	other corvette parts sources.  good luck!!!
