 i want to thank all the people that responded to my post
 a few weeks ago about buying an '86 chev nova with over
 100,000 mi.
 
 i decided to buy the car and have had it for about a month.
 i replaced the front brake pads and changed the oil.  so far
 no problems have surfaced.
 
 i received many suggestions and encouragement on this
 purchase and figured a late "thank you" was better than none.
 
 thanks to all!
 
 jim
