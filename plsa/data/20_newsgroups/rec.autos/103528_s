 vw and mercedes have tinkered with particulate traps.  also, vw
 uses a kind of turbocharger on their jetta ecodiesel that helps
 reduce particulates as well, although i don't know the
 mechanics of it.
 
 many diesel cars,busses, and trucks in europe are now being
 equipped with catalysts and traps in an effort to clean up
 diesel emissions, already well below legal limits anyway.
 
 it's a shame gm had to soil the diesel's reputation in
 passenger cars and prevent further resource devotion to
 research into making this outstandingly efficient engine even
 further ahead of gas engines in emissions.
