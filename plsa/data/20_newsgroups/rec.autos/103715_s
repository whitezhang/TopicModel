 they changed the lights and slope of the hood, along with the new
 grille.  otherwise, it is unchanged.
 
 interestingly, their lack of wood and lack of a grille was a big
 design statement... they tried to defy conventional wisdom and carve
 their own niche ... unfortunately, sales were only half those of the
 lexus and hence, they now join the pack.  i still wonder if much of
 the problem wasn't the slow start from the initial ad campaign.
 
 personally, i like the q without the grille.
