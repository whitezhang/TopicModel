 i'm considering switching to geico insurance, but have heard that
 they do not assign a specific agent for each policy or claim.  i was
 worried that this might be a real pain when you make a claim.  i have
 also heard that they try to get rid of you if you have an accident.
 
 i'm interestend in determining whether or not these things are true.
 has anyone out there with geico made a claim?  i'd be interested in
 hearing whether or not you were satisfied with the service and whether
 you then had trouble renewing your policy.
 
 i'm also interested in any good or bad stories about liberty mutual or
 state farm.
