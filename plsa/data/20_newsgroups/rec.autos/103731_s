 not only the sonett (correct spelling), but the 95 wagon and 96 sedan
 used a 1500 cc or 1700 cc v-4 from ford of germany.  this particular
 motor had a 60 degree vee angle, a balance shaft and siamesed exhaust
 ports.  this motor was later stretched into the v-6 commonly seen in the
 capri.
 
 the v-4 could make pretty reasonable power for its size.  but in the
 saab, it made too much torque for the transmission, which had been
 designed for a 3-cylinder 2-stroke.
