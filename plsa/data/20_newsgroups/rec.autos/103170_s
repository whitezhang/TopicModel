 ok.  i can agree to this, because, as we have both proved, what is ideally
 supposed to happen, isn't always.  and even though i'm rearely the one doing
 the passing, i don't see where it makes you stupid, but i agree, that if you 
 think you are safe, because the other guy is supposed to have been paying 
 attention, then yes, you are just as dumb as the other(maybe dumber?)
