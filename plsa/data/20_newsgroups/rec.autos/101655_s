 not exactly dumb, but who remebers the tachometer on the 69 or 70 firebird 
 bulging out of the _hood_ right in front of the driver. neat place but i love 
 to know what the elemnts did to its internals after a few years. also, does 
 the speedomete pointer on many us cars have to be 3 feet long?.
