 it depends on your priorities.  a lot of people put higher priorities
 on gas mileage and cost than on safety, buying "unsafe" econoboxes
 instead of volvos.  i personally take a middle ground -- the only
 thing i really look for is a three-point seatbelt and 5+mph bumpers.
 i figure that 30mph collisions into brick walls aren't common enough
 for me to spend that much extra money for protection, but there are
 lots of low-speed collisions that do worry me.
