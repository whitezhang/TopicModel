 driven very little and stored inside since then - mostly collected dirt &
 dust.  needs attention to brake cylinders (like all mg-t's) but otherwise
 ready to run.  chrome & paint not fancy but it is mechanically excellent.
 the engine, a 1250cc, was completely overhauled by a machine shop.  it is
 priced at $12,000.
 
 1953 mg-td good shape but hasn't been run since '70's.  needs engine work,
 but no rust and everything is with it including a top, side curtains and
 carpet that were new and haven't seen the outdoors since the '70's. $9,500.
 
 1952 mg-td basket case.  i'd call it a parts car, but it's too good
 for that.  everything seems to be there except the tach.  would make
 a good project car or parts car if you insist.  no apparent rust but the
 upholstery is a disaster.  stored inside since the '70's.  the top was
 new but now soso.  this one has wire wheels!  looking for $4,500.
 
 all three cars will be sold "as they stand" with no hassles or haggles.
 time has passed by and it is time to part company.  prices are negotiable.
