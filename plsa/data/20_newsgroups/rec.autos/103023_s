 
 thanks to everyone who responded to my honda accord break question.
 it does seem that the master cylinder is bad. i will have my
 mechanic double check and be sure it isn't something simpler
 and cheaper first, but from your responses it sounds like it
 is very likely to be the master cylinder.
 
 thanks everyone!!
