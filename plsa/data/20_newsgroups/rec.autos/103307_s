 hi folks,
 
 i recently bought a 1981 mercury capri (my first car ever!).
 i have noticed a few problems with the car :
 
 	1. it gives very low gas mileage (something like
            11 miles / gallon ; i hear other car owners speak of
            gas-mileage figures like 25 miles/gallon (wow!) etc.).
 
 	2. when i start the car, it goes into high idling (something
            like 1500 (or is it 15000 ?) rpm. after driving 4 or 5 miles, 
            it comes down to 300 (or 3000?) rpm. 
 
 i would like to know if there is any way by which i can fix these
 problems. or is it natural for an old car like this ? (it has
 done about 117,000 miles). someone suggested that i change/rebuild/
 recondition the carburettor. i am not prepared to do it
 unless i am sure it will fix the problem. and yes, i got the
 car tuned-up recently (within the last 200 miles or so).
 
 please let me know if you have any suggestions. please respond
 by email since i don't scan this newsgroup regularly.
 
 thanks.
 
 regards,
 
 --sudhi.
