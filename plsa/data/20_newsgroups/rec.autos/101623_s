 
   any truth to the rumor of an awd 3-series for '94?  i believe
 this info was published in either popular science or autoweek
 a couple of months ago.
 
   also, a friend told me that bmw used to make an awd 325 called
 the 325ix.  i'd appreciate any info about this car too.  thanks..
 
   thanks.
