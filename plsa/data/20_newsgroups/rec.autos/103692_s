 does anyone have any info on the new 4 valve per cylinder diesels mercedes
 is working on?  any specs on outputs, engine size, will they be direct or 
 indirect injection?,  etc. would be welcome.  from what i hear these should 
 be out late this year, next year??
 
 thank you in advance for your replies!
