 while previous volvos have been essentially very fast tractors, the 3,4 and 8 series
 are far from 'agricultural' in design or execution (how many fwd tractors have you 
 seen?).

 you state this like it is a bad thing.  :^)  (remember, car companies use
 ad agencies - they don't do their own ads!)

 is this true?  i know that they had done joint ventures with renault, but i haven't
 heard about their subsumption into renault - does this mean that the french government
 now owns volvo?  - anyway, renault makes some very nice cars, they just don't sell
