 why don't you look again at motor trend's, slalom times, they are 67.9, right
 along with the integra, and the car does that with small 14 inch tires that
 are all -weather xgtv4, not to mention that the integra rides alot better than
 a beretta.
 your acceleartion times also vary, magazine to magazine
 road & track and car& driver have the gs-r at 6.8 to 8.0 for road and track.
 also quarter mile times vary from 15.4 to 16.1
 you can't tell exactly by the numbers.  furthermore, the integra will
 definately outrun the beretta on the high end.  car & driver and road & track
 have the gs-r doing 136 to 141 mph, and it gets there fast.

 ***you always believe those exact numbers, why don't you drive a gs-r, and see
 for your self, while the gs-r has a low 117 torqye, its high gearing over a 8000
 rpm make up for the difference (still wouldn't call it a torque moster though!)

 quad 4 reliable, yeah, what's your definition of reliable- if that's reliable,
 then its safe to say that integra engines in general are near perfect
  (not to mention, a hell of alot smoother and quieter - balance shafts.the acura has the engine
    wins the reliablity contest hands down. you can rev that car all day, everyday,
 and you'll never blow a hose, or crack the block, or anything else. (i speak
 from expierence!)
 i'm not saying the quad 4 is a bad engine, but don't highlight reliability when you
 comparing it to a acura engine.  and while the integra costs alot more, it is a
 better investment since it will hold its value considerably much better.  and
 does a nice job at being a sporty car and practical at the same time.
 
 note: this isn't a flame on the gtz, or other gm quad 4 products.  the berreta
 is a nice car, and puts out respectable performance and a very reasonable
 price not to mention, it has an airbag.  but to start quoting figures from one
 source, isn't too reliable.  read other sources, and drive both cars.  while i
 haven't driven a gtz, i have driven gts, and grand ams with quad 4 engines,
 (so they are similair.)
