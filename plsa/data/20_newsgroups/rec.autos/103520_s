 the new cruisers do not have independent suspension in the front.  they
 still
 run a straight axle, but with coils.  the 4runner is the one with
 independent
 front.  the cruisers have incredible wheel travel with this system.

 the 91-up cruiser does have full time 4wd, but the center diff locks in
 low range.  my brother has a 91 and is an incredibly sturdy vehicle which
 has done all the 4+ trails in moab without a tow.  the 93 and later is even
 better with the bigger engine and locking diffs.
