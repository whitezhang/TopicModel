 lack of build quality was the thing  i notced on the first 2 lh's i
 saw months back. the panel gaps were large and non-uniform between
 the 2 cars i saw - the kind of thing you expect and accept on a
 mustang - but not from chrysler's savior.  i drove one of the low
 end cars, and thought it was more than adequate. i'd prefer
 an lh to a taurus from my brief experience.
