 i'm about to buy a new car and finance some of it.  since i paid
 cash for the last car i bought i did not have to worry about
 whether or not i had a good amount of insurance on it because
 of a bank loan.  i just put the amount that i wanted (not what
 a bank would have wanted).  friends are telling me that banks
 require some kind of insurance on the car to protect it since it
 is collateral on loans.  is this true?  can that insurance be
 gotten as part of my other insurance?  i assume i don't have to
 pay a dealer for extra insurance over my regular car insurance.
 am i correct?  i hear about accident/health type insurance at
 the dealers and i am pretty sure these are just money makers
 for them.  i just want to verify that i don't _have_ to buy
 these at all.  or any other types of extras.
 
 what do i have to pay for?  car, tax, license.  anything else?
