 i sold my '86 sprint last april with 95k on it.  i'd driven it since
 the previous july, putting 20k miles on it.  the sensor light used to
 light up regularly, starting about 5k miles after i bought it.  
 my brother and i rebuilt the engine but used all of the original equipment,
 so i suppose the sensor could have used replacement.  performance (hah,
 if you could call it that) did not change.  perhaps emissions increased,
 but how much emissions could a ca-registered 3 cylinder engine produce?
 that was a neat car, i held the engine block easily in one hand!  has
 anyone ever driven the 'turbo' variant?  just curious...
