 just a quick note on the nwe shape mr2s in the uk.... 
 
 when they first came out here, there were 3 models. the base model had an 
 auto box and engine from the camry 2.0 !!! well i recentyl found out that this 
 model is no longer profitable for toyota and have since scraped it. i've also
 noticed that auto mr2s have depreciated a lot more than the next model up...
 
 surprise surprise huh? oh.... you lucky americans have the turbo mr2 :-(
 no such luck over here :-(
 						....shaz...
