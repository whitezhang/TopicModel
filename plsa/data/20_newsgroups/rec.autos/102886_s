 but, those chips are probably inside a custom chip, (to make it smaller and
 use less power) and the preset/data pins are not going to be available.
 it would probably not be ttl but might be cmos 
 (wider operating voltage range), not that the tecnology would make 
 much difference.
 plus the custom chip would probably be potted (encapsulated with epoxy).
 good luck.
