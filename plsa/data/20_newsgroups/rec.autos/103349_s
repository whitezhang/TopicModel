 i have had my probe looked at twice by my local dealer (where i purchased
 the car) ... the first time, they made this problem worse.  the second time,
 after advising them of the service bulletin mentioned on my ford-probe mailing
 list (they said they didn't know of the bulletin), they adjusted the window and
 made it *much* better.  however it now makes a "scritch scritch" noise on rough
 roads, and *still* squeals when i open/close the window in wet weather (anyone
 elses's do this?)
 
 >>ford only gives 1 key with the car.  c'mon ford, spend an extra few pennies!
 
 i got two keys with my car, but only one remote-entry push-button thingie!
 but then, i bought my 93 with 2500 miles, and  i think it may have been a
 repossession ... so i'm not surprised something was missing :-(
 
 >>horn buttons behind air bag in spokes and not in center (personal preference)
 
 i am seriously considering following the advice in the owners manual where
 it describes the procedure to follow if "you discover something on your ford
 that could ... cause ... serious injury ... threaten lives ... etc).  something
 about notifying the national traffic safety group as well as ford.  those little
 "you've-got-to-position-the-fingers-perfectly-to-make-it-beep" buttons are
 terrible.

 well, i guess that's good in a way, but in a way it's bad.  when someone
 hears that kind of horn, they expect to see a big american car.  they may
 not associate the sound with a small "jap car" style car (like the probe is).
 
 >>tires fling dirt/mud onto side of car 
 >yeah, not very badly, but enough to be annoying sometimes.
 
 the mudflaps help a lot.
 
 >>transmission (the 5 speed is a must)
 
 i have always been a 5-speed guy.  almost every car i've ever owned has been
 a 5-speed.  because i got a good deal on this car with the 2500 miles, i
 (knowingly) overlooked the fact that it has an automatic.  but it is a pretty
 high-tech automatic.  it is a fully electronicaly controlled 4-speed with
 torque converter lockup.  even with the automatic, i'm getting 35 mpg on the
 highway, driving 65-70!.    (but of course driving > 65 is illegal, so i 
 probably made that sentence up).  :-)     around town the mileage has been
 around 25-27, not bad for an automatic.   of course it doesn't have the
 "control" of a 5-speed, but since i do a lot of city driving, it turns out
 to be very convenient.  it's nice to be able to drink a cup of coffee and
 drive at the same time (although that, too, is illegal here in 
 "we-like-to-control-your-life massachusetts" :-)
 
 
 >>no shake/rattle noises when going over bumps/potholes (still!)
 
 shakes and rattles has been my main gripe.  i've gotten them to fix the
 worst of them, but i fear that with the rather harsh ride, the car will
 be a virtual potpouri of rattles when it gets older.
 
 >>tires: 225/55vr16 goodyear eagles (70% left; hoping for 30k :-)
 
 on my 89 probe gl, i got about 40k out of the original goodyears,
 and had driven the replacement tires (bridgestone) 50k miles when
 i tradeed the car.  the 195/65(60?)vr14 firestones on my 93 probe
 look like they're designed for performance (ie rather wide, shallow
 tread, etc), so they probably won't last as long.  but the car handles
 very very very well.  it sticks to the road like glue, even on a rough
 surface.
 
 >interior is very, very nice too.  very pleasing to the eye, and ergonomically
 >sound.
 
 definitely.  ford/mazda did a very very nice job on this one.  the
 car has a "much more expensive than it actually is" look and feel to it.

 having driven an 89 probe for 4 years, i find the 93 suspension "interesting".
 the car actually drives much better than the 89 ... it is a very firm
 ride, and you definitely know about each and every bump in the road.  yet
 the car remains very civilized on even the bumpiest roads.  you hear and
 feel the bumps, yet the car retains its posture very well.
 
 >>if you have 3+ passengers, by all means bring them along too.  they'll find

 >>differently (if that's "better" is up to you).  
 
 well i wouldn't encourage passenger-carrying in the probe unless the
 person in the front seat likes to sit with his knees to the dash.  as
 mentioned in the consumer reports write-ups, "consider the back seat
 as a parcel shelf".  no biggie to me though (if it had been, i'd not
 have bought the car!  (but it's definitely not a family car)).
 
 >>also, there's a lot of glass

 a/c is a must on any probe from 89 - 93.  the 93 in particular sends out
 a real blast of cool air when the ac is on max.  that "lots of glass" you
 mentioned is what gives the car the "very good visibility" reports you
 see in all the write-ups.  most "sports/sporty" cars don't have that
 good visibility.

 the complaints i've heard re: exhaust system (on 93's) have been on 
 the gt.  of course being a different engine, that is a differeent 
 exhaust system.
 
 i was one of those with an 89 who qualified for the free replacement.
 since i had already replaced the muffler when i received the notice, 
 i was/am due a refund from ford.  i applied in february and am still
 waiting.   :-(

 yes.  i was pretty amazed when i had my car in for some touch-up
 adjustments this past week, and they had to keep it overnight (too busy
 for them to get to it) and they offered to pay for a rental).  they 
 did make me pay for taxes and insurance though :-(

 i have to agree that they seem to have some qc problesm.  but i seriously
 feel the car design is sound, and expect it to do very well.
