 ok, here's what i understand:
 
 the sl/sl1/sl2/sw1/sw2 was meant to compete with the following cars:
 
 honda civic
 toyota tercel (sl,sl1)
 toyota corolla (sl1,sl2)
 nissan sentra
 mazda 323/protoge'
 subaru loyale/impreza
 isuzu stylus
 geo prizm
 ford escort
 mercury tracer
 mistubishi mirage
 plymouth/dodge colt
 
 
 their core competition is the civic, corolla, and sentra.  most of the other
 models are in the same class, but aren't the first cars you would think of.
 i threw in the escort/tracer because it has a good amount of japanese
 technology and has similar reliability stats.  i didn't include domestic small
 cars such as the cavalier, sunbird, shadow, sundance, tempo, and topaz, since i
 think saturn is going after cars that have at least some degree of japanese
 roots.
 
 the sc1/sc2 was meant to compete against the following cars:
 
 toyota paseo
 honda civic si/civic coupes/del sol si
 nissan nx1600/nx2000
 mazda mx-3
 isuzu impulse
 geo storm
 ford escort gt
 
 
 if you look at the prices of these cars, they're more expensive than they're
 4-door counterparts.  the is good reason for this.  it is a more upscale and
 trend-driven market.  even though many of these models are based on sedan
 platforms, their interior, etc. is good enough to warrant slightly higher
 prices.  here are some of the platform derivations i can think of:
 
 tercel -> paseo
 sentra -> nx1600/nx2000
 civic -> del sol
 323 -> mx-3 (not sure on this one)
 stylus -> impulse/storm
 
 to illustrate, a tercel starts at around $8000, while the paseo starts at
 around $11,000.  even a 4-door tercel will cost less than a 2-door paseo.  now,
 you might be saying that the tercel doesn't offer the power that some 4-doors
 offer.  what i mean is that there is no 4-dr tercel with a comparable
 powerplant as its sport coupe derivative.  let's take another example: the
 isuzu stylus xs and impulse xs/storm gsi.  both have the same powerplants (a
 1.6l 140hp engine), but the smaller 2-dr coupes are generally more expensive.
 again, this is because the two-door sport coupe market is a more
 fashion-oriented and trend-setting segment.  people are willing to pay more
 money for this type of car.  
 
 
 in short, even though the sc1/sc2 may be smaller, hence "less" car, it's market
 orientation dictates a slightly higher price than its mechanically equivalent
 sedan (sl1/sl2) version.
 
 i hope this clears things up a bit......
