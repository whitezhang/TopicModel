 the car magazines have printed a lot of information about the new mustang
 and the consensus about what to believe in my "car circle" is that the 
 suspension pieces and tuning will be almost identical to the current
 cobra, but on a stiffer body structure which will improve its behavior.
 after the mn12 (thunderbird) cost and weight debacle, ford decided 
 independent rear suspension with rear wheel drive won't be tried again in 
 a volume car.  
 
 the current 4.9l v-8 will soldier on for about two years.  a version of
 the 32 valve modular v-8 in the mark viii could be offered then.  ford
 is spending big money tooling up for 2.5l and 3.5l v-6 engines which will
 power most of their cars in the immediate future, and therefore probably
 do not consider volume production of 300 hp v-8 engines a priority. 
 
 undisguised, the car looks ok, but not nearly as exciting as the new
 camaro/firebird, imo.  
 
 i suspect ford will produce their car with higher quality than gm will 
 achieve with the camaro/ firebird.  the way gm loses money, the temptation
 to "just get them out the door" for the sake of positive cash flow will be 
 great once demand really takes off.
