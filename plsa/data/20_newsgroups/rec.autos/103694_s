    before the s4 became the s4 it was called the 200 turbo quattro 20v.
    this model did come in a wagon, a very quick wagon.  very rare also.

 being a satisfied audi owner (-90 100 turbo quattro. my 4:th audi) i
 get the free vag magazine. the latest issue presented a new s4 avant
 (wagon) with a 4.2 litre v8. i'd like one of these ;-)
 
 btw, this is my second quattro and my third turbo and i must say that
 even in the summer, with dry roads, the quattros give so much extra in
 road holding and balance that i hope i can afford them always.
