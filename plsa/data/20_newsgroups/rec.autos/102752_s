 yes, but then someone would have no problem draining your oil in a parking lot.
 
 all they have to do is reach underneath, turn a valve, and forget the trip 
 home.
 but there is less likelyhood they have a wrench with them.
 
 i personally recommend, installing a 'special' locking drain plug to keep
 vandals away. :---)
