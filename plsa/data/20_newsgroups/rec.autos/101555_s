 that my be, but every volvo i've ever owned has lasted far longer than most
 other cars.....
 1981 volvo 245....125,000 miles, still on the road.
 1983 volvo 242....195,000 miles, still on the road.
 1984 volvo 244....175,000 miles, still on the road.
 and i'll admit, the dealer repair cost is high. but with some mechanical
 aptitude of your own, and finding a good indi mechanic, you can avoid most
 breakdowns, and make the rest cheap(the sum total of the repairs on the car with
 195,000 miles has been 2 mufflers and a radiator. whoa. bad repair record). 
 and all of these cars are driven fairly hard. none of them are at the head of
 a line of cars going 30 mph....the first two spend a lot of their operating
 life with the speedometer pegged...and the only reason the 84 doesn't is it has
 a 120 mph speedo...
 what i want to know is....have all you people who hate volvos been traumatized
 by someone in a 745 turbo wagon blowing you away on the road, or what?
