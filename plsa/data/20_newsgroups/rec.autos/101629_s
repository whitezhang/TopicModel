 i understand caddy is working on one, double battery, super high perf
 engine, more gauges, a bit 'stretched', etc, lots of communication equipment,
 the works. color selection is limited though. 
 
 the problem is that the guy at 1600 penn. avenue is about to get it
 (pres. clinton) (last time it was a lincoln, this time a caddy).

 not to my knowledge; i know gm does conversion work for things like 
 hot climates (i.e. the chevy caprices sold to the middle east) but 
 things like that are always done by third parties, not the manufacturer.
 maybe you will need to buy a specific package that has beefed-up everything,
 perhaps the police cruiser package on the caprice/crown vic and start from
 there.

 "and i wuz drivin' along in my armored seville sts and this punk pulls out
 of nowhere with an rpg (rocket propelled grenade) but the bulletproof
 windshield stopped him" :-) don't think many people on the net have a need
 for bulletproof cars. 
 
 check with local armored service companies/security/bodyguard places. they'd
 know best. i think your average luxury car dealer will have a coronary if
 you told them "i'll take the blue caprice, with options fz01 (fuzzy dice),
 pr11 (power everything), and ar007 (armor).

 i believe an article on the conversion process appeared in the car press within
 the last few months.
