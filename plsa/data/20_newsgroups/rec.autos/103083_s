 i    of course car safety is important.. i for one used to think that these 
 guys are going way ott with their airtbags (sorry del button dont work) and 
 side impact bars and crash zones and (the list goes on) just tpo make the 
 car heavbier (and all its penalties) ... bur recently i had a little accident (on
 my bike) and not as bad as john's ..... but after the accident - it made me 
 realizer i should have worn a helmet (my mom always insistede i should... i was
 more concerned about my hair style).....
 
 a few days agi - i read a report in which the old rea.. rea shit - renault 5
 had an accident and its roof caved inwards and crushed the occupents heads...
