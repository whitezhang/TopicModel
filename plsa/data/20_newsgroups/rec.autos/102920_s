 perhaps instead of this silly argument about what backup lights
 are for, couldn't we agree that they serve the dual purpose of
 letting people behind your car know that you have it in reverse
 and that they can also light up the area behind your car while
 you're backing up so you can see?
 
 backup lamps on current models are much brighter than they used
 to be on older cars. those on my taurus wagon are quite bright
 enough to illuminate a good area behind the car, and they're 
 much brighter than those on my earlier cars from the 60s and 70s. 
 
 insofar as vettes having side backup lights, look at a '92 or '93
 model (or perhaps a year or two earlier too) and you'll see
 red side marker lamps and white side marker lamps both near the
 car's hindquarters.  those aren't just white reflectors.
