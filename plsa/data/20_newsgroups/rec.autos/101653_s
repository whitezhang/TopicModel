 brake rotors and the clutch are the main things.  there has been a clutch 
 replacement program; you might check to see if the car is still eligible, 
 as it is a change well worth making.  you can also swap the cruddy cable 
 shifter for the newer rod shifter, also a change worth making, but that'll 
 cost you some $$.
 
 my brakes usually do one wibble-wobble on startup, so that is probably 
 normal.  didn't know they had a self-test, that's interesting.
 
 what kind of tires does the car have on it?
