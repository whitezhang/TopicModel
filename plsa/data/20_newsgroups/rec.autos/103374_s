 does anybody have any information on the second generation broncos? (i'm
 not talking about bronco ii's, i'm referring to the broncos that began
 production in 1978 based on the f-150 chassis i believe)
 
 i need to know what to look for, can the tops be removed from all
 models, how easily can that be done. also, what kind of price range
 should i be looking at? (i.e. what is blue book) i'm in college right
 now, and would like a jeep. unfortunately, i've got a bit of a ride to
 school, and i need to carry a lot of junk to and from the dormitory in
 the spring/fall. i think that the bronco (with the removable fiberglass)
 would be a better (read "bigger") choice than a cj-5 or cj-7.
 
 even better: anybody in the maryland/virginia area interested in selling
 one?
