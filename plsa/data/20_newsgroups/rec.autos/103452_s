 there is a tool available to reset the service indicator on bmws but the lights
 will come back on after 2-3 weeks. the tool is in fact illegal (in europe 
 atleast). it is often the case that the unsuspecting punter trots off to buy a 
 used bmw and a few weeks later, all the lights come on! other than that, i know 
 of no other tool.... anyone else? 
 
 about changing oil every 15,000 miles.... thats ok.... on newer audis, they 
 only require it after every 12,000 miles (i am talking about an oil change)
 just a query: do you drive your car very very carefully? like no sudden 
 acceleration etc? if yeah, then the 15,000 m oil change seems quite reasonable.
 but if you drive kinda fast... i'd get a bit up tight abot that 15,000 thingy
 
 (a point to note: just because the first light came on at 3k, doesn't mean
 all the others will come on every 3k too)
