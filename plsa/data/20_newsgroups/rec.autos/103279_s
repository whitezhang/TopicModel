 the event:
 
 * the joliet mud turtles, a chicago land four wheel drive club, is
   sponsoring an on/off road rally sunday april 25th.
 
 * for those who ask "what is an on/off road rally?", well...
 
   an on/off road rally consists of the following:
 
    1. an on-the-road rally where participants are given a set of
       directions and clues guiding participates around the 
       joliet/plainfield area.  the object is to navigate a course
       based on a set of directions and clues.  participants will
       be given a set of questions pertaining to the course which
       they must answer along the way.  points are awarded for the
       number of correct answers given.  directions will ultimately 
       lead to an off-road area where a four-wheel drive course is 
       set-up.  at various locations in the on-road course, check-points
       will be set-up where participants will be asked other questions
       or requested to perform some activity (e.g. tire roll, truck tow,
       basketball free-throw, etc.) for additional points.
 
    2. an optional off-road, four wheel drive course where participants
       will navigate off-road trails, mud bogs and/or hill climbs.
       points are awarded for successfully navigating off-road obstacles
       without getting stuck.  if you should get stuck (which is half
       the fun anyway), there will be assistance to get your vehicle
       unstuck so you can try it again.  the off-road course will
       divided up based on tire size, so stock 4x4s as well as modified
       4x4s can run the course.
      
   at the end of the rally, trophies will be awarded to top scoring
   participants.  door prizes and dash plaques will also be given out.
   food and drinks also available at the conclusion.
 
 * this is an organized activity sponsored by the joliet mud turtles
   so safety and fun is our foremost concern.  all 4x4s must be
   street legal and have solid tow points for the off-road section
   of the course - we don't want to have to separate someone's bumper
   from their vehicle :) .
