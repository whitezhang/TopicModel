 you raise a valid point, but again it's a tradeoff -- how much money
 do you want to spend for that kind of protection?  you could buy a
 volvo, saab, or 'benz and get really good crash protection (and other
 luxuries) but you'll pay significantly more for it.  in my case it's
 out of the question because *all* of those cars are beyond my budget.
 
 even in high-speed head-on collisions the most beneficial item you can
 have is a good old 3-point seatbelt.  nowadays, at least in the us,
 you get an airbag if you get a 3-point belt so (presumably) you get an
 added safety benefit there as well.  that's something i certainly look
 for and which can be had in inexpensive cars.
 
 my $.02, of course.
