 gee.... is it 1999 already?
 
 yes, it will still be on the fox program chasis, anything that will be different
 on the new car as far as mechanical's is unknown. the suspension will most
 likely be changed, as well as the drive drain. from what has been printed on
 it, there is no clear idea of what will be done, as some say it will have
 the modular v8 and others the current small block... just have to wait and see
 also is far as styling goes from what i seen is good, a return to tradition.
 c scoop on the sides and roof line much like a '65 or '66 fastback.
