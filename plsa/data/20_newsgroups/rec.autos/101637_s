 land crusier is just simply nice with shit-load of power and room.
 fully stocked, it cost ~$40,000.  i think it is worth the money.
 only problem is when you get into accident(it doesn't usually break down
 unless you forget to get a oil change for 30000 miles or something
 stupid like this), body parts and other parts are very hard to locate. 
 parts are over priced also.  one of my friend had accident in past snow
 storm and he is still waiting for front bumper and passenger side fender.
 
 well, if you test drive land cruiser, all other suv look like toys.
 one of magazine writer called it "land bruiser".  
 
 if you have $40,000 to spare for suv, get land cruiser and forget lange rover.
