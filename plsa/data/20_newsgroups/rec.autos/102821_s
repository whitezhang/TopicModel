 buick co. when durant was there.
 
 when the directors kicked durant out of gm in 1910 he took chevrolet and
 others with him.  as mentioned before, they founded the successful
 chevrolet company.
 
 a little-known fact is that the chevrolet co. actually took over gm!
 that was how durant got back in charge of gm-- legally his new company
 chevrolet co. did the buying, and gm was a division of chevrolet!
 
 after 1920 and into the sloan era, gm shuffled things so that the gm
 board was superior, but there was always a degree of autonomy given
 the chevy division, presumably because of the initial structure.
 (if you look at the organization chart for gm in sloan's book, chevy
 division reports directly to 14th floor, not through the "passenger
 car division" which covers buick, olds, cadillac, and oakland/pontiac)
