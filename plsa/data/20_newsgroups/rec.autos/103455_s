 for the information of those not "lucky" enough to live in the city of
 austin, tx, if an auto a/c system is checked and found to have leaks,
 it must be repaired at that time, or evacuated.  this is an ordinance
 unique (i think) to the city of austin.
 
 freon is subject to increasing taxes, but $12 is about 2x cost here.
 recovered freon is not required to be "purchased" from the car it is
 withdrawn from.  as a matter of practice, some shops here are charging 
 a recycling fee that is less than the cost of the freon removed if it 
 is reintroduced to the system.
 
 just another quality service from an _enviornmentally conscious_ city.
