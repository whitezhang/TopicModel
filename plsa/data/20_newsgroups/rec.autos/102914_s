 if i hear someone screwing with my car (ie, setting off the alarm) and
 taunting me to come out, you can be damn sure that my colt delta elite
 will also be coming with me. it's not the screwing with the car that'd
 get them shot, it's the potential physical danger. if they're
 taunting like that, it's very possible that they also intend to rob
 me and/or do other physically harmful things.
 
 if they're just screwing around, no harm done. if they're bent on
 mayhem, they will receive the cure for their lead deficiency; a
 180gr. injection @1200 fps...there's no telling what today's violent
 criminals will do. death may be the most pleasant outcome...
