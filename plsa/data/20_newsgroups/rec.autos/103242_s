 i find this method much better myself, too, although i do really
 hate it when the bolt finally comes loose and the wrench and my
 hand both come crashing into my face.  after coming to, which is
 about 15 minutes later, i change my clothes (because by this time
 all the oil has drained *on* me), and ice my entire face and suck
 down about 20 tylenol to ease the pain.  later in the day i then
 proceed with refilling the engine oil.
 
 it's just crazy how i try and change the oil on my cars in one
 weekend---i go through about 3 bottles of tylenol and 2 bags of ice.
