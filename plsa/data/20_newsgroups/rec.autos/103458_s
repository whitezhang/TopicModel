 i have been having problems with a slightly different clutch problem on
 my 90 prelude. see rec.autos.tech for more detail. my problem is a false
 engagement point below the actual one. it also seems affected by weather -
 it is most noticeable (and annoying) on damp or cold days. my dealer says
 he can't reproduce the problem - i think i'll just sell the car.
