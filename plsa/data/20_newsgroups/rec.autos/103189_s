 the big win with the v-1 is not its range but rather its
 directionality and multiple-transmitter tracking (which you later
 called a "gimmick" -- a conclusion i disagree with).  since the
 detector incorporates multiple receivers it's not surprising that it's
 significantly more expensive.  while the added capabilities may not
 help you, there is added value for those of us who live in areas where
 there are a lot of false-alarms.

 i certainly call it "interesting" but i'm another person who thinks
 that the added value might be coming at too high a cost.  very
 adequate radar detectors are available for less than half the cost and
 one of them has suited me rather well.  if i did more long-distance
 travelling in areas i'm not familiar with i'd probably consider
 getting the v-1 because it's additional information would be useful in
 discriminating false alarms.
