 
 i had exactly the same problem with a 1981 horizon.  third gear would
 just disengage.  engine would rev up.  kind of disconcerting.
 
 i sold that car quite a few years back but the memory of that tranny
 sticks with me.  it also had a clutch chatter in first that the dealer
 could not fix.  if the lemon law had been in place then, that car
 would have been covered.
 
 i have had several jap cars since then (figuring the horizon was my
 contribution to the american auto companies), and have never seen any
 bad behavior with the exception of a toyota tercel with a bit of
 clutch chatter that they did fix on the first try.
 
 anyway, from that day forward, i have sworn that i would never
 purchase another american car with a standard.  american manufacturers
 don't have a clue on how to manufacture five speed transmissions and
 have been doing the automatics much longer and on many more cars.
 however, i hate automatics, so i am still buying jap cars.
 
 not sure this is any help, but other cars do this too.
 
 cheers, larry
