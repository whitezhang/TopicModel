 who cares about typos of these meaningless, synthetic names?  if the
 cars were named after a person, e.g. honda, i'd be more respectful.

 wrong!  the gs300 and sc300 use straight sixes, while the es300 uses a
 v6.  only a giant like toyota can afford to have both a v6 and inline
 6 in its lineup, but that won't last for long.
