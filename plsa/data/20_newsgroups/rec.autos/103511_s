 an aquaintence has a 87 accord.  the driver's side headrest was
 accidentally put in backwards and has jammed.  according to the
 dealer, the only way to get it out is to spend several hours
 disassembling the seat.  this is the second time i have heard of this
 happening, and i wonder whether there's an easier way to get the
 headrest back out.  has anyone else ever dealt with this problem?
 your advice would be appreciated!
 
 please email, and i will summarize if there is interest.
