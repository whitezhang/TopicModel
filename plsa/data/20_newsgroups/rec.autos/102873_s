 the quality of autobahns is something of a myth. the road surface
 isn't much different to a typical tx freeway. they are better
 in terms of lighting, safety, signs, roadmarkings etc. i'd have
 no problem driving 130 on most us freeways, as it is, i save it
 for the backroads, which really are more likely to be dangerous.

 it would have to be quite severe. i don't recall any us freeway,
 without road damage warnings, that i would regard as unsafe
 at 130 in any decent, well damped car. note that my definition
 of decent, well damped, would exclude most typical american sedans.

 i don't know where you live, but i would be much more worried
 about cops, other traffic etc. than the road surface at 130.
 it just isn't that fast or that dangerous. if you have a probe
 gt, no problem. the 4cyl models i have driven would be
 likely to be unpredictable at higher speeds.
