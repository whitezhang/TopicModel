 however, if you agree some terms, and then, when about to sign, the
 dealer slips you a contract with different terms, and leads you to
 believe that it embodies the terms you verbally agreed to, that
 is fraud.  there is no 3 day limit on restitution for fraud.
 
 you may have to sue (and win) to get out of this.  you will almost
 certainly have to threaten to sue.
