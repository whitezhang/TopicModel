 actually, i've had a bad habit of stuffing a whole bunch of other garbage
 junk mail in along with whatever else into *anybody's* prepaid envelopes
 until they almost burst.  i believe they pay postage by weight.
 heh, heh, heh...
 
 anyways, don't tear up the quotes just yet...i sometimes use their
 quotes or other insurance quotations as leverage to haggle for a
 lower rate elsewhere.  usually it works to *your* advantage if 
 they are lower.
