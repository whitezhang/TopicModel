 i think this is getting a little overheated.  highway robbers have been a
 part of life since the middle ages at least.  it's human nature to look
 at history through rose colored glasses, but random acts of violence have
 been a ceaseless part of our heritage.  overall, life is better now than it
 ever was then.  it's just that random individual acts of violence have
 never
 been historically significant, and record keeping in the past was never
 good
 enough to retain them all.
