 a couple of months ago i went to a dealership to test drive a car.  afterwards,
 we sat down to discuss prices.  i explained that i wanted a car just like the
 one i drove, but in a different color.  he said he could get one exactly like
 i wanted from the dealer network within a day.  we then negotiated a price and
 signed the deal.
 
 next day, i get a call.  he explains that they goofed, and they had neglected
 to take into account a price increase. (the last price increase had occurred
 over 4 months prior to my visit.)  if i still wanted the car, i would
 have to fork over another $700.  as an alternative, they would honor the
 price if i bought the car i test drove (which had been sitting around for 
 6 months and had a few miles on it). i said goodbye.  this was a good
 example of how they can lowball you and still cover their butts.  it's too
 bad more people don't demand honesty or these types of dealers would
 no longer be in business.  
 
 the next dealership i went to was straightforward and honest.  first thing the
 salesman said was, "lets's see what you have for dealer cost and work out
 how much profit i should make."  the deal went through with no problems.
