 	oh, sure -- sorry, but the absence of a cupholder is not gonna
 discourage anyone from eating/drinking in the car;  let's just put one
 in anyway, so at least they don't have the further distraction of trying
 not to spill it.
 	furthermore, you are obviously not a smoker; on a cold day, it
 takes a certain skill to toss a butt out of a cracked window without having
 it wind-deflect into the back seat.  also, just 'cause some smokers use
 the window, doesn't mean all of us do.
 	this reminds me of *one* pleasant feature in the otherwise
 ergonomically-hellish interior of the alfa romeo milano:  you could ash
 your cigarette without even removing your hand from the wheel; the 'tray
 was *right*there*.

 	these, i will agree, are abominations, right along with the fake
 continental spare-tire kit -- it's sad watching those little old ladies 
 try to load their groceries into the trunk with that huge tire-medallion
 in the way.
 	most pitiful fake convertible top: on a "cadillac" cimarron, with
 all the chrome door trim still visible -- not fooling *anyone*.
 of course, there was that hyundai excel i once saw...
