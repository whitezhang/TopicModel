 the civic does still come in a 4 door model.  my wife and i looked
 quite seriously at the 626, prizm (corolla), and civic, as well as
 some other cars.  our impressions: all three seemed well built and had
 the features we wanted - these are similar to the features you want
 except for cruise control, and we want a manual transmission and are
 considering anti-lock brakes.  i also hate automatic seatbelts and we
 both think having an airbag is a plus.  in general, comfort and
 performance were both significant.
 
 some specific +'s and -'s are listed below.
 
 mazda 626
  + very comfortable and roomy
  + can theoretically get abs on dx model, though in practice this is
    hard to find
  + base price for base model includes numerous little things like:
    tach, variable speed wipers, rear defroster, 60/40 split folding rear seat
  - more expensive than many other cars listed below
 
 honda civic
  + dx gets significantly better mileage than other cars listed here
  + comfortable front seat
  + adjustable seat belt mounting
  - no abs without ex model (includes $1000's of other things like a sunroof)
 
 geo prizm/toyota corolla
  - seats not very comfortable to us (your mileage may vary)
  + adjustable seat belt mounting
  + can get abs without lots of other extras
 
 saturn
  + sl2 was quite comfortable, though sl1 less so
  - motorized attack belts
 
 dodge spirit
    no real outstanding +'s, but seemed generally ok
  - rear seat does not fold down
 
 chevy corsica
  + comes with abs standard
  - lower "would you buy that car again" and safety ratings in
    consumer reports (than first 3 cars above)
  - suspension didn't feel as stiff as the others (this would be a +
    for some)
 
 the honda accord and toyota camry were both more expensive than the
 626, and in our minds, not significantly better.
 
 we probably gave disproportionately low consideration to the "big 3",
 due (a) to my wife's family's general dislike of chrysler products,
 (b) some unimpressive gm products owned by my parents and a housemate
 of mine (c) the taurus comes with automatic transmission, i find the
 seat of the tempo very uncomfortable, and the escort has attack belts
 and no air bag.
 
 we'll probably end up with a 626 - i saw a 626 dx with a/c and
 cassette advertised for just under $12800 (washington post, april 14,
 i think), and my local dealer says they can match that price.  i will
 probably get the 626 (maybe tomorrow).  the main question in my mind
 is whether or not i will have to do a "factory order" or "preference
 order" to get one with abs, and whether or not the dealership will
 run the price up a lot if i do so.
