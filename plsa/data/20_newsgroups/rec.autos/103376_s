 well, an lt1 blazer wouldn't come close to a gmc typhoon in speed, i think its
 too heavy.  as it is right now, the normal 210hp 5.7 engine has plenty of 
 power for a full size blazer.  of course, i'm not saying gm shouldn't put the
 lt1 in it :).  it seems like they have a real winner with that engine.  why
 spend so much more money into getting a 32 valve dohc v8 when you can take 
 an lt1?  it even seems to get pretty good gas mpg (for a 5.7, that is.)

 yeah, it's a flat black, lowered 4 door caprice riding on 17" aluminum rims and
 eagle gs-c tires.  the rest of the car is basically a caprice ltz (read: 
 plush police package) with 300 horsepower.
 
 i heard that chevy is resurrecting the monte carlo but that's going to get 
 their 3.4 dohc v6 and not the lt1.
