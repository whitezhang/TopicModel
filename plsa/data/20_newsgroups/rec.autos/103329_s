 radar (radio association defending airwave rights) says that geico
 insurance not only buy's radar for police but also actively lobbies
 states to promote making radar detectors illegal.   i think the
 buying part is a misuse of money but the radar detector part shows
 how little they know about the issue.  no study i am aware of has ever
 concluded that detectors have a negative impact on safety or that
 users have a higher average speed.  incompetence by geico?  i think
 so.
