 
 my ex-husband & i used to own borgwards.  haven't seen any for a long
 time.  they were really good cars.  does ayone out there know anything
 about them now?  i heard they were being made in mexico, but of course
 they wouldn't be the original german - if that's even true.  when i've
 been in mexico i haven't seen any.  we loved ours, even tho' they were
 ugly - they had names - one was humphrey borgward.
