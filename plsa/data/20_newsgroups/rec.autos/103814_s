 hi there, maybe you can help me...
 
 i have an '88 corolla with a 5 speed as the subject line says.  the gearbox
 seems excessivly clunky.  i used to have an '85 corolla, and it was also 
 somewhat clunky, but it had 30,000 more miles on it, and it wasn't nearly as
 bad as this car!  is there fluid in the 5speed case?  if there is, could it
 just be low, or in need of a change?  as i recall, only the autos have fluid.
 or am i just mistaken?  please no flames for owning an import.  i also have
 an old dodge, but it's not in very good shape these days...
 
 thanks,
 derek
