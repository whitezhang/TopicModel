 i'm having an interesting problem with my girlfriend's car.  before
 i delve into its innards, i thought i'd check "net.wisdom" on the
 subject. :)
 
 it's a 1985 buick skyhawk (i know...i know)
 2.0l efi 4-banger
 auto
 35k miles
 
 when i drive tha car long enough to get it hot (especially at
 highways speeds) the transmission has this nasty habit of
 getting "stuck" in 3rd gear.  as a result, when you stop for
 a light the motor stalls.  putting the car in park, and waiting
 for 30-60 seconds before restarting sometimes allows the transmission
 to "reset" and go back into 1st.  otherwise, it just stalls when
 put in drive.  
 
 my thoughts:  either it the 3rd gear band is binding and getting
 stuck when it gets hot (not so likely) or perhaps the lock-up
 converter is not disengaging properly (seems likely).  the least
 likely (keeping fingers crossed) is that some critical vacuum
 hose has broken/cracked and this behaviour is due to lack of
 vaccuum somewhere (as used to happen with old modulator valves).
 
 my background is that my father owns a service station and
 i worked there on and off from 10-19 years of age.  please
 feel free to be as technical as you want. :)
 
 i'd appreciate hearing any tips/suggestions/offers of free
 beer. <grin>
 
 skoal,
