    yes. nobody is watching them.  if they get caught, there is no punishment
  at all.  in the old days such behaviour would be rewarded with a whipping
  with a good-sized belt, and then taken into some hospital to see first hand
  what kind of damage such accidents cause.   of course this doesn't happen
  any more.  that whipping would probably save the kid's life by teaching
  him some respect for others.  a person with that little respect would
  inevitably wind up dead early anyway.
 
    the problem is creeping gradualism.  if you put a frog into hot water,
  he just jumps out.  but if you put him into cold water and then ever-so-
  gradually heat it, the frog will cook.  this is what the entertainment
  industry and lack of religious, moral, and educational standards in our
  modern north american society have done to us over the years.  now that
  we are about to be 'cooked', we may have woken up too late.

 #society, as we have known it, it coming apart at the seams! the basic reason

 #"no big deal". kid's see hundreds on murderous acts on tv, we can abort

   and the education system and the religious leaders aren't doing much 
  about it, either.  with both parents working in this society, where is
  the stabilizing influence at home?   latchkey children are everywhere!
  and these latchkey kids can watch whatever rotten videos and listen to
  whatever violent hate-promoting "music" and videos they like because no
  one is home to stop it.
 
   this day and age, when there is about 100 times more things to learn
  than when i went to school, our answer to this increased knowledge is
  shorter school hours and more leisure time!  i say keep the kids in
  school longer, feed them good food and teach them something, and when
  they get home, have a parent there to interact and monitor them.  there
  is a very old and now forgotten proverb: a child left on his own will
  bring a parent to grief.  daycare systems are not the answer.  this is
  just shifting the parents' own responsibilities off on someone else to
  whom it's not a life-long committment, but rather just a job.
