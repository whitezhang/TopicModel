 hello again.
 
 anyone here done any tinting work.  what are the best brands out there?
 how about applications...i heard there was a water based brand that s
 you can move around, till it's just right, and you then let it dry like that.
 
 also i would consider having it professionally done, how much around
 wisconsin or chcago area, that does a decent job, fairly cheap. (college kid)
 
 thanks for all the info...
 
 ps.  what is the maximum legal tint limit.
