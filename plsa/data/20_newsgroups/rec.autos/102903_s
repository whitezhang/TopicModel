 oh come on, silly, all you have to do is cut a hole in your hood and 
 put a tube there so you can get to the oil fill hole.  what do you
 think all those big air intake things are for on those hot-rod cars?
 they're just for looks only...little does anyone know, they provide
 access to the oil-fill hole.
 
 well, over where we live, we have problems with vandals stealing 
 people's wheels.  those locking nuts didn't stop them.  so to be
 safe and sure, i welded the lug nuts to my wheels together.  it
 works, serious!  i haven't had my wheels stolen yet!
