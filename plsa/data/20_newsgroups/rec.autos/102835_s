 if you hold off, there are a number of interesting convertibles coming
 to market in the next few years.
 
 the new lebaron will be based on the mitsubishi galant, which should
 be an improvement over the current model.
 
 the new pl compact will have a convertible option (also a chrysler
 product)
 
 kia, makers of the ford festiva is planning a larger convertible.
