      i also experience this kinda problem in my 89 bmw 318. during cold
 start ups, the clutch seems to be sticky and everytime i drive out, for
 about 5km, the clutch seems to stick onto somewhere that if i depress
 the clutch, the whole chassis moves along. but after preheating, it
 becomes smooth again. i think that your suggestion of being some
 humudity is right but there should be some remedy. i also found out that
 my clutch is already thin but still alright for a couple grand more!
