 	the olds supreme convertible got high marks in c/d's recent test, if
 you can get by the stupid body moldings and stuff.  the saab 900 ragtop may
 be out of your range, but its a good choice.  is there a new f-car convertible?
 the nissan 240sx convertible is a nice car also... those immediately come to 
 mind...
