 hi! this is my first time to post on this news group. now a days , i have stucked at a certain problem. i have '88 mazda mx-6, non  turbo fuel injection.
    there is a engine warning signal on the dash board. while driving, this signal turns on, but not always. what does this mean? in the manual, they say "go to authorized mazda dealer.". it is really good idea. don't you think so? 
   i wanna know how the engine warning signal comes. is anybody out there who can give me same advice as "authorized mazda dealer" can give ?
