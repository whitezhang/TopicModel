  a 68 corvette but, i don't want to put corvette seats in it.  the original
  seats are in exc. shape but they are uncomfortable as hell.  i'm going to
  store those and find a set to drive in.  i have all the vette catalogs but
  i'm looking for a more generic type seat.  i can modify the brackets but 
  cushion height and overall width are a concern.  i've looked through some
  local boneyards without success.  i would just like to find a pair of 
  cheapo's to use this summer.
