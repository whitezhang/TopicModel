 
 it is actually simple in principle. porous adsorbents like zeolite and
 activated carbon can adsorb gases evaporated from the adsorbate (water
 or methanol, etc.) giving the cooling effect.  upon being heated, the 
 gas-saturated adsorbent bed will give off the gases which are then to be
 condensed.  this forms the adsorption refrigeration cycle.  the only problem
 is that the cop is very low (0.2 -0.6).
