 that is absolutely correct.  they have a streak of meanness that runs much
 deeper and stronger than anything i ever experienced even during the height
 of the 60's racial struggles.  i am absolutely convinced that there are
 kids out there today that have no concept of right and wrong, but have the
 human intelligence which is turning them into the greatest predators that
 have ever walked the earth.  they will prevail unless the rest of humanity
 decides that it is in their best interest to stand up against these feral
 humans, and for individuals to start taking some responsibility for their
 own protection.  in a state in which the individuals turn to the authorities
 and police for protection, the police and government is soon composed of
 the very feral humans that they originally sought protection from.
 
 gee, i guess you touched my hot button.  i'd better go cool off somewhere.
