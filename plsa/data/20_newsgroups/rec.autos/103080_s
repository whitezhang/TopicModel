 
 i'd like to hear stories on experiences with the hyundai sonata.  i
 know consumer reports has trashed them but the people i know that
 have them swear by them.  they also haven't had the problems with
 them that consumer reports claims.  i haven't driven one yet.  i
 have driven a '93 hyundai elantra (which consumer reports also
 trashed) and was very impressed with it.  the local hyundai
 dealership ("no-haggle" policy) is offering an elantra gls w/ power
 moonroof for $13163.  they also have a sonata base, w/ sunroof for
 $13997.  i know my preference is for a sonata gls w/ sunroof and
 4-spd automatic.  i'll decide which engine i prefer after test
 driving both the 4-cyl and the v6.  the sonata is also offering a
 $1500 rebate.  hmmm, that's another question.  is the following
 scenario the appropriate manner to handle "negotiation"?
 
 1.  make offer
 2.  subtract rebate from offer
 3.  talk trade
 4.  subtract trade from offer to get final price
