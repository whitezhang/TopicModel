 
 aw>>>my 85 caprice classic with 120k+ miles has finally reached
   >>>the threshold of total number of mechanical problems that
   >>>i am forced to post :).  anyone out there who might be
   >>>able to give me some pointers on one or more of the below,
   >>>please e-mail or post!
 
 aw>>>1. when making turns, especially when accelerating,
   >>>there is usually a loud "thunk" from the rear of
   >>>of the car.  sounds like it could be the differential.
 
 wheel bearing, ujoint.
 
 
 aw>>>2. on starting the car, i get blue (oil) smoke from
   >>>the exhaust for 5-10 seconds.  exhaust valves
 
 bad valve stem seals.
 
 aw>>>3. brakes.  more pedal travel than i feel comfortable
   >>>with, but master cylinder is full and fluid is
 
 worn pads, rear brakes not adjusted up tight or worn out drums.
 90% of low pedal complaints usually are from a rear brake problem.
 
 aw>>>4. tranny.  tranny problems seem to be slowly getting
   >>>worse -- takes almost 2 seconds to downshift from
   >>>3rd to 2nd on heavy throttle application, and more
   >>>recently, it is reluctant to shift from 2nd to 3rd.
   >>>fluid (checked with car running with tranny put
   >>>through all the gears and then back to park, as per
   >>>haynes manual) is red and clear, and is on full mark.
 possible modulator valve if equipped with one. also could be the
 kickdoen cable.
 
 aw>>>5. my springs all around are just about shot -- i have
   >>>4 new shocks on, but car still skips out on bumps
   >>>in turns at moderate to high speed.  how hard are
   >>>they to change?  can they be reconditioned?
 difficult on front. easy on rear. they are not expensive. about $75-$100
 for front and less than $50 for the rear.
 
 its also kind of dangerous to work on the front springs without the
 proper equipment.
                                                         don
