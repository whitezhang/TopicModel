        i just had my rotors on my '92 taurus gl changed less than 500 miles
    ago and...you guessed it, i'm noticing slight warpage in the left rotor.
    :-(  i had a mechanic friend of mine look at it and he said that there is a
    high spot on the rotor that is causing the problem.  this is a brand new
    rotor bought from a ford dealership.  can't they even produce a brand new
    rotor that is not warped?  i'm currently negotiating with them to swap it
    out for a new rotor.
 
        this is my first american build car and i'm not overly impressed.
