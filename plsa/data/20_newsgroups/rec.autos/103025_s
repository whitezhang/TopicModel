 having spoken to technical staff from ford many times, i can assure you that 
 internally at ford this car is always called the taurus "show" or just  
 "the show".  as in long "o" sound.  i still refer to it as the "s-h-o",
 however, because it sounds better to me. i assume many purist fans and owners 
 prefer using the ford lingo.
