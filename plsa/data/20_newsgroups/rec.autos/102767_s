 a friend of mine had some sensors damaged by flood waters, ford denys any
 sensors are registering bad.  he and his father did the short a circut via
 paper clip method (not sure of the exact technique), and read the codes off
 the "service engine" light flashes generated from this.  came up with the 
 damaged sensors, went back to ford, and told them what was wrong.  they
 fixed the car after that.  what a bunch of bozos.
