 if your viper system were tuned like a neighbor's is you wouldn't get
 any sleep because of the damn thing waking every one in the neighborhood
 up.
 
 we all used to try to ignore the alarm, but have now made a pact to
 bombard the house with night-time visits and phone calls when ever we
 are awakened because some thunder storm passed over the next county
 or a stray dog looked at the car.
 
 car alarms are a serious pain-in-the-ass!

 p.s. real men don't have car radios since the exhaust is too loud to
      hear it anyway <grin>!
