 talk to philip greenspun. he took ford to court recently and, despite much
 manouvering and trickery on ford's part, he won! well, actually i think
 ford settled out of court on the provision he shut his mouth and stopped 
 causing them trouble. i love it when the little guy wins. i don't have
 philip's address anymore, but a "philip, where are you" call may bring him
 out of hiding.
 
 cheers,
 paul.
