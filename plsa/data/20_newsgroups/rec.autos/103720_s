 just out of curiosity, how is this "dog clutch" any different from a synchro
 transmission.  what you described sounds the same to me.  in fact, what little
 i've studied on trannies, the instructor referred to the synchros as "dogs"
 and said they were synonymous.  the gears are always meshed in a synchronized
 gearbox, and you slip the synchro gears back and forth by shifting. or at least,
 that is what i was taught.  explain, por favour?
