 ah, yes, the big chunks down in the sump. the solution is simple. sort of
 like the advice my aunt always gave -- never scratch your ear with anything
 except your elbow.
 
 if you have pieces of ring, con rods, valve heads or stems, just reach into
 the sump through the hole in the block that was associated with the creation
 of those large bits and pieces. anything you can't remove with one hand 
 through the hole in the block may safely be left in place.
