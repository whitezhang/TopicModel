 in response to a post about suv's, i got several unsolicited recommendations to
 check out the land cruiser, despite its astronomical price.
 the toyota dealer told me it's a "cult car".
 if a car is good enough to create a passionate and loyal following, there
 must be something really extraordinary about it.
 so, all you land crusher cultists - here is your chance to convert me.
