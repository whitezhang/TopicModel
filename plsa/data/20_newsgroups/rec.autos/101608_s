 i bought a car with a defunct engine, to use for parts
 for my old but still running version of the same car.
 
 the car i bought has good tires.
 
 is there anything in particular that i should do to
 store the defunct car long-term?  i'd hate to have
 parts of it go bad.  someone has told me it's bad
 for the tires to not move the car once-in-a-while.
 is this true?   do i need some props to take the
 weight of the tires?
 
 best to reply by mail, i am getting spotty news delivery.
