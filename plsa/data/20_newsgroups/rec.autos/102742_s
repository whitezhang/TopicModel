 i consulted with someone working on an electronic odometer.  the
 design was to use a microprocessor based system to write a somewhat
 ofuscated pattern into an eeprom.  the idea was to make the circuit
 difficult to program arbitrary values into the eeprom.  the
 secondary purpose, acutally the primary purpose from the standpoint
 of practicality, was to distributed the writes so as to avoid
 exceeing the maximum number of writes fof the eeprom being used.
 the microprocessor also ignored pulses coming from the hall effect
 at a rate any higher than 110 mph so as to make spoofing the reading
 by bench pulsing at least somewhat undesirable.  this was for an
 automobile that was not expected to ever exceed 110 mph in
 operation.  the case, of course, might not be the same for your
 1993 rx-7!
 
 the ecm modules of some cars do indeed store info about conditions
 under which cars have been operated.  since steering angle and
 velocity data, etc is available it would not be difficult to
 collect all sorts of interesting demographic information about the
 drivers' use of the car.  i am not aware of any manufacturer
 currently trying to enforce warranty restrictions based on reading
 out use data from the ecm.  while it could be a potential invasion
 of your privacy for manufacturers to have access to data about your
 driving style, it could also provide valuable information from
 actual field use conditions to help engineer more appropriate cars.
 i personally wouldn't mind the dealer collecting my driving
 demographics as long as it is done in an anonymous fashion.
