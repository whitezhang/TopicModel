 hello,
 	i am looking to slightly increase the performance of my 89 honda
 civic si.  i was wondering if anyone could suggest upgrades that were not
 too drastic.  i thought that one of the easiest upgrades would be a new
 header.  does anyone know what kind of increase that the header would give
 me?  i think i would check with jackson racing for the part.  are there
 any other comparines would make honda parts.  
 
 	are there any other small changes that can be easily made and won't
 screw up the car.  things like new injectors?, new fuel injection chip etc?
 i would welcome any suggestions of small changes that would make a
 difference.
 
 	i don't really want to change the cam etc because i have heard that it
 would be much harder on the engine.
 
 e-mail relpies prefered please and i will post a summary of all the replies.
 thanks for any help you may have to offer!
