 consumer reports once wrote about the s-10 blazer that it "shook and rattled
 like a tired taxi cab".  there is one noise that is expecially irritating -
 the back window squeaks.  i believe its because the whole tailgate assembly
 and window are not solid.  anyway, has anyone had the same problem, and have
 you found any fixes?
