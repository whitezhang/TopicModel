 nice theory.  too bad the mr2's never came with a four cylinder over 2.0
 liters.  more like 1.6.  or did they? were the nonturbo mr2ii's  2.2 or
 some such?
 
 i also understand that anyone using balancing shafts on four cylinders, must
 pay saab a royalty for using their patented design..like porsche's 3.0 i4...
