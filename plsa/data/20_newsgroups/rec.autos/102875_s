 i'm not going to argue the issue of carrying weapons, but i would ask you if 
 you would have thought seriously about shooting a kid for setting off your
 alarm?  i can think of worse things in the world.  glad you got out of there
 before they did anything to give you a reason to fire your gun.
 
 we can all ask "what's happening to society these days", but don't forget to
 ask another important question too: what effort am i expending to make it any
 different than it is?
 
 just my thoughts,
