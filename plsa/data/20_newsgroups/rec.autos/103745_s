 oil pressure, oil temperature
 coolant temperature
 manifold vacuum
 ammeter, voltmeter
 
 fuel pressure [maybe] (problematic, since you either need an electronic
 sensor/gauge pair or you have to mount the damn thing outside the car)
 
 in addition, it'd be nice to have a big red idiot light 'check guages'
 connected to oil pressure, oil temp, coolant temp, ammeter &
 voltmeter.  with heaps of guages, it's hard to look at them all all
 the time.  in the case of oil pressure, for example, you want to know
 right away if your oil pump goes bad, unlike coolant temperature, a
 minute or two of 0 oil pressure would be a very bad thing(tm).
