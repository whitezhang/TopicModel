 you can also just put the detector off to the side on the dash so the cop
 doesn't see it right away...valentine is the best detector by far (as stated
 by car and driver) and even tells you what direction the radar is coming from.
  it also gives the amount of "threats" it is picking up, so if you go through
  the same place everyday, and it always goes off there, you can glance at the
  number of "threats" the valentine is detecting to see if it is a genuine cop.
   it's about $300 and you can only get it factory direct..one problem.
