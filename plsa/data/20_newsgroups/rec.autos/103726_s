  i don't think that a transmission fluid change will solve your problem.
  unless you are in an extremely cold climate and using a very heavy weight
  fluid.  follow the manufacturer's recommended oil weight.  some of the
  cars i have had (all standard transmissions 4 or 5 speeds) recommend
  changing the transmission fluid at 30,000 miles under normal driving
  conditions.  i've gone 100,000 without changing the transmission oil (and
  had to replace the transmission bearings!). my older cars used 85 weight
  oil whereas my 92 honda uses 10-30 motor oil (or maybe 30 weight).
