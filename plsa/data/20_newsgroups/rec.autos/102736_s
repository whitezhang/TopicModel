 sorry i can't help you with your question, but i do have a comment to
 make concerning aftermarket a/c units.  i have a frost-king or frost-temp
 (forget which) aftermarket unit on my cavalier, and am quite unhappy with
 it.  the fan is noisy, and doesn't put out much air.  i will never have
 an aftermarket a/c installed in any of my vehicles again.  i just can't
 trust the quality and performance after this experience.
