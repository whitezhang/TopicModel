 back to the f1 stuff for a second, note that the `auto' tranny in f1
 _still_ shifts at the driver's command, not some preselected schedule.  the
 driver still controls the shifting, not the transmission.

 i have yet to see a torque multiplier installed on a production automobile. 
 such systems do exist, but none are presently installed in production autos
 that i am aware of.  these are commonly called viscous drive cvts or
 fluidic amplifiers.

 what the convertor _does_ allow is for the engine to be closer to its
 torque peak during the launch before a clutched car can fully engage it's
 driveline.  chevy proved it many years ago with the '70 camaro (ets and
 terminal 1/4 mile times were close enough tpo be identical for 4 speed and
 auto cars).  note that this is also the major reason that an auto car can
 get away with fewer gears than a manual, the slip in the convertor makes up
 for the fewer ratios (and before everyone starts yelling about the proposed
 5 sspeed autos soon to be out, note that some manufacturers are using 6
 speed manulas now).

 correct.
