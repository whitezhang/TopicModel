 hi,
 
 my friend's 1983 toyota tercel accelerates by itself without using
 the gas peddel. the repairman said it has a internal leak of air in
 the carburetor and needs a new carburetor (costs $650). she likes
 to know if it is possible to fix the problem without replacing
 the whole carburetor.
 
 thank you.
