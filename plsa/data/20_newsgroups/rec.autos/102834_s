 i like my power windows. i think they're worth it.
 
 however, cruise control is a pretty dumb option. what's the point?
 if you're on a long trip, you floor the gas and keep your eyes on
 the rear-view mirror for cops, right?
 
 power seats are pretty dumb too, unless you're unlucky enough to have
 to share your car. otherwise, you'd just adjust it once and just leave
 it like that.
