 some other owners on the ford-probe@world.std.com mailing list have commented 
 about this problem, but i haven't seen it happen on my 3 month old 
 '93 probe gt.  i think this may be something that ford has corrected since 
 the initial batch of cars.  also, someone said that ford has issued a 
 service bulletin to inform dealers about how to correct this problem, so you 
 may be able to get your dealer to fix it.

 haven't seen any of these problems, nor have i seen these mentioned on the
 mailing list, so these might just be having bad luck with these.

 definitely!

 no problems like these either.  i haven't been able to find any obvious 
 places where they screwed up.
 
 >ford only gives 1 key with the car.  c'mon ford, spend an extra few pennies!
 
 hmmm!  i got two keys with my car.  something tells me you got stiffed by
 your dealer on this.  (actually, if you count the "credit card" key that 
 came in the owner's binder, i got 3 keys, but since the credit card key
 doesn't have any teeth cut in it yet, i guess i won't count it. :-))

 the latter is probably because of the air bag.  it's pretty much takes up
 all the space where you'd expect to find the horn.
 
 speaking of the horn, i was surprised to find that the probe comes with one
 of those nice 'merican sounding horns instead of the japanese sounding kind.
 the previous probes had japanese horns.

 yeah, not very badly, but enough to be annoying sometimes.

 i agree strongly with all of the above, especially about the engine.  the
 interior is very, very nice too.  very pleasing to the eye, and ergonomically
 sound.

 yes, this car's stiff suspension isn't for everyone.  i personally like it,
 but if you find it a little harsh but otherwise like the car, i'd strongly
 suggest looking into the mx-6.

 the problem with the back seat is that there's no leg room.  plenty of 
 head room, though.  shorter people fit back there without any complaints,
 so long as the seat they are sitting behind is pulled forward a bit to 
 give them a place to put their feet.

 the power moonroof can greatly improve the ventilation throughout the car. :-)
 i really enjoy the moonroof, by the way, but then i've always been a sucker
 for open air driving.  no leakage problems or anything like that...yet!
 
 >i've heard that the exhaust system has trouble, but mine works fine.
 
 i haven't heard about this one.  i know that some of the very early probes
 ('89 and maybe '90) had problems with prematurely rusting mufflers (which
 ford will replace at no charge), but i haven't heard about anything like
 this concerning the '93 probes.
 
 i haven't had any real trouble with this car outside of a cv joint boot
 that was leaking, but the dealer took care of that promptly, and even
 gave me a free rental car for the day and a half that i was without my
 car.  i was quite happy with the way they handled...especially considering
 that i was expecting the worst from them!
 
 from what i've heard, it sounds like ford/mazda had some qc problems with 
 the probe (and probably mx-6) when they first went into production, but 
 i think these problems have mostly been corrected at this point.  that's
 almost always to be expected with a completely new car like this, though.
 
 hope this helps,
