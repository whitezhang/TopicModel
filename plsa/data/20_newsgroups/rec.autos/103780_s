 i recently bought a 2 band detector.  you guys must all think i'm
 nuts, right?  well, i did a little research into ka usage in this
 area and found out that ka is not currently being used in this state
 as well as surrounding states.  here's how i found out:
 
 - a cop friend who did spend time nailing speeders doesn't even know 
   what ka is.  he's heard of k, which is what they use here and i
   explained that ka is used for photo radar etc.. he then said, yeah,
   "ka stands for k automatic"... duuhh.  he then went on to say that
   plans were being made for getting laser guns as far as going high
   tech were concerned, but he didn't know too much.
 
 - my 8 year old 2 band whistler was consistently going off at speed traps,
   even the real sneaky ones.
 
 - when i called the escort shop, they confirmed that ka is not used here
   or in surrounding states.  they did claim that laser was being used
   a lot here, which i was quite skeptical of.
 
 so in the end, instead of spending a lot of money and/or waiting
 months for a state of the art detector, i got a low priced, high
 performance 2 band escort 2200.  incidentally its performance is equal
 to their top of the line model in x and k band detection.  i know that
 escort has been surpassed by other brands lately, but i've never fully
 relied on a detector and i was convinced that the escorts would be at
 least quite good, which was good enough for me and my wallet.
