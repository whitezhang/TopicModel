 
 	probably the most famous v16 is the one cadillac made from about 1925  
 to 1935.  they had to scale down then because the great depression really put  
 the crimp on luxury cars.  it had 452 cubic inches with over two hundred horse  
 power.  "they don't make them like they used to."  
 	there were others though.  packard had one until about 1930 whe it down  
 sized to their legendary twin-six, their mainstay for the next twenty years.   
 lincoln and pierce arrow might have also had one but i am not two sure.
 	most luxury and semi-luxury cars of this era at least experimented with  
 v16 if they did not actually produce them.  there was actually a "cylinder war"  
 among the big three to see who could produce the biggest engine.
