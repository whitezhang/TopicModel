 thanks to a reply from someone i looked a little further and found what
 i was looking for.  the april cr magazine has most of the above things.
 despite recent articles here the ratings looked pretty good for
 relative comparison purposes.  unfortunately the crash test comparisons
 didn't include half of the cars i'm comparing.
 anybody know how '93 honda civic hatchbacks and toyota tercels fare in
 an accident?
