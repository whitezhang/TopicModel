    as i live in sweden i remember the day perfectly well. we changed
 side 1967-09-03 (or 03-sep-1967). i don't remeber the exactly time but
 it was in the night. (in the 'big' cities like stockholm & gothenburg
 all trafic was forbidden, exept busses and taxis, during the whole
 weekend.) the day was a sunday and everything was prepared in before.
 
 before the day we was told to follow the yellow lines on the road and
 after it was the white one that matters. the signs with arrows on was
 prepared with a 'left mode' label that was torn off that night to
 reveal the new right mode arrow.
 
 the year after iceland also changed.
 
 about cars: before the h-day (h as in "hoegertrafik". "hoeger" is
 swedish and stands for 'right') practically all cars already had their
 steering wheels on the left side. even the imported cars from uk had
 the wheel on 'the right side'. at last we have cars with the wheels on
 the right side. :-)
 
 more contries that uses the left side is:
 
 japan
 tanzania (i think)
 new zeeland
 how about south africa?
 
 btw. some sais that the left side is the right side because ivanhoe
 and other knights meet at the left when they fight in tournaments. :-)
