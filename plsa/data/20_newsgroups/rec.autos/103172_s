 	actually, this started as a great idea.  before steering-column
 locks became popular, saab installed a *gearshift* lock -- put the car
 in reverse, remove the key, and the car *stays* in reverse!
 	also, suppose you get into your car, and a thug comes up and
 demands your keys at gunpoint.  you hand them over, he gets in, and
 has no idea where to put the key!  at this, he will run away (or perhaps
 shoot you anyway  %-}).  i heard this actually happened somewhere...
 	btw, i hear that the saab 900's new successor will have the
 ignition on the console, between the seats, where it belongs.
