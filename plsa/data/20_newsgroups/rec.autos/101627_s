 740 turbo in uk was good for 124mph. useful for blowing away vw beetles, though i
 believe the beetle corners better. 
 
 i can say without any doubt that i have never been blown away by any volvo, ever.
 i've been blocked into a few car parks though by shit-head volvo owners who 'only thought they'd be a few minutes'. this does not happen with the owners of any other makes of car.
 
 not sure how long the small shit-box volvos last - too damn long. the worst car i ever drove was a hired 340. in power, handling and ride it was reminiscent of something
 from the 50s, without the character. the 340 only ceased production a couple of years back. i've only been a passenger in the big volvos, but that was enough. i ought to go
 for a test drive because they offer some neat gifts.
