 i am considering buying an new car, so i called three insurance
 companies in california to get estimates. i asked for the same
 coverage and same deductibles. most of the companies charge you
 according to your zip code. others charge according to your city.
 anyhow, i gave the same zip code and city to all three places. here's
 what i found (for a '93 integra gs):
 
 aaa: ~$2000/yr.
 state farm: 2614.92/yr.
 allstate: 1220/yr.
 
 aaa is non-profit, so they said i could also expect to receive about
 $200-300 back at the end of the year.
 
 still, there is a huge gap between all of these companies. state farm
 wants more than twice as much as allstate. i think i should be
 suspicious, but i've never heard anybody else complain.
 
 any comments?
 
 thanks,
