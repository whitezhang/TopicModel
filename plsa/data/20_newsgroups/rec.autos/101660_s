 	"i read an article in the 3/25 chicago tribune stating that
 	chrysler is having problems addressing the demand for the 3.5l
 	engine for it's lh cars.  can anyone post how long they are
 	waiting for an ordered car or how long they have been told
 	they'll have to wait??"
 
 ordered mine december 30, got it nine weeks later.  but the dealer said
 that *new* orders were being held up -- he didn't expect to see any
 more 3.5l-engine lhs for awhile.
