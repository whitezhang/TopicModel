 
  i have been looking at buying a 1989 jeep laredo and was wondering
 if anyone had any bad or good experiences with this model. is it
 all that much different than the other yjs? 
 
  it looks, feels and sounds like a nice vehicle even thought the
 price is rather steep for an '89 (12k canadian).
