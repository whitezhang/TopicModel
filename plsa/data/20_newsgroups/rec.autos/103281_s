 
 help!!!
 my wife has informed me that she wants a convertible for her next car.
 we live in south fla., so we are definitely in the right are for one.
 my wife has mentioned the miata, but i think it is too small.
 i would like to wait for the new mustangs ( dec. '93 i think).
 anyone have any opinions on any/all convertibles in a reasonable price range.
 
                                            thanx
