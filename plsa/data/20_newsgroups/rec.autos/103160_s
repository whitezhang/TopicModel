 diesels fall into the same emissions mythology as alcohol fuels.  the main reason
 they are considered "cleaner" is because they are better at the emissions we
 actually measure and regulate.  but they also contribute additional emissions
 which have long been determined to be as harmful, but no suitable control or
 limits have been defined.  
 
 current evidence is pointing to most visible smog actually being diesel emissions
 and suspended particles and less of a photo-chemical reaction.  diesel particulates
 are now becoming a major concern in decreased lung capacity.  and alcohols emit
 signifcantly more aldehydes (a known carcinigen) than gasoline.  the evidence
 is mounting that while we have been beating the gasoline engine to death, we may
 have been ignoring the effects of the alternatives.
 
 and anyone who thinks diesels are so great, should go and spend a few hours in
 rush hour traffic in some cities in europe.  there the stench of the diesels is
 awful and it can even burn the eyes.  
 
 diesels being clean is only relative to our current standards.
