 i really must object to that last statement.  having a lot of experience
 with a '92 grand am coupe, i can firmly state that they do have a lot of
 outstanding qualities.  very reliable throughout.  great layout of controls
 and components.  very roomy considering the exterior size of the car.  they 
 look sharp inside and out.  the v6 that i drive has exceptional power and 
 drivability compared to other similar cars that i have driven.
 
 all in all, it's a fun-to-drive, dependable, and reasonably priced vehicle.
 please don't knock it with a statement like that unless you back it up with
 specific reasons why you feel that way.
