 alright, beat this automobile sighting.
 
 driving along just a hair north of atlanta, i noticed an old, run down
 former car dealership which appeared to deal with, and repair, older
 rare or exotic foreign sports cars. i saw:
 
 ford gt-40 (!), the famous model from ford, that seemed to win most of 
 its races in the late 60s, including le-mans 4 or 6 times.
 
 two jensen interceptors, one a convertable, one a hatchback?
 
 porsche 911 (boring compared to the rest)
 
 three ferarries, a mondial, a 308 prepared for racing, and a red 60s model
 that i couldn't identify.
 
 and at the bottom, a late 70s mg convertable.
 
 outside there was a rotting rover 3500 saloon, which was never regularly
 sold in the u.s.
 
 and in the showroom, there was a small italian body, either an alpha romeo
 or a lancia. it was about the size of an austin mini.
 the trunklid was missing, exposing a boot with a voltage regulator 
 in the upper left corner of the wall, and a chunk of metal removed from
 the floor on the right hand side as if something would leave the trunk
 and go to the outside from here.
 the taillights looked like they
 would be the round type (if they were there). does anyone know what the
 make of this one is?  
 
 certainly made my day...
