 well, i never wrote that i would act as you described.  i stated that i 
 would not block a would-be passer.  i would not block a would-be passer
 "for their own good" or for any reason other than i was prevented from 
 doing so due to the traffic circumstance.  i fail to see how deterring a
 passer under these circumstance would in any way decrease your chances
 of being involved in an accident, fatal or otherwise.  in fact, i could
 imagine how blocking a would-be passer would actually increase your 
 chances of being "offed" or involved in an accident, especially if 
 this "passer" is riding your bumper.  intentionally blocking a person
 riding your bumper is certainly not a "wise driving practice", it 
 only causes the jam to become more congested. 
  
 i don't mess with trucks and i actually watch the road ahead and the 
 road behind!   if i perceive that i am rapidly closing on a "pack" 
 of vehicles, i try to avoid getting caught up in situation such as you 
 decribe.  usually either traffic is just building and i have to deal 
 with this fact of life, or i wait to a slow passer to complete their 
 pass and make way for the pack to clear.  if someone decides then to 
 pull up on my bumper, i signal my intention to move to the right, and 
 do so at the first opportunity (& hope they will open the jam).  i 
 feel this is not only courteous driving, but alot safer than the 
 actions you advocate!!!  there are actually many courteous drivers 
 on the road who do not intentionally impede others.  
 
 if someone in front of me seems to be oblivious to the fact that they 
 are blocking traffic i use my blinker or flash my lights, or, if all 
 else fails, will briefly speed up /slow down so they might get the 
 message that i am a faster vehicle trying to pass.  i feel it is never 
 safe to ride anyone's bumper.  if someone is intentionally blocking 
 traffic, because they feel that it is civil duty or philosophic duty 
 or for some unfathomable reason, i feel they deserve, at the very least,
 derision.       (sorry this is soooooooo long.)
