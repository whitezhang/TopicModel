 the vw "thing" kubelwagen lookalike is still manufactured in mexico and 
 possibly south america.  good luck importing one--  they probably don't meet 
 us safety and pollution requirements.  there are mechanics and junkyards 
 which specialize in vw; they might be helpful for finding a "thing" unless 
 the wwii re-enacters have grabbed them all.
 
 the wwii kubelwagen was the german equivalent of the jeep, but was not 4-
 wheel drive.  one is on display at the patton museum at fort knox, kentucky, 
 also the rare "schwimwagen" (sp?) amphibious version, in full-scale dioramas.
 highly recommended!
