 while your 0-60 time is consistent with most car magazines and reports, i saw
 the pbs motorweek show clock a 5-speed sl2 at 7.9 seconds.  i'm sure that most
 sl2 owners will be very lucky to get this speed, but 7.9 seconds is still
 astonishingly fast for a small 4-door.  a new civic ex runs about 8.2 seconds
 0-60, if i'm not mistaken.  most cars in this class are lucky to be in the
 9-second range.
