 well, yes, the exhaust is where the majority of the noise comes out, but the
 basics (tone, firing cadence, etc.) are determined by the engine configuration.
 in the case of the viper, yes, we are discussing a huge multicylinder 90-deg.
 engine, which will sound somewhat like a truck.  and my understanding, btw, is
 that that v-10 engine was designed originally with the intention of being ad-
 aptible for either the trucks or the viper.  and from what i've heard (no first
 hand knowledge :-( ) it's doing a pretty good job at both.
 
 and the best exhaust sound in the world is now and will always be a 60-degree
 dohc colombo-designed v-12.  period.
