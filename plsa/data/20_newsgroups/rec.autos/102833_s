 
 dear netters:
 
 i am looking to buy a used eagle talon '91 or '91 tsi awd.
 question is that the '91 tsi awd was mentioned in the
 april consumer reports to a car to avoid!
 
 in particular, the manual transmission, electrical system,
 and brakes were below par (in both models).  a friend of mine
 ownes a '90 tsi awd and he has had 2 brake jobs (pads), one
 stuck valve, and some clutch/transmission problem, something
 about sticking/grinding into second gear.  this doesn't seem
 too bad if one "beats" on his car.
 
 i am willing to suffer reliability--for speed and looks.  seems
 you have to pay big buck if you want all three.  anyway can
 anyone please let me know how you like your talon, and any
 problems you may have had, and if the repairs are worth it.
 
 thanks for any responses!
