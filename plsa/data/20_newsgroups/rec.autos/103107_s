 i can relate to this. i've tried everything on my 86, greasing every point,
 wd40, etc. grease on the two cheap hinges on the tailgate seems to quiet it
 down for a time, until the grease works out of the hinges. (hinge pins appear
 to be made out of 16 penny nails!) 
 
 another vibration seems to get worse with age, and that is a vibration in the
 transmission in 4th gear. my s10 has 59k miles on it. i bought it new, treated
 it very easily, no fast off-road stuff. can't gm build chevies like they used
 to? ford explorers look nice, until you look at the price.
