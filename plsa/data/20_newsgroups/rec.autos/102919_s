 --when i was selling nissans last summer, i sold a '92 se-r in early august
   when its supply was getting quite scarce.  the car was black with abs, 
   value option pkg, and power moonroof.  i sold it for $12,900 plus tax.
   naturally, my manager didn't really care to sell one of the most desirable
   se-r's for virtually no profit (to the best of my knowledge).....
