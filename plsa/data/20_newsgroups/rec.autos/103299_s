 you know, i'm a ford fan, i must say, so i'm looking forward to the next
 mustang.  i have faith that it will be a fine product, more desireable
 than the camaro is now.  you know, that's mho.  
 
 the differences these days between ford and gm are not so much the quality,
 just the philosophy.  it used to be quality _and_ philosophy.  gm is
 barely catching up, but they have more room for improvement that
 can only be made up in time.  stss still come off the assembly line
 with screwed up paint stripes and poor trunk/door/hood/panel alignments;
 it's those 75 year old plants.  and the latest gm products still come
 with the standard equipment rattledash (tm).  but like i said, they're
 getting better and making the move in the right direction.
 
 they beat ford to the market with the camaro/firebird, but really only
 in words.  production of these vehicles will be limited until the
 end of the year, keeping selling prices above msrp for the most part
 since there are so many twitching camaro fans out there.  i wouldn't
 press ford to hurry the mustang since the final wait could be worth it.
 besides, no bow-tie fanatic is gonna buy the mustang anyway.
 
 i do not put much stock in the mag rags' "inside" information, or even
 ford rep quotes.  the taurus was pretty much a surprise when it was
 finally disclosed in it's entirety.  "inside" information had the
 taurus with a v8 and rear-wheel drive at one point.  i wouldn't look
 for a simple re-paneled mustang, folks; you may be cheating yourself
 if you do.  there's a lot of potential.  ford hasn't released a new
 car without a 4-wheel is in 7 years.  the mustang project has been
 brewing for at least 4, right?  a 4-wheel is could happen.  those
 modular v8's are out there, too.  in the interest of cafe and
 competition, don't rule those out, either.   your ignorant if you do.
 and there are so many spy shots and artist renderings out there,
 who really knows what it'll look like?  the mach iii?  doubt it.
 highly.
 
 the next mustang will be ford's highest profile car.  it attracts
 way more attention than the camaro/firebird because it's heritage
 is more embedded in the general public.  don't lie to yourself and
 believe ford will forfeit that.
 
 i submit that the mustang will be a success.  enough to elicit
 defensive remarks from some heavy camaro fans here.  you know,
 intelligent, critical spews like, "the mustang bites, man!"  some of
 you are already beginning.  i predict that the mustang and camaro
 will be comparable performers, as usual.  i predict that the
 differences will be in subjective areas like looks and feel, as usual.
 the camaro is still a huge automobile; the mustang will retain its
 cab-rearward styling and short, pony-car wheelbase.  the camaro still
 reaches out to the fighter pilot, while the mustang will appeal to
 the driver.  the camaro will still sell to the muscle car set, while
 the mustang will continue to sell to the college-degreed muscle car set.
 both will be more refined (i do think the camaro is).  there will be
 no clear winner.
 
 unless the ford gets the 32v, 300hp romeo.  you don't seriously believe
 that it was designed for the mark viii only, do you?
