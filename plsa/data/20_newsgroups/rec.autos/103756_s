 for an all out sports car, i'd go for the rx-7 without the sports
 suspension (which is too stiff.)  for a little more practicality and more
 comfort, the nissan 300zx turbo is a good buy.  and for a good dose of
 luxury, the lexus sc300 is perfect (with a manual transmission of course.) 
 however, the toyota supra is coming out soon and if you like it's looks,
 the performance is supposed to be great, almost race car like.  i don't
 particulary like the mitsubishi 3000gt's or the dodge stealths as they are
 too heavy and aren't very nimble handlers for a sports car.
