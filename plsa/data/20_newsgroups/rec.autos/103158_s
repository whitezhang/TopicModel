 	copies to come along since the mazda mpv."
 
 i'll agree about villager but not mpv -- it's so small that i'd class
 it as a suv with an extra seat shoehorned in.  to get any rear cargo
 space, you shove the back seat up against the middle seat, eliminating
 *all* leg room.
 
 back to the villager ...
 
 	"only the price is controversial."
 
 and the use of attack belts instead of 3-point belts.  that killed it
 for me.
