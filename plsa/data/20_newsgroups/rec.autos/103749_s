 well, you can just about set your watch by honda releasing new models every
 4 years and an upgrade half way through the cars life. the local acura
 dealership tells me that the new integra will be out very soon, i.e. may/june.
 
 its hard to find specific details as the integra has been deleted from
 most of the rest of the world - i have seen them in canada and australia
 as well as the u.s. but it was discontinued after the first generation
 in europe. normally you can see new japanese models appear in europe
 or japan first and extrapolate from there. c+d reported that the engine
 would be a carryover i think.
