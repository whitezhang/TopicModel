 in rec.autos you write:
 
 >if ayrton senna can drive a racecar with fully automatic transmission,
 >it can't be half bad..  :-)
 
 this mclaren auto-transmission (i still think it's only half auto,
 but you may be right) has nothing to do with your gm, chrysler, volvo,
 or whatever auto transmission. it's a normal manual transmission
 gearbox with clutch and all, but there are servo motors, which do
 the shifting. 
 
 that means, there is no power loss in the drivetrain (if you take out 
 minimal mechanical friction), and the sami-auto transmissions 
 (ferrari, williams, mclaren(?),...) don't tell you, when to shift,
 either. however, these transmissions share an important disadvantage
 with your stock auto-trannie: they are expensive.
 
 as long as these servo-shifted gearboxes aren't available on 
 'normal' cars i'm gonna stick with my manual. i just can't see an
 advantage to make up for two grand i lose in this deal and the
 loss in mileage and power (except maybe in real heavy traffic). but
 then i drive mostly on the autobahn and country roads anyway.
 
 there's no point in making a religion out of this, i just wanted to
 point out a few technical facts and my own opinion, so there's
 no need for a flame war.
