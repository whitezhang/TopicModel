 that is a question that can only be answered by yourself and where you live. 
 if you live in a place where crime is apparent, then it might be a good idea to
 get one simply as a deterrent.  however, if a professional thief wants your
 vehicle, its as good as gone no matter what you do.  but to slow down any
 thieves it would be a good idea to get the basic options.  that would be:
 
 1)	ignition kill or fuel cut-off
 2)	a flashing red led
 
 these two are basic to a decent alarm system.  
 to slow down the criminal some more, get a steering wheel lock.
 that should be sufficient to persuade the thief to find an easier target.
 but, then there's always car-jacking.  
 why is life so confusing?
 i hope i helped somewhat.
