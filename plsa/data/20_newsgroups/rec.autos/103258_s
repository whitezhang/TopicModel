 think again!!  thanks to 60 minutes (tick tick tick), used 200
 quattros are bargains.. '89s go for about $15k, '90s go for perhaps 1
 or 2k more, the 20 valve 91's are quite a bit more because of an
 enormous hp and torque gain.. i think they go for about $23 to $25k if
 you can find one.  i have seen quite a lot of '89-'90 200 quattros (not
 that many wagons though) at the dealer lot.. they use very high
 quality paint and the entire car is zinc galvanized, so it will never
 rust.
 
 in short, typically a 4 yr old 200 looks no more older than a 1 year
 old and the 5 bangers are bullet proof engines.  200k out of one is
 not rare, even for a turbo, which is watercooled for the 200s.  then
 there are aftermarket chips that you can buy to bump up turbo boost...
 
 if you are into luxo-gizmos.. the cars are loaded with just about
 everything too..
 
 the price of parts is a different story though...
