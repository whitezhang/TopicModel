 i don't know where you live, but i couldn't get out of my driveway
 at night without reverse lights. as someone said, out in the country
 you notice neat little things like stars and the difference between
 day and night. at night around my house (which is amongst a forest of
 rather tall oaks) it is dark, except for nights with full moons.
 reverse lights illuminate my path very well when backing up; i greatly
 prefer cars with them to cars without operational reverse lights.
