 hey all,
 
 
 i'm looking at buying a new car, but i'm confused about the insurance
 coverage.  this also applies to my existing car insurance policy.  does
 anyone understand what the "limited tort option" means.  will it lower
 my rates if i opt to have it, or will it be more expensive if i opt
 to have it?  what does it do for me (in layman's terms please)?  is
 it a good deal or should i ignore it?  i'm not the type to sue anyone
 at a drop of the hat nor am i the type to report every little ding to
 the insurance company as a vandalism claim.  please help.
 
 
 
 thanks in advance.
 
 
 george
