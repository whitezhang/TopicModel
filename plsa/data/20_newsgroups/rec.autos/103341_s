 this is a very simplistic view of safety. assuming that you are in a collision
 (less likely with a more agile smaller car), then the important factor
 is how well does the car sacrifice itself to save you. this is why a thousand
 pound f1 car can hit a wall at 200 and the driver walks out and why
 everybody dies when a suburban hits a wall at 35 (as i recall for the last
 generation suburban hic numbers). 
 
 as an aside, just what is the point of an airbag? it seems to me that
 seatbelts with pretensioners (audi et al), or a good tight 5 point belt 
 will prevent you every moving far enough to hit the airbag. you might be
 
 saved from some flyign glass? or is an airbag just a lowest common denominator
 safety device that is of some use in a head on collision when you are
 wearing no seat belt?
