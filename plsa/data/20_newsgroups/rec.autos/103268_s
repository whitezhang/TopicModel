 
 does anyone know how to reset the service indicator of a bmw after changing
 the oil yourself?
 
 also, i have about 3,000 miles on my 525i and so far only one of the five
 yellow service indicators went out. that means i don't need oil service until
 it reach approximatly 15,000 miles which doesn't make sense to me. any idea?
 
 ps of cause i did my first oil change at 1,200 miles 
 
 
 derek
