 
    i wouldn't want anyone to make kindling out of my front living-
    room wall and then drive their diesel powered m-60 tank into it,
    shooting super-hot soot all over my curtains and that freshly 
    made kindling.
    in other words, please don't flame me!
 
 	  yup, i'll have to answer for this one.
