 i'm not sure if this made it out so i'll try again.
 
 i have an ecklar's (sp?) corvette car cover for sale.  the cover is canvas
 on the outside and felt on the inside.  it is weather proof and in great
 condition.  i'm asking $95.00 and i'll pay shipping.  (originally $175.00
 in october of 1992).
