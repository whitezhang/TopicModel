 --let me put it like this.  the only similarity between the three models
   is the "300", or 3-liter engine displacement.  actually, the sc300 (the
   coupe) and the gs300 (the funky-looking new sedan) share the same 3.0
   liter inline-six, and the es300 (popular small sedan) uses 3.0 v6 shared
   with the camry.  the sc300 is a luxury/sports coupe, the gs300 is the new
   luxury sedan, and the es300 is the base executive sedan.  all three look
   completely different.
