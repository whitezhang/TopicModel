 dumbest options? well here in the uk, bmw offer a 'no-smokers' option...
 it just means they take the fag lighter out.... big deal....
 
 btw - i just bought a honda crx f1..... its neat... did consider an mr2 targa,
 mx5 (you guys call it miata?).... but that crx just one my heart with that 
 body kit and 8-spokes.... 
 
 ps: is richard out there somewhere?
