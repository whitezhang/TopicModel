 well, the opel deal fell through...
 
 now i'm looking at a datsun 240z for sale in our local buy&sell.  any
 previous owners have any experience with these cars?  besides looking
 for rust,good compression,low miles, and all the other usual car
 things one looks for, is there anything special about these cars that
 i should watch out for?
 
 how about things like handling,performance,mileage,etc.  these cars
 look hot, to my eyes at least, and bear more than a passing
 resemblance to the aston martin db4 zagato(sp?), which has to be one
 of the most beatiful cars ever made.
 
 what is the difference between 240z, 260z, 280z?  the 280zx is rather 
 unappealing imho, but the other cars are decent.
 thanks again...
