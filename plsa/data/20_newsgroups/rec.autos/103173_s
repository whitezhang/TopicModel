 either i've just fallen for this, or you guys
 are _really_ paranoid!
 
 you're actually worried about somebody stealing 
 your oil?
 
 c'mon, you think a vandal'll do that?!
 
 that's absolutely ridiculous!
 
 besides, how hard is it to get under the car to 
 change the oil?
 
 i can say from experience on the cars that i've driven and
 changed the oil on, my mazda 323 is pretty much a pain, but
 once you've done it once, you don't forget how, and it
 gets easier.
 
 i can't imagine any other cars are much worse than mine.
