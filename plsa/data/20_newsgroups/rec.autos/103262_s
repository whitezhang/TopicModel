 sometimes a bad choke pull-off diaphram will cause a car to fast idle. the
 pull-off, which is vacuum actuated, provides a necessary pull in non-cold
 weather conditions to get the idle off the the fast idle cam. locate the
 fast idle cam on your vehicle and see if you can rotate it to produce a
 normal idle. if so, locate the diaphram and test it. if you can't apply
 suction (via a good piece of rubber vacuum hose) with your mouth that will
 cause the diaphram to retract, then it's bad and should be replaced.
