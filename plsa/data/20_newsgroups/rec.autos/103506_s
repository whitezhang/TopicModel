 i had a similar experience.  we had a written quote which had been mailed
 to us from the salesman at one of these "no-haggle" toyota dealers for
 a camry xle w/abs, leather, etc.  the price seemed fair, but when we
 went in to take them up on their offer, they "discovered" that certain
 extra cost items hadn't been included in their original written quote.
 it would have totaled an extra $1100 and, in spite of the fact that we
 had a written quote, they said there was nothing they could do.
 
 bottom line, quotes from salemen are worthless and it appears to me that
 the toyota dealers think they've got such a superior auto that they
 don't have to deal.  we walked, went out and bought a new lh car
 (eagle vision tsi) and i don't regret it one bit!
