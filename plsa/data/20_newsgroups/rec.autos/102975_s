 water gradually builds up in the trunk of my friend's 89 ford probe.  every
 once in a while we would have to remove the spare and scoop out the water
 under the plywood/carpet cover on the trunk.  i would guess this usually happens
 after a good thunder storm.  a few qs:
 
 1) is this a common problem?
 2) where are the drain holes located for the hatch?
 
 thanks for any info.
