 no, that sounds pretty reasonable for that car and that city.

 unless you have an accident, you won't need more.  if you plan on
 paying for the car with a credit card, check and see if your card
 automatically covers rental cars.  also, your own auto insurance may
 cover rental cars also.
 
 most rental companies here offer extra insurance when you rent, and
 require you to initial in several spots if you don't want it.  the
 credit cards and personal auto insurance provide the same sort of
 coverage that the rental agency is trying to sell.
 
 i have never rented from alamo, so i don't know if they follow this
 same practice.
 
 >is the beretta a good rental car?
 yes.  it is a compact 2-door, probably a bit dull performance and
 acceleration-wise, but very adequate.  it will have an automatic
 transmission, am/fm stereo, air conditioning, and possibly power 
 windows and door locks.
