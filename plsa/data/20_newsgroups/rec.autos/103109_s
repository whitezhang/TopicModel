 i have to disagree with this.  i have a 92 z28 with a 350 and a 4-speed auto
 w/ overdrive, and it is really better that way.  chevy autos are reknowned
 for their long life and ability to handle copious amount of power.  i live 
 in the dallas area, and a manual would be much harder to drive in the traffic 
 here.  now if i still lived out in the sticks like i used to, a manual would be
 more fun.  
 
 safety-wise, an auto is less distracting...i would hate to have to be    
 shifting gears while i was trying to ease into traffic in the freeways here.
 performance-wise, i can hold my own against any stock 5.0 mustang or 5.0
 camaro w/ a five speed.  
 
 all of this imho... :)
