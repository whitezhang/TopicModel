 just for the record, read your owner's manual before attempting a push start.
 most manufacturers today do not recommend this (i think the catalytic converter
 is the primary reason - unburned gas goes down to it and may ignite when
 the converter gets into its operating range).
 
 the best reason for a manual? because you like to drive one. i find that its
 much easier to develop lazy habits in an auto trans car. remember, pay 
 attention out there - stupidity behind the wheel has still taken more people
 to the morgue than drunk driving. the problem is that we don't revoke peoples
 license for stupidity.
