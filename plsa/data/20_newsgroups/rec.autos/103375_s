 yeah, it seems toyota has always had a problem with those 2.2's
 and sound. i know the celicas with em were pretty noisey, and
 the mr2s were no exception. now, about large displacement 4s
 with bad noise.. i have a 90 grand am h.o. quad 4, and it
 sounds really good, almost like a larger 6.. now, toyota
 is coming out with an all-new celica next year and the mr2...
 well who knows..
 
 later-
