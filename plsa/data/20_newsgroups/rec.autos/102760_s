 	pioneer dx 680 car stereo.
 		- cd player
 		- 18 fm presets, 6 am
 		- removable faceplate
 		- seperate component speakers professionally mounted
 		  in the doors.
 
 the car has been well maintained.  i wax it often and keep the interior
 clean.  its a good running car with a solid body (no rust thru, tiny
 spots of surface rust.  when i see a spot i touch it up.)  the stereo
 makes the car.  i have had no mechanical problems with it.
 
 i'm looking for $900.00 firm.  the car has an average wholesale value of 
 about $900.00 without the stereo.  the stereo cost me $500.00 last july.
