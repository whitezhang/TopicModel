 sure, but the surface condition of most good autobahns is far better
 than most of the roads here. a dip in the asphalt that you test your
 shocks on at 60 will kill you at 130. don't get me wrong, i love to
 drive quickly and they say my probe will do 130, but that's 30 more
 than i've ever tried in it cause there isn't a decent enough piece
 of road hereabouts.
