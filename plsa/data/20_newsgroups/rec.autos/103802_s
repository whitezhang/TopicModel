 we have seen lots of discussion on automobile engine configuration. let me ask 
 a similar question from the aviation field. you must have seen images of prop 
 planes with all cylinders exposed. i have seen up to 8 cylinders positioned 
 radially in a circular fashion with the prop at the center of the circle. 
 this arrangement always brings up a geometric dilemma. how can one crankshaft 
 throw accomodate 8 rods or are the pistons displaced but not visible from the 
 outside.
