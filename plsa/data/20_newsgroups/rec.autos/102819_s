 
 the biggest hurdle for automatics (imho) is not shifting speed
 per se, but rather the transmission's reaction speed when you
 try to force it to shift manually.  
 
 this was the biggest fault with the subaru ecvt -- it took soooooo
 lonnnnnnnnggggg for the tranny to find the right ratio.
 
 the sales propaganda says the saturn automatic is effectively an
 electronically-shifted manual.  might this mean that saturn has
 conquered the problem?  (i dunno, only driven saturn 5-speeds)
 
 input, please!
 
 another question:  any plans for a manual-trans chrysler lh?
 does anyone else out there fall asleep at night dreaming of this combo?
