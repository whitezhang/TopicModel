 they light the highways in texas?  funny, everywhere else i've been
 they only light 'em at junctions.
 
 i won't even get into how much road markings vary between states and
 localities except to say that there are some areas where markings are
 essentially nonexistant.

 i suspect you have very limited experience -- us freeways vary
 dramatically, particularly between states.  i can name a number of
 interstate highways in various parts of the country where 130 would be
 very optimistic in any car.
 
 i'm not sure what you call "quite severe" in terms of road deviations
 but i suspect every single bridge junction on i84 through ct would be
 considered so.  they're hard to take at 85mph.  that's not the only
 interstate i've seen with such deviations, but it's one i drive
 frequently.
 
 texas is pretty much an edge-case -- you can't assume that everywhere
 has roads in such good condition, such flat terrain, and such
 wide-open spaces.  it just ain't so.
