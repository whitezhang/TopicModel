 i saw an interesting product in ny auto show, and would like to 
 hear your comments.
 
 militech(tm) is yet another oil additive. but the demonstration of this
 product really impressive, if it didn't cheat.
 
 the setup of the demo is fairly simple. a cone shaped rotor is
 half submerged in a small oil sink, filled with motor oil. the rotor
 is powered by an electronic motor. a metal pad is pressed against
 the rotor using the torque wrench until the rotor stopped by friction. 
 the torque that is needed to stop rotor is read from the torque wrench.
 
 before militech was added, the rotor was stopped with about 60 lb-ft
 of torque (you pick the brand of oil, no difference). once militech was 
 added to the oil, the rotor could not be stopped even with 120+ lb-ft of
 torque. 
 
 here is the good part: even after the salesman emptied the oil sink, 
 you still could not stopped the rotor with the thin film remained  on it.
 
 they say you need only add 2oz per quart of oil every 15k miles. a 16 oz
 bottle is $25.
 
 i still have my doubts. if this product is really so great, why it was
 so little known? the salesman said it is widely used in military. i didn't
 believe it.  the demo was so impressive, that i bought a bottle against
 my common sense.
 
 has anyone heard of or actually used this product? is it real?
 if you are going to the auto show, please visit this stand on the 
 second floor. see if can find out if the demo is a hoax or not.
