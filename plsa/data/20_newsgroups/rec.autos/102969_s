 ever' once in a while, you still see a reference to the super-
 slab system as "interstate and defense highways."  but whether
 the military has much of anything that goes 80 on the road is
 another matter.  a few of their most whomped-up diesel trucks,
 maybe, load permitting.  the military surplus stuff i've
 driven -- "jeep classic" (willys/kaiser/amc, pre-independent
 suspension) and power wagons (slant 6 in a crew-cab pickup)
 weren't exactly congenial at highway speeds, and i wouldn't
 swear any of them would do 80 except as a bedload on a semi.
 
 you just gotta love the standard military tire, too, or at
 least the one they used to use.  designed circa ww ii as a
 compromise between traction in icky sticky goo and longevity
 on sharp rocks and so forth, it's quite ill-adapted to high
 speeds on civilian roadways.  for those who can't remember
 what they look like, imagine a mountain-bike tire with a
 road rib in the middle, scaled up to car size. oh, yeah, and
 narrow too. one of the standard mods for civilizing a surplus 
 jeep was to install tires and wheels that reflected some of
 the advancements made in ride and handling since d-day.
 
 but the point made by wharfie and others still stands:  if
 you're going to do 80 in a mil-spec '58 power wagon (or a
 jeep or a tank transporter or other unwieldy rubber-tired
 vehicle) anywhere, i'd suggest the american interstate.  
 your safe speed there tends to be limited more by your car
 and skills, road maintenance, and the swarms of fools around
 you; the roads were designed for going like the devil.
 
 naturally, neither i nor my employer advocates unsafe or
 unlawful driving.
