 v4s? i don't know of any. i4s and flat4s are abundant.
 
 >v6 - legend, mr3? mr6?
 
 a whole $h!tload. minivans, pickups, just about any car above the
 subcompact/compact range and below the full-size range (with a few
 exceptions).
 
 i6s are much more rare now; the only one i personally know of that's
 still in production is the venerable ford 300cid in the f-series pickups.
 i think that jeep's big 6's are also straight sixes, but i'm not a
 big jeep person.
 
 >v8 - don't know of any.
 
 where are you to not know of v8s? there are mustangs, cadillacs,
 lincolns, camaros, corvettes, thunderbirds, all real full-size
 pickups, crown vics, chevy moby^h^h^h^hcaprice ;-), and even a few
 japanese and european vee-hickles with v8s.
 
 v10 - dodge viper; dodge promises a truck with a v10.
 
 >v12 - jaguar xjs
 
 don't ferarri and lamborghini both use v-12s extensively?
