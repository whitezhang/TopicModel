 mercedes-benz announced yesterday its plans to begin building sport-utility
 vehicles in the us by 1997.  they are targeted at the jeep grand cherokee
 et al. and will reportedly sell for less than $30,000.
 
 did anyone see a picture?   is it the g-wagon (gelaendewagen) currently
 available in europe (and in the us by grey-market) or is it an entirely new
 vehicle?  any details would be appreciated.
