 talking about car alarms, there are certain cars in this country that are 
 only insurable if they are fitted with a vecta alarm. we're talking coswoths
 and porsches and stuff. just before they (the insurance companies) decided to 
 make this move, they insisted that the car be fitted with a scorpion alarm (
 now they've changed to the vecta)... so everyone who's spent $$$ on fitting 
 the scorpion alarm have founbd themselves having to upgrade to the vecta system.
 
 sad huh? :-(					...shaz...
