 sorry 'bout that - mine is a '91 model non-turbo 2.0. (with abs and revised
 suspension (whatever revised means)). i'm in australia, so we always seem to 
 get the versions without extras which the europeans and americans get as 
 standard.
 
 my query is, - why does the noise get noticeably louder about 2-3 months after
 an oil change. i just find it a bit wierd that this happens. is it the oil i'm
 using (mobil 1) or is it the engine (the 3s-ge version/model) ie. gets
 noiser the older the oil is (i'm only guessing). 
 
 its not annoyingly distressing or anything, but just slightly puzzling.
 
 
 puzzled.
