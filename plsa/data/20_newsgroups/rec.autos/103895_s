 all gimmicks!  stick with plain 'ol carnauba wax that's non-abrasive.
 eagle 1, meguiars, turtle wax, and a few others are good examples.
 the colored waxes just color in the scratches so they're not so 
 apparent.  the better approach is to buff minor scratches completely
 off with a cleaner/mild abrasive.
 
 never tried liquid glass, although i still have this sample they sent
 me a few years back.
