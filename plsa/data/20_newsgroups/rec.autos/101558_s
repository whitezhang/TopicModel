 
 i am thinking about getting an infiniti g20.
 in consumer reports it is ranked high in many
 catagories including highest in reliability index for compact cars.
 mitsubushi galant was second followed by honda accord).
 
 a couple of things though:
 1) in looking around i have yet to see anyone driving this
    car. i see lots of honda's and toyota's.
 2) there is a special deal where i can get an infinity g20, fully
    loaded, at dealer cost (i have check this out and the numbers match
    up). they are doing this because they are releasing and update mid-1993
    version (includes dual air-bags) and want to get rid of their old 1993's.
 
 i guess my question is: is this a good deal? 
 also, can anyone give me any feedback on infiniti?
 
 thanks,

 p.s.
 
 the other cars that i have test driven and which are in the
 running are:
 mitsubishi galant, honda accord, and toyota camary
