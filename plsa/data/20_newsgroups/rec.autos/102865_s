   i would suggest you take the car to the nearest chevron dealer, with
 your own oil and filter.  ask for an oil change.  it will cost less
 than $10.  watch him/her do it.  just from watching someone do a job,
 you will be able to learn and remember the sequence, and do it right
 when you do it yourself the next time.  besides, when he/she loosens
 the drain nut, the next time around it will be easier for you.
 
   if it is stuck, use an impact wrench.  not too much force though.
 use a new washer each time you put the nut back.....
