 it seems that there are more and more "bands" available for
 police radar each month.  i have recently purchased (within
 the last 8 months) the bel 966stw.  while it is not a perfect
 detector by any means, it does do the job fairly well.  
 
 now, however, i pick up a car magazine at the airport and
 read about this super ka wideband which is a superset of
 the ka wideband that this latest generation of detectors
 was touted as covering.  
 
 so now bel has a new series of detectors out that cover all
 the usual bands (x, k, ka photo, ka wideband) as well as the
 new super ka wideband.  
 
 just as there comes a point of diminishing returns when chasing
 increased pc computing power with faster and faster cpus (for
 the average home consumer, at least), it seems that there is
 now the same concern with radar detectors.  does it make sense
 to upgrade just 8 months after purchasing my "new" detector?
 is valentine upgrading their equipment?  if so, it might be 
 worth it for me to upgrade to the valentine.  i was in the 
 market for a valentine when i purchased the bel but the
 3-4 month waiting time was just too much for me since i had
 inadequate protection with my passport.  life was much simpler
 when there was just x and k band and escort has the best
 equipment on the market and there was no need to continuously
 shop for a new detector.  i hope that the flood of new radar 
 bands ceases with this new super wideband business.
