 now, my ego with regards to my shifting ability is as big as anyone else's, but
 i just ordered my first car with an auto trans. i wasn't planning on it; but
 after driving a few i was convinced: things have changed since the days of 
 "slip 'n' slide withe powerglide". they shift *better* than i do, there's no
 clutch to wear out (honda wanted $800 for my 4wd wagon last year!- got it done
 for $500), it only costs about 5% in gas milage on the highway and it makes it
 easier to concentrate on all the radios in my car ;-)
 
 (oddly enough, while two of my best friends- both in the auto industry here in the 
 motor city- have switched wholeheartedly to autos, their wives *insist* on 
 manual. shift envy?)
 
 braggadocio aside, given today's technology and the warranties they're handing 
 out the auto trans seemed like an excellent choice. call me a convert.
