 hello everyone,
    i have an insurance question.
 
 allstate insurance
 
 situation: person wrecks car. car is drivable to dealer. person 
 reports accident (no other cars involved). driver estimates damage cost 
 exceedes cost of car. insurance people claim car is "totalled" because of 
 exceeding repair costs.
 person says "wwhhhaatttt!!!! but i drove the car here!" and takes it to 
 another place. other place estimates 2,101.00 in damage. 2,000 less than the 
 dealer.
 one more hitch... the car is registered in florida but the accident occurred 
 in pennsyvania.
 
 question: should the insurance recognize and pay for the damages of this, 
 now fixable, car even though they prematurly declared totalled?
 
 please respond via e-mail if you think you know anything about this sort of 
 thing.
