 don't worry about leaks.  don't worry about which way to turn the damn thing.
 take a good claw hammer and pry it straight out.  now, you'll notice, after
 all the oil pours out, that there are no theads where there used to be.
 
 thats why 'heli coils' were invented.  yes, buy a few of these gems, and
 rethread the hole a little larger each time you change the oil.
 when the hole gets too big for any heli coil you can buy, its time to trade in
 the car...
