 these arethe numbers i have been stating in the past 5-10 messages. it
 really angers me that you insisted you were right, and that you had
 no clue what your own car weighed. why didn't you check when i first
 told you that your figures were implausible?

 i'd like to hear a better explanatin of how you come to that 
 conclusion from the above data.

 no, sorry your wrong again. *you* quoted the del sol as doing 0-60 in
 8.1 according to c+d. interestingly, the stealth es, which is
 *faster* than your rt does the samerun in 8.5 seconds according to
 c+d. kind of embarassing isn't it? why didn't you check the figures
 
 before posting? it only makes you look stupid when you are caught out
 twice with *your own* figures.

 if you insist, i gave you every chance to retract, but:
 
   dodge stealth es auto does an 8.5/16.4 - wonder why you couldn't find it?
 
 do you realize that a 9k sentra (c+d) will run a 16.7, that a sentra se-r or saturn
 will run in the 15's? don't you think it is kind of strange that your
 222hp sports car is so easily beaten. 
 
 a mustang 5.0, which weights about the same (according to *your* numbers),
 has less power and is much quicker? care to explain. don't be abusive,
 just try and come up with a rational explanation of where those 222hp
 went to, its a mystery to me.

 i guess you drove a 5 speed and couldn't shift/
