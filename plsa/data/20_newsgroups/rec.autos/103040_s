 i just had my 41 chrysler painted. i was told to refrain from waxing it and
 to leave it out in the sun!! supposedly this let's the volatiles escape from
 the paint over a month or so (i can smell it 15 feet away on a hot day) and
 lets any slight irregularites in the surface flow out, as the paint remains
 a little soft for a while.
