 any reason you are limited to the two mentioned? they aren't really at
 the same point along the suv spectrum - not to mention price range.
 how about the explorer, trooper, blazer, montero, and if the budget
 allows, the land cruiser? 
 bear in mind that 90% of all suv's purchased never venture off-road.
 carefully weigh the trade-off between comfort and off-road performance
 when choosing one, and realistically decide whether you'll actually
 make enough use of the off-road-ability to sacrifice (some of) the
 on-road comfort.
