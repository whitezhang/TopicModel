 i agree with gaia. even though the saturn has proved to be a very reliable car
 so far, a little money spent now is worth the peace of mind.
 
 in my opinion, getting the powertrain warranty is enough. in my case, that's be
 cause; anything that needed repairing in the interior (sunroof, windows, doors,
  etc.) i could do myself. i just didn't want to mess with the engine and such.
 
 plus i think the extra 3 years of 24-hour roadside assistance must be worthe so
 meting. i opted for the 5 year plan for $375.
