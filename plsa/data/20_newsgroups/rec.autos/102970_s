 well, i'm afraid the time has come; my rice-burner has finally died.
 i'd always promised my wife that we would do a scandanavian tour when
 my car died and pick up a volvo in sweden, drive it around and then
 import it home. 
 
 can anyone give me 1) advice on feasibility and relative costs 2)
 references where i might learn more 3) personal experience?
 
 please email
 
 thanks
