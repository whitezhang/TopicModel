 yep, that's when i noticed it too. i stopped replacing the hood badge  
 after the second or third one (at $12.00 each).
 
 2002 drivers used to flash their headlight at each other in greeting. try  
 flashing your headlights at a 318i driver and see what kind of look you  
 get. they usually check their radar detector...they think you're alerting  
 them to a cop.
