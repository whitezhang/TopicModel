 	checker motors went out of business in 1982.  it's hard to get
 old checkers that are worth restoring, since almost every one was
 a fleet vehicle that was driven into the ground.  if you can get a 
 body in decent shape the mechanicals should all be available _somewhere_ - 
 checker used whatever parts were around.  for instance, i had a chevy
 straight six and a gmc truck radiator and a ford rear in mine.
