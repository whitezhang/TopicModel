 foot in mouth again, drew.  the first generation mr 2's were 1.6's which 
 were very smooth.  i'd be real surprised if the original poster was talking
 about a 1st generation car.  the second generation cars were 2.2 for the
 non turbo and 2.0 for the turbo.  i drove the non turbo 2.2 and calling it
 unpleasant is to be kind to it..

 wrong and wrong.  mitsubishi owns the patent, which has since expired
 which is why everybody with a shred of integrity is putting balance
 shafts into their big 4's.. the notable exception is nissan.. and only
 for the us market suckers.  i guess we need to write to c&d and start
 telling them to publish graphs for engine vibration over rpm.  then
 you'll see usenet discussions of the form: engine a has peak
 vibrations 3 db less than engine b, therefore engine a is better than
 engine b.
 
 1/2 :-)
