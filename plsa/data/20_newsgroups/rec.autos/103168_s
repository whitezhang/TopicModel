 i couldnt agree more.  that is how it should work. people should also always see motorcycles too.
 
 i constantly scan behind me (i have one of those wink mirrors) and two outside mirrors.  i actually spend just as much time checking my six (cops you know).
 
 i still get caught off guard every now and then. 
 
 
 maybe i didnt word it right the first time.  what i was trying to say was that if you plan to blow by somebody at a very high speed differential and you assume you are safe because the guy sees you, you are stupid (of course, it depends on the circumstances).  i have had some very scary instances when i assumed this and i dont think all of the fault was the other guy (now if he was going 25 in a 55 thats a whole different story)
