 anybody got any good/bad experience with selling their car through one of
 those car hunters?  i'm selling a 1991 dodge stealth r/t and i was contacted
 by this company called the markham group based out of illinois.  
 
 they said they have 7-10 buyers in my area interested in my car or they wouldn't
 be talking to me.  they talked to me for a good 20 minutes asking everything
 about my car and said they could sell it no problem.  they guaranteed that if
 they didn't sell my car in 75 days, i would get my money back ($389) and since
 i charged it, i'm protected by federal law which states that if i'm not satisfied,
 i would get a refund (which is true).  they federal expressed all the paperwork 
 to me which had a contract stating their policy about the 75 days and such.
 
 i called up the bbb in illinois and they do not have a file on them which is
 good news.  so they definitely are a legitimate company but so far, it's been
 over week and i have gotten nothing.  so how effective are these types of 
 companies? anybody care to share their experiences?
