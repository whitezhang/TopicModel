 i grew up in new york city so i rode in many checker cabs.  the jump
 seats were fun as a kid.  although the cars were roomy -- a good trait
 for a taxi -- they had a design flaw that i don't understand they never
 fixed: the rear passengers tended to fall out of their seats when the
 driver braked.  i wouldn't want to take a long ride in the back seat of
 one of these vehicles.  why did you like yours?  i never drove one, so
 i have to ask.
