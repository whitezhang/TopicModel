  i was wondering if anyone out there could enlighten me on this car i saw
 the other day. it was a 2-door sports car, looked to be from the late 60s/
 early 70s. it was called a bricklin. the doors were really small. in addition,
 the front bumper was separate from the rest of the body. this is 
 all i know. if anyone can tellme a model name, engine specs, years
 of production, where this car is made, history, or whatever info you
 have on this funky looking car, please e-mail.
 
 thanks,
