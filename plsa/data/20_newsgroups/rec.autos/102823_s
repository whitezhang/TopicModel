 ford tried that also, back in 1983.  my 1983 ranger pickup had the horn at
 the end of the turn-signal stalk, instead of in the center of the wheel where
 god intended it to be. :-)  i drove two different cars then (the other an
 1984 camry), and never did get used to pushing the turn-signal stalk to
 blow the horn.  the only time i got it right was when i was getting the
 annual state-required safety inspection!
 not one of ford's better ideas.
