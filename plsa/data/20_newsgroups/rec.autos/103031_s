 not a flame, just a point:  i'd be scared at 130 here, not because i feel
 _i_  or my car couldn't handle it, but because of exactly what you said:
 drivers who are stupid.  like the ones who are doing 130 also, and so
 they pull in right behind you at maybe 1-2 car lengths....oh yeah, real
 smart...  this scares me in cities at 50.  when i can't see enough of
 the car to make it recognizable, they are following too close.  and 
 when i see them doing this and reading a newspaper.....*sigh*...this
 is why america has 55-65 speed limits: our drivers are too dumb to realise
 that reading the paper should be done at breakfast, or work, not in their
 car.
