 
  i am a little confused on all of the models of the 88-89 bonnevilles.
 i have heard of the le se lse sse ssei. could someone tell me the
 differences are far as features or performance. i am also curious to
 know what the book value is for prefereably the 89 model. and how much
 less than book value can you usually get them for. in other words how
 much are they in demand this time of year. i have heard that the mid-spring
 early summer is the best time to buy.
