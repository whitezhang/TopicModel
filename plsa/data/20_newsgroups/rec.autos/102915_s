 if it is the first set of brake pads on front, then this is fine. my car
 eats a set every 15k miles or so. the fact that he is replacing the
 muffler too is also ok.
 
 >would other things break down or have to be replaced soon?
 
 the mileage is fairly low - but typical fwd stuff is cv joints. check
 the maintenance records with the manufacturers requirements for valve
 adjustments, timing belt changes and so on.
 
 the 60k mile service is often expensive, so make sure he has done everything.

 well, this is one of the commonly cited methods for identifying a
 car with highway miles. 
 might check the gas pedal wear too. ask him how many sets of tires he
 has been through. a highway car might have squeezed by on 2 sets,
 a hard driven car 6-10 sets.

 well, the maxima should be pretty reliable - but if its out of warranty
 you should get it checked out by someone knowledgeable first. stuff
 for japanese cars can be expensive.

 1995 model year, i believe.
