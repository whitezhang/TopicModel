 don't worry about this -- they'll drop you like a hot potato after you do
   make a claim. they'll just make filing the claim a pain, but it will end
   when they leave you in the lurch.

 more than that. geico funded the company that developed lidar. when locals 
   showed a reluctance to buy the units, geico started giving them away. i
   know they've given units to the florida highway patrol, county sheriff's a
   and some local governments.
 the real question is why? this is the hook. geico, and other ins. co.s can
   tell which drivers represent risk. this is a determination they can make
   after you receive a speeding ticket from one of geico's lidar units. most
   drivers do not represent increased risk even after a ticket or two, but 
   this gives them the opportunity to raise rates for equal risk. it's called
   extra profits. they also know how silly the nsl is, and how it is almost
   universally ignored. driving in excess of the nsl gets you a ticket, an
   increase in your rates, points on your license --- but it doesn't make you
   a riskier driver to insure.
 like the sound of this? like the people who thought up the scheme? go geico!
 
 unless you have some driving history problems, you're usually better to go
 with one of the major companies and stay there. you'll get long term customer
 discounts on your premiums. now, about the % of your premium that is paid as
 commission. that's another story for another day.
