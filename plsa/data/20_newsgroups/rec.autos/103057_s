 
 i would also be interested in finding out about the '94 talon,
 and i suspect that many other people would be interested too,
 so let's get some responses on the net.
 
 the question again:
 does anyone have any info on the 1994 eagle talon / mitsubishi
 eclipse / plymouth laser?
 
 i know that the old talon was based on the mitsubishi galant,
 and that in japan, a 240 hp twin-turbo v6 1994 galant has been
 released.
 
 so anyway, any info on the '94 talon would be appreciated.
