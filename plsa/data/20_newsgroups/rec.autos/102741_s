 this makes sense(radar pointed down), because almost every train i pass head-on that triggers
 my radar detector does so more just after i have passed the front of the engine.
 i get a little of the reflections as i am approaching and the instant i get to
 the side of the first engine the detector receives a fairly strong signal for
 a short time. it happens with just about every train i see.
