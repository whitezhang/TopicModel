 : as the subject says, i am moving from mass. to calif. and will be driving
 : mostly on interstate 80.
 : any advice from folks who have done it before?
 
 - plan your gas stops in major-city areas to avoid the 25 cent-per-gallon
 "only gas station for 50 miles and you're an out-of-towner" surcharge.
 
 - prepare your car.  don't forget things like your fuel & air filters.  if
 you're loading your car up, consider putting your spare on top of your stuff
 just in case of a flat.  in my x-country trip, a tire disintegrated in the
 california desert & it took me 20 minutes to unload all my stuff to get to
 the tire.
 
 - if you have a hatchback, cover all your stuff with a white bedsheet to help
 keep the stuff and your car cool, as well as *possibly* avoiding theft.
 
 - mcdonalds have good, clean bathrooms.
 
 - invest in a $30 cb & magnetic roof antenna.  it may help if you're stranded,
 and you can always ask people for places to stop for food, etc.
 
 - many times police like to hang out in the 1st 10 miles after you enter a
 new state, to catch all the speeders who have "escaped" the previous state.
 
 - same as above; when you enter a 55mph city zone after hours and hours of
 65mph rural interstate
