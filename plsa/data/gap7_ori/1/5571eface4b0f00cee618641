POLICE Scotland have had a bungled bid to shut down The Arches nightclub thrown out.
Lawyers for the popular night spot successfully argued that the force had used the wrong legislation and failed to include a complaint of violent disorder.
Glasgow's Licensing authority refused to grant a closure order, but said a new fresh complaint would be considered as soon as possible. Police had submitted a report after 26 people were reported over drugs and alcohol offences at the club.
It came 14 months after an underage schoolgirl died after taking ecstasy at the venue.
 

On Sunday, a member of staff was reported for an alleged licensing offence, while a 30-year-old woman was found unconscious outside the venue in what club bosses say was an “alcohol-related episode”.
The Arches' lawyer Robert Skinner said 15 reports of drug offences on Saturday were searches by door stewards and that a series of alcohol offences were from clubbers being searched in the street after police emptied the venue.
Police Scotland said its response had been appropriate and the number of offences proved that.
