WILDLIFE crime officers are investigating following the discovery of a dead bird of prey.
The buzzard was found by a member of the public on Friday in the Millcroft area of Strathaven, South Lanarkshire.
Police Scotland said they are working to establish the cause of death and to find out whether any crime was committed.
Pc David Woods said: &quot;Due to the inherent scavenging nature of buzzards, they are particularly vulnerable to the illegal use of poisonous bait.
&quot;We will be working closely with experts at the Scottish Agricultural College and Science and Advice for Scottish Agriculture to carry out a post-mortem examination and toxicology tests to determine cause of death.&quot;
Anyone in the area who saw any suspicious activity is urged to contact police on 101.
