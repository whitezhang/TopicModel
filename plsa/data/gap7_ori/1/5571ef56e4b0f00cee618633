 OUR April Fool story was so convincing even the employees at Tunnock’s bakers thought it was real. 
We joined in the annual fun yesterday with a tall tale about Scotland’s iconic bakers sponsoring traffic crossings around the country.
 Zebra crossings would be replaced by brightly coloured biscuit wrapping and Belisha beacons were to be replaced by flashing Teacakes . 
The prank hit the sweet spot online, too, sparking debate on Twitter and Facebook.
Last night, biscuit boss Boyd Tunnock said: “It worked a treat.
“One of the girls in the office actually thought it was true until I told her it was a spoof.
“We even had a message from our competitors Lees congratulating us on the joke. I thought the April Fool was a great idea. And there could be some mileage in it.
“Our red and yellow colours looked very &shy;dominant on the crossings. It got people talking and it was great fun.”
 

On Facebook, Jim Shovelin said: “ You’ll be able to use these to go to the shop for your Tennent’s Lager flavour crisps.”
And Linda Nash said: “Would love this if it was true… would bring a smile to most people’s faces.”
Over on Twitter, @whiteheadsheila tweeted: “If only…”
And @dinnerpartyclub warned: “Zebra crossings sponsored by #Tunnock’s sadly have a very short use by date.”
While @benthebass6 tweeted: “good God, very nearly fell for that and then someone reminded me it’s the 1st April, who’d have thought eh?”
