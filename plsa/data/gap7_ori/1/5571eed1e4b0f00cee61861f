A FITNESS trainer shot outside his home may have been targeted by a love rival, detectives believe.
Stephen Fitzgerald, 28, was gunned down when he returned home from taking an exercise class last Wednesday.
He was discovered by his father, Stephen snr, lying in a pool of blood outside the house.
Stephen, from Parkhouse, Glasgow, is recovering at the city’s Western Infirmary after emergency surgery.
It’s understood detectives have been able to question him but he remembers little about the attack, which happened on March 25.
Sources say they don’t believe the shooting is related to drugs or gang violence and are looking at it being linked to a “personal relationship”.
His sister Adele, 35, confirmed yesterday that police had asked the family for details about his past relationships.
She said: “The CID have asked me about that as well. But I don’t know anything about it. I don’t know what people are thinking has happened.”
 

Detectives believe a stolen Mazda found burnt out nearby in Cadder may have been used as a getaway vehicle .
Detective Inspector Jim Bradley said: “Following extensive inquiries, we are satisfied the injured man was the intended target of the attack.
“We believe he was targeted by someone who knows his routine and was possibly followed to Haywood Street.”
Bradley appealed for anyone who saw the maroon or burgundy Mazda 6 car on the evening of the attack to get in touch.
It was stolen from Riddrie on March 11 and fitted with the false registration SN14 NRJ.
