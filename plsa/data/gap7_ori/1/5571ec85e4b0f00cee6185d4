POWERFUL new bugs which resist antibiotics could kill 80,000 Britons in the next few years, according to experts.
An official Government report has raised serious concerns about an outbreak of drug-resistant bacteria.
Such bugs would turn routine medical treatments into high-risk procedures.
The warning comes from the National Risk Register of Civil Emergencies.
The assessment says if a widespread outbreak of a resistant blood infection occurred, around 200,000 people in Britain could be affected and 80,000 of them would die.
The report adds: “The numbers of infections complicated by anti-microbial resistance are expected to increase markedly over the next 20 years. Much of modern medicine – organ transplant, bowel surgery and some cancer treatments – may become unsafe.
“And influenza pandemics would become more serious without effective treatments.”
Professor Sally Davies, chief medical officer for England, said last year: “The world simply cannot afford not to take action to tackle the alarming rise in resistance to antibiotics.”
