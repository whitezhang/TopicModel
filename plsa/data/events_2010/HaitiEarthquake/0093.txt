About a hundred people gathered in Ankeny Square Thursday night to remember those who lost their lives in this week¡¯s devastating earthquake in Haiti and to show support to those struggling to survive and to those going to help in the relief effort.

It was also an effort to encourage people to donate to the cause.

Flickers of hope burned from the ends of candles and the support from the community meant the world to Judith and Carlos Gelin who haven¡¯t hear from family in Haiti since Tuesday¡¯s earthquake.

I realized that there are good people in the world,¡± said Judith who is the executive director of the Society for Haitian Arts and Culture.  ¡°They have good hearts and they really care about other people. I couldn¡¯t believe that. I¡¯m very happy for that.¡±

But she said it has been a stressful time as she and her husband Carlos wait to hear from family members.
 
The Gelins have more than 100 family members in Haiti and the fact that they haven¡¯t yet heard from any of them has the Gelins especially worried.

Cassandra Nelson, of Mercy Corps, is among the few who can go and help in the relief effort. She finished packing for her trip to Haiti Thursday.

As an emergency worker, she¡¯s helped in disasters in Afghanistan and the Indonesian tsunami, but she leaves for Haiti with mixed feelings.

¡°They need assistance desperately,¡± Nelson said. ¡°So I¡¯m really happy to be part of that. But at the same time I think it¡¯s going to be a really hard mission.¡±
