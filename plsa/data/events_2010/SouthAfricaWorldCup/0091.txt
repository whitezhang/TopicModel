Diego Maradona demanded an apology from the international footballing media in a press conference ahead of Argentina¡¯s decisive clash with Mexico on Sunday, where FC Barcelona attacker Lionel Messi will try to lead the squad into the quarter-finals of the tournament.

Maradona and his players were widely criticized during their qualifying campaign, and only the most die-hard fans rated their chances of lifting the trophy in July. But the Argentines have breezed through the first round of the competition, thanks largely to inspiring performances from La Liga players Messi and Higuain, and must now be taken seriously as title contenders.

Maradona seized on his team¡¯s positive performances and exclaimed that ¡°Many journalists should apologize to the players. I¡¯m not suggesting you drop your trousers, but it would be honest and great so we all get along better. It isn¡¯t easy going from being nobodies back home to winning three matches at a World Cup. At the training camp, we had to swallow what you all said about us being a disaster ¡ª the worst Argentine team you¡¯d ever seen. All of a sudden we¡¯re an excellent team ¡­ the most handsome people in the ¡®barrio!¡±

Argentina eliminated Mexico [2-1] when the two sides met in the Germany 2006 finals four years ago in a pulsating match that was only decided in extra time.
