The Delph Methodist Cubs have begun a fundraising effort to help victims of the recent flooding in Pakistan. They¡¯re urging local people to donate any leftover foreign currency they may have lying around.

The UN estimates than 20 million people have been affected by the devastating floods, which first hit Pakistan back in July. More than 1,600 people are thought to have died, with more than one million homes destroyed.

Local Parish Councillor Ken Hulme, who is the leader of the Delph Cubs, Delph Methodists Cub Leader Ken Hulme said: ¡°I¡¯m proud to say our cubs and beavers  have  raised hundreds of pounds for past appeals but the scale of the Pakistan Flood Disaster exceeds them all.¡±

He continued: ¡°We are asking people to dig out their spare foreign currency and either take it down to Delph Library and drop it in our
collecting box there or drop it off at my house ¨C 28 Sevenacres, Delph. We will then turn the foreign currency into funds the Disasters Emergency Committee can use for emergency aid.¡±

Cllr Hulme also thanked the Delph Community Association for their support. For more information about the appeal, Cllr Hulme can be contacted on 01457 872859.
