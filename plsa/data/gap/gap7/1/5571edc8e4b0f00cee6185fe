BOSSES at a controversial nightspot have warned clubbers of a tough new clampdown on all drugs, including legal highs.
A statement on the website for The Arches in Glasgow states that anyone found with drugs will be reported to the police.
The move comes after a failed attempt by police to shut the venue down.
Officers lost their second bid to close it after an unconscious 30-year-old woman was found outside the club last Sunday.
Officers asked for a closure order from Glasgow City Council’s licensing board after a string of problems at the venue.
But the application was rejected after The Arches’ lawyer argued that a closure order was not appropriate.
