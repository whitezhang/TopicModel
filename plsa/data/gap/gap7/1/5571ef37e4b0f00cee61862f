A CROOK who bragged about his new &pound;30,000 truck after going bankrupt has had it ticketed – while he was in court.
Convicted fraudster Robert Kelbie’s shiny Ford Ranger was parked illegally outside Edinburgh’s Justice of the Peace Court for nearly 90 minutes.
Inside, Kelbie, a serial driving offender, was being fined &pound;460 with six penalty points for speeding and using a phone at the wheel.
He was already banned – he lost his licence under totting up rules last week – and it was his fourth offence of driving while on the phone.
JP Neil Morrison told Kelbie he had put other drivers at risk and should have learned his lesson by now, but decided against extending his ban.
Kelbie, 31, will get his licence back in September with the six points already on it. His solicitor told the court he “certainly” had the money to pay a fine.
 

 
A friend drove the truck to court.
Kelbie, of Ratho Station near Edinburgh, was made bankrupt in December over council tax debt and is understood to owe nearly &pound;100,000 to various creditors.
But the cocky crook still boasted on Facebook about his new truck , posting a photo with the message: “This is my new motor.”
The truck bears the livery of a driveway firm Kelbie set up two months before he went bust, and it can’t be seized to pay his debts if it belongs to the company.
Ex-boxer Kelbie was told to pay &pound;34,000 under Proceeds of Crime law in 2012 after admitting mortgage frauds worth &pound;145,000.
He is notorious for a long-running feud with convicted drug dealer Mark Richardson. He was shot outside a gym in 2010 and Richardson’s dad was attacked with baseball bats.
