An airline have banned booze on a notorious flight from Scotland to party island Ibiza.
Ryanair told passengers travelling from Glasgow Prestwick to the Spanish isle that they will no longer be able to take alcohol on board.
Bosses yesterday confirmed it is the only one of their flights hit by the new restrictions.
An email being sent to passengers flying to Ibiza states: “Customers will not be allowed to carry alcohol on board and all cabin baggage will be searched at boarding gates.
 

“Any alcohol purchased in airport shops or elsewhere must be packed in a suitable item of baggage, which will be tagged and placed in the aircraft hold free of charge. Customers attempting to conceal alcohol will be denied travel without refund or compensation.”
Last September the flight hit the headlines when a video emerged showing drunk passengers chanting, swearing and stamping their feet on the plane.

And in 2013 the flight had to be diverted to Beauvais airport, near Paris, because of drunk passengers causing trouble.
Ryanair said: “The comfort and safety of our customers and crew is our No1 priority and we will not tolerate unruly behaviour at any time.”
