A FAMILY'S Easter getaway was ruined last night after they narrowly escaped death - as their car terrifyingly burst into flames on the M74.
Their motor sparked alight just outside of Johnstonebridge as they headed north and within minutes the blaze was out of control.
As they dashed out and took refuge, black smoke billowed into oncoming traffic.
An onlooker said: &quot;You could see the flames from about a mile away.
&quot;The entire front half of the car was on fire and melting away.
&quot;It looked like something out of a movie.
&quot;It was a miracle no one was killed.
&quot;But it was a real shame to see all their stuff and their roof box being destroyed.&quot;
&quot;Fire crews rushed to the scene after panicked motorists called the emergency services.&quot;
Scottish Fire &amp; Rescue confirmed they attended a vehicle blaze on the southbound carriage of the M74 earlier this evening.
