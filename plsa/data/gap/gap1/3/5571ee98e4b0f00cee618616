A DAD was run over after tackling hammer-wielding robbers who terrorised his family when they broke in to steal the keys to his high-performance car.
Steven Stewart, 38, was knocked down as he attempted to stop the thugs stealing his Mercedes van.
 One of them mowed him down in a stolen car at the end of his street in Cumbernauld , near Glasgow , as he gave chase on foot. 
Steven and his wife Janice, 36, were asleep on Tuesday night when they heard noises from downstairs.
When he went to investigate he was confronted by two men who shouted “armed police”.
They demanded the keys to his high-performance Audi RS6 while threatening him with a hammer.
They had already stolen the keys to Steven’s company van and his wallet from his office in the house.
Steven, who runs Holyrood Glass, said: “I can’t believe that people would be so callous to come in to a home with small children and threaten someone like that.
“Generally when you disturb a burglar they run off, but even after I confronted them they still demanded the keys.
“After I refused to hand them over they just walked out the house and one got in my van and the other got into the Golf.
“I chased them out the estate, and the one in the Golf ran me over.”
The couple’s children, Simonne, seven, and 13-year-old Elise, and Janice’s parents who also stay in the house were left terrified by the incident.
Janice, 36, said: “They need to be caught before they do this again as they could seriously hurt someone next time.”
