A YOUNG hero with Down’s Syndrome has been made an honorary firefighter after saving his mum and brother from their burning home.
Brave Lee McGinley, 25, ran from his room as the flames and smoke took hold to help his mother Anne-Marie and brother Sean to safety.
The crew who raced to the scene from nearby Calton Community Fire Station in Glasgow reckon Lee saved lives that night.
And they gave him a hero’s welcome at the station to thank him for his fast thinking and courage.
Group manager Jim Cavanagh said: “This was a serious fire that really would likely have ended in tragedy had it not been for Lee’s quick actions.
“It spread very rapidly and the home was badly affected by intense heat, flames and thick toxic smoke.
“By immediately getting himself and his brother straight out, Lee undoubtedly prevented very serious injury or even loss of life.
“He was a firefighter that night – and we’re delighted to say that he’s part of the Calton team.”
The Calton boys invited Lee and nephew Ben, nine, to the station as a reward. Lee joined the crew in some training drills and was presented with a certificate of achievement and his own firefighter’s helmet.
 

Lee also got a signed Celtic strip with a message from manager Ronny Deila and a voucher to replace computer games he lost in the fire.
He told the firefighters: “Thanks for everything you’ve done. I was a firefighter that night – now I’m one of your crew. It’s great.”
Lee and Anne-Marie were checked by paramedics at the scene and didn’t have to go to hospital.
Sean was treated at Glasgow Royal Infirmary for minor burns and the effects of breathing smoke.
The fire, which broke out shortly before midnight, left the family home so badly damaged that they’ve had to be rehoused while it’s repaired.
