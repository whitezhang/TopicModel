 THE CASH-strapped NHS in Scotland is paying out tens of millions of pounds in bonus payments to leading medical staff. 
Consultants are taking home payments of up to &pound;75,000 a year through the system of “distinction awards” and “discretionary points”, on top of annual salaries of up to &pound;102,000.
And the total bill has increased to &pound;40 million a year, says the Scotsman newspaper.
The payouts went up by almost &pound;700,000 in total across Scotland last year, figures obtained under Freedom of Information laws have shown.
When she was health minister in 2010, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon pledged to bring bonuses for top medical staff under control and is now facing calls to explain the rise.
Although “distinction awards” have come down, in line with Ms Sturgeon’s pledge, other “discretionary” payments by health boards have soared by more than &pound;3.5 million.
The revelations follow several cases - highlighted by Record - which saw many patients left waiting for hours in extremely busy Accident &amp; Emergency departments. Official NHS figures have shown that waiting times targets have been regularly missed.
Consultants can expect to earn a basic salary of &pound;76,000 to &pound;102,000, depending on their level of seniority. Many already supplement this by doing operations in the private sector.
Liberal Democrat health spokesman Jim Hume said: “It is right that we reward exceptional performance and that is what we get from doctors in our NHS on a daily basis. But as with any other area of public spending, SNP ministers need to be transparent about pay awards.”
Conservative health spokesman Jackson Carlaw said: “This is yet another example of Nicola Sturgeon pledging one thing and delivering quite another. Patients will question whether or not this is the best use of significant NHS funds.
“Consultants of course are highly skilled and valuable, but they are also well remunerated.”
The biggest payouts were in Greater Glasgow and Clyde where &pound;12.2m was paid out in 2013-14, up by &pound;500,000 on the previous year, while &pound;6.6m was paid out in Lothian.
In Grampian, 53 consultants enjoyed distinction payments last year ranging from &pound;31,959 to &pound;75,899, the figures reveal.
And 228 consultants in the north east received discretionary payments ranging from &pound;3,204 to &pound;25,632.
In Lanarkshire, nine staff received distinction payments ranging from &pound;63,194 to &pound;21,066, while 193 got discretionary payments of up to &pound;25,632.
