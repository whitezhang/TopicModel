SHOCKED G4S guards have told how they were given redundancy notices – while handcuffed to prisoners.
The stunned workers were escorting cons on visits to hospitals when bosses broke the news that their contracts were being ripped up. 
Union leaders said they were given the choice of redundancy or cuts to pay and hours that would cost more than &pound;4000 a year.
They said 56 guards got the letters, and at least 10 of them were cuffed to prisoners at the time.
Steve Farrell of the guards’ union, Community, said: “In 20 years, I’ve never heard of such an inhumane way of treating staff.
“It was humiliating, degrading and a total disgrace. G4S should be ashamed.
“In 2015, there are many ways of communicating with people. It’s a terrible indignity to serve such a letter in front of someone else, never mind a handcuffed prisoner.”

The guards were given the letters on Wednesday in swoops on hospitals in Perth, Glasgow and Wishaw, Lanarkshire.
Other workers affected had letters hand-delivered to their homes the next day – by colleagues who normally monitor offenders on tags or early release programmes.
Farrell said police were called to one house after a guard’s wife refused to accept the letter and the person delivering it was “persistent to the point of causing offence”.
He claimed G4S were scrambling to save money after signing a “loss leader” Scottish Government contract that they couldn’t make pay. He urged bosses to negotiate.
G4S said overall staff numbers in their prisoner escort business had increased, but 50 roles were being made redundant as part of a “restructuring”.
A spokesman said: “We have taken steps to help these colleagues through this change. All those affected have been offered alternative roles, financial support and protection of their hours.
“We took the decision to inform all those affected at the same time, and regrettably this meant some colleagues were on duty. We are sorry for any distress this caused.”
