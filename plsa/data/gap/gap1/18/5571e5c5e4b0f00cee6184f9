A teenager has been arrested over the attempted murder of two brothers.
The victims, named locally as Peter and James Stewart, required hospital treatment after the incident in a stairwell in Edinburgh's Wardieburn Place West earlier this month.
It happened after the pair had travelled more than 100 miles from Aberdeen to buy a car.
A 16-year-old man has now been arrested by police in connection with the incident.
A report is being sent to the procurator fiscal and he is due to appear at Edinburgh Sheriff Court on Tuesday.
Officers said inquiries into the incident are continuing.Try our news quiz
