SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon tried her hand at gymnastics during a visit to a gym in Cumbernauld where she launched the SNP's youth manifesto.She looked at ease trying out some of the equipment.She was accompanied by actor Martin Compston, who made his name as a troubled teenager in Ken Loach's Sweet Sixteen.Ms Sturgeon said: &quot;The biggest investment we can make in Scotland's future is in our young people - and as First Minister I am determined to do everything I can to support and empower them.&quot;Last year's referendum showed us that the case for extending the right to vote to 16 and 17 year olds in every election is now unanswerable. The SNP will keep pushing for votes at 16 and 17 in all elections.&quot;In government in Scotland, the SNP is delivering 30,000 modern apprenticeships a year and we are expanding entitlement to Education Maintenance Allowance - scrapped south of the border - to support 57,000 school pupils and college students, making it easier for them continue their education.&quot;We have restored free higher education - and there will be no tuition fees in Scotland for as long as the SNP are in office.&quot;A strong team of SNP MPs at Westminster would support the reduction of tuition fees for students south of the border - giving more young people south of the border the chance to go to university.&quot;The SNP leader added: &quot;This is an example of the progressive influence the SNP can have at Westminster - and demonstrates exactly how we can help deliver policies for the benefit of people beyond Scotland.&quot;We are doing all we can to strengthen and grow our economy to provide more opportunities for young people close to home - in numbers at Westminster we go further, pushing for an increase in the minimum wage for under 18s by over &pound;1.20 an hour to ensure more young people are better paid.&quot;A strong team of SNP MPs will stand up for the rights of young people at every turn and deliver the progressive action that is needed to support more of our young people into work, education or training.&quot;Compston, the star of the police drama Line of Duty said that while 16 and 17 year olds could not vote in May's General Election, Scottish nationalist MPs at Westminster would &quot;ensure their voices are heard loudly and clearly&quot;.Compston, who joined the SNP in the wake of last-year's independence referendum, declared the party's &quot;commitment to Scotland's young people is clear&quot;.While 16 and 17-year-olds could vote in that ballot, they are not allowed to have a say in the General Election.Compston said: &quot;Young people under 18 might be being denied the chance to vote at this election - but the SNP will ensure their voices are heard loudly and clearly at Westminster.&quot;Labour, the Lib Dems and the Tories all have a track record of broken promises: introducing fees of thousands of pounds a year south of the border and failing to protect young Scots from the worst impacts of Tory cuts. Only the SNP can be trusted to stand up for Scotland's young people.&quot;The SNP youth manifesto states that 16 and 17 year olds should be entitled to vote in all elections, as well as pledging to increase the minimum wage for under 18s by &pound;1.20 an hour and to create 30,000 modern apprenticeships each year.The party will continue to oppose the introduction of tuition fees for Scottish students at university north of the border, and its MPs would vote in favour of reducing tuition fees across the UK.Labour leader Jim Murphy has urged Nicola Sturgeon to &quot;stop the spin and come clean on her plans for a second referendum&quot;.Former prime minister Gordon Brown warned yesterday that the SNP was seeking a strong representation in Westminster in order to &quot;twist the arms&quot; of MPs into granting another referendum.But Ms Sturgeon insists this election is not about another referendum and says she will not be pressured into it by her rank-and-file if she does not think Scotland is ready for a re-run.Speaking ahead of a visit to a school basketball court, Mr Murphy said: &quot;A vote for the SNP will put Scotland on the road to a second referendum.&quot;Nicola Sturgeon promised the referendum was a once in a lifetime event, then it was once in a generation, then it was 15 years and now it's being planned for the 2016 manifesto.&quot;The priority for SNP MPs after this election won't be improving the economy, it will be planning the second referendum campaign.&quot;Elsewhere, Liberal Democrat deputy leader Sir Malcolm Bruce will join North East Liberal Democrats as they campaign for Gordon candidate Christine Jardine in Stoneywood.Scottish Conservative party leader Ruth Davidson will say professionals and &quot;Tartan Tories&quot; that defected to the SNP are flocking back to the Conservatives for the General Election.
