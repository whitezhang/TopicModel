THE body of tragic student Karen Buckley arrived home in Ireland yesterday – two weeks after she was reported missing in Scotland.
Her parents John, 62, Marian, 61, and three brothers flew from Glasgow to Cork with her remains, ahead of her funeral in Mourneabbey tomorrow.
The 24-year-old’s body was released to the family after a final post mortem in Glasgow on Friday.
Alexander Pacteau, 21, has been charged with her murder.
Aer Lingus stepped in to arrange the special flight to take Karen home.

Her relatives were supported on the heartbreaking journey by their local priest Father Joe O’Keeffe.
On arrival in Cork, Karen’s body was taken home in a silver hearse, followed by her parents and brothers Brendan, 32, Kieran, 28, and Damien, 27.
A vigil for Karen was held in Glasgow yesterday. Mourners met in Partick’s Mansfield Park to light candles in her memory.
