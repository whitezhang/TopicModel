AMERICAN football legend Lawrence Tynes is suing his former club for millions for the illness which ended his career.
The Scot, 36, caught MRSA at a Tampa Bay Buccaneers training camp in 2013 and was forced to quit the sport when it infected his toe.
He’s claiming $20million (&pound;13.2million) from the Florida team for loss of earnings.
The specialist kicker – twice a Super Bowl champ with the New York Giants in 2007 and 2011 – says he almost lost his toe when the disease took hold, though Buccaneers doctors missed the signs.
He said: “I found my own doctor in town. He looked at my toe and told me, ‘You have MRSA.’
“I’m at a billion-dollar company with supposedly the best doctors in the world, and not one of them told me I had it.”
Tynes lived in Greenock until moving to the States aged 10. He also had a spell with the Scottish Claymores in 2002.
