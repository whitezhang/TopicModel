THE wife of Scots rugby legend Gavin Hastings has revealed how being blighted with Parkinson’s disease means strangers sometimes accuse her of being drunk.
Diane Hastings said people stare at her because of her symptoms, which include twitching and erratic body movements,
This month, after she tripped and stumbled while walking arm in arm with a friend from a restaurant to her car, a stranger threatened to report them for drink-driving.
Diane said: “It was only when Gavin arrived and said, ‘Well, she does walk funny but she has Parkinson’s disease’, that the man backed off.
“A lot of Parkinson’s sufferers do get mistaken for being drunk.
“When I go out for a meal, I see people stare from other tables.”
Diane, 50, has been married to the former Scotland and British Lions captain for more than 20 years. And she said he has been her rock since she was diagnosed with the incurable neurological disorder 10 years ago.
Gavin, 53, was in Australia at the Rugby World Cup when she delivered the news and immediately became her “towering strength”.
 

Diane, of Craiglockhart, Edinburgh, has controlled her symptoms with medication for the last 10 years and she has led an active social life, as well as bringing up son Adam, 18, and daughter Holly, 16.
But her condition has deteriorated in the last six months.
She said: “I was warned the medication would work for the first 10 years. Now I can’t depend on it to work.”
 Gavin, who fundraises for Parkinson’s, said: “You won’t find a more positive couple than us. Her diagnosis was devastating news and there was nothing  we could do about it. 
“But we’re a team and I’ll always be there for her because she’s amazing and I love her.”
