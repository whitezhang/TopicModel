A stowaway sneaked into Scotland after hiding for 500 miles in the luggage hold of a school trip coach.
The man was able to slip aboard the primary school bus as it returned from Disneyland Paris.
Shocked parents told how they saw the man scramble from the baggage &shy;compartment in front of children before he was tackled by the driver.
The dad of one pupil said: “It is really worrying to think this man was able to travel undetected in a bus full of 11-year-olds.
“He could have been violent or a rapist.”
It is believed the man – described as black and in his mid-20s – sneaked on at the Calais ferry port before the bus crossed the Channel on the way back to Whitburn, West Lothian, from the six-day trip.
A mum of one of the Whitdale Primary school pupils, who saw the drama, told how the surprised passenger tried to escape.
She explained: “He tried to make a run for it but the driver grabbed him.
“There was a bit of a struggle but I don’t think he had the energy to put up much resistance.”
Thirty primary seven youngsters and three teachers had been on the trip.
Parents have demanded an investigation into how Saturday &shy;morning’s incident was able to happen.
Police Scotland said the man is “in the hands of the UK Border Agency”.
