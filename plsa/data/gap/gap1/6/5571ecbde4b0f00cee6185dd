A POLICE probe has been launched after an autistic Scot stuck in a psychiatric hospital hundreds of miles from home was left unattended in a minibus for two hours.
Two carers have been suspended after severely disabled Darren Browne, 27, from Renfrewshire, and another vulnerable patient from the Wast Hills unit in Birmingham were spotted alone in the vehicle during a recent day out.
The incident comes after Darren’s desperate dad Paul appealed to care chiefs in the Record last month to find his son a suitable facility in Scotland after being separated from him for seven years.
Now he has told of his horror at learning Darren, who suffers from extreme episodes where he can lash out and injure himself, had been put at risk of serious harm.
Paul said: “A member of staff told me Darren was alone in the van for two hours and 10 minutes. I was in tears when I heard. He is a severely disabled man and he is just left like that.
“He has smashed a window with his head before. Imagine what he could’ve done in that vehicle alone. It’s cruelty in my opinion and Darren’s life was put at risk.”
 

Darren was returned to Wast Hills unharmed after police where alerted to the incident in Selly Oak, Worcestershire.
West Midlands Police are investigating, as are Danshell – the care providers who own Wast Hills.
Darren stayed in several Scots units in his teens. But as he got older, aggressive episodes proved difficult for staff.
Paul agreed he could temporarily go to West Hills in 2008 – more than 300 miles from his home in Inchinnan – because experts said it was the only place available to deal with his needs.
Renfrewshire Council and NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde insisted they are doing their best for Darren and have shortlisted care providers.
Paul said: “Being separated from my son and hearing this is ripping my heart out.”
Danshell would not comment on the circumstances while an investigation was being carried out.
