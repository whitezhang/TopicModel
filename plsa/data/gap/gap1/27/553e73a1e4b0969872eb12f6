CELTIC striker John Guidetti will discover on Thursday if he is to be punished for singing an allegedly "offensive" song about the demise of Old Firm rivals Rangers.The on-loan Manchester City player had been due to appear before the Scottish Football Association's disciplinary panel on April 9 but that hearing was postponed.However, the SFA has confirmed the 22-year-old's case will now be heard this Thursday.Guidetti was issued with a notice of complaint last month after giving an interview to Dutch TV show FC Rijnmond.In it, he repeats a chant sung about him by the Hoops support: &quot;Oh John Guidetti, puts the ball in the net-y, he's a Super Swede and the huns are deid, walking in Guidetti wonderland.&quot;Rangers fans claim the term &quot;hun&quot; is a sectarian slur - although supporters of other clubs insist it has no religious connotations.SFA compliance officer Tony McGlennan accused the Swede of breaching disciplinary rule 73, stating that &quot;on or around March 6, 2015, you did in the course of a interview given to the Dutch Television Programme FC Rijnmond, make comment of an offensive nature&quot;.It is not clear if Guidetti will appear before the Hampden panel at Thursday's re-arranged hearing but Celtic have already backed the player.In a statement issued last month, a spokesman for the Parkhead outfit said: &quot;We are very surprised and disappointed that this has even found its way to an SFA judicial panel. John Guidetti will be defending this charge.&quot;Guidetti made a sensational start to his Celtic switch, scoring 11 goals in his first 12 games after moving north from the Etihad Stadium.But his form has been patchy since and he was left on the bench by boss Ronny Deila on Sunday as the Hoops took another step towards their fourth consecutive Scottish Premiership title with a 3-0 Tannadice win over Dundee United
