Glasgow's new super hospital today welcomed its first patients.The &pound;842million site opened its doors this morning, with patients arriving from around 9am.With 1109 beds and around 10,000 staff, Scotland's largest health board has been planning the opening for months.Jimmy McLellan was among the first people to enter the hospital, through its dramatic atrium, which stretches up the entire height of the 14-storey building.The 62-year-old, from Bridgeton, had an appointment to discuss treatment for a stomach condition.He said: &quot;It's like a five-star hotel, it's out of this world. I know the hospital has cost a lot of money, but it is definitely money well spent.&quot;Mr McLellan checked in at one of the hospital's self-service check-in machines, before meeting with his doctor.&quot;It's very futuristic&quot;, he added. &quot;And although it all seems pretty unusual right now, it's definitely the way forward.&quot;NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde is poised to vacate three separate hospitals, transferring around 1000 patients to the new South Glasgow University Hospital.Dr David Stewart, medical director for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, said: &quot;This allows us to truly bring healthcare into the 21st Century. For most of my career I've been working out of buildings some of which have been more than 100 years old.&quot;Frankly, although they were fine in their day, they were not suitable for the type of technologically based healthcare which we need to deliver now.&quot;Dr Stewart is in charge of moving 1000 inpatients and 10,000 staff to the new facility.The three acute hospitals which are shutting -- the Southern General, the Victoria Infirmary and the Western Infirmary - will each close over the course of a weekend with a two-week gap between each one.Planned surgery will stop at each site two days before the move, with some patients offered operations at the Golden Jubilee or private hospitals to prevent queues building up.A&amp;E departments will continue seeing patients until around 8am on the Saturdays when they are due to shut.A drop of 561,000 leaflets to every household in the NHS GGC region will give people news about the new arrangements.
