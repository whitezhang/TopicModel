TELLY sports presenter Kirsty Gallacher has joined protests against party nights at Edinburgh Zoo amid fears that shy animals could be left terrified by revellers.
They are bringing back Zoo Nights, where party-goers can spend Friday evenings among exotic animals while drinking beer, eating snacks and enjoying a range of entertainment.
But Kirsty, 39, joined with animal rights charity PETA to ask the zoo to cancel the &pound;20-a-ticket events.
Last year at London Zoo, who run similar offers, one man poured beer on a tiger and another stripped and tried to get into the penguin enclosure.
Edinburgh-born Kirsty wrote to the city’s zoo chief executive Chris West: “These late-night events are a horrible idea and only add to the stress experienced by animals in captivity.

“Zoos must put the safety and well-being of the animals in their care above all else.”
Nearly 8000 PETA supporters have called for Zoo Nights to end. But the zoo claim they have had none of London Zoo’s problems.
They said: “Although alcohol is available in moderation, there is not a ‘drunken’ atmosphere.
“Keepers are careful to monitor animals’ behaviour at any evening event. All entertainers and bars are away from animal enclosures.
“No one cares more about the animals in our care than us.”
