DESPITE the best efforts of the Rebel Alliance, the Death Star is now fully operational in Glasgow.
The new South Glasgow University Hospital, known to most already as the New Southern General, has also been dubbed the &quot;Death Star&quot; in typical Weegie humour.
Officially, it's because the building has a star shape, apparently, but it's more likely down to the likelihood you'll die of old age before finding a parking spot.
But now we can reveal that the real Death Star has been spotted over George Square, the At-At Walker in front of the GoMA has been suitably brought down to size with a traffic cone, and someone STILL hasn't got this big walking carpet out of our way.
As these exclusive images - created by our design guru Bill Sullivan - show, there's definitely something something something Dark Side something going on in Glasgow.

PS Luke, Glasgow Now is your father.
PPS No! You can't be! That's impossible!
