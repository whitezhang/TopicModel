CELTIC player Liam Henderson only arrived in Norway two weeks ago – but hasn’t wasted any time getting to know the local talent.
The midfielder, 18, went on loan to Scandinavian giants Rosenborg earlier this month but is already hanging out with stunning model Nicole Sunde, who hails from the side’s home town of Trondheim.
 

The 18-year-old beauty, who is well-known in Norway and has modelled around the world, posted an Instagram pic of herself with her arms wrapped around the playmaker.
It appears to have been taken in a flat and a pair of football boots can be seen in the background.
One of Liam’s followers posted: “Get in there, mate.”
And one of Nicole’s fans asked: “Does he eat haggis?”
When contacted by the Record, Nicole claimed: “I’m just friends with Liam.”
 

The youngster has played 22 times for Celtic’s first team since making his debut last season. He was snapped up by Rosenborg boss Kare Ingebrigtsen on the final day of the Norwegian transfer window and made a late appearance in their 6-0 win over Haugesund at the weekend.
Ingebrigtsen signed Henderson, who also represented Scotland at under-19 level, from old friend Ronny Deila.
He said: “Liam has huge potential and Ronny speaks very highly about him.
“He is a young, ambitious, hard-working boy with a strong will to win and experience of playing in front of 60,000 spectators, so he knows what the pressure of expectation is.”
