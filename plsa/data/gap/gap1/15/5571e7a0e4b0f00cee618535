A DANGEROUS new trend for “tram surfing” has been snapped for the first time by passengers in Edinburgh .
An eagle-eyed traveller spotted two youths high-fiving as they rode for at least two stops through the city centre at around 4:30pm on Tuesday.
Witness Charlie James, who managed to take a picture of one of the teens while they ‘tram surfed’ on the westbound service, branded them “idiots”.
She said: “I thought it was completely idiotic. They clearly thought they were cool and funny but it was stupid.
“He and his friend were on the outside of the tram as it pulled into the Princes Street stop, they got off and high-fived each other.
“Then once I was on the tram and it started moving off, he got back on but his friend didn’t.
 

“As we were moving, a ticket inspector came along and was on the phone to control. She was saying the police had been informed as well.
“Once the tram reached Shandwick Place he got off and the inspector told him the police had been called. He said he’d just missed getting on at the last stop and walked away.”
Transport chiefs in Manchester were forced to scrap a narrow metal ledge at the base of their tram doors in 2000 after teens were spotted using them to ‘surf’ the network.
It is believed that the Edinburgh tram surfers are using the same metal toe hold while they cling to the edge of the doors.
A spokesman for Edinburgh Trams urged passengers to report tram-surfing incidents to staff, and said: “This behaviour is rare but it’s extremely stupid and dangerous – as well as himself, he’s putting other road users at risk.
&quot;We always call police on 999 when we see this happening.”
