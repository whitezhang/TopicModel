Former Scotland football captain Colin Hendry will appear in court to fight a drink-driving ban.
Hendry, 49, was arrested by police after being stopped while driving a blue Ford Focus in Church Road, Lytham, Lancashire at 1.15am on February 21.
He provided a reading of 63 micrograms per 100 millilitres of breath - the legal limit in England is 35 micrograms.
Blackpool Magistrates' Court was told last month that Hendry accepts the facts of the case but argues the amount of alcohol he consumed in a period of time did not &quot;correlate&quot; to the figure provided in the sample.
His solicitor, Gwyn Lewis, who specialises in defending motorist cases, said there were two possible explanations. Either Hendry had some alcohol in his system that he was unaware of or he had a &quot;quite rare&quot; metabolism which meant a correct reading would not be given, he said.
The court agreed to adjourn for a &quot;special reasons&quot; hearing in which Hendry is set to call evidence from a forensic service scientist and two civilian witnesses who were with him on the night of the incident.
Hendry, of Coopers Row, Lytham, had a long playing career, captaining his country in the 1998 World Cup and appearing for a series of clubs including Blackburn Rovers, Manchester City, Bolton Wanderers and Glasgow Rangers.
