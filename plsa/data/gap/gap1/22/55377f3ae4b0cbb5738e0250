A SCOTS holidaymaker who had an altercation with two frail pensioners on an all-inclusive cruise told police he was acting in self-defence.
Graeme Finlay, 53, denies unlawfully wounding Ron Phillips, 70, who walks with a crutch and was carrying two cocoas for him and his 68-year-old wife June.
Finlay, of Meadowside Quay Walk, Glasgow, also denies causing grievous bodily harm to June while they were cruising off Lanzarote in January 2014.
Ron suffered a gash to the forehead when he was repeatedly punched and knocked out, while his wife was later found to have fractured two vertebrae after being shoved and losing consciousness, Teesside Crown Court heard.
The jury heard that Ron and June had enjoyed dinner and gone to a cabaret bar on the ship, the Thomson Celebration, before deciding to “turn in” at around 1am.
He said: “I turned my head and the next thing I knew, I was coming to on the floor with various people around.
“June was at the side of me complaining bitterly, saying, ‘Oh, my back, my back’.”
Prosecuting, Lewis Kerr said June had seen her husband being punched several times and that when she went to his aid, she was shoved against a wall.
Mr Kerr said that after the attack, the crew found bloodstains in Finlay’s cabin and he was “disembarked” from the cruise.
He was questioned by police in the UK and said there had been an argument that night. He accepted he hit Ron but did not accept causing the injury to June and said he had been acting in self-defence.
The trial continues.
