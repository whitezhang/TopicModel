Three Rangers fans have admitted causing a sectarian disturbance at a football match. 
Ryan Maclellan, 17, Brian Robertson, 18, and Gordon Cruickshank, 29, had all been due to stand trial at Livingston Sheriff Court.
But they pleaded guilty to engaging in behaviour likely to incite pubic disorder in a designated football ground.
Sentence on the three men was deferred until 24 June.
Maclellan and Robertson, both from Lesmahagow, South Lanarkshire, and Cruickshank, from Ibrox in Glasgow, were accused of shouting, swearing and uttering sectarian remarks during a Scottish Championship tie between Rangers and Livingston at the Energy Assets Arena in the West Lothian town.
They were also alleged to have sung offensive and sectarian songs, and songs in support of a proscribed terrorist group, at the match on 4 October last year, which Rangers won 1-0.
Former co-accused Allan Thompson, 17, from Shotts, North Lanarkshire, was acquitted at an earlier hearing after the Crown accepted his not guilty plea.
Ryan McIlwraith, 19, of Craigend, Glasgow, maintained his not guilty plea to the charge and will stand trial.
