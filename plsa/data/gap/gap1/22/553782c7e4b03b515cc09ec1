A TRACTOR has crashed on a stretch of the M74 after being driven out of a field - by a dog.
The vehicle veered out of a field and into the path of busy morning traffic on the M74 after a dog reportedly leaned on the wheel.
The tractor came to rest after colliding with the central reservation around 8.30am on Wednesday morning.
The incident occurred near junction 13 at Abington in South Lanarkshire.
A Traffic Scotland spokesman said: “The dog accidentally leaned on the controls and the vehicle made its way out of the field and onto the M74.”
The incident has now been cleared and the dog is reportedly unharmed.
