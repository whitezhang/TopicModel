THE number of starving youngsters fed by city foodbanks has risen by more than 60% in a year.Shocking figures show the total number of people fed by Glasgow's four Trussell Trust foodbanks has nearly doubled.A total of 17,571 people - 10,955 adults and 6616 children - were given a three-day emergency food package during 2014/15.This is a dramatic 80% rise from 9687 people, including 4015 youngsters, who were fed during the previous year, 2013/14.In 2012, the charity fed 659 people in Glasgow.There was only one Trussell Trust foodbank operating in the city during that year - the South East branch based in Govanhill - and there are now four spread across Glasgow.However, these numbers are widely accepted to be the tip of the iceberg as dozens of other groups and organisations across Glasgow are also working to help people going hungry.The figures released today by the Trussell Trust show 117,689 people - including 36,114 children - used Scottish foodbanks in the last year.The UK-wide number of users fed by the charity tops a million - including almost 400,000 children - for the first time.Ewan Gurr, Scotland Network Manager, said the Glasgow South East foodbank was a &quot;perfect indication&quot; of the overall increase.He said: &quot;They've gone from 700 in the first year to over 4000 in their second year to just shy of 7000 in their third year.&quot;It's deeply concerning.&quot;It's the same consistent stories that we hear: rising cost of food and fuel, welfare reform, limited opportunities for those seeking work.&quot;I see many families who were keeping their head above water five years ago but now they can't feed themselves.&quot;In 2014/15 33,408 of people used a Trussell Trust foodbank in Scotland due to a benefit delay, while 24,609 - a huge jump from 13,552 the previous year - accessed one because of low income.A total of 20,387 visited a foodbank due to a benefit change.Mr Gurr said the real number of foodbank users was probably much higher.He said: &quot;The full extent of the problem could well be much wider as The Trussell Trust figures do not include people who are helped by other food charities or those who feel too ashamed to seek help.&quot;Trussell Trust foodbanks are increasingly hosting additional services like debt counselling and welfare advice at our foodbanks, which is helping more people out of crisis.&quot;The experiences of those who experience hunger is the key to the finding a solution.&quot;The Evening Times has been highlighting the work of foodbanks in and around the city through our Food For Thought Campaign.We launched it last year to aim for a more coordinated approach to foodbanks and to remove the stigma of them.Among our supporters who have helped with collections and raised awareness of food poverty are NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde and Glasgow Housing Association.We have also received support from actor Martin Compston, David Hayman and Sir Tom Hunter.
