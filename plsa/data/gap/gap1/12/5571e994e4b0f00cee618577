A top dentist faces being struck off after being accused of rushing into implant surgery.
Philip Friel, 38, is due to appear before a disciplinary hearing this month on 49 separate allegations.
These include failing to obtain medical history, not informing the patient of the procedure and inappropriate treatment.
The patient at his practice Philip Friel Advanced Dentistry in Glasgow’s west end was taking medication which affects bone tissue.
It’s used to treat conditions such as osteoporosis and cancer. But it’s also believed to increase the risk of oral health complications.
Friel, of Milngavie near Glasgow, is accused of failing to undertake a “proper investigation.” He is to appear before the General Dental Council’s conduct committee on April 20.
Friel could be banned from practising if the allegations, said to have occurred between 2006 and 2012, are proven.
In 2011, Friel was named best young dentist in Scotland at the Dentistry Awards. In 2012 he was put at No26 in the UK’s 50 most influential dentists.
