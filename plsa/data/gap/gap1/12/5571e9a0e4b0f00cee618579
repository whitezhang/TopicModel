A FRESH analysis has indicated Labour could win the General Election and cut out any deals with the SNP, by joining forces with the Lib Dems.
Leading Scots-based election expert Professor John Curtice has produced his findings by analysing opinion polls carried out in the past week.
His poll-of-polls puts Labour in line for 302 seats and suggests the Lib Dems are likely to take 20 - both parties combined falling fractionally short of the 323 needed for a majority in the Westminster Parliament.

Curtice believes an alliance along those lines, which could win the support of three left-centre SDLP MPs in Northern Ireland, would be a more pallatable arrangement for Labour than running a minority administration in hoc to the Nationalists. The SNP have said they would support a Labour Government on an issue-by-issue basis, vowing to fight against any further austerity measures and refuse to back renewal of the Trident nuclear deterrent.
Curtice, professor of politics at Strathclyde University, told Scotland on Sunday: If either Labour or the Tories can get to the 300 mark, the Nats’ acquiescence is no longer required. The crucial question is can either of them get to the 300 mark? This poll-of-polls suggest Labour can.”
