A Scots gangster will go on trial tomorrow in Tenerife accused of stabbing a rival in a drugs turf war.
Gordon Horsfall could face 15 years in jail if convicted of attempted murder during the feud between British and &shy;African dealers.
The 35-year-old fugitive is said to be in hiding in Thailand and not expected to show at the Canary island trial court.
His his lawyer has indicated he will seek to have the case dropped.
Prosecutors say they are confident judges will order the trial, suspended last October, to go ahead in his absence.
 Horsfall allegedly knifed Abdelhafid Khamed after &shy;luring him and a pal to a flat with a lucrative cannabis deal. 
Khamed managed to escape by jumping out of a window before being found lying in the street by passing police.
Another Scot, Craig &shy;Anderson, 44, is one of four British defendants.
 Another, Darrell Pope, faces up to 17 years in jail if convicted of attempted murder, drug trafficking and falsifying documents. 
 An international arrest warrant was issued for Horsfall, from Glasgowâ€™s Thornliebank, last year after he was charged with attempted murder and drug trafficking. 
Prosecutors want him jailed for 11 years on the attempted murder charge and four years on the drugs charge.
 Spanish authorities tried to have him extradited after the December 2006 stabbing but he was already serving a five-year prison sentence for a shotgun attack outside a &shy;Glasgow nightclub in July 2004. 
Horsfall phoned an &shy;accomplice to deliver a gun and bulletproof vest after a &shy;confrontation with two men inside Blanket, in Sauchiehall Street.
He opened fire, injuring a woman who was saved because the bullet bounced off her &shy;necklace.
 He then shot doorman Anthony Nyangweso through the hand before fleeing in a taxi.
