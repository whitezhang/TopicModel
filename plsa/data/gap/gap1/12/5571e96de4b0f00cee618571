A WOMAN was sexually assaulted after getting into a car she believed was a private hire taxi.
The 31-year-old was attacked after being picked up in Candlemaker Row, near the Greyfriars Bobby statue in Edinburgh, at about 3.30am.
Police said the assault happened in a lay-by just past Hillend ski slope, near Boghall Farm, in Midlothian.
The woman was then taken to the Edinburgh city bypass where she left the car near the Sheriffhall roundabout.
Police Scotland Detective Sergeant Keith Mackay said: &quot;This was a frightening experience for the woman, who is now in the care of her family.
&quot;We are eager to trace this man and are appealing for witnesses. Anyone who recognises the man's description, or the description of the car, is urged to come forward.&quot;
The suspect is described as being South Asian, slim and aged between 35 and 40 with an Edinburgh accent.
He is around 5ft 5in or 5ft 6in, clean shaven with dark cropped hair and was wearing dark clothing.
The car was a five door saloon, which could be navy blue.
