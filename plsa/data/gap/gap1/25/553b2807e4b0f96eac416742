SCOTTISH WATER has started work on a new Â£1.2m infrastructure upgrade on the White Cart Water.The work will upgrade the waste water management in Cathcart area and improve the natural environment of the White Cart Water.The &pound;1.2m project is part of Scottish Water's major &pound;250m, five-year investment into the Greater Glasgow area's waste water infrastructure.The construction of a new Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO) with a screen and pipework will relieve the sewer system during storm events and should be completed by the end of August.As part of the project a number of otters residing in the White Cart Water have been relocated to the north bank of the river so as not to disturb them.Allan Dougall, Scottish Water's project manager, said: &quot;Otters are fully protected under the conservation regulations and, in liaison with Scottish Natural Heritage, we moved the local population on this stretch of the White Cart Water from its holt on the south bank to a new holt on the opposite side. The operation was delicate and took some time, but we are delighted that it has been successful.Traffic will be affected during the second phase of construction which is due to commence at the end of May. Lane closures are expected on Clarkston Road, between the junction with Holmhead Crescent and the access to Cathcart railway station.The lane closures will be in place for about eight weeks to allow the installation of 50m of new pipework and two manholes.Mark Maclaren, Scottish Water's regional communities team manager, said: &quot;We will be doing everything possible to minimise any inconvenience to local residents, businesses and road users, as we did for the otters, and we hope our customers appreciate that any short-term inconvenience will be far outweighed by the long-term benefits this investment will deliver.&quot;CSOs are designed to spill to watercourses in heavy weather, to help prevent flooding, and are allowed to do so under Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) regulations.
