 BIRD conservationists have offered to drop objections to T in the Park – if organisers agree to measures to protect nesting ospreys. 
 RSPB Scotland had feared the festival’s impact on the legally protected birds near its new venue at Strathallan Castle in Perthshire. 
They were among a number of protesters raising concerns about the site.
 

But yesterday the RSPB told Perth and Kinross Council they would not oppose the July event as long as T bosses agreed to measures including:
●A 500m buffer zone until mid-June, when the birds are “likely to lay eggs, incubate them and raise chicks”.
●A permanent buffer zone of 200m where no T staff or revellers are allowed to go after mid-June.
●No lights or fireworks shining directly at the nest.
●The dance music tent, big wheel and funfair should be at least 500m away from the osprey nest.
●A bird expert on site who can stop any activities that may cause disturbance to the ospreys.

A T in the Park spokeswoman said they had been monitoring the ospreys and their nest and were happy they would have measures in place ”to secure the long-term protection of the birds as well as the future of the event at Strathallan”.
