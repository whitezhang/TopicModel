 John Higgins hopes fellow Scot Anthony McGill will meet China's Ding Junhui in the final of the World Snooker Championship. 
 Higgins, 39, lost 13-9 to round-two opponent Ding, 28, on Saturday after McGill knocked out defending champion Mark Selby 13-9 on Friday. 
 And four-time winner Higgins wants 24-year-old McGill to go all the way at the Crucible. 
 &quot;I said to him [Ding] I hope he plays Ants in the final,&quot; Higgins said. 
 &quot;Ants has been brilliant and I think he's got a new army of fans.&quot; 
 He added: &quot;He [Ding] made a couple of pressure clearances which means he's probably ready to win the world title. 
 &quot;Obviously I'd be routing for wee Ants to win it but if Ants doesn't win it I'd love to see Ding win it.&quot; 
 McGill is playing in his first World Championship having made it through the qualifiers, and Higgins has been impressed not just by his performances but how he is handling the pressure. 
 &quot;He's been a credit to himself,&quot; he added. &quot;He's a cracking boy and he probably won't let it get to him. 
 &quot;He's got a big chance in this tournament if he keeps playing as he did against Selby and Stephen Maguire. 
 &quot;He's loving it and fair play to him. He's living the dream. 
 &quot;We all knew he was a great player coming through as a boy and he's carrying that through. He's grown in stature every match and he's not going to be an easy game for anybody.&quot;
