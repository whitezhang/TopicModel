TOURISTS travelling on the Caledonian Sleeper turned up at a Scottish train station to discover they were booked onto coaches that did not exist.
The blunder comes less than a week after Serco took over the franchise and promised to make the service one of the best in the world.
Around 20 passengers turned up at Edinburgh Waverley station on Tuesday night to catch the overnight train to London, but were informed their reservations were for carriages which were not there.
The bookings, which included a large group of Canadian teenagers, were made on April 1, the day Serco took over.
Departure was delayed while train staff booked the passengers onto the later service leaving Glasgow. The tourists were dropped off at Carstairs station to transfer to their new sleeper in the early hours of Wednesday.
Rob Bruce, a regular commuter on the service, told The Herald: “There were lots of people standing around on the platform and I thought it was a bit odd.
“It seemed there were people booked onto coaches N and P and those coaches didn’t exist.
“There was a party of Canadian teenagers who were affected and their tour guide was stressed. They had a busy schedule and it would all be messed up if they didn’t get to London.”
Serco, who took over the franchise from ScotRail on a 15-year term, apologised for the error.
Ryan Flaherty, guest services director, said: “I’m really sorry that these people had a problem with their booking - it shouldn’t have happened.
“We have identified the problem and we are confident that it will not happen again.”
Serco have committed to a &pound;150 million revamp of the service.
