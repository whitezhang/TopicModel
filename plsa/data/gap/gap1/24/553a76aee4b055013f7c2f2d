Hotels in Glasgow reported their highest ever occupancy rates in March, boosted by the SNP's spring conference and concerts, a study suggests.
Analysis from market research firm LJ Research suggests room occupancy in Glasgow rose 5.7 per cent to 82 per cent, outstripping Edinburgh and Aberdeen for room demand.
The research suggests average cost of a room was down in Glasgow, Edinburgh and Aberdeen in March compared with last year, though room demand in Glasgow helped to mitigate the decline.
Based on the industry measure of revenue - revenue per available room (RevPar) - rates in Glasgow rose on average more than five per cent to &pound;56.45, the study suggests.
In contrast, average room rates in Edinburgh dipped four per cent year on year in March to “just over &pound;83”, and in Aberdeen average room rates fell 3.2 per cent to &pound;93.30.
Occupancy in Aberdeen dipped eight per cent year on year to 67.6 per cent.
Glasgow City Marketing Bureau chief executive Scott Taylor said: “The 12 days of the Commonwealth Games have translated into 15 consecutive months of growth in Glasgow with some of the highest occupancy rates on record in the city.
“This is the legacy of the Games, which will be felt in Glasgow for the next decade.
“Our research shows that occupancy in Glasgow last month was the strongest of any major city in the UK and Europe.”
