A WOMAN was sexually assaulted after getting into a car which may have been a taxi.

A man and woman helped the 23-year-old into the vehicle in Renfield Street, Glasgow, at around 1.35am on Monday April 13.
The car then drove off towards Great Western Road, where the woman was subjected to a sexual assault near the Lincoln Inn.
Before getting into the vehicle the woman had been eating in Bistro Takeaway on Renfield Street at around 1am.
Police are trying to establish whether the vehicle the victim got into was a taxi or a private car.
They are also keen to speak to the man and woman who helped her into the vehicle.
Detective Inspector Greg Wilkie said: “We are in the process of reviewing CCTV images and are keen to speak to anyone who was within Bistro Takeaway, Renfield Street or anyone who was on Great Western Road who may have information which could assist our investigation.
“We are still trying to establish if the car the woman got into was a licensed cab or a private car. I would urge anyone with any knowledge or information to contact us as a matter of urgency.”
