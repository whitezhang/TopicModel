Two men have stolen a five-figure sum of money during an armed robbery at a Post Office in Glasgow. 
The men entered the Post Office in Quarrywood Avenue, in the Barmulloch area, at 07:55 on Friday. 
They threatened a member of staff with a knife and demanded money before escaping with the cash. 
The 27-year-old worker was said by police to have been badly shaken but otherwise unharmed by the ordeal.
Both suspects are white, and one of them was about 35-40 years old with short brown hair and wearing a black jumper. 
Det Sgt Raymond Hunter said officers had been carrying out door-to-door inquiries and were in the process of collecting CCTV images from the surrounding area. 
He added: &quot;There are a number of other shops in this area and people may have seen the two men prior to or after the incident.
&quot;I am therefore appealing to anyone who was in the area or any local residents to contact us - any information you have could assist our enquiry.&quot;
