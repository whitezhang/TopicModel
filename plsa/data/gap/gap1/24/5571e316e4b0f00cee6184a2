POLICE have launched a murder inquiry after a man’s body was discovered at a house in Perthshire.
Jeweller Alan Gardner was discovered in his home, in Balbeggie, close to Scone Airport on Thursday afternoon.
Officers confirmed that the 49-year-old, father-of-one's death was being treated as suspicious.
A force spokesman said: “Next of kin have been informed and enquiries are at an early stage.”
 

Originally from Wishaw in North Lanarkshire, he had moved into the property with his wife Jennifer about eight years ago.
The pair separated in 2013 and she moved out of the area.
Neighbours described Mr Gardner as a 'bit of a loner' who ran his own jewellery repairs business from a small workshop in his back garden.
