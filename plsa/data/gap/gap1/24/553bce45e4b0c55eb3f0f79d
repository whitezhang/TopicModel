 Hamilton player-manager Martin Canning said he was pleased more for his players than himself as he finally got his first win since taking charge. 
 Goals from Jason Scotland and Ali Crawford ensured  Hamilton defeated Lanarkshire rivals Motherwell and secured their top flight status for next season. 
 &quot;It's a great night and a good result,&quot; Canning told BBC Scotland. 
 &quot;Tonight the boys got exactly what they deserved, they were all over Motherwell from start to finish.&quot; 
 It was Hamilton's first win since 4 January, when they beat St Johnstone 1-0 in Perth. 
 &quot;We played really well, we controlled the game. We played with a professionalism and an experience that I enjoyed watching,&quot; said Canning. 
 &quot;It's been tough. From a personal point of view I haven't been too concerned, the club have been great. 
 &quot;It's more for the players to give them the belief that they're still the same players that did so well at the start of the season. 
 &quot;In my nature I want to win. Obviously I wanted that win as soon as I could get it. Tonight wasn't about me getting a win, it was about the players getting what they deserved.&quot; 
  Motherwell manager Ian Baraclough  now has a major task on his hands to keep his side out of the play-offs, with the possibility of falling nine points behind Ross County should they win on Saturday. 
 He said: &quot;I'm frustrated that we have created more chances and better chances, and to come away without scoring is amazing for me. We just weren't clinical enough. 
 &quot;We created good chances, there were six or seven at least that I counted, we hit the woodwork a couple of times and their keeper has pulled off a couple of good saves from one-on-ones. That has cost us. 
 &quot;Their two goals have come from positions of good possession, we have given it away cheaply, they have broken and been clinical. There's the difference. 
 &quot;We still have to believe we can bridge the gap.&quot;
