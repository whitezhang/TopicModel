Police are appealing for two members of the public to contact them after a 23-year-old woman was sexually assaulted by a car driver in Glasgow.
The victim had been eating at the Bistro Takeaway in Renfield Street before being helped into what may have been a taxi by a man and woman.
The car then drove off towards Great Western Road where the driver attacked the woman near to the Lincoln Inn.
The incident took place at about 01:35 on Monday 13 April.
Detectives want to speak to the man and woman who helped the victim in a bid to find out more details about the car and the driver. 
Det Insp Greg Wilkie said: &quot;We are in the process of reviewing CCTV images and are keen to speak to anyone who was within Bistro Takeaway, Renfield Street, or anyone who was on Great Western Road who may have information which could assist our investigation. 
&quot;We are still trying to establish if the car the woman got into was a licensed cab or a private car. 
&quot;I would urge anyone with any knowledge or information to contact us as a matter of urgency.&quot;
