A KILLER who was freed early after killing a young mum was yesterday ordered to be detained without limit of time for pulling a knife on a psychiatrist.
Joseph Harrison served just four years of a six-year sentence for the 2005 &shy;strangling of Susan Third, despite &shy;warnings he posed a serious risk of harm.
In May last year, he pulled a knife with a four-inch blade from his pocket during an appointment with a consultant psychiatrist.
He claimed he had heard voices telling him he was being targeted by a hit squad.
Susan, a 21-year-old &shy;prostitute, had approached Harrison as he sat crying in his car at Aberdeen harbour.
He strangled her with the fascia of his car stereo before driving to a field near &shy;Catterline, Aberdeenshire, where he sexually assaulted the mum of one and dumped her body.
He was ruled to have been suffering from diminished responsibility at the time, which limited his sentence, Perth Sheriff Court heard.
Harrison was moved from Carstairs state hospital into prison before being released in February 2009. His licence period ran out in February last year.
His meeting with the psychiatrist was held three months later.
Carol Whyte, prosecuting, said: “The accused believed he could hear voices and that a hit squad were looking to kill him.
“He removed a knife from his inside pocket and showed it to the doctor. The doctor instructed him to put it away and he did so.”
Former farm worker Harrison, 38, from Brechin, admitted carrying an &shy;offensive weapon.
Sheriff Fiona Tait made Harrison the subject of a compulsion order.
He will be detained at Murray Royal psychiatric hospital in Perth.
