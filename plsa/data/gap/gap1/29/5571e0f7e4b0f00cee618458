HUNDREDS of fire and rescue service support staff are facing pay cuts of up to 25 per cent.
Bosses blame a funding gap of almost &pound;50million which it’s claimed could also see 200 firefighters axed.
The pay cuts will affect a quarter of the 900-strong support staff at Scottish Fire and Rescue and it comes with a double blow of cuts to overtime pay.
Staff were told by letter that the pay cut at the national service – launched in April 2013 – will come into force next year.
Insiders say the move has left workers feeling “betrayed” with many fearing “real financial hardship”.
Scotland's chief fire officer Alasdair Hay told Holyrood’s justice committee yesterday they would be forced to look at frontline cuts after an 11 per cent fall in funding and a six per cent rise in costs.
Mechanics, cooks, cleaners, admin and IT staff are among those affected by the proposals, which would kick in next July.
Fire chiefs still have to negotiate further with unions, but sources expect the pay deal and other changes to terms and conditions to be “railroaded through”.
One worker said: “The Scottish Government are calling for an end to austerity while the fire service are proposing pay cuts.
“To have pay slashed by 25 per cent means not being able to pay the mortgage.”
Many of those affected are among the lowest paid and it is thought some will see their wages plunge by up to &pound;10,000 a year.
The service are also set to change their hours which means overtime and pay for working unsociable hours will be reduced.
Fire service director Diane Vincent said: “The service are committed to supporting employees who may see changes in their pay or terms and conditions.”
The committee also heard some fire engines weren’t being used because of a lack of staff. Stephen Thomson, of the Fire Brigades Union, said: “On any given day, there will be appliances which are not available because of a lack of personnel.”
