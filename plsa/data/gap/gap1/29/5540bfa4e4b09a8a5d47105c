A 19-year-old woman carrying her one-year-old son has been attacked as she walked along a footpath in North Lanarkshire.
The woman was grabbed from behind by a man at about 11:30 on Tuesday near to Marmion Road in Greenfaulds, Cumbernauld.
She fell to the ground and suffered facial injuries. Her child was unhurt.
The attacker is described as about 6ft tall, of slim build, wearing a black hooded top and dark-coloured jeans.
Police have been conducting inquiries in and around the area in an effort to find out more details about the suspect.
Insp Phil Rose, of Police Scotland, said: &quot;It's not clear why this man approached the woman and pulled her back. We don't know if he intended to rob her or if his intention was to harm her.
&quot;The footpath is well used by local people and at that time of the day there would have been people out and about.
&quot;If you know who this man is or if you have any knowledge about him or the crime, please do get in touch with us.&quot;
