A Scottish firm has launched an investment scheme to help raise &pound;3m for a new brewery.
Edinburgh-based Innis &amp; Gunn plans to fund the brewery through &quot;mini-bonds&quot;, which allow individuals to lend money directly to small, unlisted businesses. 
One of the mini-bonds can be redeemed against beer at Innis &amp; Gunn's online shop. 
It plans to build the new brewery at an unspecified location in south east Scotland.
The company is currently in &quot;advanced negotiations&quot; to buy land for the facility.
It expects the brewery and bottling line to create up to 35 new jobs over the next four years.
Innis &amp; Gunn said it would continue to brew the bulk of its beer at Wellpark Brewery in Glasgow.
Founded in 2003, the brewer reported turnover of &pound;11.8m last year - up from &pound;10.5m in 2013. Last year the company sold more than 20 million bottles of beer.
Innis &amp; Gunn founder and chief executive Dougal Gunn Sharp said: &quot;Our state-of-the-art brewery is where we will get even more creative and make epic new beers for craft beer drinkers to enjoy.&quot;
