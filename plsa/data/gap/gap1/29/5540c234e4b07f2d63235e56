Rail workers are to stage a strike on Bank Holiday Monday in a dispute over the sacking of a colleague.Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union on East Coast trains based at Edinburgh's Waverley station will walk out for 24 hours.The staff work as on-board train managers and catering managers on trains in and out of the station, including the intercity route to London King's Cross.The union is protesting at the dismissal of Mark Doughty, saying he merely told passengers they could not have hot food on a journey to London because of a broken boiler and staff shortages.RMT general secretary Mick Cash said: &quot;We are determined to right this outrageous injustice of a member fired for telling passengers the truth.&quot;
