A man accused of murdering Glasgow gangland figure Kevin “Gerbil” Carroll has lodged a special defence blaming someone else.
William Paterson, 35, denies repeatedly shooting and killing 29-year-old Carroll outside Asda, in the city’s Robroyston area, on 13 January, 2010.
He is also accused of fleeing to Spain in a bid to defeat the ends of justice.
Paterson appeared at the High Court in Livingston today.
The preliminary hearing was told a trial will start next month.
