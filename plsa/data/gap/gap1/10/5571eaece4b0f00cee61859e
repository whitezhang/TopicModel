A PERVERT who groomed a 12-year-old boy for sex in a public library previously sent an explicit photo to a 13-year-old.
We revealed yesterday how twisted Sam Roan, 21, bombarded a schoolboy with sordid online messages while sitting feet away in Leith Library in Edinburgh.
Now it has emerged the beast was out on supervision at the time after targeting a boy aged 13 via messaging service Snapchat.
Roan sent him a photo of private parts along with sexual messages from his home in the city’s Wardieburn last August.
The web predator was charged and brought to Edinburgh Sheriff Court, where he was placed on a three-year supervision order on November 19.
The order banned him from using or possessing an internet-enabled device without permission or contacting an under 17 without approval.
But just three months later, he sent the sick messages to the 12-year-old at the library. Roan appeared at court yesterday for breaching the order.
Sheriff Nigel Morrison deferred sentence until next month when Roan will also face punishment for the library offence before Sheriff Frank Crowe.
We told how the boy was on a public computer looking at Facebook when Roan came into the library.
He befriended the child before starting the vile online chat.
Roan told the victim he had done “sexual stuff” with a guy, adding: “We can go round the back and I’ll only show you if you want me to.”
Roan, who turns 22 tomorrow, has been placed on the sex offenders’ register. He is on bail and is banned from Edinburgh libraries.
