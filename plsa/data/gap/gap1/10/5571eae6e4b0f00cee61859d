A LABOUR councillor last night spoke of his terror after a pro-independence supporter threatened to “cut his head off” on the campaign trail.
Paul O’Kane was canvassing for leader Jim Murphy in the Auchenback estate in Barrhead, Renfrewshire, when he was heckled by a Yes voter.
Paul said: “The man came to the front of his garden and started shouting at me because I had a suit and a rosette on.
“He was saying ‘There’s the big Labour politician’, ‘Get away’, ‘Get out of here’. Then he picked up an electric saw, switched it on and shouted at me: ‘If you come over here, I am going to cut your f*****g head off.
“It made a hell of a noise and it was quite frightening.”
Paul, who represents Neilston, Uplawmoor &amp; Newton Mearns North on East Renfrewshire Council, said the yob had earlier taunted him with comments such as “You’re a red Tory”.
The group were preparing to leave the estate when the moron targeted them again.
Paul said: “I’m used to vigorous political campaigning but that level of intimidation and threat is disturbing. It was as if he wanted to chase us out of town.
“That is completely undemocratic. And to threaten someone’s life really is disturbing and quite upsetting.”
The councillor was canvassing with four volunteers, including a 71-year-old man, when he was threatened on Monday night.
The Record tried to speak to the Yes supporter yesterday but he was not at home.
It is understood the man had an SNP poster in his window but it has since been removed.
Police Scotland confirmed the matter is under investigation.
A spokeswoman said: “We can confirm we have received a complaint about a group of adults threatened on Divernia Way, Barrhead, on Monday. Inquiries are ongoing.”
