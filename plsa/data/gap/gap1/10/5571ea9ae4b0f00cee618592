Police investigating an attempted murder in which two brothers were stabbed have said they are following various lines of inquiry.
The “appalling” daylight attack on the pair happened after they travelled more than 100 miles to buy a car.
The victims have been named locally as Peter and James Stewart, aged 43 and 45 respectively.
Both men suffered serious injuries, with Peter understood to have been stabbed in the heart, and they were taken to Edinburgh Royal infirmary.
James was discharged yesterday while his younger brother is now in stable condition having initially been “critical”.
The attack happened at about 6pm on Wednesday in Edinburgh’s Wardieburn Place West.
The men had travelled to the capital from the Aberdeen area on the understanding that they were going to buy a vehicle.
Both were attacked in a common stair by two men, who quickly fled.
Officers, who are treating the incident as an attempted murder, want to speak to any witnesses who may have seen the attackers.
Detective Chief Inspector Stuart Houston said: “We’d like to thank the public for their assistance and patience so far, and I would urge anyone who may have further information which can help with our enquiries to come forward.
“We’re currently pursuing various lines of enquiry to establish the full circumstances surrounding this incident and I would like to reassure the public that there will be an increase in high-visibility patrols in the local area over the coming days.”
He previously described the incident as an “appalling attack”.
The first suspect is described as being a white man aged between 17 and 19.
He has a central Scotland accent and light-coloured short hair, which is shaved at the sides. He was wearing a light sky-blue hooded sweatshirt and grey jogging bottoms.
The second suspect is a white man in his mid-twenties. He has a stocky build and was wearing a striped top.
