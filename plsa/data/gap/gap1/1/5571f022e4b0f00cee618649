IT’S a sweet idea to keep kids safe, brighten up our towns and save councils a fortune – and it’s coming to a street near you.
Scotland’s favourite biscuit bakers, Tunnock’s, are set to become the first firm ever to sponsor our zebra crossings.
Instead of boring black and white stripes, we’ll soon be crossing the road on colourful images of Caramel Wafers.
 

And designers are working on plans to replace Belisha beacons with flashing Tunnock’s Teacakes.
Scotland’s minister for pedestrians, Miles Walker, told the Record: “This is a great breakthrough.
“Not only will local authorities no longer have to bear the cost of keeping crossings painted, but drivers will see them earlier and children will be attracted to them.”
 

Tunnock’s sales director Fergus Louden added: “I liked the idea right away.
“Apart from promoting our brand, it will save the country a fortune. And making all the crossings bright and colourful can only be a good thing.
“We’ll keep them in good order. You won’t find potholes near a Tunnock’s crossing.”
