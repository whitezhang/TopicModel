SICK burglars are raiding the homes of recently bereaved families while they are attending the funeral.
Police in Dumfries are investigating a spate of break-ins in recent weeks that all followed the same pattern.
PC Kennedy Anderson said there appeared to be a connection between obituaries appearing in local newspapers and homes in and near the town being targeted.
He added: “These burglars are disgusting. It’s a double hit during an already traumatic time. The things that have been stolen might not even be valuable but there’s a lot of sentimental value that can never be replaced.”
Local undertakers are now working with police to warn families to secure their properties during funerals.
Police have asked for anyone with information about the break-ins in Dumfries, Collin and Mouswald to contact them on 101.
