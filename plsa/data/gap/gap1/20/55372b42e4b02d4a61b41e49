TEN adults and a child were injured today following an eight vehicle crash on Scotland's busiest motorway.
Police Scotland confirmed six cars, a van and a lorry were involved in the rush hour accident on the westbound M8, east of the Kingston Bridge in Glasgow.
Three adults, including the lorry driver, were taken to the city's Western Infirmary and a fourth was admitted to the Southern General.
A five year-old boy was also treated at Yorkhill Hospital.
Six people also made their own way to various hospitals.A police spokeswoman said: &quot;No one has been seriously injured.&quot;
The accident happened around 9am and forced the closure of Junction 18 at Charing Cross. Police said the M8 reopened at 12.25pm and inquiries are ongoing to establish the cause.
 

The boy was removed from a car by firefighters and taken to hospital where he was treated for minor injuries.
Scottish Fire and Rescue Service confirmed its crews rescued three people following a multi-vehicle crash.
Firefighters used hydraulic rescue equipment to remove the roofs from three cars and create space for the casualties to be safely released.
Station Manager Eddie Ritchie, the incident commander, said: &quot;This was clearly a significant collision and our appliances from Yorkhill, Govan and Polmadie were mobilised along with the heavy rescue vehicle from Easterhouse.
&quot;There were a number of walking wounded. 
&quot;Three people were trapped inside three cars and firefighters removed the vehicles' roofs to ensure they could be safely released.
&quot;It was a challenging operation - the cars were positioned against the wall beside the hard shoulder, but our firefighters were working alongside paramedics and trauma doctors who were attending to the casualties as we worked to extricate them.&quot;
