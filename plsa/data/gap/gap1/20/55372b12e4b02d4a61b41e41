CONSTRUCTION has started on a new recreation area for veterans in Glasgow.
RAF vet John Burrett cut the first sod on the Erskine Glasgow site to extend the care home to allow more activities and welcome more visitors from other homes or family and friends.
The 46-bed Erskine Glasgow Home opened to residents in October 2007 with specialist nursing, dementia and palliative care and providing physiotherapy, speech and language therapy, dentistry and podiatry on site.
Ian Turnbull, recreation assistant at Erskine Glasgow, said: “The new build is going to be superb, simply first class for our residents.
“At present when we hold recreation events it is a bit like going into the resident’s living room. With the new facility we won’t be disturbing residents quiet time any more. The fact that there will be a dedicated recreation room we will be able to do so many more activities, the possibilities are endless.”
The home currently doesn’t have a room big enough to accommodate all the residents and the new space will make it easier to host events and be in use daily with film nights, arts and crafts, musical events, concerts, celebrations such as birthday parties, exercise classes and reminiscence activities.
Erskine Glasgow home manager Gordon Johnston added: “We will watch the creation of the new facility with much interest and look forward to the day when we can move into a purpose-built space for the provision of activities which will greatly benefit our residents.”
