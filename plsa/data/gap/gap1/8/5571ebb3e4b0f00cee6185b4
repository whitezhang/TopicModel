A great-GRANDMOTHER was given a lift when five hunky firemen made sure she was able to celebrate her 100th birthday party.
Alice Fairbairn was stuck on the first floor of her care home due to a broken elevator and looked like missing her big day.
That was until firefighters came to the rescue and carried her in her &shy;wheelchair down two flights of stairs to be met by her loving family.
The elevator at Dryfemount care home in Lockerbie was out of order after being damaged in a lightning storm and it looked set to scupper the party.
Care staff phoned the ambulance service, patient transport workers and other care homes but no one could help.
Then a call to the fire service saved the day and Alice made it to her party in style.
The team of five firefighters came equipped with an emergency &shy;evacuation chair but were forced to carry Alice down two short flights of stairs in her wheelchair.
 

The firefighters even came back to make sure Alice was returned safely to her room after she enjoyed time with her son, grandchildren and &shy;great-grandchildren.
 
Dryfemount manager Sandra Cooke said: “She thought it was just wonderful. She said it really made her big day even more special.
“Unfortunately the officers didn’t get any cake – but they stuck around for a cup of coffee afterwards before coming back a wee bit later to take her up the stairs again.”
Fire station manager Colin Wallace said: “With the home’s lift being - temporarily out of action, we were asked to help Alice get downstairs so she could celebrate her 100th birthday in style.
“She’s an inspirational lady and our team were very happy to be able to lend a hand.
“I’d like to thank Alice, her fellow residents and the staff for making the crew feel so welcome – I know they’re looking forward to Alice’s 101st.”
Her day was capped off by a message from the Queen, presented to her by Lord-&shy;Lieutenant of Dumfries Jean Tulloch.
