PARENTS at two primary schools in the south side of Glasgow have told of their fear that a child "will be killed" due to other parents' hazardous driving.Members of the parent council from Darnley Primary School and St Angela's Primary School, both in Darnley, say that the parents drive at high speeds, reverse out without looking, park completely on pavements and block emergency exits.Their driving has resulted in many near miss accidents and a few children have been &quot;bumped&quot; by cars however, parents say they have been subjected to verbal abuse when trying to confront the culprits.The schools, which are both located on Glen Moriston Road, finish only ten minutes apart and both begin at 9am every day leaving the small street heaving with traffic.They are now desperate for something to be done to stop the dangerous drivers.Tracy Rigley, whose eight-year-old son and six-year-old daughter attend St Angela's Primary School, said: &quot;If there was a fire there would be no way that they could get in because they block their entrance.&quot;If it carries on like this, it's only a matter of time before something happens to someone.&quot;My son has been hit by a car and my husband has had various altercations about this which leads to us being verbally abused as if it's our fault.&quot;And the parents fear the situation is only getting worse.Angie O'Donnell, whose eight-year-old son is a pupil at St Angela's, said: &quot;I took my son down to the school one day and he parked his bike and waited for me to cross.&quot;The lollipop lady came out and told him to cross but a car stopped right in front of him as he was about to step out and stopped to let his kid out - it makes you so angry.&quot;We cannot give our kids any independence because theses selfish drivers will not walk for two minutes.&quot;The school has put measures in place to decrease the traffic by implementing a walking scheme from the nearby Sainsbury's car park, but the parents say it has been ignored.Rosemary Paisley lives directly across from the schools and has to move her car from the street before taking her eight-year-old daughter to Darnley Primary School.She said: &quot;I have to move my car out of my street to Sainsbury's every morning because if I do not get it out before the school rush hour starts I would not be able to get my car out for work at all.&quot;I do not know what it is going to take for drivers to take head of what the signs are saying and what has been asked of them.&quot;Councillor Rashid Hussain backs the parent council's move to improve the road safety.He said: &quot;We're planning to put together an action group with police, pupils and parents which is all about the kids educating the parents.&quot;We are also speaking to the roads development about what can be done in to solve the issue of road parking.&quot;
