 A FED up farmer who closed his business after repeated quad bike thefts has shamed the culprits with a foul-mouthed road sign. 
Bill Clark set up Largo Quad and Clay five years ago.
 He placed the notice next to the A915 near Upper Largo in Fife making his feelings towards the vandals quite clear. 
It reads: “Largo Quad and Clays now closed due to thieving b*****ds.”
The break-ins at the farm started 18 months ago and saw one bike stolen, another severely damaged and a trailer stolen but later recovered.

Bill said: “This has been a continuing saga. We know who they are, but it is so frustrating because we can’t do anything.
“I’m a bit gutted about it. We were going to replace five bikes but that was going to be about &pound;35000 and it would have been tantamount to disaster.”
The 55-year-old added: “We had an awful lot of repeat business, and there were other people involved who got a wage which they no longer do. It’s really annoying because it was working.”
A police spokesman said: “Police are aware of reports of theft at Chesterstone Farm.
“Two men have been arrested and charged in connection with separate incidents in July and December last year.”
