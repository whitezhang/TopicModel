Grant CostelloThe Scottish Green Party has called for wage rises to tackle food poverty.New figures published in the Evening Times yesterday revealed the use of food banks had risen by more than 60% in the past year.The Greens have pledged to deliver a &pound;10 an hour minimum wage by 2020 and roll back cuts to the benefits system.Patrick Harvie, Scottish Green MSP for Glasgow, said: &quot;These figures are sobering. It's clear that the dismantling of the benefits system, the unfair sanctions regime and the low pay economy we now have are all playing a part. It's simply unacceptable in a country with so much wealth and so much good food.&quot;An immediate step we could take is to stop subsidising employers who pay poverty wages. Let's make the minimum wage a Living Wage right now.&quot;
