One of the country’s best known sign posts could be heading for the scrap heap – unless a new caretaker can be found.
The famous Journey’s End signpost at John O’Groats at the north-east point of the country has stood for almost six decades and been photographed countless times.
It marks the point 874 miles from Land’s End at the opposite end of the UK in Cornwall.
The sign has been the start or end point for thousands of cyclists and walkers but the company who owns the sign – and charges for photographs - is poised to lose its snapper at the site.
As they struggle to find a replacement, due to the remote location, they have closed the site.
A spokesman for Courtwood Photographic said: “We have been unable to find a new manager for our John O’Groats operation and therefore consider the best option would be to lease the operation to anyone interested in running the signpost independently.
“To date, no interest has been shown and therefore the signpost will remain closed until further notice.”
Peter Dymond, who has worked there for 16 years, is set to move to England.
He said: “It’ll be the end of a very long tradition. How many businesses have been around for 57 years up here?
“I’ll miss my job here very much – it’ll be a sad day when I do leave John O’Groats.”
Two years ago, the signpost was moved to a new nearby site due to redevelopment in the area and profits have dropped.
A new sign, which was free to be snapped beside, was put in its original place by leisure firm Natural Retreats.
They have undertaken a &pound;6 million redevelopment of the area with, in 2010, received a Carbuncle Award for “the most dismal place in Scotland”.
