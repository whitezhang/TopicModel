A classic Two Ronnies comedy sketch was relived in a Scots court when two men in the dock admitted stealing ‘four candles’.
And prosecutor Iain Gray, quoting a classic TV comedy sketch from the Two Ronnies, told the sheriff: “It’s four candles M’Lord – not fork handles.”
There were smiles among lawyers, court officers, social workers in Ayr Sheriff Court who remembered the famous sketch, the Ayrshire Post reported.
But Sheriff Desmond Leslie didn’t so much as blink, as he carried out his jurisdiction in a right and proper manner.
Andrew Hercus, 54, and Kevin Speirs, 39, admitted the four-candle heist from a shop in Girvan.
Defence lawyer Glenn Davis said the pair lived together in the town’s Park Road, and were prone to binge drinking.
The offence occurred at The Original Factory Shop, a large store in Girvan’s Dalrymple Street.
“It was a hare-brained scheme” said Mr Davis. “Both have drink problems. There was a full recovery of the goods.”

The theft occurred on October 16, last year.
And Hercus also admitted stealing groceries from Girvan’s Co-op store on the same day.
Speirs’ not guilty plea to this offence was accepted by depute fiscal Mr Gray.
And Hercus’ not guilty plea to stealing a watch from an Ayrshire Hospice charity shop in Girvan, a week earlier, on October 9, was also accepted.
A third person in the dock, Margaret McGill, 35, of Deacon’s Place in Girvan, pleaded not guilty to the two October 16 thefts.
Her case was adjourned for a week, and she will stand trial if she maintains her innocence.
