A SEETHING mum hit out last night after the teenager who raped her 13-year-old daughter was locked up for just three years.
The beast, aged 14 at the time of the attack, raped the girl in woods in Pollok, Glasgow, while she was drunk and “incapable of giving or withholding consent”.
The perv, now 15, was convicted last month and sentenced at the High Court in Glasgow yesterday. Judge Bill Dunlop said the attack must have been “a very unpleasant experience” for the victim.
But her mother was furious with the sentence, saying he is likely to serve only a fraction of his term before becoming eligible for parole. She added: “I am disgusted by the leniency of the sentence.
“At the very least I would want him to serve the full three years.
“It is hardly a deterrent to serve such a short sentence. That time will fly by and then he will be back on the streets again.
“I hate to think what he is capable of. He is a danger to young women.”
