AN Aberdeen fan today admitted inciting public disorder at a football match on Remembrance Sunday - by making a remark about the IRA to Celtic fans.
Daniel Fraser made the sectarian comment on November 9 last year while hurling abuse at rival supporters who were at Pittodrie for the lunchtime fixture, which Celtic won 2-1.
The 24-year-old was part of a large group of Dons fans who were being monitored by police at half time near the fenced off area separating the two supporters.
Fraser, who has been following the Dons since he was 16, was then caught by officers approaching Celtic fans before telling them to &quot;shove the IRA up your a***&quot;.
He appeared at Aberdeen Sheriff Court today where he admitted inciting public disorder by shouting, swearing and making the sectarian remark at the game.
Sheriff Alison Stirling refused the Crown's call for a banning order preventing him going to future fixtures and instead fined him &pound;300.
 

The sheriff said a ban from football matches would be &quot;disproportionate&quot; given that Fraser had no previous history of getting into football related trouble.
She said: &quot;Obviously this is a matter of concern that this happened at a football match.
&quot;But I'm not going to make a football banning order in this case.
&quot;I regard this case as at the lower end of disorder.&quot;

The court heard Fraser had been part of a large group of Dons fans who were trading jibes at the dividing fence between the two rival supports.
Fiscal depute Karen Dow said: &quot;At 12:30pm on the day the Scottish Premiership game between Aberdeen and Celtic was being held at Pittodrie.
&quot;At 1:25pm during the half time interval police noticed the accused with a large group.
&quot;He was singing and clapping his hands and pointing towards the Celtic supporters.
&quot;Police requested he stop. He walked towards the segregation area and police heard things being shouted by the accused.
&quot;He was stopped, cautioned, arrested and charged.
&quot;He was taken to the police station where at that time he admitted he had said 'shove the IRA up your a***'.&quot;
Defence agent Mike Horsman said that his client quickly accepted responsibility for his behaviour.
He said: &quot;He was singing and there were various remarks being shouted on both sides of the fence.
&quot;He accepts that he made the remark.
&quot;He did not realise at the time the significance of this.&quot;
Fraser refused to comment when leaving the court yesterday.
