A seven-year-old boy has died while skiing in the French Alps.
The boy reportedly became separated from his family as they skied in the resort of Flaine on Friday afternoon.
 Police have launched an enquiry and investigators are at the scene today (SAT) in the resort of Flaine.   
 Police chief Patrick Poirot, the head of the mountain rescue division in Annecy, said: “Specialists are at the scene to try and determine exactly what happened and understand every element that led to this tragedy.   
 “It was Friday at about 4pm. The seven-year-old boy was with his parents skiing. They were on the piste and then they could not see him. They looked for him but couldn’t see him anywhere on the piste. They went to the piste patrol and said: ‘Our child has disappeared.’   
  
 “At about 6pm some tracks were discovered in the snow. It was in a very dangerous area. In an out-of-bounds area. The tracks led to the little boy’s skis. They were there in the snow at the top of a cliff. It was very dangerous. The piste patrol could not go down the cliff.   
 “So they called a helicopter but it could not land. They spotted the boy and rescuers were winched down but the child was dead. It was now about 7.30pm.   
 “Hypothetically we think that after losing his parents, the little boy didn’t know where to go and skied in the wrong direction. He's just seven-years-old. He left the marked ski slope and probably skied to the top of a cliff. He then stopped, removed his skis, walked a little way and then fell. He fell 50 metres.”   
Flaine is a French ski resort near Geneva. It is a functional ski-in/ski-out resort popular with families. On Friday the weather was clear and sunny.
