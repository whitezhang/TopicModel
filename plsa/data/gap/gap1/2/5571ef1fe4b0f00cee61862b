A KILLER murdered a prostitute in his home - then raped two other vice girls in front of his dead victim.
Steven Mathieson carried out the horrendous attacks while his partner was on a night out - and his four year old son was sleeping in the next room.
The car salesman stabbed tragic Luciana Maurer a total of 44 times after arranging to meet her at his family home in Falkirk last December.
He then went on to rape two other escorts he called to his home that night - and they only escaped by fleeing his house naked.
Mathieson today pled guilty to murder and rape at the High Court in Glasgow.
Detective Inspector Dave Pinkney from the Major Investigation Team said: “The incidents that took place within the property in Springfield Drive led to the death of one woman and left two other females traumatised and extremely distressed having been the victims of serious sexual assaults.
“Police responded quickly to the area and detained Mathieson almost immediately. Following extensive forensic enquiries he was ultimately charged in connection with all of the reported offences.
“I would like to thank the victims and the family of Luciana Maurer for their courage and assistance during the course of this investigation.
“While nothing can undo the pain Steven Mathieson’s actions have caused, they can take some solace in his conviction as we await his sentence.”
Chief Inspector Paterson, local area commander said: “ The murder and subsequent police activity impacted greatly on the community at the time.
“This early guilty plea will be welcome news for those who have been affected locally and beyond.”
