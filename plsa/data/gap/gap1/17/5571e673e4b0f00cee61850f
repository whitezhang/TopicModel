LIMBS in the Loch killer William Beggs has been told to pay thousands in costs after a humiliating court defeat.
And the notorious “jailhouse lawyer” could have to sell his house to pay his debt.
 Beggs is serving at least 20 years for murdering and dismembering Barry Wallace, 18, in Kilmarnock in 1999. He threw his victim’s limbs and torso into Loch Lomond and his head into the sea. 
He passes his time in prison bombarding the authorities with legal claims and advising other cons on compensation demands.
But Beggs came unstuck after accusing Scotland’s information commissioner of acting illegally by refusing his demand to see the minutes of a committee meeting where one of his many complaints was discussed.
 

 Lord Carloway told Beggs at the Court of Session that his arguments were wrong and the commissioner, Rosemary Agnew, acted correctly. He then told Beggs to pay her costs, estimated at thousands of pounds. 
The judge said the loser must pay the costs of the winner, and added: “The normal rule must apply here.”
The court heard that Beggs owns property in Kilmarnock and other assets, which he could sell to pay his bill.
