KAREN Buckley’s home village was in mourning yesterday as news emerged that the human remains found in High Craigton Farm near Milngavie was her body.
Throughout Mourneabbey, a close-knit farming community in County Cork, people grieved for the bubbly 24-year-old student who grew up among them.
Father Joe O’Keefe described the police announcement as the news that all his parishioners had been dreading. He told the Times: “We were all living in hope of better news than we are now realising,” he said.

“All we can say to the parishioners is to pray for the Buckley family and to continue to keep them in our prayers.”
Karen has been remembered and celebrated in church services and at the schools where she was a pupil. Father O’Keefe led a vigil at the Curch of Saint Michael the Archangel, in the nearby town of Mallow. Parishioners packed the pews and others stood outside.
Primary school teacher Denyse O’Brien, who went to school with Karen and her three brothers, attended the mass. She said: “There were just about five other girls in Karen’s class. All those other girls were there with their parents and those parents were crying because it could have been any one of those girls.”

Yvonne Bane, principal of St Mary’s Secondary School where Karen was a pupil, has been comforting pupils and leading prayers. She said: “The school community have been sharing warm memories of our beautiful former student over the last number of days. Our thoughts and prayers are with the Buckley family.”
The Irish government has added its own messages of sympathy and support to the family. Deputy prime minister, Joan Burton, told parliament: “It’s every parent’s nightmare, what has unfolded in recent days.”
