THE funeral of a young couple who were killed when their plane crashed into an Argyll hillside was held yesterday.
David Rous, 28, and his wife Margaret Ann, 37, were flying from Dundee to Tiree to visit family when their light aircraft went off radar in the Beinn nan Lus area of Glen Kinglass, south of Oban, on Easter Saturday.
Their bodies were found that night after a huge air, land and sea search, along with the scattered wreckage of their plane.
Although they lived in Newport-on-Tay, their final resting place is on Tiree, where islanders joined family in Heylipol Church for the funeral service.
The Rev Elspeth MacLean said it was “a celebration of the lives of this young, talented, lovely couple”.
