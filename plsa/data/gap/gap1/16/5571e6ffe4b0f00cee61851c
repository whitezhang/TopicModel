 THREE people have been arrested after police recovered &pound;200,000 of drugs . 
 The seizure of cocaine and amphetamine was made in Aberdeen's Woodside area. 
Police attended a property in Rosehill Drive earlier today.
 Two men aged 27 and 31 and a 19-year-old woman have been arrested and are expected to appear at Aberdeen Sheriff Court tomorrow. 
Chief Superintendent Adrian Watson from Police Scotland said: &quot;I am only too aware that our communities across the city have again asked for tackling drugs to be a local priority and the action taken today demonstrates our commitment to dealing with this issue.
&quot;There will be no let up and we will continue to work with partners, elected members and of course the communities themselves in that regard.
&quot;I would continue to urge the public to contact us with any information or concerns they may have on 101, or anonymously via Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.&quot;
