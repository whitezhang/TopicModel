A MURDER investigation has been launched after a man was found with his throat cut.
 The 29-year-old’s body was discovered by police on Monday in a flat in Glenrothes , Fife. 
They were called to the scene on Tummel Road following concerns for the victim’s welfare.
Officers and forensics teams remained at the scene for a third day yesterday and continued carrying out door-to-door inquiries.
A number of evidence bags full of items could be seen lining the hallway outside the top-floor flat where the body was found.
 The death is being treated as unexplained as police inquiries continue. 
A source said: “The confusion is that they thought it was a suicide at first.
“But then they noticed the cut across his throat was too clean to have been done by himself.”
It is believed that officers are speaking to “a person of interest” in connection to the death.
The victim, who is not registered as living at the address, has not yet been named but is believed to be a foreign national.
A police spokeswoman said: “Police in Fife attended an address on Tummel Road, Glenrothes, at 12pm on Monday, April 13, following reports of concern for a person.
“The body of a 29-year-old man was found within and his death is currently being treated as suspicious.
“Officers are currently pursuing a positive line of inquiry.
“We would urge anyone with information about this incident to contact Police Scotland on 101.”
