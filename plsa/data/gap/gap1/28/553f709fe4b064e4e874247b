A schoolboy sparked a security alert after posting a threat online to commit a massacre at his own high school.He made the threat against fellow pupils at Dalziel High School, in Motherwell, North Lanarkshire.The Evening Times understands some parents were so concerned by the online comment that they kept their children home from school on Friday.The message, which was branded &quot;stupid and ill-judged&quot; by the school's head teacher, is believed to have been posted on an online forum last week and was read by parents who then alerted staff.Teachers investigated and spoke to the pupil, who cannot be named for legal reasons, before it was confirmed that the threat was a hoax.Robert Birch, head teacher of Dalziel High School, said: &quot;As soon as we became aware of this statement, we spoke to the pupil and it was immediately clear he regretted his ill-judged and stupid comment.&quot;Education bosses confirmed to the Evening Times that police were not made aware of the incident.Mr Birch added: &quot;We were satisfied no further action was required.&quot;Dalziel High School, which has around 900 pupils, is a non-denominational secondary school in the North Lanarkshire Council area.Last year, youngsters across Glasgow and the West of Scotland were be given advice on how to protect themselves online.Police Scotland highlighted the dangers of the internet as part of the force's Stay Safe Online campaign.Children, between 13 and16-years-olds were given advice about sexting, how to deal with inappropriate pictures, social media posting, and password security.
