DOUGHNUT chain Krispy Kreme has set its sights on Glasgow after launching a bid to open a store at Braehead.
A planning application has been lodged to convert the former Clydebuilt Scottish Maritime Museum into a giant doughnut outlet â€“ two years after the launch of a new Krispy Kreme store in Edinburgh brought traffic chaos to the Capital.
Legions of doughnut fans travelled from as far as London and Glasgow to be among the first to sample the delights of Scotland's first Krispy Kreme outlet.
Tailbacks from hungry drivers queuing to visit the Hermiston Gait store stretched back as far as the city bypass and the M8 during the first week of opening.
The store, the first opened in Scotland by the American chain, took &pound;60,000 on its first day - three times its previous record.
Now Krispy Kreme is set to hit Glasgow with planning permission expected to be granted within the next few months.
