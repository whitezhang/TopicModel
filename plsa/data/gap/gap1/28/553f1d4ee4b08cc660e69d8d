ENTREPRENEURIAL youngsters are putting their class work under the hammer to raise money for sick kids.S3 pupils from Hollybrook Academy, a school for children with additional support needs, are auctioning art work to raise cash for Yorkhill Children's Charity.And they have earned support from international auction house McTear's Auctioneers.The creative group of 15 pupils has taken over the running of Scribbles for Hollybrook, a project founded by the social enterprise class a year above them.But they have set out to make the endeavour bigger than before with their international auction.Teacher William Brown said: &quot;The project came about very organically. Myself and my colleague Victor Cannon were talking to our art teacher Anne Giles about the number of art works left over by former pupils.&quot;And we thought, 'what if we could sell it?'&quot;So we set to work with last year's S3 to found Scribbles for Hollybrook, which proved to be a huge success.&quot;Last year Scribbles was backed by Ikea, which donated frames for pictures and hosted a display of the artwork for two months.The business was launched at Glasgow's EcoChic boutique, itself a social enterprise, which set up a micro-store selling the works.This year, youngsters contacted McTear's Auctions and worked with auctioneer Natasha Rathkin to catalogue and photograph drawings and paintings.The famous auction house is now selling their efforts online at http://www.the-saleroom.com/en-gb/auction-catalogues/timed/mctears-galle...Pupils chose to donate the money to Yorkhill as the majority of them had received treatment there at some point in their lives.Youngsters also took a vote as to whether they should take a salary for their work and unanimously voted no.Mr Brown added: &quot;The young people had an option to take a wage from the proceeds but chose not to.&quot;After a discussion they decided on their own that all money should go to Yorkhill. We're really proud of them for their attitude to this.&quot;Scribbles has also teamed up with The Unexpected Artist in the St Enoch's Centre, which is selling their work in its shop.And pupils in groups of three or four are taking it in turns to man the stall,Mr Brown added: &quot;Our pupils have additional support needs but they have completely taken ownership of this project - it is their and their fellow pupils' art, they are gaining valuable customer-facing work experience, money handling and raising cash for a very good cause.&quot;I am over the moon.&quot;With the original 100 artworks now dwindling in number, the only worry now is running out of paintings to sell.Mr Brown added: &quot;We may have to step things up in the art department.&quot;The auction closes on May 10 at 8pm.
