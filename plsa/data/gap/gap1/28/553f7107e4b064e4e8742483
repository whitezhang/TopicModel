The design for a controversial new primary school and nursery campus in Bishopbriggs has been unveiled.The new facility will see Woodhill Primary School, Auchinairn Primary School and Cleddens Learning and Childcare Centre merge on the existing Woodhill site.The proposals have been met with opposition since first revealed in 2013.Parents of pupils from both schools staged initial demonstrations calling for East Dunbartonshire Council to scrap the plans.Councillors also spoke out about the closure of a Auchinairn Primary School which is in one of East Dunbartonshire Council's most deprived areas and a mile from the Woodhill site.Despite this East Dunbartonshire Council voted to close and merge the schools in January 2014.The following month Scottish ministers called in the decision over concerns that the council hadn't fully considered the impact the Auchinairn school closure would have on the local community which is in the lowest 20 per cent of deprivation data zones.They said they were also concerned that there were not adequate plans for managing traffic and congestion around the new school and that its capacity may not reflect the rolls of both schools.But the following May they said they were satisfied that the &quot;closure proposal was a reasonable one which the council were entitled to make&quot;.The Scottish minsters gave its consent to the plans with a number of conditions, including a requirement for the council to offer support to vulnerable families and to involve both school communities in the development of a travel plan and after school activities.The council is required to inform ministers of their progress on the conditions in June this year and in June 2016.Now that the initial designs for the school have been produced, residents were invited to take a closer look and speak to architects Archial Norr at a drop-in event at Bishopbriggs Academy yesterday.The council said that the design could change following public consultation.Council leader, Rhondda Geekie said: &quot;This event is an early opportunity to see what progress has been made so far in shaping the new school and it is your chance to have your say.&quot;From the very start we have been committed to creating a new school and nursery that is centred around delivering what pupils, parents, teachers and the wider community needs.&quot;
