CITY business bosses are being invited to take part in an environmental award scheme.The free event in The Lighthouse on May 7 will give them the chance to hear from previous winner BAE Systems Naval Ships.The maritime engineering company won the large management category of the Vision in Business for the Environment of Scotland (VIBES) Awards.Now in its 16th year, VIBES aims to encourage efficient use of resources, improvement of environmental performance, enhancement of business competitiveness and support for wider sustainable development.The event is the first in a series of free events across the country designed to offer local businesses the opportunity to gain insight and experience from previous VIBES winners. As well as hearing from BAE Systems, attendees at the launch event will also hear from Glasgow's Green Year 2015, Zero Waste Scotland, The Lighthouse and from the team at VIBES before embarking on a tour of the venue.Gillian Bruce, chair of VIBES Awards, said: &quot;We held the 2014 Awards ceremony in Glasgow last year so it is great to kick-off the 2015 Awards in the city. Each year we receive interest from businesses throughout Scotland, so it is fantastic to be able to host free events regionally where local organisations can hear directly from previous local winners and businesses. The events provide a great way for businesses to find out more information on the awards and the opportunities they present without feeling obliged to commit to anything.&quot;As well as hearing from a number of previous winners, each event also provides great networking opportunities for like-minded businesses. In addition to these events, we will also help businesses with their application forms with sessions specifically designed around this.&quot;VIBES is a strategic partnership between Scottish Environment Protection Agency, Scottish Government, Scottish Water, Scottish Enterprise, Highland and Islands Enterprise, Zero Waste Scotland, Energy Saving Trust and Scotland's 2020 Climate Group. The Awards are further supported by CBI Scotland, the Institute of Directors, the Federation of Small Businesses and Bright Green Business.Applications for this year's awards will open on Thursday 7th of May 2015 and will close at 5pm on Monday 13th of July.The event on the 7th of May will take place from 4-7pm at The Lighthouse - 11 Mitchell Lane, Glasgow G1 3NU.For more information on VIBES, please visit www.vibes.org.uk.
