SCOTLAND’S famous Kelpies could be swathed in dark blue and white scarves to mark Falkirk getting to the Scottish Cup Final.
Fans of the club have started a campaign to get giant scarves tied round the landmark sculptures, which lie just outside the town.
And to even the score, some fans have even suggested that cup final rivals Inverness Caley Thistle should make their own giant scarf - to wrap around Nessie.
In a Facebook page set up to promote the idea, one Bairns fan writes: “Falkirk reaching the Scottish Cup Final is a massive event for our town. To mark the occasion, we think the Kelpies should have Falkirk scarves!
“HOW AMAZING WOULD THIS BE?! Spread the word, and make it happen! Cmon Your Bairns.”
Within hours the facebook page has had 1500 likes.
Bairns fan George Cleary wrote: “Brilliant idea.”
And fellow Falkirk fan Rod Moore suggested: “Light them up in Blue as well.”
While footie fan Karen Taylor came up with the idea of getting an Inverness scarf for the most famous resident in Inverness - their monster.
Karen wrote: “This is amazing. I hope the Inverness fans get one of theirs for Nessie!”
