GLASGOW WARRIORS are to hold a charity auction to raise cash for the Glasgow School of Art's Mackintosh Appeal.&nbsp;Ravaged by fire in May last year, it is believed &pound;20million will be needed to restore the world-famous Mackintosh Building to its former glory.Fundraising has been underway ever since the tragedy and the Evening Times can exclusively reveal Warriors are preparing to do their bit to help the worthwhile cause.Along with team partner McTear's Auctioneers, the Scotstoun club will auction off 15 alternate shirts worn by the GUINNESS PRO12 leaders in their landmark 15-13 victory in Montpellier in what was their maiden away game in the European Rugby Champions Cup.It is a touching gesture as the strip design was inspired by Charles Rennie Mackintosh.Along with another jersey worn by retiring team captain Al Kellock, all the tops will be signed individually by the players.Glasgow Warriors managing director Nathan Bombrys said: &quot;We're grateful to be able to support such a worthwhile Glasgow institution.&quot;Our away shirt designs over the past two seasons have been inspired by Charles Rennie Mackintosh designs, with a Mackintosh rose design featuring on the shirts we have up for auction.&quot;It's great that we're able to team up with our new partner McTear's and utilise their expertise as auctioneers to support the appeal.&quot;We hope the auction will raise a lot of money to help the Glasgow School of Art recover from the tragic fire in one of the world's most iconic buildings.&quot;Full-back Stuart Hogg has also praised the auction and hopes fans get behind the fundraiser.He said: &quot;These signed shirts are great souvenirs for Warriors fans and all the boys are really happy to be helping out.&quot;The auction is for a great cause and I hope our supporters get right behind the campaign.&quot;McTear's managing director Brian Clements said: &quot;The Glasgow School or Art building is one of the city's most iconic structures and we are delighted to be teaming up with Glasgow Warriors to raise funds for the restoration project.&quot;We know from experience that sports memorabilia is highly collectible - particularly match worn jerseys and I am sure there will be lots of rugby fans out there who will be keen to get their hands on these rare items.&quot;Glasgow School of Art Director of Development Alan Horn added: &quot;The Trustees of The GSA Development Trust have been touched by the generosity of so many individuals and organisations in Glasgow and around the world, and are delighted to receive this latest support from Glasgow Warriors and McTear's.&quot;Hopefully, the notoriously generous and warm-hearted Warrior fans will bid enthusiastically.&quot;The auction will run at www.mctears.co.uk/live from Tuesday 28 April at 12 noon until Sunday 17 May at 8pm.&nbsp;
