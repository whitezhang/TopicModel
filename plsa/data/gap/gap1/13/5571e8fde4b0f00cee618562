A DECOMMISSIONED coal power station is vying to become Scotland’s first purpose-built cruise ship terminal on the mainland.
Developers say the &pound;300million development at Cockenzie in East Lothian would bring in around 500,000 tourists a year from Europe and the Baltic countries.
The site could accommodate at least 200 cruise liners a year, compared to the 70-80 which currently dock further up the Firth of Forth.
It would be big enough for modern liners which are too tall or wide to call into existing ports.
At present, only Orkney has a purpose-built cruise terminal, although many liners call into ports around the country.
The Cockenzie Development Company also hope to build an eco village, a visitor centre dedicated to naturalist John Muir and a business and retail park on the site.
The work would be completed in 10-15 years.
Professor Alfred Baird, maritime transport expert at Edinburgh’s Napier University, said: “It would easily represent the biggest single economic development in East Lothian for generations.”
Plans to built a giant marine energy park at the site were scrapped last month by Scottish Enterprise.
