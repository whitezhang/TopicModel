MOTORISTS may have been forgiven for thinking they were in a real-life funfair thanks to one driver taking to the road in a dodgem.
Retired fairground operator Tom Evans, from Glasgow, whizzes around Scotland in his street-legal purple car.
The 69-year-old was pictured in Hawick, in the Borders, showing off the bumper motor.
It has wing mirrors, indicators, runs on petrol and is fully taxed and while its potential speed is in the region of 75mph Tom usually sticks to a much safer 40mph. Fun-loving Tom’s wife and two sons bought him the car as a Christmas gift two years ago after he spotted it for sale on Facebook.
 

Passers-by usually stop and stare as he cruises past because they can’t believe their eyes.
The wacky vehicle would be more at home back in a funfair than it looks on the road but Tom simply loves driving around in it.
The engine came from a Reliant Robin and Tom said it needed a lot of work on the brakes and electrics.
Famous passengers have included the Duke of Argyll, who hitched a lift in Inveraray, and anyone who has a selfie taken with Tom’s dodgem is asked to make a donation to Yorkhill Children’s Charity.
