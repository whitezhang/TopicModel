A SCOTTISH seaside town centre has returned to normal after a man barricaded himself in a room and threatened to self-harm.
Officers raced to the Short Stay Hostel, Princes Street, Ardrossan at 11.50pm last night following reports of a disturbance.
They found a man holed up in a room at the hostel threatening to injure himself.
Specially trained officers including public order officers and licensed force negotiators were at the scene for hours.
The streets around the area were cordoned off until the man was arrested at around lunchtime today.
Police Scotland said: &quot;We can confirm that a 28-year-old man has been arrested for alleged disorder offences following the earlier incident at the Short Stay Hostel, Princes Street, Ardrossan.
&quot;He will be conveyed to hospital for assessment.
&quot;The road has now reopened and we would like to thank everyone for their cooperation.&quot;
