A BIN lorry driver was “out cold” at the wheel as his runaway vehicle ploughed through a row of front gardens yesterday.
 Residents watched in horror as the 21-ton truck careered down the street and tore through hedges before stopping yards from their homes. 
It was a chilling echo of the bin lorry tragedy in Glasgow last year, when six Christmas shoppers were killed after driver Harry Clark also fell unconscious at the wheel.
In yesterday’s accident, a Glasgow City Council lorry swerved into gardens in Croftside Avenue, in the city’s King’s Park area, at around 11am.
The driver was taken to hospital after the crash but no one else was injured.
 An emergency worker said: “This was a 16-ton vehicle, full with about five tons of paper as it  was recycling day. 
“It is spine-chilling to think how close we have come to another bin lorry tragedy. If this had been summer with loads of kids about, things could have been so much worse.
“The driver was unconscious and unaware of what had happened.
“This has been a really lucky escape.”
 

Julie Beckett, 43, who lives nearby, said: “I opened the curtains just as it was happening and couldn’t believe it. The driver was slumped over the wheel and he looked out cold.
“The lorry wasn’t going very fast but I think the hedges stopped it.
“Even still, there was a split second when I thought it was coming straight for the house.
“Two other boys were outside the truck – I don’t know if they hit a button at the back to stop it.”
 The lorry was towed away two hours after the crash. A council spokes-man said: “It is a huge  relief that no one appears to have been injured. We are assisting the police with their inquiries.” 
The crash came just a day after a preliminary inquiry was launched into the causes of the Glasgow bin lorry tragedy on December 22 in which six people died and 10 more were injured.
