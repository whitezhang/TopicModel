A BODY found in a harbour belongs to a pensioner who was reported missing from his home, police have confirmed.
William Binnie was last seen at his home in Kinghorn, Fife, on Saturday night but when his wife woke at 6:30am the following morning, he had vanished.
A massive search effort to trace the pensioner was launched, including the RNLI who scoured the coastline of the seaside town.
The 80-year-oldâ€™s body was found on Monday afternoon before tests were carried out to confirm his identity.
There are no suspicious circumstances surrounding his death and a report will be sent to the procurator fiscal.
