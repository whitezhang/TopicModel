SPURNED football legend Colin Hendry has been arrested by police investigating an allegation that he breached a restraining order which protects a former girlfriend.
The 49 year old father of four was questioned at Blackpool Central police station, Lancashire Police have confirmed.
Hendry, of Cyprus Point, Lytham, Lancashire, has been released on bail .
Today the former Scotland and Premiership star is due before magistrates in Blackpool on a drink driving charge .
Proceedings against him on that issue were adjourned so he could produce &quot;special reasons&quot; why he should not be banned from the road following suggestions by his legal team that his drinks may have been &quot;spiked&quot;.
The latest incident involving Hendry revolves around his relationship with 40 year old mother of two Sarah Kinder - a blonde beautician who specialised in bikini waxing,nails and spray tans.
The restraining order was issued following her complaints that despite her telling Hendry their relationship was finished he continued to park outside her home in Lytham and continued to send her unwanted messages on social media.
However Hendry has continued to contact her and was arrested following a complaint last weekend.
Lancashire Police said: &quot;A 49 year old man from Lytham was arrested in connection with a complaint about breach of a restraining order and harassment.&quot;
Hendry's life has been in a downwards spiral since the death of his wife Denise in 2009 following botched cosmetic surgery.
He was declared bankrupt with debts of over &pound;2 million and the Georgian family home on Lytham seafront had to be sold.
His attempts at football management with Blackpool and Clyde were shortlived. And last year he and Blackburn Rovers - where he was youth team coach - parted company.
He also became involved - as a victim- in a tapas bar brawl with fellow Scot and former best pal Hector Mc Farlane who maintain Hendry's still owes him tens of thousands of pounds.
