 NESSIE hunters can use Google Street View from today to hunt for the elusive creature. 
 When searching in the Loch Ness area, the usual yellow Google peg man will change to a Nessie peg monster, giving users the power to zoom into different areas of the loch. 
Tourism body VisitScotland hope the global initiative will boost the profile of Loch Ness and Scotland.
 

Chief executive Malcolm Roughead said: “The Street View project is hugely exciting for us.
“We are delighted the team at Google have been as inspired about our monster as the thousands of visitors who travel to Loch Ness every year hoping to catch a glimpse.”
 The launch comes on the anniversary of the famous “Surgeon’s Photograph” of  the Loch Ness Monster, which was published in a newspaper in April, 1934.
