SUZIE McGuire has spoken of her shame over her suicide bid as she struggled to cope with her abusive relationship with ex-husband Derek Mitchell.
 The former Clyde DJ said she realised she’d have left her children with no mother but was suffering depression at the time. 
Suzie said: “I’m ashamed of that now, because I would have left four children without a mum but I was in such a bad place.
“I was still struggling with depression which was exacerbated by the abuse and constant assaults.”
Referring to one of her children, she added: “Poppy came early and I couldn’t breastfeed initially and I was told I was a failure as a mum.
“I was not sleeping and it all came crashing down.
“I was in that place where I didn’t want to be here anymore and took steps to make that happen.
“I don’t recognise that person anymore and know there is a bright happy future out there for us. My children are my life and I’m relieved I was saved.”

 Speaking on Radio Scotland , Suzie, 45, said she’d fallen in love with Mitchell even though “the vibes weren’t great” and she’d been warned off him by family and friends. 
She said: “He was very charming, a younger man and said all the right things and I fell in love very quickly. I was swept off my feet.”
“I was always making excuses for him and never was relaxed and quite edgy. I became a wreck inwardly.
“I was afraid to voice an opinion after being told I was stupid, fat, old and ugly.”
 In January, Mitchell was found guilty of three charges of assault and one of breach of the peace and got 300 hours’ community service .
