A UNIQUE archive of photographs showing the experiences of people who travelled to make Scotland their home has been put on display on a website.
The project is the brainchild of academic Deirdre MacKenna, whose great-grandfather came to Scotland from Filignano in central Italy in the 1870s.
She said: “I wanted to create an open platform of the people and places that make up our society and, by doing so, contribute to a well-balanced representation of the multi-cultural nature of Scotland.
“It was also to give the immigrants a place to hang their hat. They can go to individual cultural associations but don’t always want to do that. They then stay in the cultural ghetto, which can lead to stigma.”
 

Deirdre is now fundraising to develop the project and plans to travel throughout Scotland collecting stories and photographs to expand the website.
She said: “The project has an initial 20-year development period to enable us to see what the archive produces from more than one generation.
“From there, we can work towards it becoming a national resource.
“It is in the DNA of us but we don’t really talk about it enough.”
 

One of the most captivating photographs is of Deirdre’s grandfather and grandmother, Pietro and Amalia Salvatore, at a wedding. Pietro is leaning on a bottle of Ruffino Chianti. Deirdre said: “The image reflects their true personalities, Pietro is reflective and quiet while Amalia appears modest and sweet.”
Pietro moved to Scotland to build a fortune to buy land back home and Amalia followed him.
The images, dating back to the 1840s, tell the story of families who migrated to Scotland from China, Ghana, Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, New Zealand, Pakistan, Poland and elsewhere.
