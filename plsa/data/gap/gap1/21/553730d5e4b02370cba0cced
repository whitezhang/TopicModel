Glasgow Prestwick Airport is to install new X-ray machines and a hi-tech security scanner at a cost of &pound;250,000.
The device, known as a &quot;body scanner&quot;, will replace the existing walk-through airport security metal detector.
It uses &quot;millimetre wave technology&quot; to scan passengers in order to detect prohibited items. 
The Scottish government-owned airport said the device, which is being used by 250 airports worldwide, would be installed in the spring.
Prestwick Airport's security manager, Ian Gregory, said: &quot;As part of our ongoing customer commitment, we've listened carefully to passengers' comments. 
&quot;They asked that the operation at our search facility remains fast, efficient, friendly and stress-free, and the new equipment will help us meet their aspirations.
He added: &quot;The technology uses automatic threat recognition software which interprets the scan data instead of creating an image and identifies areas where items may be concealed on the body.
&quot;These areas are flagged on a standardised stick-figure on a screen to indicate to the security officer areas of the individual's body which should be checked. 
&quot;As privacy and confidentiality are paramount, all data relating to the individual is destroyed after the scan is completed.&quot;
