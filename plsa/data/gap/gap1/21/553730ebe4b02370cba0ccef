A teenager has been arrested in connection with alleged laser pen attacks on aircraft and a police vehicle in Glasgow.
The incidents took place in the city's Drumchapel area. 
The 17-year-old male was due to appear from custody at Glasgow Sheriff Court on Tuesday.
Ch Insp John McBride, of Police Scotland, said: &quot;These types of incidents are extremely dangerous and will simply not be tolerated.&quot;
He added: &quot;The effect of a laser attack within an aircraft can dazzle and distract the crew - it can even cause temporary blindness. 
&quot;Luckily on these occasions no harm was caused and the pilot was able to land the aircraft safely, however the potential for catastrophe should not be underestimated.
&quot;People need to realise the dangers of this reckless behaviour and I would urge anyone to think twice before doing so as this is an offence we take extremely seriously.&quot;
