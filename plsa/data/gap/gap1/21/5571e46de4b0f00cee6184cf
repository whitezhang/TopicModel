A MURDER hunt has been launched after a father of two was found dead in his home.
 Alexander Duncan, who was known as Addy, was discovered in his Edinburgh home by his partner on Sunday afternoon. 
It’s understood the 59-year-old had suffered head and face injuries and police said they are keen to trace anyone who may have seen him between Thursday afternoon and Saturday night.
Alexander was a well-known face around Leith and is known to have spent Thursday afternoon in the Marksman bar in Duke Street with two women.
Detectives said they know who the women are but are keen to establish his movements afterwards and would like anyone who may have seen him to contact them.
They said his partner discovered his body at his flat in Primrose Street late on Sunday afternoon.
A police source said: “There wasn’t much blood in the house. He had a head injury on the right side and above his eyebrow.
“He was well-known for sitting in the Kirkgate shopping centre and was a familiar face around Leith.”
Detective Inspector Martin MacLean said: “We are keen to establish Addy’s movements between leaving the Marksman on Thursday and possibly up until Saturday. We have not had any confirmed sightings as yet and would like anyone who may have been in his company to contact us.”
The DI said specialist officers were assisting the family while uniformed police carried out door-to-door inquiries in the street.
