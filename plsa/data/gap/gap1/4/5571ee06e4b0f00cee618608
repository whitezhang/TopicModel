BUNGLING police have been forced to make a handwritten apology after breaking down the wrong door during an early morning raid.
The botched swoop at 7.30am on Wednesday saw eight officers storm the flat in Edinburgh.
Four hours later, after drilling through the front door lock, the officers from the city and the north-east of England realised they had mixed up names and targeted the wrong home.
Homeowner Alistair McPhail was horrified to discover his mangled front door after returning home from work to his Pennywell Road home.
The 52-year-old said: “It’s like the Keystone Kops. They were apparently there for four hours trying to gain entry.
“It’s ridiculous they have time to do this. I told them, ‘Next time you fancy a jolly in Edinburgh go and see the castle and leave my flat alone’.
“I’m going to have to make a complaint.”
The dad of two said his 21-year-old son had already been quizzed by police over a serious assault in the north-east of England but was cleared after just 25 minutes.
He added: “My son is going to have to [make a complaint] because he has his career to worry about. I’m really sorry for the person who was assaulted but that doesn’t justify them doing this.”
Officers left the letter in the McPhails’ living room. It said: “A search warrant obtained from Teesside Magistrates Court has been executed at your home address in relation to but once entry was gained it became apparent this was the wrong door.
“Please accept our sincere apologies for this inconvenience. If you wish to make a claim for the damage, please contact us.”
Cleveland Police said: “The officers acted on the information that was available to them at the time.”
