Abstract 
The Bayesian paradigm apparently only sometimes gives rise to Occam's 
Razor; at other times very large models perform well. We give simple 
examples of both kinds of behaviour. The two views are reconciled when 
measuring complexity of functions, rather than of the machinery used to 
implement them. We analyze the complexity of functions for some linear 
in the parameter models that are equivalent to Gaussian Processes, and 
always find Occam's Razor at work. 
1 Introduction 
Occam's Razor is a well known principle of "parsimony of explanations" which is influen- 
tial in scientific thinking in general and in problems of statistical inference in particular. In 
this paper we review its consequences for Bayesian statistical models, where its behaviour 
can be easily demonstrated and quantified. One might think that one has to build a prior 
over models which explicitly favours simpler models. But as we will see, Occam's Razor is 
in fact embodied in the application of Bayesian theory. This idea is known as an "automatic 
Occam's Razor" [Smith & Spiegelhalter, 1980; MacKay, 1992; Jefferys & Berger, 1992]. 
We focus on complex models with large numbers of parameters which are often referred to 
as non-parametric. We will use the term to refer to models in which we do not necessarily 
know the roles played by individual parameters, and inference is not primarily targeted at 
the parameters themselves, but rather at the predictions made by the models. These types 
of models are typical for applications in machine learning. 
From a non-Bayesian perspective, arguments are put forward for adjusting model com- 
plexity in the light of limited training data, to avoid over-fitting. Model complexity is often 
regulated by adjusting the number of free parameters in the model and sometimes complex- 
ity is further constrained by the use of regularizers (such as weight decay). If the model 
complexity is either too low or too high performance on an independent test set will suffer, 
giving rise to a characteristic Occam's Hill. Typically an estimator of the generalization 
error or an independent validation set is used to control the model complexity. 
From the Bayesian perspective, authors seem to take two conflicting stands on the question 
of model complexity. One view is to infer the probability of the model for each of several 
different model sizes and use these probabilities when making predictions. An alternate 
view suggests that we simply choose a "large enough" model and sidestep the problem of 
model size selection. Note that both views assume that parameters are averaged over. Ex- 
ample: Should we use Occam's Razor to determine the optimal number of hidden units in a 
neural network or should we simply use as many hidden units as possible computationally? 
We now describe these two views in more detail. 
1.1 View 1: Model size selection 
One of the central quantities in Bayesian learning is the evidence, the probability of the data 
given the model P(YI.Mi) computed as the integral over the parameters w of the likelihood 
times the prior. The evidence is related to the probability of the model, P(.MilY) through 
Bayes rule: 
P(YIM) =/P(YIw, MdP(wIMd dw, 
P(MIY) = P(YIM)P(M), 
P(Y) 
where it is not uncommon that the prior on models P(.Mi) is flat, such that P(.MilY) is 
proportional to the evidence. Figure 1 explains why the evidence discourages overcomplex 
models, and can be used to select  the most probable model. 
It is also possible to understand how the evidence discourages overcomplex models and 
therefore embodies Occam's Razor by using the following interpretation. The evidence is 
the probability that if you randomly selected parameter values from your model class, you 
would generate data set Y. Models that are too simple will be very unlikely to generate 
that particular data set, whereas models that are too complex can generate many possible 
data sets, so again, they are unlikely to generate that particular data set at random. 
1.2 View 2: Large models 
In non-parametric Bayesian models there is no statistical reason to constrain models, as 
long as our prior reflects our beliefs. In fact, since constraining the model order (i.e. num- 
ber of parameters) to some small number would not usually fit in with our prior beliefs 
about the true data generating process, it makes sense to use large models (no matter how 
much data you have) and pursue the infinite limit if you can 2. For example, we ought not 
to limit the number of basis functions in function approximation a priori since we don't 
really believe that the data was actually generated from a small number of fixed basis func- 
tions. Therefore, we should consider models with as many parameters as we can handle 
computationally. 
Neal [1996] showed how multilayer perceptrons with large numbers of hidden units 
achieved good performance on small data sets. He used sophisticated MCMC techniques 
to implement averaging over parameters. Following this line of thought there is no model 
complexity selection task: We don't need to evaluate evidence (which is often difficult) 
and we don't need or want to use Occam's Razor to limit the number of parameters in our 
model. 
We really ought to average together predictions from all models weighted by their probabilities. 
However if the evidence is strongly peaked, or for practical reasons, we may want to select one as an 
approximation. 
2For some models, the limit of an infinite number of parameters is a simple model which can be 
treated tractably. Two examples are the Gaussian Process limit of Bayesian neural networks [Neal, 
1996], and the infinite limit of Gaussian mixture models [Rasmussen, 2000].

Figure 1: Left panel: the evidence as a function of an abstract one dimensional represen- 
tation of "all possible" datasets. Because the evidence must "normalize", very complex 
models which can account for many datasets only achieve modest evidence; simple models 
can reach high evidences, but only for a limited set of data. When a dataset Y is observed, 
the evidence can be used to select between model complexities. Such selection cannot be 
done using just the likelihood, P(YI TM, g4). Right panel: neural networks with different 
numbers of hidden unit form a family of models, posing the model selection problem. 
2 Linear in the parameters models - Example: the Fourier model 
For simplicity, consider function approximation using the class of models that are linear in 
the parameters; this class includes many well known models such as polynomials, splines, 
kernel methods, etc: 
y(x) = y wi(Pi(x)  y = w T , 
where y is the scalar output, w are the unknown weights (parameters) of the model, (Pi(12) 
are fixed basis functions, (in ---- i (x(n)) and x © is the (scalar or vector) input for exam- 
ple number n. For example, a Fourier model for scalar inputs has the form: 
D 
y(x) = ao + y act sin(dx) + bct cos(dx), 
d=l 
where w = {ao, a, b,... , aD, bD}. Assuming an independent Gaussian prior on the 
weights: 
D 
$ [coa) +  cct(a, + b)]), 
p(wl$, c) exp (- - 
d=l 
where $ is an overall scale and cct are precisions (inverse variances) for weights of order 
(frequency) d. It is easy to show that Gaussian priors over weights imply Gaussian Process 
priors over functions 3. The covariance function for the corresponding Gaussian Process 
prior is: 
D 
= 
d=0 
3Under the prior, the joint density of any (finite) set of outputs y is Gaussian

Figure 2: Top: 12 different model orders for the "unscaled" model: ca cr 1. The mean 
predictions are shown with a full line, the dashed and dotted lines limit the 50% and 95% 
central mass of the predictive distribution (which is student-t). Bottom: posterior probabil- 
ity of the models, normalised over the 12 models. The probabilities of the models exhibit 
an Occam's Hill, discouraging models that are either "too small" or "too big". 
2.1 Inference in the Fourier model 
Given data D = {x ©, y()In = 1,... , N} with independent Gaussian noise with preci- 
sion r, the likelihood is: 
N 
p(yl x, w, r) cr II exp (- [y(*) - w T,12). 
For analytical convenience, let the scale of the prior be proportional to the noise precision, 
$ = Cr and put vague 4 Gamma priors on r and C: 
p(r) cr _a,- exp(-fir), p(C) or C a2- exp(-fi2C), 
then we can integrate over weights and noise to get the evidence as a function of prior 
hyperparameters, C (the overall scale) and c (the relative scales): 
E(C, c) = ffp(yl x, w, r)p(wlC , r, c)p(r)p(C)drdw = fi½2 F(oq + N/2)

where A = (T( r- U diag(), and the tilde indicates duplication of all components except 
for the first. We can optimize s the overall scale U of the weights (using eg. Newton's 
method). How do we choose the relative scales, c? The answer to this question turns out 
to be intimately related to the two different views of Bayesian inference. 
2.2 Example 
To illustrate the behaviour of this model we use data generated from a step function that 
changes from -1 to 1 corrupted by independent additive Gaussian noise with variance 
0.25. Note that the true function cannot be implemented exactly with a model of finite 
order, as would typically be the case in realistic modelling situations (the true function is 
not "realizable" or the model is said to be "incomplete"). The input points are arranged in 
two lumps of 16 and 8 points, the step occurring in the middle of the larger, see figure 2. 
If we choose the scaling precisions to be independent of the frequency of the contributions, 
ca cr 1 (while normalizing the sum of the inverse precisions) we achieve predictions as 
depicted in figure 2. We clearly see an Occam's Razor behaviour. A model order of around 
D = 6 is preferred. One might say that the limited data does not support models more 
complex than this. One way of understanding this is to note that as the model order grows, 
the prior parameter volume grows, but the relative posterior volume decreases, because 
parameters must be accurately specified in the complex model to ensure good agreement 
with the data. The ratio of prior to posterior volumes is the Occam Factor, which may be 
interpreted as a penalty to pay for fitting parameters. 
In the present model, it is easy to draw functions at random from the prior by simply draw- 
ing values for the coefficients from their prior distributions. The left panel of figure 3 shows 
samples from the prior for the previous example for D = 6 and D = 500. With increasing 
order the functions get more and more dominated by high frequency components. In most 
modelling applications however, we have some prior expectations about smoothness. By 
scaling the precision factors ca we can achieve that the prior over functions converges to 
functions with particular characteristics as D grows towards infinity. Here we will focus 
on scalings of the form ca = d ' for different values of 7, the scaling exponent. As an 
example, if we choose the scaling ca = d a we do not get an Occam's Razor in terms of the 
order of the model, figure 4. Note that the predictions and their errorbars become almost 
independent of the model order as long as the order is large enough. Note also that the 
errorbars for these large models seem more reasonable than for D = 6 in figure 2 (where a 
spurious "dip" between the two lumps of data is predicted with high confidence). With this 
choice of scaling, it seems that the "large models" view is appropriate. 
SOf course, we ought to integrate over C, but unfortunately that is difficult.

Model order 
Figure 4: The same as figure 2, except that the scaling ca = d a was used here, leading to a 
prior which converges to smooth functions as D --> . There is no Occam's Razor; instead 
we see that as long as the model is complex enough, the evidence is flat. We also notice 
that the predictive density of the model is unchanged as long as D is sufficiently large. 
3 Discussion 
In the previous examples we saw that, depending on the scaling properties of the prior over 
parameters, both the Occam's Razor view and the large models view can seem appropriate. 
However, the example was unsatisfactory because it is not obvious how to choose the scal- 
ing exponent 7. We can gain more insight into the meaning of 7 by analysing properties of 
functions drawn from the prior in the limit of large D. It is useful to consider the expected 
squared difference of outputs corresponding to nearby inputs, separated by A: 
G(x) = E[(f(x)- f(x + 
in the limit as A --> 0. In the table in figure 5 we have computed these limits for various 
values of %, together with the characteristics of these functions. For example, a property 
of smooth functions is that G(A) cr A s Using this kind of information may help to 
choose good values for 7 in practical applications. Indeed, we can attempt to infer the 
"characteristics of the function" 7 from the data. In figure 5 we show how the evidence 
depends on 7 and the overall scale U for a model of large order (D = 200). It is seen 
that the evidence has a maximum around 7 = 3. In fact we are seeing Occam's Razor 
again! This time it is not in terms of the dimension if the model, but rather in terms of 
the complexity of the functions under the priors implied by different values of 7. Large 
values of 7 correspond to priors with most probability mass on simple functions, whereas 
small values of 7 correspond to priors that allow more complex functions. Note, that the 
"optimal" setting 7 = 3 was exactly the model used in figure 4.

4 Conclusion 
We have reviewed the automatic Occam's Razor for Bayesian models and seen how, while 
not necessarily penalising the number of parameters, this process is active in terms of the 
complexity of functions. Although we have only presented simplistic examples, the expla- 
nations of the behaviours rely on very basic principles that are generally applicable. Which 
of the two differing Bayesian views is most attractive depends on the circumstances: some- 
times the large model limit may be computationally demanding; also, it may be difficult 
to analyse the scaling properties of priors for some models. On the other hand, in typical 
applications of non-parametric models, the "large model" view may be the most convenient 
way of expressing priors since typically, we don't seriously believe that the "true" gener- 
ative process can be implemented exactly with a small model. Moreover, optimizing (or 
integrating) over continuous hyperparameters may be easier than optimizing over the dis- 
crete space of model sizes. In the end, whichever view we take, Occam's Razor is always 
at work discouraging overcomplex models.
