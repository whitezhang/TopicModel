who came into contact with her”John who met David when he visited Tiree added “He was a really nice man and a very talented structural engineer with a bright professional career ahead of him“Together they made a fine couple We can only imagine what the family must be suffering“A cloud has fallen over Tiree but the island community will come together as it always does at times like this”Margaret Ann's widowed mum Catriona Maclean and sister Johann both live on Tiree John Macaskill vice convener of the island's community council added “It's absolutely tragic what has happened It's a major blow for the community “Family and friends as is done in Tiree will gather round to support Mrs Maclean in her grief”Neighbour Angus Mackinnon said “They are very close friends of ours and we are all

hours laterYesterday efforts were continuing to recover the bodies from the crash siteNeighbours of Margaret Ann and David in NewportonTay also paid tribute to them One said “They were very wellliked around here“They held a few parties to get to know the neighbours and were really nice “Margaret was a local GP and David spent a fair bit of time working away from home“He had a lot of contacts in

Balbirnie House Hotel in Fife in July 2013 and they spent their honeymoon in VeniceIain MacKinnon station officer of Oban's volunteer coastguard team was part of the group who went searching for the coupleHe said “At the loch surface it was almost perfect visibility But in terms of using the rescue helicopters they were very restricted because the cloud was down to 100metres “It was way down on the hill particularly the area where the crash site is – that was over 700metres“They took the mountain rescue guys as high as they possibly could and dropped them on the hill to walk up from there The problem with a plane crash is a plane is going quite fast If you are going at 60mph on the road a plane will go at 100mph – it's a fair impact at that kind of speed”Aviation expert David Howitt who retired recently after managing the small airfield at Glenforsa on Mull for 50 years said the weather had been bad at the time of the crashHe said “I have been taking weather readings here for 50 years and on Saturday the weather was very dubious There was very poor visibility”David said the Cherokee aircraft the couple were flying was renowned as one of the most reliable light aircraft and was often used for training purposesHe added “The sympathy of the aviation fraternity goes out to the family”As forensic experts were airlifted to the scene of the crash yesterday police said inquiries were continuing into what caused the accidentChief Inspector Fergus Byrne added “Specialist officers are at the scene and every effort is being made to recover the victims investigate the circumstances then remove the wreckage of the plane“However the area is very remote and the crash site extensive and it will take a considerable amount of time to complete our work”Try our quick news
