WATCH out Clarkson, there’s a new kid in town – his name’s Enzo and he’s at the wheel of a Ferrari.
The shiny red F340 was one of a fleet of supercars that pulled up at Yorkhill Children’s Hospital in Glasgow yesterday.
The Easter treat was organised by Yorkhill patient-turned-volunteer John O’Byrne to surprise two big car fans and other sick kids. George Leishman, 12, and Alasdair Wilson, 14, got behind the wheel of dream cars including Porsches, Nissan Skylines and Subaru Imprezas.
But it’s no surprise that five-year-old Enzo Mitchell was drawn to a Ferrari – since the famous marque was founded by his namesake, Italian race ace Enzo Ferrari.
 

John, 35, of Mosspark, Glasgow, launched a venture to make the dreams of Yorkhill patients come true six months ago and has so far treated dozens of youngsters to magical days out.
He said: “As a former patient and someone who works at the hospital, I have experienced Yorkhill from both sides and know how much things like this mean to the children.”
