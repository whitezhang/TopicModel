A DRUNKEN thug who attacked a postie and tried to steal his mail got a bit of shock – because his intended victim was a former boxing champ.
Daniel Brown, 22, assaulted Kevin McIntyre as he was delivering a package but didn’t know that, as a professional boxer, the postie won the British welterweight title in 2007.
And Brown, who has a history of violent crime , was left stunned as the 36-year-old mailman fought back.
Paisley Sheriff Court heard that on September 6 last year Kevin couldn’t find the flat he wanted, so he knocked on another door.
Brown answered, stepped towards the postman and put his arm out in a bid to block his exit.
 

He then grabbed at the mail Kevin was carrying and put his hand at the postie’s back.
Fearing the yob might be armed with a knife , Kevin punched him and then left the building before phoning the police.
When officers arrived, they found Brown was very drunk and noticed he had a piece of mail that had been taken.
Brown, of Manor Road, Paisley, admitted the offence in court.
He also pled guilty to another assault that happened in West Buchanan Street, Paisley , earlier that day.
 

On that occasion, Brown attacked 43-year-old John Bisland and robbed him of a can of cider.
John fell to the ground after being punched and had four stitches inserted in a deep gash to his face once he had been taken to Paisley’s Royal Alexandra Hospital.
After studying Brown’s record and describing the two latest offences as “particularly serious,” Sheriff Seith Ireland deferred sentence until April 16 for background reports.
Brown was remanded in custody.
