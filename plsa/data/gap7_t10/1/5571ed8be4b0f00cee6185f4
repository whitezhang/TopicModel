DON'T be surprised if you see Spider-Man running the roads and trails of Scotland.
The chances are it will be comic books fanatic Ross Lawrie, who is training for an epic long-distance run – kitted out as the Marvel superhero.
Ross is taking on the West Highland Way Race in June and hopes to run the 95-mile route in 24 hours in the costume to raise funds for kids’ charity CHAS.
The 38-year-old, from Falkirk, said: “I’ve been a huge fan of Spider-Man since childhood. I’m also a keen ultra runner and fundraiser for children’s charities.
“It was only a matter of time before all these things combined.”
Ross has competed in the annual race twice before and admits it is tough enough without wearing an all-in-one suit.
 

He added: “Luckily the Spider-Man outfit, which I designed myself, is made of Lycra so it is comfortable for running, but it isn’t warm.
“It’s the head part that will cause the most problems because it is not easy to breathe and see through.
“I am spending many training miles wearing the suit so I can get used to its limitations.”
Ross has been spotted by surprised passers-by during his run to work between Falkirk and Grangemouth.
The graphic designer also raises funds for good causes by attending functions dressed as Spider-Man.
He said: “I am the go-to for anyone who wants Spider-Man to appear at a charity event. I am proud of the thousands of pounds my superhero has raised for children’s charities.”
