POLICE sealed off a street yesterday after a man was found dead – leaving his neighbours fearing a murderer in their midst.
Emergency services had raced to Julian Court in Kelvinside, Glasgow, at 9.20am after receiving reports of a seriously injured man outside.
The victim was declared dead shortly after police and paramedics arrived.
The upmarket area is home to stars including Still Game’s Ford Kiernan, who lives just yards away.
Detectives have said they are treating the death as “unexplained”.
Last night, there was still a large police presence at the scene, which was sealed off for several hours.
Many residents were evacuated from their homes.
Jon Mills, 28, couldn’t get past the police cordon when he tried to return to his house in a lane nearby.
He said: “It’s pretty shocking, and frightening, to think someone could have been murdered just a short distance from my front door.
“I was away overnight and I have returned to this.
“It is really not the kind of thing you expect around here, it is generally a quiet area, everyone works and there is rarely any trouble.”
Another resident added: “There are loads of children around here and so people are going to be really on edge.
“It shows you aren’t safe anywhere.”
