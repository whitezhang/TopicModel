A BABY turned blue after choking on a 3in piece of rope found in a packet of baby food.
Mum Heather Macintosh slapped nine-month-old Aaron on the back four or five times before noticing something in his throat.
 Heather, from Glasgow , managed to pull it out but now wants an explanation from the makers of Ella’s Kitchen Thai Curry. 
The mother of two said: “I was at my mum’s all day last Tuesday so didn’t have time to make Aaron’s dinner like I usually do so I grabbed a couple of packets of the Ella’s Kitchen stuff to try.
&quot;The first few spoonfuls were fine then all of a sudden he started choking. He started going blue and purple so I picked him up and smacked his back four or five times.
“I eventually saw this thing peeking up at the back of his throat. It turned out to be a bit of rope.”
 
Heather, 24, kept the contents of the pack and two days after contacting the firm they told her an envelope would be sent for her to return them.
 

The auxiliary nurse said: “If I wasn’t so on the ball, it would have been a different ending. It was terrifying.
“I just want Ella’s Kitchen to promise they’re going to check all their food and to warn other parents to keep an eye on what’s inside their packaged baby food.”
An Ella’s Kitchen spokeswoman said they use an independent laboratory to investigate such cases.
She added: “Should we find a foreign object was in a product we would ensure all procedures were reviewed and revised to prevent a reoccurrence.
“The health and safety of our consumers is our number one priority.”
