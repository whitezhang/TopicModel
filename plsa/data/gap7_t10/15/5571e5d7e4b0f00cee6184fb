FIVE hundred extra GPs would be recruited if Labour oust the Tories from Downing Street, Jim Murphy has announced.
The pledge came as Labour unveiled their Scottish manifesto yesterday, with Murphy insisting the party does not need Nicola Sturgeon to make it bolder.
Murphy sought to turn the tables on the SNP leader after she made Ed Miliband a tv debate offer to lock the Tories out of Downing Street.
The vow to hire hundreds of doctors follows news of a GP shortage in Scotland.
This week, the Record told how patients had to queue outside Kersiebank Medical Practice in Grangemouth after two GPs were left to attend to 10,000 people.
Speaking in Glasgow’s East End yesterday, Murphy dismissed the SNP leader’s claim that Labour would not be “bold enough on their own” in government.
Murphy said: “The SNP have been a steady-as-we-go government, there has been nothing radical, nothing redistributive. Which of these policies in this Labour manifesto can the SNP support? The answer is very few of them.”
He also rounded on Sturgeon’s claims of a Labour “betrayal” made during Thursday’s tv debate when she said Miliband would not be forgiven by voters if he refused to work with the SNP in a hung parliament.

Murphy said: “Most Scots haven’t forgotten that they – the SNP – brought down a previous Labour government.
“And most Scots will never forgive them if they prevent this Labour government from being elected.”
He said Scots were the key to change with Labour or blocking change by backing the SNP, adding: “The SNP are not a proxy for a Labour government, they are a roadblock.”
Other policies in the manifesto include a &pound;200million mental health fund and a &pound;200million cancer fund.
Murphy also pledged Labour would establish breakfast clubs in primary schools attached to 20 secondary schools serving the poorest Scottish children.
He added: “In our manifesto I’m proud to say the party of John Smith and Donald Dewar is back in business.”
