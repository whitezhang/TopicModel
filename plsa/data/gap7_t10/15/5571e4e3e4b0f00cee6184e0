A KILLER who murdered a shopkeeper and shot a police officer was freed from jail – then stole from his girlfriend to fund a holiday to Blackpool.
 Notorious Raymond McCourt claimed he had committed the crime because he was struggling to cope with freedom and wanted to return to the prison system . 
McCourt, who got life in 1993 for murdering Khalid Mahmood and shooting a policeman, was jailed for 10 months yesterday and recalled to prison on his life sentence.
Sheriff William Wood said: “I expect you might not see the light of day for quite some time.”
 

 Perth Sheriff Court was told McCourt had been deemed suitable for release on licence earlier this year. He had gone to live with his partner Agnes Hailes, but within a few weeks she went away for the weekend and McCourt decided to help himself to her valuables. 
 He stole jewellery, cash, three watches, nine mobile phones, a video camera and a key from her home in Alyth, Perthshire , between March 6 and 8. 
McCourt, originally from the Glasgow area, took the items and pawned them for around &pound;780 which he then blew on a week-long jaunt to Blackpool.
He said he had taken the items and treated himself to a final blowout before being sent back to prison for breaching the terms of his release on licence.
