 BUNGLING security firm G4S have dealt workers another slap in the face after issuing them with redundancy letters while they were handcuffed to prisoners . 
The firm made a grovelling apology following our report revealing how security staff were served with the notices while they were accompanying dangerous cons.
After our story on Saturday, G4S agreed to re-open negotiations on the fate of 56 employees who faced choosing between having their wages and hours cut – or the sack.
But bosses then sent out the redundancy letters again, this time by Royal Mail.
Steve Farrell, of the guards’ union Community, said: “I have no idea what they are thinking about in sending out duplicate letters to somehow atone for the shambles in their initial proceedings.”
One G4S worker said: “I don’t know will be achieved by sending out more redundancy letters. The offence has already been caused. What we want is a guarantee that our jobs are safe.”
G4S blamed the redundancy threats on “restructuring”.
They have brought in part-time staff to help deliver their contract with the Scottish Government to ferry prisoners to court and hospitals.
The worker added: “Inexperienced workers are doing 80-hour weeks and falling asleep on the job.
“It’s a liability to public safety because dangerous criminals are being moved from place to place.”
After Saturday’s story, G4S tweeted: “We’re sorry for the distress this caused. All colleagues have been offered alternative jobs and financial support.”
No one from the firm returned our calls yesterday.
