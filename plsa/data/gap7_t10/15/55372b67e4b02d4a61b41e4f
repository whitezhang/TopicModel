SUZIE MCGUIRE'S abusive ex-husband has appeared on the catwalk as a model.
Derek Mitchell, 38, who was convicted of beating  the former Clyde presenter , was strutting his stuff at the L’Oreal hair awards at Glasgow’s Hilton Hotel last Monday.
Self-confessed alcoholic Mitchell claims he’s given up booze and taken up healthy living to make a fresh start.
He proudly posted his catwalk pictures on his Facebook page, saying : “As random nights go, this  was defo up there.”
 

In another post he  claims: “Four months  sober today. Life’s tough but I’ve stopped making it tougher.”
Bearded Mitchell was modelling for East Kilbride barber shop Iconic, run by Tony Cairney.
Cairney yesterday refused to comment on Mitchell’s appearance in the show.

Accountant Mitchell  was given a 300-hour  community payback order in January for assaulting  DJ Suzie.
On one occasion he broke his wife’s finger in a drunken outburst. He also attacked her after she hosted a Cash for Kids charity event.
