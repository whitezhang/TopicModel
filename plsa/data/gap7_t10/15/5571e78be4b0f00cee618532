POLICE have detained Alexander Pacteau in connection with the disappearance of student Karen Buckley.
Pacteau, 21, was identified by police as the man who picked up Karen from a Glasgow nightclub in the early hours of Sunday morning.
He told officers he had driven the 24-year-old to his flat in Dorchester Avenue where they had sex before she left at 4am to walk home to her flat in the city's Garnethill.

However Karen, originally from Cork in the Irish Republic, had not been seen since leaving the Sanctuary club three hours earlier and friends and family have not been able to contact her.
Her handbag was found yesterday near Dawsholme Park, streets away from Pacteau's flat, and search teams and forensic officers have spent most of today poring over the property and surrounding area, along with various locations outwith Glasgow

Police said Pacteau - who they initially insisted was not a suspect - had been assisting them with their inquiries throughout the day, but just after 6.30pm revealed the investigation had taken a dramatic turn.
It emerged a 21-year-old man had been detained in connection with her disappearance.A police spokesman confirmed: &quot;Officers are following a definite line of enquiry.&quot;
