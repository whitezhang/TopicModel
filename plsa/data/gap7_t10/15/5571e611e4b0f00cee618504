A GRIEVING mum and dad have paid a heart-rending tribute to the baby daughter they lost when she was only six months old.
Iona Carpenter and Kevin Hodgson knew before little Violet was born that she had a heart condition.
But she seemed to be making good progress after surgery in March when complications set in and she died with her parents at her side.
Kevin, 26, of Dumfries, said: “We cherish every second we had Violet in our lives. It was six months and 10 days but it was much more than that – it was her whole lifetime.
She celebrated Halloween and Christmas, she went sledging and she even drove a car.
 

“We parked up in the middle of nowhere and sat her on our lap with her hands on the wheel. And she loved her giraffe. It went everywhere with her.”
Iona, 25, added: “She loved being the centre of attention, she loved music and she liked looking out the window at the world passing by.
“It’s so hard to deal with. She was one of a kind.”
Violet was born last September with a condition called Ebstein’s Anomaly, which affects one in 20,000 children.
She passed away on March 22 at Yorkhill Hospital in Glasgow.
As well as her parents, Violet is survived by brother Lucas, five.
Iona said: “If it wasn’t for Lucas we’d have nothing to live for. He was a great big brother and he keeps us going.
“We put up a mask for people but inside our hearts are breaking. The pain will never go away.”
