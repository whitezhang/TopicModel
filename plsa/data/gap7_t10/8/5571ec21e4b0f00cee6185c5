A SERIOUS road crash involving two lorries totally closed a carriageway on one of Scotland's major motorways this morning.
Fire and Rescue crews from Hamilton and fire brigade heavy rescue vehicles from Easterhouse, Glasgow and Clydebank were rushed to the scene on the M74 at Bothwell, South Lanarkshire.
Firefighters used hydraulic cutting equipment to rescue a man.
Watch Manager Graham Hunter, the incident commander, said: “The collision involved two HGVs and left one man trapped by the legs.
“Firefighters immediately began work to free the casualty - this involved using hydraulic cutting equipment to extricate him and setting up a platform so he could then be removed on a rescue board.
“Our police colleagues closed the motorway to ensure the safety of everyone at the scene and paramedics were attending to the casualty while we worked to release him.”
After being lifted clear of the vehicle the man was moved to an ambulance and taken to Monklands Hospital.
The road was re-opened shortly after 8.30am
One motorist said:&quot;I was on the southbound catrriageway and I could see one lorry with the whole front totally mangled.
&quot;It looks like her has hit something high up such as another lorry.
&quot;I could see the driver still in the cab wearing his hi-visibility vest and he actually looked concious. I hope the guy is gouing to be alright.
&quot;There were loads of cars roundabout and fire engine and police.&quot;
More travel news
Traffic caught on the carriageway before the closure was put in place is likely to face long delays before being able to leave the motorway.
Traffic was being diverted on to the Raith interchange and sent north on the A725 to join the A8/M8 at Shawhead.
Major roadworks are taking place at both Raith and Shawhead adding to the long delays.
Traffic Scotland gave this advice to motorists today: &quot;Leave motorway by slip road to roundabout, take 3rd exit to A725, continue to Shawhead, tuirn left on to A8, follow permanent signs.&quot;
