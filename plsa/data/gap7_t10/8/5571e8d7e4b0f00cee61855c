A World War Two hero from Helensburgh was laid to rest with full military honours - after fears no-one would show up to say farewell.
Former Royal Marine John Taylor - who died last week at the age of 93 - had few surviving relatives triggering concerns that no-one would show up to see him laid to rest.
But following an appeal on social media, veterans and members of the public gave him a fitting send off at St Joseph’s Catholic Church, Lomond Street, Helensburgh.
John’s cousin Danny McGourlay, 76, from Helensburgh, said: “John was based in Deal Barracks, near Dover, during the war and served all over the place. He served for about two and a half years before he was injured.
“He was so proud of his military service and was a well known face in the Royal Marines Association. He married late in life and his wife died in 2004 so he had no direct family to turn up for his funeral.
“We put an appeal out for people to come and along and make sure he gets a good send off.
&quot;He was a terrific character. He had some carers who used to come in to check on him and once they were away, he was out like a bullet.
 

“He would go for a wander around the charity shops and nip into a local centre for a cup of tea. He never, ever forget his time in the Marines and loved to go along to veteran engagements.
“He went up to Spean Bridge where the commandos used to train and was so proud of his time as a Marine commando. He will be deeply missed.”
 
On the Royal Marines Association Facebook page , member Ian Rudkin paid tribute. He wrote: “Step forward now, you Royal Marine, You’ve borne your burdens true, Walk peacefully on Heaven’s streets, There is a space for you!”
Another member James McMurdo wrote: “I have managed to get some lads together who will be attending.”
