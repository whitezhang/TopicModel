TWO men are fighting for their lives in what is believed to be a knife attack on an Edinburgh street today.
A car was found abandoned near the scene of the attack and police are now hunting the attacker.
A police cordon has been mounted around a dark grey Vauxhall Astra found at the side of the road at Wardieburn Place.
One resident said: “I saw my neighbours looking out their windows and a car abandoned outside.
“I never heard anything at the time like shouting or anything but I did see an ambulance leaving with police cars going with it.”

And they added: “I don’t recognise the car, it’s not been parked there before and I’ve been here for four years.
“It might be stolen. That happens a quite often around here.”
The attack took place at around 6pm today and the road was reopened after an hour.
A Police Scotland spokeswoman said: “Police in Edinburgh responded to a report of a serious assault on two men in the Wardieburn/Pilton area of the city around 6pm tonight.
“Enquiries are on-going into the full circumstances of this incident.”
