A RUGBY player has died in a motorbike crash weeks before he was due to become a father.
Haddington forward Armandt Pryor, 23, was killed in his native South Africa on Sunday.
The popular No7’s long-term girlfriend Kylah Beeslaar, who lives in Pretoria, is expecting a baby next month.
Haddington RFC president Peter Brownlee said: “Armandt came across from South Africa in September.
“He was thoroughly committed to the club, never missed a night’s training and even though we had a very poor season, he was like a beacon of light.
“He reminded us of what it takes to be a top rugby player and he certainly was that.
“He brought a lot of the old-fashioned values to Haddington that have perhaps been lost a little in Scottish rugby. He was truly a team player who will be missed by everyone he met. It’s absolutely devastating for all.”
Head coach Bryan Craig added: “This young lad was truly one of us and about to be a dad.
“I am devastated for all his family and those who got to know him well.”
Kylah is due to have a baby boy on May 19. She shared snaps of Armandt cradling her bump just weeks ago.
In January, Armandt explained his decision to play rugby in Scotland. He wrote: “Even if it is halfway around the world, you know we gotta make them travels and it means that much to put that jersey on.”
