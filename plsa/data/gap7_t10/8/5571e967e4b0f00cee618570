A SCOTS disability charity came under fire last night after it emerged workers are paid just &pound;2.50 an hour.
Enable Scotland are paying the paltry sum to carers looking after people living with severe learning disabilities in their own homes.
The charity – who employ senior executives earning up to &pound;90,000 a year – say their job is to “campaign to fight discrimination and inequality”.
But their board are locked in a battle with staff over poor pay and conditions, including the last-minute cancellation of extra &pound;50 payments for Christmas and New Year shifts.
One worker said: “I don’t know another organisation that would get away with having the terms and conditions that Enable have.”
Public services trade union Unison stepped in after it emerged some of their members were earning &pound;2.50 to work as overnight carers in clients’ homes.
This &shy;“sleepover” rate is &pound;4 an hour less than the national minimum wage rate for over-21s and it reflects the number of hours staff were &shy;physically working rather than the time they spent on duty.
Unison have called for the pay rate to be increased and for staff to get backdated payments.
Dave Moxham, deputy general secretary of the STUC and co-chair of the Scottish Living Wage Campaign, says the workers should be paid an hourly rate of &pound;7.85.
He said: “It is also shocking to hear that a charity would use such underhand methods as to appeal for volunteers to undertake festive season shifts on the expectation of a pay bonus then reverse the previous practice of giving a bonus when the volunteers have been found.”
A spokesman for Enable &shy;Scotland confirmed that a small number of staff are paid a sleepover rate of &pound;25.77 and this is under review.
