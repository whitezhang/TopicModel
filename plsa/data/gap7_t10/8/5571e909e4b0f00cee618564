SCOTLAND'S highest-paid charity boss earns more than the Prime Minister, new figures reveal.
Stuart Earley, chief executive of animal charity the SSPCA, takes home an incredible &pound;185,000 a year.
That beats David Cameron’s &pound;142,000 and makes First Minister Nicola Sturgeon’s &pound;135,000 look modest. He is one of the most richly rewarded charity executives in the UK.
A survey by the Charities Aid Foundation found two other bosses on six figure salaries – Laura Lee of Maggie’s Centres and Dana O’Dwyer of Capability Scotland. 
The chief executives of the Scottish Association for Mental Health, Scottish Autism and Quarriers earn just below &pound;100,000 a year.
It also found pay rises unheard of in other sectors, including one voluntary organisation where the basic salary, of more than &pound;60,000, had risen by 26 per cent in three years.
There are 23,700 charities in Scotland. The average salary for a charity worker in the UK is &pound;26,500.
John Low of the Charities Aid Foundation said: “Many people remain concerned the money they donate may not be used to the best effect and charities must ensure they are properly communicating the achievements of their work.”
The SSPCA defended its strategy of paying Earley nearly &pound;200,000 a year. He came to the charity in 2007, having previously run the Deep Sea World aquarium in Fife and Whipsnade Animal Park in Bedfordshire.
A spokesperson told the Daily Mail: “Since Stuart took over we have become one of the most successful charities in the UK. 
&quot;We’ve managed to do all of this with an intentionally small management team and by spending less overall on executive pay than most comparable charities.”
