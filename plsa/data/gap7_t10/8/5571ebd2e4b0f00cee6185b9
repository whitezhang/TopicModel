A man has died following a crash one of Scotlandâ€™s most dangerous roads.
 The one car smash happened on the A9 close to Asda at Tain at around 11.30am today. 
Emergency services rushed to the scene, including an air ambulance, but they were unable to save the man.
 It is understood police officers are investigating if a medical condition was to blame for the collision. 
 The road was closed for several hours while crash scene investigators examined the area but later reopened. 
Work to convert the A9 to a complete dual carriageway has started but will not be completed until 2025, according to plans.
 In a bid to improve safety on the road, average speed cameras were installed along much of it last year.
