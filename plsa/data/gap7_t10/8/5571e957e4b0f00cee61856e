A BOGUS taxi driver lured a woman into his car, drove her to a layby and sexually assaulted her.
The 31-year-old victim got into the saloon-style car, believing it was a private hire cab, in the early hours of yesterday.
The attacker drove her to a layby around five miles away, where he attacked her.
Police say the man again drove off with the woman but she managed to get out of the car and raise the alarm. Yesterday, she was being cared for by her family.
Detective Sergeant Keith Mackay said: “This was a frightening experience for the woman.
“We are eager to trace this man and are appealing for witnesses.”
The 31-year-old woman got into the car in busy Candlemaker Row in Edinburgh city centre around 3.30am.
She was asssaulted near the Hillend ski slope in Midlothian before the attacker headed to the city bypass, where she managed to escape near the Sheriffhall roundabout.
The car has five doors and is possibly navy.
 The suspect was described as being of south Asian appearance. He is aged 35-40 and has an  Edinburgh accent. He is around 5ft5-6, slim, with dark cropped hair. He was clean-shaven. 
Detective Sergeant Keith Mackay said: “Anyone who recognises the man’s description, or the description of the car, is urged to come forward.”
Police issue guidance for those travelling by taxi or private hire car on their website. They recommend pre-booking your car and advise that you ask the company to text you when the car arrives to take you home.
 They add: “Never get into a vehicle unless you’re sure it’s either the private hire car you ordered or a licensed taxi – all taxis and private hire cars must have local authority plates and stickers  indicating the company name.”
