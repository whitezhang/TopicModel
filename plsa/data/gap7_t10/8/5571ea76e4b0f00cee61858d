A FORMER Labour MP and his councillor wife were escorted out of a Dundee city centre pub by police officers following a late night row with staff.
Jim McGovern, who announced he would not be seeking re-election earlier this month, was caught up in an argument in The Counting House in the city's Reform Street at 10pm on Thursday.
Bystanders watched as the 58-year-old and his wife, Norma, refused to leave and allegedly berated a waitress with cries of “Don’t you know who I am?&quot;
A Police Scotland spokeswoman said: “Officers attended at the Counting House, Reform Street, Dundee following a report of two people refusing to leave the premises, inquiries were made and the matter was resolved.”
McGovern caused a headache for Labour bosses when he announced he would not bid for a third term as MP for Dundee West, leaving his party just six days to produce another candidate before the registration &shy;deadline.
The 58-year-old cited ill health for his late &shy;bombshell.
