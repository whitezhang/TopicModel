A MAN tested for Ebola in Glasgow after returning from Liberia does not have the disease.
The man was admitted to the Brownlee Centre for Infectious Diseases at Gartnavel Hospital in Glasgow at around 2am today.
An NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde spokesman said earlier today: “A man has been admitted to hospital this morning and is being tested for Ebola. He had come from Liberia.”
He said it is thought “very unlikely” that the man has Ebola.
The man was given the all clear in the early afternoon.
