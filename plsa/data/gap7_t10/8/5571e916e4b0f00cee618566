THE steam engine made famous in the Harry Potter movies looks set to hit the buffers after a near-miss with a high-speed train.
West Coast Railway Company, who own the Hogwarts Express train, face a ban from operating after a driver allegedly ran a red light.
The firm could lose their licence after it emerged one of their steam engines in England almost crashed with a train travelling at 100mph.
Independent regulator the Office of Road and Rail has found “significant weaknesses” in the safety procedures, and any legal breaches could see services being derailed.
West Coast are already suspended from Network Rail’s lines over safety fears.
 

The near-miss at Wootton Bassett, in Wiltshire, last month involved a steam engine with 13 coaches of passengers coming to rest on a junction less than a minute after a First Great Western passed.
It is believed the steam engine driver passed through a red signal at 75mph after failing to spot a warning sign.
A spokesman for West Coast Railways said: “A recent breach of safety regulations involving one of our trains crossing a red light has led to discussions by both parties to establish how this happened and the preventative measures in place to ensure it can’t happen again.
“Although no one was injured, West Coast Railways consider this to be sufficient to carry out a full internal enquiry with the support of Network Rail and at this time will not be running under their current operator licence.”
