TOP health and safety lawyer, Advocate Peter Gray QC, will represent Glasgow City Council at the inquiry into the bin lorry crash that killed six people in December.
A preliminary hearing will take place in Glasgow Sheriff Court today, with the full Fatal Accident Inquiry (FAI) tabled for June.
Gray’s CV makes him an obvious candidate for the job. He represented BP at last year’s FAI into the Super Puma crash that killed 16 over the North Sea. The year before he defended the Danish shipping company behind the tug tragedy on the Clyde in 2007.
He’s described in the expert guide, Legal 500 United Kingdom, as: “The pre-eminent practioner at the Scottish Bar for health and safety and regulatory work, where his knowledge is unrivalled.”
