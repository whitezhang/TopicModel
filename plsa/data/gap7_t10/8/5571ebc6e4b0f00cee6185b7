CELTIC supporters groups have announced a pre-game foodbank collection to mark the 100th anniversary of its charitable founder Brother Walfrid's death.
The drive for donations will take place before Celtic's premiership clash with Kilmarnock at home next week.
The collection is being officially backed by Celtic and will see the food distributed among foodbanks in the West of Scotland.
Previous collections have raised thousands of pounds worth of food and cash for local charities in Glasgow.
Items specifically being asked for include sugar, tinned fish, fruit, meat and baby food.
Here's some pictures of people donating to Maryhill foodbank:

Peter Lawwell, Celtic FC Chief Executive, said: “We are delighted to be working with our supporters on this magnificent initiative. So many years after our formation, Celtic continues to be very well aware of its continued social responsibility and the club does more charitable work now than ever before.
“We are proud that Brother Walfrid’s spirit remains so strong at Celtic and through such initiatives we will continue to honour the ambitions of the club’s founders and make a positive difference to the lives of people in need.”
Tony Hamilton, CEO of Celtic FC Foundation, added: “The phrase ‘more than a football club’ rings true with this joint approach from the Club, its supporters and its charitable arm.
&quot;The story of Celtic, as seen by our Founding Father, is alive and well today more than 125 years after our formation and I hope that both of these events will be supported.&quot;

The supporters groups said: “100 years after the passing of Brother Walfrid there is still hunger and need in our communities.
&quot;“Walfrid’s vision was the formation of a successful football club based on the core principle of the alleviation of poverty in our society.”
The collection, next Wednesday night, will be staffed by volunteers.
