ANDY Murray has revealed that his fiercest rivals on the tennis court, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic have not been invited to his wedding.
The news came as 800m of bunting hung out along the streets of the town ahead of the big day.
He has not given any explanation for his decision to omit the biggest names in the game from his list.
However, they are not the only prominent names which will not feature at the nuptials.
Other prominent supporters such as Sir Sean Connery and Sir Alex Ferguson have also failed to receive an invite to the wedding.
It’s believed the most high-high profile guest will be former Wimbledon favourite Tim Henman.
Andy told the Express: “There won’t be any celebrities as such. I don’t have any celebrity friends so it wasn’t something that was planned.

“The list will be everyone who we’re close to, people we’ve spent a lot of time with in the past but also people we see ourselves spending time with in the future. That’s how we came up with the names. Pretty much everything is done now and under control.
 

The 27-year-old, who moved up to third in the world rankings after reaching last Sunday’s Miami Open final, said he has invited some of his Davis Cup team-mates.
He added: “James Ward is coming and we invited Kyle Edmund but he can’t come as he’s playing. Jamie Delgado will be there.”
The reception will be held at Cromlix, the luxury hotel in Dunblane bought by him in 2013.
