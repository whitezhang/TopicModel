GLASGOW is to take centre stage in a huge “celebration of music” being held across the UK by the BBC this summer.

The city will play host to the finale of a series events which will be held in 10 towns and cities and broadcast live across TV and radio networks “from dusk to dawn” on 5 June.
The City Halls, in Glasgow’s Merchant City, will host an all-ticket gala featuring the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra, jazz singer Jamie Cullum, pop-rock favourites Deacon Blue and bhangra artist Jaz Dhami.
The two-hour show - which will be broadcast live on Radio 2, Radio 3 and on the BBC Red Button service - will also feature an appearance from Claire Hastings, the BBC Scotland Young Musician of the Year, who won the contest at the same venue in February.
Five days of special events and broadcasts are being planned from BBC Scotland’s Pacific Quay headquarters, including the launch of new music programme The Quay Sessions and a special version of The One Show.
Tom Jones, Lulu, Ricky Wilson, George Ezra and Mark Ronson will be among the artists taking part in events elsewhere in Britain for BBC Music Day.
Bob Shennan, director of music at the BBC, said: “BBC Music Day is a unique opportunity for people to celebrate music and musical talent.”
