CHILDREN as young as 15 were among suspected housebreakers arrested by police in a crackdown in Edinburgh.
Officers launched a series of raids over the last 72 hours to tackle a crimewave that has seen the number of break-ins soar by up to 40 per cent in the Lothians.
They believe a group of up to 30 people are mainly responsible.
Superintendent Matt Richards said yesterday 14 suspects – including many young people – had been arrested during the raids.
Richards, who is heading Operation RAC to tackle the soaring number of break-ins, said: “We are looking at a group of about 20-30 individuals that we know are active frequently.
“In my opinion, we need to get to the root cause of this problem which is intergenerational in certain areas where stealing is potentially seen as a rite of passage.”
A squad of 40 plainclothes officers carried out a dawn raid on four properties in the Drylaw area of Edinburgh yesterday morning.
They were hunting for four youths who are known housebreakers but only one was detained after handing himself in.
Police in Edinburgh also arrested a 15-year-old for allegedly stealing a car, theft and various driving offences.
Police Scotland scrapped the dedicated housebreaking unit in Edinburgh when they took over in 2013.
But they reintroduced a similar team after detection rates dropped to 17 per cent. The current rate is 26.8 per cent.
In Glasgow, police launched a series of raids in Drumchapel which targeted two drug gangs involved in a violent turf war.
A 49-year-old man was arrested for alleged intent to supply drugs and a 40-year-old woman and a 38-year-old man were held on outstanding warrants.
