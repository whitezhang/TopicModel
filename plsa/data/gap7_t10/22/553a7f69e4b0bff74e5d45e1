POLICE chiefs have warned a Loyalist march through the East End poses a very high threat of serious disorder and violence.The Regimental Blues wants to hold a procession on Saturday May 9 starting on Garnock Street, travelling along Royston Road, High Street, Gallowgate, London Road, finishing in Tullis street.It is expected around 75 people will take part and that the march will take an hour.On April 16, representatives of the Regimental Blues, Police Scotland and the city council met to discuss arrangements on the day and organisers were asked why they had chosen the route.They said it had been specifically chosen to break down the barriers which are traditionally associated with certain areas of the city and their respective attachment to Republican or Loyalist causes.However police objected to the route of the march saying it posed a high risk of public disorder which could only be contained with a substantial police presence.They asked for the march to take place from John Knox Street along High Street, Gallowgate and London Road ending in Tullis Street.The organiser said he would consider moving the assembly point to John Knox Street but was opposed to the suggested new route.As the two sides failed to reach agreement, the matter has been referred to the city council's public petitions committee for a final decision.A report to councillors says: &quot;Police Scotland have made the following comments about the planned procession on May 9.&quot;Should this application be granted, community tensions could rise and the threat of serious disorder and violence is very high.&quot;This would not only impact significantly on the local residential and business community but the general public going about their daily business would also be severely affected.&quot;The report adds: &quot;It is considered there are clear risks that if this procession was allowed to proceed as currently proposed, there would be a significant likelihood of public disorder with risks to public safety and extended disruption to the life of the local community.&quot;Councillors will be told marches by the Regimental Blues last year and the year before only passed without &quot;significant incident&quot; because of a substantial police presence.The report says: &quot;It is to be noted in these previous processions by the Regimental Blues there were no significant issues with the organiser and that the participants' behaviour complied with the police and code of conduct for processions.&quot;The Regimental Blues have made a number of public statements about their views on groups which they regard as associated with Irish Republicanism.&quot;In terms of general principles of freedom of speech they are entitled to do so.&quot;However, it is feared there is a potential for a procession by the group along the planned route attracting significant opposition and protest.Members of the public petitions committee on Monday are being asked to approve a route of the march starting in John Knox Street and ending in Tullis Street.
