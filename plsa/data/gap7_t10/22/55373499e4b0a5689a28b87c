A PLAN to build hundreds of flats for rent on the banks of the Clyde has been given the go-ahead despite objections from MSPs, councillors and local people.The development by Kippax, part of the Dandara Group, is part of the massive Glasgow Harbour development.City councillors were told the multi-storey will be phase three of the GH&sup2;O scheme which has been moving west along the river.Phases one and two involved five blocks of flats which are all completed and occupied.The first plan for phase three would have resulted in a further three blocks being built on a site opposite Sawmill Road at Castlebank Street.They would have contained 770 properties with the tallest soaring to 22 storeys high.The new planning permission is for a total of 342 flats of which 78 will be studio flats, 134 one bedroom flats and 130 two bedroom flats.Shops, offices, food and drink outlets and a gymnasium are planned for the ground floor level.The flats, which will be in a block ranging in height from 12 to 16 storeys, will not be for sale but will all be available for rent.A report to the planning committee said the original scheme was relatively plain in appearance and the finish relied heavily on glazed balconies and screens to add a level of visual interest.It added: &quot;This was not considered to result in an acceptable level of architectural treatment for this high profile site immediately adjoining the River Clyde.&quot;Negative comments have also been received from members of the public and from MPs, MSPs and elected members of the council.&quot;The proposal has been amended and while the scale and massing remains unchanged, it now has a more refined facade composition and more appropriate external finishes.&quot;They now include acid etched pre-cast stone, granite and quartz coloured panels and bronze coloured metal Juliet style balconies.However the plan resulted in 15 letters of objection from local residents, MSPs Drew Smith and Sandra White and councillors Aileen Colleran, Fergal Dalton and Kenny McLean.They claimed the development was a dramatic change to the original masterplan for the area, was overdevelopment of the site and did not provide a variety of housing types.Objectors also raised concerns that having all the accommodation for rent would not create a stable population who cared about the future of the area and would result in anti-social behaviour.But the planning report said: &quot;No specific reasoning as to why the proposal would result in anti-social behaviour has been provided.&quot;There are no aspects of the proposal that would evidently or knowingly contribute to anti-social behaviour.&quot;Glasgow Kelvin MSP Sandra White said: &quot;All the residents who live in the Glasgow Harbour flats are very concerned because they bought their flats in good faith that all new flats would be the same and now they find out these flats will be rented and not of the same quality.&quot;They are similar to the flats which have been just been pulled down in the Sighthill area of the city.&quot;
