THE father of a footballer who died after collapsing during a game has paid tribute to his son.
Robert Parry, 68, said Kenny Parry was a “wonderful father and son”.
Kenny, 39, was taken ill on Friday while playing for Carluke Rovers over-35s against Easthall Star in Shettleston, Glasgow.
 His dad said: “The game had only been going for eight minutes, Kenny turned to run for the ball and just collapsed. 
“People ran and tried to resuscitate him but he was not breathing.
“The ambulance arrived and took over and they managed to get a pulse.
“They got him to the Royal Infirmary where they worked on him for two hours.
“Kenny fought very hard for his life but the doctors could not save him.
“There is still to be a post mortem but we believe he suffered a heart attack.
“The whole family is devastated.”
Kenny was married to Isobel and had two sons, Logan, six, and two-year-old Millar.
His mum Moira and brother Scott were also said to be devastated last night.
The former Clyde and Albion Rovers player was an insurance loss adjuster as well as a keen amateur footballer and keep-fit fanatic.
His team’s website said: “It was with extreme sadness and sorrow that Carluke Rovers FC today learned of the passing of Kenny Parry.
“Our thoughts go out to Kenny’s wife, children and family from everyone in the Carluke Rovers family. We are thinking of you at this sad and difficult time.”
Carluke councillor David Shearer said: “It is a tragedy for his family and friends – my deepest sympathies go out to them.”
