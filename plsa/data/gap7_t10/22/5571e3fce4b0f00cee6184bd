Police are hunting a man who sexually assaulted a three-year-old boy standing just feet away from his mother.
The incident happened at around 6:45pm on Tuesday evening in the Muirhouse area of Edinburgh.
The youngster had been walking on Pennywell Gardens when he was approached by the man and inappropriately touched.
The suspect is described as between 5’6ft and 6ft tall with a stocky build and a unshaven appearance. He was seen wearing a brown leather jacket, dark coloured trouseres and a coloured wooly hat.
He was last seen walking in the direction of Millennium Public Park.
A concerned friend of the youngster’s mum posted on social media, urging parents to be extra vigilant following the horrifying incident.
She wrote: “Can any of you mums in the Muirhouse area please be vigilant with your kids particularly around the muirhouse park and path down to martello court.
“A wee 3 year old boy was touched inappropriately at 6:45 last night. His mum has asked if u could all be extra careful she was standing very very near her son when this happened.”
She later added: “He is coping really well but mum and dad are distraught.”
Detective Chief Inspector Alwyn Bell, who is leading the investigation, urged witnesses to come forward if they saw the man in the woolly hat.
She said: “said: “We are extremely keen to apprehend this individual as quickly as possible and I would encourage anyone who remembers seeing this man in the area of Pennywell Gardens to contact police immediately.
