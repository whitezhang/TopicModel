DISABLED campaigners are gearing for a final push against plans to change Kirkintilloch town centre, saying it will lead to a "Russian Roulette" crossing.They fear problems over plans to introduce a &quot;shared space&quot; system, where controlled crossings, kerbs and other obvious road markings are removed from a busy junction.The council says a trial of the proposals last year led to a drop in traffic speed and that they want to create an area where pedestrians have an equal right of way with vehicles.But people with sight problems say they would have problems crossing the road without the 'green man' system on traffic lights and have vowed to continue their fight ahead of next week's crucial council vote.The scheme, which is part of the Kirkintilloch Masterplan, would see traffic lights, barriers and kerbs removed at the Catherine Street junction.The proposals were voted through by East Dunbartonshire Council's Development and Regeneration Committee last month. They will now go to the full council for a decision next Friday.Members of East Dunbartonshire Visually Impaired Forum are strongly opposed to the plan, labelling the new junction the &quot;Russian Roulette&quot; of crossings .Forum chairman Sandy Taylor, who attended the committee meeting where the plans were passed, said the council was 'ignoring the wishes of the cast majority of the residents of Kirkintilloch.'He added: &quot;At no time during this committee meeting was the public mentioned and once again its voice was ignored.&quot;However, it is getting louder as more and more people become aware of the full extent of what is happening.&quot;He vowed to continue with the campaign and said: &quot;The public demand the retention of safety barriers and controlled crossings.&quot;More than 1,500 people have signed a petition set up by the forum against the proposals.The forum is to lobby councillors at next week's meeting and said they feared that the town centre could become a no go zone for visually impaired people if the plans are passed.A spokesman said: &quot;We hope that with one final push the sense will prevail and the scheme will be scrapped.&quot;The council's regeneration director, Thomas Glen, said council officers had &quot;reiterated the rational behind the scheme as being to help regenerate Kirkintilloch town centre as a destination for people to work, shop and visit.&quot;
