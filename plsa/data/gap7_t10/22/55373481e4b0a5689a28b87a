A LABOUR government would get "loud and vigorous" support from the SNP on certain issues Nicola Sturgeon said.On policies where they shared a common aim there would be support, if Ed Miliband was Prime Minister the First Minister told trade union delegates.While Tories past and present warned of a dangerous alliance between the parties, Ms Sturgeon said she would back a progressive approach by Labour.She highlighted areas where the parties differed, but said the SNP aim would be to ensure Labour was bold and radical.She told the STUC Congress in Ayr again that the SNP would not back a Tory Government or help put one into power in a hung parliament.She said: &quot;: &quot;I know Ed Miliband addressed you yesterday, and let me say in some areas like improved working conditions, a determination to crack down on zero hours contracts and increasing the minimum wage - though I would like to go further than he would to &pound;8.70 by 2020 - on these and many other areas we have similar views.&quot;Where we support proposals a Labour government would put forward we will support them vigorously and loudly.&quot;But she stressed the differences and the areas where the SNP would want a change of direction from Labour.She added: &quot;It does sadden me that Labour seem determined to continue with a failing cuts agenda - not because it's necessary but because they want to be seen as tough as the Tories.&quot;I think that is the wrong approach. The Tory policy of austerity and cuts have failed and when a policy is failing you don't continue it, you decide to change it and put in its place something better.&quot;Ms Sturgeon restated pledges made in the manifesto she launched this week including a National Minimum Wage of &pound;8.70 an hour.She added: &quot;&quot;Hard-working people have been let down by Westminster - with the cost of living rising as the harsh cuts agenda takes its toll.&quot;We need a new, progressive approach to tackle inequality, boosting pay for our lowest paid workers and helping close the gap between rich and poor.&quot;She qualified her support being loud and vigorous by stating she expected Labour to offer more than at present.She added: &quot;The SNP will never, ever, ever in a month of Sundays support a Tory government but we will use our influence, if the Scottish people choose to give us that influence, to make sure the Tories are replaced not by a Tory-lite government but by something that is better, bolder, and more radical.&quot;
