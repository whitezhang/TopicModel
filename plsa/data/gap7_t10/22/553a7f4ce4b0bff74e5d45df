A funeral service will be held for a baby boy whose remains were found on a path near a cemetery almost two years ago.Police launched a major investigation after a dog walker made the discovery in undergrowth close to Seafield Cemetery and Crematorium in Edinburgh in July 2013, but the identity of the child and his mother is still unknown.The service will be held by police next week for the boy, who may have been up to six weeks old.Detective Inspector Rory Hamilton said: &quot;The tragic death of this young baby and the continued efforts to trace his family really touched a nerve with the local community and we are grateful to the public for all the assistance they provided us with.&quot;We have yet to receive the vital piece of information that can help us identify the child's mother and we will now lay the infant to rest during a service at Seafield Crematorium at 10am on Friday May 1.&quot;Anyone also wishing to come along and pay their respects is free to do so.&quot;He added: &quot;Whenever we receive any information in relation to this incident it will be reviewed and acted upon accordingly.&quot;Anyone wishing to provide us with information can do so by contacting Police Scotland on 101 or by attending at any police station.&quot;
