BOUNCERS, bar staff and taxi drivers are being recruited in the fight against domestic abuse.Police are working with staff in Glasgow city centre, including bartenders and taxi stewards, on how how to spot signs of domestic abuse and violence.And today the scale of domestic abuse taking place in city bars, nightclubs, and hotels is laid bare.The Evening Times can reveal frontline officers dealt with more than 450 incidents in the last year as senior cops speak out to dispel the myth that domestic abuse only happens in the home.Our investigation uncovered incidents involving violent partners in city centre streets, pubs and nightspots - not just behind closed doors.Chief Inspector Mark Sutherland, said: &quot;Domestic abuse can occur no matter where you are. It can happen at home, in a pub, nightclub, hotel or in the street.&quot;Drinking and drugs can make the abuse worse, but they are never an excuse.&quot;For most people, coming into the city centre means enjoying a night out, but for some people who experience domestic abuse, the night can quickly turn sour as they face alcohol-fuelled violence and abuse.&quot;Hotels in the city can offer the same 'behind close door' opportunities for domestic perpetrators.&quot;But, no matter where it happens, we will continue to deal with offenders and support victims of domestic abuse.&quot;Figures released to the Evening Times reveal police in the city centre were called to 463 domestic abuse related incidents, between April last year and earlier this month, against the five year average of 495.But tough action from police, and partnership working, has seen the culprits behind more than 77% of the incidents caught.Area commander, Mr Sutherland said: &quot;&quot;Police Scotland will not tolerate domestic abuse, working with our many partners in the public and voluntary sector, we look to ensure the safety victims and prevent further abuse.&quot;Specialist domestic abuse officers and local policing officers, who are out and about in the city centre, play a key role in tackling domestic abuse.&quot;Whether in a hotel room, pub or club we are ready to respond and to support victims of domestic abuse, which can have a devastating effect on families and communities across Glasgow.&quot;While domestic abuse remains more prevalent in residential areas, it is still all too common in Glasgow city centre.&quot;We will continue to educate and advise those in the hotel and licensing trade, so that victims are supported at the first point of contact and encouraged to report incidents to the police.&quot;We have several local schemes, including Best Bar None and Hotel Watch, which help us deliver a joined up approach and help keep people safe.&quot;The specialist officers within our Divisional Domestic Abuse Investigation Unit will also continue to provide excellent support to front line policing.&quot;Police hope working with bar staff, bouncers and taxi drivers will encourage people who see something they are unhappy with to act on it.Mr Sutherland added: &quot;Currently, we're seeing a reduction in reported incidents, against the five year national average.&quot;And while I welcome that, I do so with real caution.&quot;I remain convinced that domestic abuse is an under-reported issue, and while we are seeing a reduction we're far from complacent about it.&quot;
