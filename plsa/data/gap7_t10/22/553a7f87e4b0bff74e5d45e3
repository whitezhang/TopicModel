DETECTIVES believe late-night revellers could hold the key to catching a sex attacker who pounced on a young woman.Officers have urged a man and woman, who helped the victim into a car in Glasgow city centre, to come forward.The 23-year-old woman was in the Bistro Takeaway, in Renfield Street, at around 1am on Monday.Around half an hour later, she got into the car, possibly a taxi, and was driven to Great Western Road, near to the Lincoln Inn.She was then sexually assaulted.Detective Inspector Greg Wilkie, who is leading the investigation, has appealed for any witnesses to come forward.He said: &quot;We are in the process of reviewing CCTV images and are keen to speak to anyone who was within Bistro Takeaway, Renfield Street or anyone who was on Great Western who may have information which could assist our investigation.&quot;We are still trying to establish if the car the woman got into was a licensed cab or a private car.&quot;I would urge anyone with any knowledge or information to contact us as a matter of urgency.&quot;Anyone with information is asked to contact officers at Drumchapel Police Office on 101.
