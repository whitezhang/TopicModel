DRIVERS were today warned of a “summer of cones and delays” on Scotland’s busiest motorways because of major repairs to the M8 and M74.
The Institute of Advanced Motorists (IAM) said: “There will be short-term pain as nearly every motorway in the Central Belt is now undergoing major resurfacing or extension work.”
The warning came as a series of closures of the M74 was announced by road maintenance firm Scotland Transerv.
These include the badly-potholed northbound carriageway between junctions eight (Canderside) and six (Motherwell) in Lanarkshire, which will be shut overnight next Tuesday and Wednesday.
One motorcyclist, “razorcharlie”, tweeted: “It possibly the worst road surface I have ever travelled on. I almost came off my motorbike at 70mph had to slow to 50.”
The work is part of the first stage of a &pound;1 million resurfacing of the M74 between junctions six and 12 (Douglas) over the next year.
Slip roads onto the motorway at junction six will be closed overnight on Monday and Tuesday.
The northbound slip road off the motorway at the same junction will be shut on Thursday night.
The southbound carriageway will also be shut between junction nine (Kirkmuirhill) and 12 on Thursday and Friday nights.
Scotland Transerv contract director Gordon Wilson said: “This is one of the most important roads in Scotland, and we hope that following our programme of work, commuters, tourists and freight drivers will value these improvements for many years to come.
“We are doing all we can to keep disruption as a result of the work to a minimum.”
Work has also started on replacing the A8 dual carriageway between Baillieston and Newhouse, east of Glasgow, with a new section of the M8.
IAM policy director Neil Greig said: “Potholes, ruts and broken surfaces are unacceptable on our premium motorway network, so this is great news for M74 users.
“There will be short term pain, however. Look out for a summer of cones and delays on the M8 and the M74.”
