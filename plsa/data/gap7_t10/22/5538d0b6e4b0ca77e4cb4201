 A RAPE victim blasted the justice system after her attacker’s sentencing was yesterday put off for a fourth time. 
Heather Ratcliffe must wait another week to see evil Gerry McMurray finally jailed for a series of brutal crimes against women.
We have told how Heather was left traumatised after being held hostage by McMurray for four months.
She only escaped when she pieced together a mobile phone he had smashed.
 The sadistic sex beast was found guilty of attacking seven women over a 16-year-period. 
Heather then spent months waiting for him to be sentenced.
Yesterday, she travelled from her home in Fife to the High Court in Glasgow in the hope McMurray would finally be jailed.
But instead she looked on from the public gallery as the harrowing case was delayed until next month.
 The court heard the latest hold up was due to a Lifelong Restriction report on McMurray, 35. 
It was only received by the judge and both legal teams on Tuesday and Lady Wise said all parties needed time to digest its findings.
Brave Heather, 25, was taunted by the smirking beast from the dock.
Fighting back tears, she said: “I’m absolutely gutted.
“I don’t even know if I can make it to next week. It’s another week that I cannot get on with my life.
“He has taken enough of my life already and has the cheek to stand and laugh.
“Every time I look in the mirror I see what he has done to my face and what he has done to my arms.
“Every time I go in the bath I see every mark he has left on my body.”
McMurray was convicted in August of sexually assaulting, raping and brutalising seven women.
