A TRAMPOLINE firm which was forced to close in Edinburgh will open a Glasgow centre.Ryze, which ran a trampoline centre in Edinburgh without a licence last year , will open in Kinning Park this Friday.The Glasgow centre was scheduled to open around Christmas time last year but bosses were forced to postpone due to the problems in Edinburgh.More than 100 people were injured in the space of three weeks at the park, with seven sustaining severe injuries including a broken back, neck and other bones.The firm insisted the figures wer better than the industry standard and they should be put into context.Organisers announced via Facebook yesterday that the Glasgow centre would now be opening its doors this Friday, April 24.Following a complete renovation of a warehouse in Kinning Park, the new 10,000sq ft space comes with angled wall trampolines, a dodgeball arena, basketball court, bounce boards and parkour boxes.It will also have facilities for children under the age of 6, a theme night on Thursday and ClubRyze, a Friday night event with lasers.A spokeswoman for Ryze said: &quot;We can confirm Ryze Glasgow will be opening at 2pm on Friday.&quot;
