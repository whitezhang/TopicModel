PAOLO Nutini is up against bands like Fatherson, The Twilight Sad, Belle and Sebastian, Errors and Honeyblood for The Scottish Album of the Year Awards.
The Paisley singer’s 2014 No.1 Caustic Love is among the records on the long list for the fourth annual celebration of Scots music. It also includes Amphetamine Ballads
by the now defunct Amazing Snakeheads who had been tipped as the next big thing by music experts.
The prizes will be handed out by radio presenters Vic Galloway and Janice Forsyth, at a ceremony on June 17 at the 02 ABC in Glasgow.
From Monday (April 27) fans will be able to stream one of the 20 nominated albums each weekday at www.sayaward.com, starting with Fatherson’s I Am An Island. Listeners can catch up on each week’s five featured albums over the weekend.
 

There will then be a 72 hour public vote starting on Monday May 25.
The album with the most public votes will secure an automatic place on the shortlist, with the other nine titles chosen by an independent panel of judges.
Stewart Henderson, chair of The Scottish Music Industry Association, said: “With another great longlist to promote The SAY Award is really coming into its own as one of the most unique and progressive music prizes in the UK.
“By encouraging the public to listen to all 20 albums and hopefully discover something new and exciting in the process, The SAY Award highlights Scotland’s extraordinary musical output and reinforces how important it is that we value our artists’ work and support them at retail.”
