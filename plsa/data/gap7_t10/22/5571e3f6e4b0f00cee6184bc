A BIKER was killed on the A85 between Loch Awe and Taynuilt earlier today.
The 34-year-old lost control of his motorcycle on the Highland road at around 11.45am.
The tragedy caused long delays for motorists after the road was closed for several hours after the incident.
Police also confirmed a second serious smash believed to have involved bikers on the same road around 25-miles away at 4.50pm today.
The A85 near Crianlarich is still closed in both directions after the incident thought to involve a car and a motorcycle.

Two ambulances, a rapid response unit and a helicopter all attended the scene.
A woman, who came across the aftermath of the crash, said: “I heard a loud bang on the crash barrier and went over to see what it was. It was awful; horrific to see.
“I spoke to the driver in the car who seemed to be ok but then I looked over and saw the two motorcyclists lying on the road.”
Police have so far refused to comment when asked if anyone had been injured in the smash.
