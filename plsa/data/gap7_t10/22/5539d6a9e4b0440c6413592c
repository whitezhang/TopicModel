A NOTORIOUS nightclub's licence could be under threat after complaints from police about alleged illegal drug use.Police Scotland asked licensing chiefs to review the Arches licence after a string of incidents at the high-profile venue.A meeting will be held by Glasgow's Licensing Board today where a decision will be made if the club's licence is to be reviewed.Sanctions open to the board could include shutting the venue, or curtailing its licensed hours.It comes after a police bid to permanently shut The Arches was thrown out after it was ruled &quot;unlawful&quot;.The closure bid came after a woman was found unconscious last month and 26 revellers were nabbed for alleged drugs and booze offences.A Licensing Board spokesman said: &quot;A complaint has been received and will be considered in due course.&quot;Police Scotland had served an emergency closure notice on the premises.Lawyers for The Arches also successfully argued the police had again attempted to use the wrong legislation in how it wanted the club's licence reviewed.It was the second time in a year The Arches has fought to stay open after being linked to the death of an underage schoolgirl last February.Police ordered a review of the club after Regane MacColl's death in February last year and its licence was at risk.The club kept its licence after bosses said they has acted on the police's recommendations, including a strict over-21s policy.However, club bosses soon re-instated an over-18s rule instead.Regane, 17, from Clydebank collapsed in the club and died later in hospital.Meanwhile, a decision is expected to be made about a Glasgow restaurant which was forced to close for two months after a violent brawl.As revealed by the Evening Times, The Loon Fung, in Sauchiehall Street, was the scene of a fight between three groups of diners.Police said the closure notice was issued to &quot;protect public safety&quot;.A decision will be made on whether the restaurant can re-open.
