THOUSANDS of musicians will return to Scotland this year for one of the world’s biggest piping festivals.

Piping Live! Glasgow International Piping Festival will feature 200 events and about 8,000 performers in Glasgow between August 10 and 16.
Organisers said the festival brings in around &pound;2 million to the Scottish economy.
The 12th year of the event was launched today as a pipe band took a trip through the city on a open-top Glasgow tour bus.
The World Pipe Band Championships remain the biggest attraction in the festival and the Field Marshall Montgomery Pipe Band of Belfast will be aiming to retain their title which they have held for four years.
Festival director Roddy MacLeod said: “It’s year 12 of Piping Live! and the festival continues to grow.
“We annually attract tens of thousands of people to the city and last year Piping Live! had an economic impact of almost &pound;2 million to the city - so you could say we’re the summer’s main attraction.
“The festival programme for 2015 is hugely diverse - whether you are looking for a family day-out, are a seasoned piping or traditional music fan - Piping Live! has something for you.”
