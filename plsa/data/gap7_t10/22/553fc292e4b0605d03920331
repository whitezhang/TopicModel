A man who raped three women and threatened to rape a fourth has been given a lifelong restriction order.
Thomas Laird, 38, carried out the &quot;horrifying offences&quot; at addresses in Glasgow, Dunbartonshire and Lanarkshire over an 18-year period. 
Temporary judge Michael O'Grady QC said Laird would be eligible for parole after serving five years. 
However, the judge said he would only be released when he was no longer considered a risk to public safety. 
He added: &quot;It is clear that you are a clever, manipulative and exploitative individual who has spent many years abusing vulnerable women.&quot; 
Laird was convicted at the High Court in Glasgow last year.
He attacked one of his victims in a house in Airdrie and raped another woman in nearby Coatbridge.
Sentence had been deferred for the court to obtain reports about Laird's character.
