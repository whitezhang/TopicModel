THE anguished daughter of a man who vanished seven years ago has renewed appeals for help in finding her dad.
Heartbroken Linda Findlay’s dad David went missing without trace on May 5, 2008.
But Linda has vowed never to give up hope that he will be found safe and well.
And she and her brothers Stephen and David have searched far and wide for dementia sufferer David.
Linda, 48, told our sister title the Paisley Daily Express: “I will never give up hope that dad will be found.
“I am just hoping someone, somewhere, may hold that little piece of information that would mean the world to us.
“It could be anything. A sighting, a tiny piece of news, just anything.
“He may have been seen in a public place, perhaps a library, or a meeting place. He was from Cardonald, even though I am from Paisley, and I hope to jog people’s memories.”
David was 69 when he went missing after he walked out of the flat he shared with Linda in Seedhill, Paisley.
Linda was going through a rough time and asked him to move back to his own flat but was left heartbroken when he vanished.
 

The retired labourer was a keen walker who enjoyed strolling in Paisley’s Barshaw Park, as well as other parts of Renfrewshire.
Police searched the park and surrounding areas but could find no trace of him.
David had been living with Linda and her family for six weeks before he went missing.
The family put up posters and checked homeless units and caravan parks. Linda even visited a spiritualist hoping for information. She said: “I love my dad dearly. Sometimes I wish I hadn’t gone out or had got home earlier.
“I am his only daughter. Daddy’s wee girl would do anything to have him back.”
At the time he disappeared, David was 5ft 4in, slim, with receding grey hair. He was wearing gold-rimmed glasses, a grey jumper with white and red stripes, grey trousers, a brown suede jacket and black shoes.
