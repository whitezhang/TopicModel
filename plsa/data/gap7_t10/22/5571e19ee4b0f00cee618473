MORE than &pound;120million of taxpayers’ cash has been used for severance deals as Scotland’s public sector sheds thousands of jobs.
Around 7,000 staff took deals in the last three years, reports The Scotsman newspaper following an FOI request.
Councils, universities and NHS jobs are amongst those that have been axed.
A fresh wave of cuts looms over the next two years under plans set out by the Westminster parties and there are growing fears that the impact on services will begin to bite.
An SNP spokesman said: “If Labour and the Tories - who are currently signed up to a further &pound;30billion of austerity cuts – get their way our public services will face further pressure.
“That’s why the SNP put forward sensible plans for a modest 0.5 per cent increase in public spending - to put a stop to Westminster’s damaging cuts and allow real investment in our public services.”
But Liberal Democrat health spokesman Jim Hume blamed the SNP for the cuts.
He said: “The SNP have tied the hands of local authorities and put them in a hugely difficult position.
“The money that has been spent on staff payouts needs to be looked at carefully, but some would say that councils are damned if they do and damned if they don’t.”
