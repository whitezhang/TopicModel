Senior figures from Scottish politics are attending a funeral service for former Labour MSP and minister Tom McCabe who died last week aged 60.
Mr McCabe represented Hamilton South between 1999 and 2011 and held several ministerial positions.
He made history in 1999 when he became the first ever MSP to be elected. 
Mr McCabe died at his home in Hamilton, South Lanarkshire, after a period of illness. His funeral is taking place at the town's St Mary's Church.
Several senior Labour figures including Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy and deputy leader Kezia Dugdale are expected to attend.
During his time in parliament, Mr McCabe also had spells as minister for parliamentary business and deputy minister for health and community care but lost his seat as the SNP swept to power in 2011.
He was diagnosed with cancer in early 2014. 
Following his death, Mr Murphy said he would be &quot;hugely missed&quot;.
&quot;That he has died at such a relatively young age and with so much still to give makes it harder to understand and accept,&quot; the Scottish labour leader said.
&quot;Tom McCabe was a good man. He was a dedicated servant of the Labour movement and was a radical finance minister in the last Scottish Labour government.&quot;
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: &quot;Tom had an impressive record of public service as an MSP and as a minister in the first post-devolution administration.
&quot;He was someone who was widely liked across the political divide and will be remembered as such across Scottish politics.&quot;
