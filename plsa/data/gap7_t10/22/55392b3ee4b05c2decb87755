An Aberdeen fan who admitted inciting public disorder by making a remark about the IRA to Celtic fans on Remembrance Sunday has been fined.
Daniel Fraser, 24, made the comment last November at Pittodrie Stadium.
Fraser admitted the offence at Aberdeen Sheriff Court.
Sheriff Alison Stirling refused the Crown's call for a banning order preventing him going to future fixtures and instead fined him &pound;300.
The sheriff said a ban from football matches would be &quot;disproportionate&quot; given that Fraser had no previous history of getting into football-related trouble.
She said: &quot;I regard this case as at the lower end of disorder.&quot;
Celtic - who were down to 10 men - won the game 2-1 thanks to a late goal, after Aberdeen had taken the lead.
