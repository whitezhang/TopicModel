A WOMAN has been sexually assaulted after getting into what she thought was a taxi in Glasgow city centre.
The 23-year-old victim was helped into the back of a car at around 1.30am on Renfield Street in the early hours of Monday.
The car then drove to the Knightswood area of Great Western Road close to the Lincoln Inn pub where she was sexually assaulted.
Detectives are keen to speak to a man and woman who are believed to have helped the woman in to the car outside Renfield Street’s Bistro Takeaway.
Detective Inspector Greg Wilkie said: “We are in the process of reviewing CCTV images and are keen to speak to anyone who was within the Bistro Takeaway or anyone who was on Great Western who may have information which could assist our investigation.
“We are still trying to establish if the car the woman got into was a licensed cab or a private car.
“I would urge anyone with any knowledge or information to contact us as a matter of urgency.”
Earlier this month a bogus taxi driver in Edinburgh lured a woman into his car, drove her to a layby and sexually assaulted her.
The 31-year-old victim got into the saloon-style car, believing it was a private hire cab.
The attacker drove her to a layby around five miles away, where he attacked her.
