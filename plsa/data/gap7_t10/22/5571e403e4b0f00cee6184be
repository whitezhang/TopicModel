A young gay man told yesterday how he was left in tears after vile bigots hung a bloodied dead rabbit from the washing line outside his home.
Rhys Thomass, 27, believes the gruesome incident is part of an anti-gay hate campaign against him.
And he says the horror of discovering the animal’s corpse has made him want to leave his home of two years.
Rhys, a trainee security guard from Dundee, said: “Some people don’t like me because of 
my sexuality.
“A couple of days ago there were mouldy beans left on my doormat and some were posted through the letter box. And a dead mouse was also put through the door.
“But this rabbit was the final straw. I want to move house now.”
 

Rhys said he thought at first that the rabbit on the washing line was a toy belonging to one of his neighbour’s grandchildren.
But when he went into the shared garden at his home, he saw that the animal was real – and had blood dripping from its face.
“I just burst out crying,” Rhys said. “I didn’t know what to do.”
He didn’t want to cause further “hassle” by calling the police. 
 
But he called his MP for help, and the MP arranged for the council to come and take the rabbit away.
The council intend to report the incident to the Scottish SPCA, to investigate whether cruelty was involved in the rabbit’s death. 
Rhys has saved photos of the scene for the charity.
 

Rhys claims he was stabbed in his bed in 2009 after being abused in the street for holding his partner’s hand.
He said: “A woman started calling us names like “p***” and “bent b******”.
Rhys claimed he went to bed but woke to find a balaclava-clad man attacking him.
He said he was stabbed in the head and shoulder, and the man told him he was going to kill him because “gays don’t deserve to live”. He said prosecutors later dropped the case.
