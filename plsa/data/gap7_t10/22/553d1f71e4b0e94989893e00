The body of Irish student Karen Buckley, who was murdered in Glasgow earlier this month, has been brought home to County Cork.
The remains were accompanied by Karen's parents and brothers on a special flight from Glasgow.
Ms Buckley's funeral will take place in the north Cork village of Mourneabbey on Tuesday afternoon.
The qualified nurse moved to Glasgow in February to study occupational therapy at Glasgow Caledonian University.
She went missing following a night out at the Sanctuary nightclub in Glasgow's west end on 11 April. 
Her body was later found by police at High Craigton Farm, Drymen.
Alexander Pacteau, 21, from Glasgow, has appeared in court charged with Ms Buckley's murder.
