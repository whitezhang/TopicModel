Distrikt is Glasgow's newest late night venue and private party destination. Open Thursday, Friday and Saturday, the club is also available to book for private hire.We created a bespoke video, produced editorial and a picture gallery as part of a native package hosted on dailyrecord.co.uk to showcase the club as the go to late night venue in Glasgow's Merchant City.

Billy Bowie Special Projects Limited worked with us to produce two videos, a corporate story on the history of the brand and the other which included a competition demonstrating the companies involvement in the local community and supporting sport.

As part of the digital campaign we developed a video competition in partnership with Kilmarnock FC andthis was shared on our Facebook platform for the Kilmarnock Standard.
These videos formed part of a native package which includes editorial and a picture gallery.
