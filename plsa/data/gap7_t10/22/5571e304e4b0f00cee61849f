A SADISTIC torturer and gangster who once tried to gouge a man’s eye out with a spoon is on the run from police.
Martin Hamilton was released from prison in September last year – but is now wanted for breaching the terms of his licence.
The 53-year-old – once dubbed the ‘Blackhill Butcher’ – was jailed for life in 2000.
Police Scotland have warned members of the public that Hamilton is “dangerous” and urged them not approach the ultraviolent thug.
 

Hamilton – from Anderston, Glasgow – was a notorious gangland figure in Scotland during a reign of terror which lasted almost 20 years.
Before justice finally caught up with him, he walked free from 12 High Court indictments for crimes including possession of firearms, a shooting, serious assault and robbery.
He was finally sent down at the High Court in Inverness, convicted of ordering the kidnap and torture of victims from the Edinburgh drug scene.
In one incident an attempt was made to gouge a man’s eye out with a spoon and Hamilton also tried to cut a man’s finger off with a knife.
He was also convicted of various drug dealing offences. 
Hamilton had already served a nine-year sentence for trying to rob the Dunfermline Building Society in Anniesland, Glasgow in 1992
A Police Scotland spokesman said: “Hamilton was released from prison on licence in September 2014 and is now wanted in relation to a Revocation of Licence Warrant.
“He is described as white, 53 years of age and has short cropped fair hair.
“Police Scotland are concerned that Hamilton may be dangerous and would urge members of the public not to approach him but to contact the Police on 101 if he is seen.
“If anyone wishes to provide information anonymously they may do so through Crimestoppers by telephoning 0800 555 111.”
