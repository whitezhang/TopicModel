THE Buchanan Street underground was quiet the day author Tom Keenan had his photograph taken there.In his debut novel, however, Tom gives the station a violent makeover, when a hooded gunman opens fire on commuters, leaving several of them dead.It's one of the number of incidents in The Father, a a Glasgow-set crime thriller.The book's anti-hero is Sean Rooney, a burnt-out forensic profiler whose fearsome drink habits are spinning out of control even as the book opens.Though he's unreliable and a law unto himself, Rooney has certain skills that make him indispensable to the CID, which in investigating a chain of killings.The writing of a novel is another step forward in Tom's varied career.Born and raised in Hamilton, the 62-year-old ran a TV repair shop in the town for several years before deciding to switch direction.He began studying at college, training to become a social worker in mental health - a job he still does today.He became an independent social worker in 2001, and launched a business dealing with mental health law.He's been writing &quot;for as long as I can remember&quot; and he has published a book before The Father - although that was a non-fiction title, about adults and mental disorder. He has written novels and plays.Certainly, The Father didn't come easily for him. &quot;I think I edited and re-edited it about 100 times before I was happy with it. And that was start to finish each time.&quot;It has gone through so many versions over the years,&quot; he adds with a measure of understatementThe finished book comes in at over 300 pages, so you can gauge the amount of work that was poured into it.&quot;I remember submitting the first three chapters to the Crime Writers' Association's Debut Dagger Award, one of the top awards in crime fiction.&quot;I ended up being shortlisted for that, which was a real boost to my career as a fledgling crime writer. That helped to confirm in my own mind that I was on the right path.&quot;The characters in the book have changed so much over the years,&quot; Tom adds.He laughs at a memory. &quot;Rooney actually started out as a blind man with synesthesia - the ability to hearing colours and see sounds.&quot;Some of that is still there, but Rooney has changed so much over the years. Others have been altered as well.&quot;One adventurous device that The Father is notable for is Rooney's internal voice, with which he seems locked in eternal argument.&quot;I had looked at different sorts of narrative styles,&quot; he says. &quot;In the end, I wanted something that gave a real sense of intimacy to Rooney.&quot;The voice could be a voice in his head. It could be a hallucination, it could be Rooney himself talking.&quot;Tom also made prolonged efforts to highlight a psychological battle between Rooney and another central character, his nemesis.&quot;It is a crime thriller,&quot; he says of the book, &quot;but it's really underpinned by all the psychological undercurrents that are going on.&quot;I've been a social worker for 31 years, and I've mostly worked in mental health.&quot;It has given me the chance to get close to people - their feeling, their moods, their conflicts.&quot;I've met people who have, in a sense, harmed other people, which has given me an insight into that sort of behaviour.&quot;I've always been interested in why people do whatever it is they do - what are the circumstances that create that in an individual, which would make them want to try to harm someone else.&quot;All of that has helped me when it came to writing the novel.&quot;The scale of Rooney's alcohol problem makes you wonder if he will live to see out the final page. At one point he comes close to being slashed with a blade after an altercation with another man on the Clockwork Orange.All Tom says is that &quot;despite his problems he knows he has to pull himself together for the final battle with the other main character.&quot;But Rooney is under my skin now, definitely. He has been for quite a while now.&quot;He's still with me. I'm writing a follow-up at the moment and he is in that, too. The publishers want a third one as well. Book two is on its way, book three will be next year - though I have absolutely no idea what it will look like. I only ever thought there would be one book, but now there are going to be three.&quot;I just want to see where Rooney goes next, what he does next.&quot;He has been with me now for eight, nine,10 years, so I feel as if I really know him.&quot;* The Father, by Tom O.Keenan, is published in paperback by McNidder &amp; Grace Crime at &pound;7.99* On the web: www.tom-odgen-keenan.co.uk
