NATIONAL Park bosses have unveiled plans for a wild camping ban they claim will keep the banks of Scotland’s most famous lochs bonny for years to come.
Loch Lomond and Trossachs National Park Authority want to create four “camping management byelaw zones” in their busiest areas.
The plans are a bid to combat vandalism and anti-social behaviour they claim are blighting beauty spots.
The proposals would create 300 camping places through a mixture of permits and sites.
But the plans have been attacked by the Mountaineering Council of Scotland who say access will be unnecessarily restricted.
Linda McKay, convener of the National Park Authority board, said: “We believe our duty first and foremost is to conserve the environment of this special place for the enjoyment of this and future generations.”
Richard Graham, local business owner and member of St Fillans Community Council, backed the plans, adding: “It’s heart-breaking to see the damage being done to such a beautiful area, the rubbish being left here and the constant anti-social behaviour..”
But the Mountaineering Council said: “They are removing the rights of the responsible majority to camp.”
