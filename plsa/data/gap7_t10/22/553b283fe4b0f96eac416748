A GOVAN woman who says her life was transformed by under-threat support group Tea in the Pot has backed a campaign to save it.Caroline Mockford, 51, is hoping vital funding can be found to help the volunteer-run organisation continue its support for women suffering from loneliness or social exclusion.The Evening Times revealed last week that Tea in the Pot, which was set up by Anne Keegan and Ann McGhee, needs &pound;110,000 to survive.Caroline said: &quot;TITP was my lifeline after I was diagnosed with chronic Crohn's Disease, osteoporosis and depression. I didn't speak to anyone for six months. Going along to TITP changed that.&quot;Caroline has completed a social science HNC with the assistance of TITP volunteers, who helped when osteoporosis made writing impossible.She has also become an active campaigner for social rights, helping to reinstate public toilets in Govan and successfully leading a five year campaign to end mobile charges for calling NHS 24.Now working as a volunteer with the Citizen's Advice Bureau, Caroline recently accepted an invitation from the Scottish Government to join the Scottish Food Commission panel.She added: &quot;To be honest, if I hadn't come to TITP and met Anne and Ann, I would still be sitting in the house. They gave me the confidence to get back into the world.&quot;The women there understood my problems, they had different issues, but could relate to me. I also felt some people had worse problems - from grannies to young women - and helping them helped me a lot.&quot;It is an extremely worthwhile group and I hope a regular source of funding can be found to secure its future.&quot;Tea in the Pot, which is supported by Oxfam, has been described as a 'modern-day Steamie' - for women to chat with other women about their issues, learn a new skill or even just enjoy becoming part of a community, all in a no-pressure and non-judgemental environment.Nearly 2000 visits were made to the drop-in during the last financial year.Anne Keegan said the response to the appeal for help had been positive.&quot;Everyone has been very kind, and one member immediately handed us a &pound;30 donation, which was really touching,&quot; she said.&quot;We are having a planning meeting later in the week to discuss funders whose criteria we might fit. These things take time but we have to look at all the options.&quot;She added: &quot;We also have a 'donate' button on our Facebook page. We are hopeful the money can be found.&quot;
