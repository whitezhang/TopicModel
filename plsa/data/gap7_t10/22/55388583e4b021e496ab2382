THE new Moderator of the Church of Scotland has spoken for the first time about his battle with prostate cancer.Rev Dr Angus Morrison, who is a graduate of Glasgow University, takes up his role at next month's General Assembly.He originally accepted the nomination in October 2013 but ill health forced him to step aside just weeks before the Assembly met in May the following year making him the first Moderator-Designate in history to withdraw from the role.Mr Morrison is now urging other men to seek tests if they detect any symptoms of prostate cancer which is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in men accounting for almost 20% of all male cancers.He has given a frank and moving interview for May's edition of the independent Church of Scotland magazine Life and Work expressing regret he did not consult a doctor sooner.Mr Morrison said: &quot;I am a man who is very slow to go to the doctor with anything and I would encourage anyone with worries about the same sort of thing to go as soon as possible and have it checked out.&quot;It can be easily treated and the important thing is to have it treated in good time.&quot;I had prostate cancer. I am full of gratitude to the team at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee who carried out my surgery.&quot;The doctors involved in my treatment are confident it has been a success.&quot;I was overwhelmed by the number of people all over the Church who wrote to assure me of their prayers. I fully believe this had its own impact on the situation. Prayer is power.&quot;Mr Morrison said becoming the first Moderator-Designate in the memory of the Church to withdraw from the role as the Church's ambassador was not an easy decision but he was confident it was the right move.He said: &quot;It all happens for a reason. It was clear to me looking back that the Rt Rev John Chalmers, who stepped in last April to take up the role, was well prepared and well equipped to address the issues that were prominent during his year.&quot;Mr Morrison said he was humbled when the 2014 General Assembly asked that he be considered for nomination in 2015 if his health allowed.He has now fully recovered from the major surgery and is looking forward to taking up the role of Moderator.The church leader said: &quot;It was so kind and gracious of the Assembly to give me the opportunity. It is a great honour and a great responsibility and I am very indebted to them.&quot;
