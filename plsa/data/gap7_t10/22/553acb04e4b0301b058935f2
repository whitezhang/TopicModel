A TORY election candidate has been slammed for making &quot;sexist&quot; comments about women in trade unions.
Gordon McCaskill, who is standing in Glasgow South West, claimed women are &quot;not keen&quot; on going on strike.
He made the comment in a public hustings where he was asked about trade union laws.
The Scottish Conservative party distanced themselves from the comments.
In the filmed recording, McCaskill said: &quot;We do believe that when you take a strike ballot there should be more than 50 per cent of people who vote on it, which has not been happening for several years.
&quot;My own view is that the trade unions nowadays have got a significant problem because they have a large number of female employees who are unionists and they are not keen on going on strike.&quot;
The audience begin to boo and shout &quot;sexist&quot; at McCaskill, an East Renfrewshire councillor.
Video contains one instance of strong language:

Chris Stephens, the SNP candidate for Glasgow South West, said: &quot;These sexist and misogynist remarks by Gordon McCaskill are a totally out of order - and reveal that Tories remain stuck in the dark old days of the past.‚Äù
A spokesman for the Scottish Conservatives said: &quot;As Mr McCaskill said himself, these are his own views. They are the not the views of the Scottish Conservative party.&quot;
