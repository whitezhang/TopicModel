AN after-school worker has been struck off after sumo wrestling with her boyfriend in front of young children.
Nicola McDonald, a registered social worker, engaged in “horseplay” with her partner while manager of the after-school club at Flora Stevenson Primary School in Edinburgh.
The mum-of-two donned a sumo suit and “inappropriately” grappled in front of children as young as five.
She also swore at workmen, stole from petty cash and claimed almost &pound;300 she wasn’t entitled to.
McDonald, who worked at the school from November 2008 to April 2013, was removed from the register by the Scottish Social Services Council after all 23 charges against her were proved.
The ex-manager kept school iPads at home for her children to use, let her kids use the club mobile phone and bought equipment using club funds.
She also listened to dance music in the club office during work hours and allowed her children to attend the club when they weren’t entitled to.
She went as far as forging statements of fees to say she had paid for them to attend. The fees amounted to several thousands of pounds.
She was dismissed as manager on April 25, 2013 for “gross misconduct”.
The panel struck her off, agreeing her misconduct was “serious and deliberate” and “fundamentally incompatible with being a social service worker”.
