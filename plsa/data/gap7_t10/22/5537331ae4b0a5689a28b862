STEWART PATERSONPolitical CorrespondentTHE difference between student tuition fees north and south of the border is why the UK needs more SNP MPs Alex Salmond said.The former First Minister gave a speech at Glasgow University where he received an Honorary Degree for services to politics and Scotland.Mr Salmond said that former Prime Minister Tony Blair reneged on a manifesto commitment not to impose fees on students, he said it was &quot;his Nick Clegg moment&quot;.Mr Salmond told the audience of staff and students that the five SNP MPs at the time voted with many Labour 'rebels' but that with his large majority Mr Blair got the policy through the House of Commons.He said: &quot;We took the decision to intervene in what seemed an English only matter because we thought the policy could impact on the competitive position of Scottish universities.&quot;And so we voted with the Labour rebels and the opposition and indeed the majority will of English MPs - and the overwhelming view of the English people. It was a close run thing for the Prime Minister, and his policy was carried by a mere five votes.&quot;Significantly, it was carried on the back of the vote of Scottish Labour MPs who imposed it on England safe in the knowledge that it did not have an immediate impact on their own constituents.&quot;He said he suspected that many students in England then and now wish there was a higher number of SNP MPs that day.Mr Salmond gave his speech on the themes of economics and empathy quoting extensively from economist Adam Smith one of Glasgow University's most celebrated graduates.He said what Adam Smith's two great works The Wealth of Nations and The Theory of Moral Sentiments taught was that self-interest without sympathy serves no interest.Mr Salmond said: &quot;&quot;And that is why we should dwell on practical experience and dismiss as unenlightened self-interest the rhetoric emanating from the Westminster parties.&quot;These are the same people who only last year said that Scotland should play a full part in the United Kingdom - of course when David Cameron said that he meant us to have our usual bit part, not the possible big part that is emerging from this election debate.&quot;What these Westminster parties fear - and what many people in England would welcome - is not just the size of the SNP, but the majority for progressive politics that would come from it.&quot;He recalled Glasgow trade union leader Jimmy Reid's famous 'Rat Race' speech at the university in the 1970s,He said research has now shown that caged rats when given the choice between the opportunity to free other rats or eat cheese, chose the former.He accused the 'Westminster parties' of unenlightened self-interest and said: &quot;If even rats have empathy, so can humans.&quot; adding: &quot;The toleration of inequality demonstrates the empathy gap.&quot;Mr Salmond who hopes to return to the House of Commons as MP for Gordon at the election said: &quot;What these Westminster parties fear and what many people in England would welcome, is not just the size of the SNP, but the majority for progressive politics that would come from it.&quot;
