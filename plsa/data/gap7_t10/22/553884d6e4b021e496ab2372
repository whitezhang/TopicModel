CARERS should have better access to respite, the Scottish Conservatives said.The Tories have pledged to secure a fully-funded week of respite for people caring for more than 50 hours a week.Jackson Carlaw, Tory health spokesman, said the National Carers' Break Guarantee would reward the &quot;unsung heroes of our society&quot; and ensure everyone who cares for someone over that timescale could access the flexible week.He said: &quot;Carers are the unsung heroes of our society, of that there is no question.&quot;Without their dedication our public services would collapse under the weight of so many demands.&quot;That's why it's so important we give them all the support we can.&quot;A fully funded week of respite can help them take some time for themselves and recharge the batteries.&quot;
