VOLLEYBALL legend Barry Robertson has finally retired from the game – at the age of 60.
 The player, who was 16 when he took up the sport , went out with a bang when he won his tenth Scottish Cup in his final game for Glasgow Mets this month. 
Barry has been capped for Scotland 75 times – and he’s especially proud of his 100 per cent record against the Auld Enemy, with 14 victories in 14 matches against England.
He said he still believes he could continue playing.
But he added: “How many 60-year-olds do you know who could play at first division level at any sport?
“It just doesn’t happen.”
 

Barry joked: “It’s a wee bit embarrassing for the Scottish Volleyball Association that there was a 60-year-old playing in the Scottish Cup final.”
 The father of two won his first honour in 1972 when Coatbridge High School triumphed in the British Schools Championship. 
 
Since then, he has amassed nine league titles.
Barry, of Bothwell, Lanarkshire, said he’s managed to stay in the game thanks to few injuries. But he did reveal the sport almost cost him his life.
He said: “I have been quite lucky with injuries.
“I did have quite a serious one in Edinburgh one year when I dived on the floor and got impaled on a large splinter about six inches long.

“It went into my chest, a couple of inches from my heart.
“There was a German doctor at the training session and he got me off the floor. Otherwise I might have been stuck there for a wee while.”
Barry had emergency surgery following the accident in February 1980. But he was soon back playing again.
The defender, who runs an interior refurbishment company, will continue to train with the Mets.
Margaret Ann Fleming, chief executive of Scottish Volleyball, said: “Barry truly is an inspiration.”
Andy Fleming, head coach of Glasgow Mets, said: “Barry’s on-court performances at 60 years old is nothing short of incredible.”
