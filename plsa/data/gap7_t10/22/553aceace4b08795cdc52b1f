TWO armed men escaped with a five-figure sum of money after robbing a post office.

The pair went into the post office in Quarrywood Avenue, Barmulloch, north Glasgow, at around 7.55am today, threatened the member of staff with a knife and demanded money.
The employee, a 27-year-old man, was not injured but has been left badly shaken by the ordeal.
The suspects are described as white and one of them is aged around 35-40 with short brown hair. He was wearing a black jumper.
Detective Sergeant Raymond Hunter said: “We have been are carrying our door-to-door inquiries and are in the process of collecting CCTV images from the surrounding area.
“There are a number of other shops in this area and people may have seen the two men prior to or after the incident.
“I am therefore appealing to anyone who was in the area or any local residents to contact us - any information you have could assist our inquiry.”
