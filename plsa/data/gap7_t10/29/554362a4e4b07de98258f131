 Celtic striker John Guidetti has been found guilty and given a warning by the Scottish FA for making an &quot;offensive comment&quot; in a television interview. 
 The Swede, who is on loan from English Premier League club Manchester City, sang a song on a Dutch TV channel which appeared to make fun of rivals Rangers. 
 Celtic had expressed their disappointment when the SFA announced the player was to be investigated. 
 During the broadcast he repeated a chant sung about him by supporters. 
 The SFA's compliance officer said that the 23-year-old broke disciplinary rule 73 by making a &quot;comment of an offensive nature&quot;. 
 &quot;We are very surprised and disappointed that this has even found its way to an SFA judicial panel,&quot; said a Celtic spokesman at the time. 
 Speaking to BBC Radio Scotland last month, former SFA compliance officer Vincent Lunny said: &quot;It would appear that their focus is on the comment attacking Rangers or making fun of Rangers for having gone into liquidation back in 2012. 
 &quot;[Celtic forward] Leigh Griffiths this time last year was sent a charge for singing 'Hearts are going bust'. 
 &quot;For me, the problem with this case and with the Griffiths case is you've got professionals who are making fun of other clubs in difficulty. People are losing their jobs within football and it's simply not appropriate for players to behave in public in that manner. 
 &quot;There are different standards between the fans and the players. The players are directly under the jurisdiction of the SFA, the fans are not. 
 &quot;That is not necessarily the case here with players. You expect fans to make fun of other clubs and taking delight in another club's demise is not surprising for fans to do but for players to do it is perhaps something completely different.&quot; 
 Guidetti, a Swedish international, has scored 15 goals this season but is yet to commit his future to the club.
