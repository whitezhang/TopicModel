A COUPLE appeared in court on Wednesday accused of having a crossbow at a mansion where Prince Charles was staying.
Steven Stewart, 38, and Mary McDougall, 23, were arrested by armed police at Dumfries House in Cumnock, Ayrshire.
McDougall is also accused of having a knife in a public place during the same incident, which happened on Tuesday.
It is understood they were detected by the royal security team with the prince, who was on a two-day visit to the mansion.
The pair appeared in private on Wednesday at Ayr Sheriff Court.
They made no plea or declaration and the case was continued until next month.
Both were remanded in custody by Sheriff Carole Cunninghame.
Stewart and McDougall, from Catrine, Ayrshire, are charged with creating “fear and alarm” by displaying the weapon while a member of the Royal Family was in residence.
They are also accused of “displaying a crossbow openly”, breaching the peace and behaving in a disorderly manner.
Charles arrived at the estate – which he previously saved from closure – on Tuesday and remained there yesterday, opening an education centre and a gym.
 

The 18th century stately home offers a range of training programmes.
Charles, whose second grandchild is due to be born soon, is great steward of the Dumfries House Trust. He headed a consortium of charities and heritage bodies who bought the house and land in 2007.
It opened to the public for the first time in 250 years in summer 2008 and attracts thousands of visitors every year.
Security is stepped up at the site and surrounding area when Royals are in residence.
Charles has visited a number of times and was joined by Prince William and Kate to greet wellwishers in April 2013.
On Wednesday, he tried his hand at badminton and table tennis as he opened the new indoor sports centre.
He said: “We can’t always rely on the weather here so an indoor centre was a priority.
“We know what a difference it can make to local youth groups, football clubs and fitness classes.”
