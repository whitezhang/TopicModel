Scots have raised almost Â£2.5 million in 48 hours for the thousands caught up in the devastating Nepal earthquake.The 7.8-magnitude quake left more than 5,000 dead and has affected an estimated eight million people.A massive relief operation was launched and the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) said food, water and shelter kits are beginning to reach remote villages despite &quot;huge&quot; logistical challenges.People in the UK donated &pound;26 million to the DEC's Nepal Earthquake Appeal within 48 hours of its launch, with &pound;2.2 million raised in Scotland alone.Combined with a &pound;250,000 donation from the Scottish Government, Scots have pledged a total of &pound;2,450,000.The earthquake struck just before midday on Saturday, sending tremors through the Kathmandu Valley and setting in motion an avalanche which swept the face of Mount Everest.A third of the population were already living two or more hours walk from the nearest good road and journeys that used to take four hours are now taking aid organisations one and a half days, the DEC said.Neil Mathers, chair of the Scottish appeal, said: &quot;The response by people in Scotland, and across the UK, has been extraordinary, even compared to the great generosity shown in previous appeals.&quot;Getting the huge amount of essential supplies needed to the hundreds of thousands of people whose homes have been damaged or destroyed quickly is a huge logistical challenge which is being hampered by the limited capacity of the one main airport and extremely difficult terrain in the areas affected.&quot;Experienced aid teams are working around the clock to get supplies into the country and then to people who need it.&quot;Mr Mathers said agencies have distributed shelter materials to camps in the Kathmandu Valley and 750 kits will reach remote Dolarka tomorrow.Aid is getting though by any means possible, including by tractor in some cases, he said, but fuel shortages and power cuts are further hampering efforts.To make a donation to the DEC Nepal Earthquake Appeal visit: http://www.dec.org.uk or call the 24-hour hotline on 0370 60 60 900.
