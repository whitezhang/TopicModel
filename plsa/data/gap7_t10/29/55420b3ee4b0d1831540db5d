A GREEDY mum of three is behind bars after pocketing more than &pound;726,000 from trusts set up to help charities.
Susan McMahon, 34, exploited her &shy;position in the trust department of accounting giants Grant Thornton UK.
She made fake &shy;documents so bosses would authorise payments.
Instead of going to &shy;charities including Save the &shy;Children, money went into accounts held by her and her husband.
McMahon, of Wishaw, Lanarkshire, pled guilty at Glasgow Sheriff Court to embezzling &pound;726,765 between 2006 and 2013.
In April 2013, one of the firm’s partners approved a &pound;15,000 cheque from the Margaret Murdoch trust for Aberdeen charity Sports University Scotland (SUS).
He became suspicious because the project did not fit with the purpose of the charity, which normally paid charities such as Alzheimer’s Research UK and Scottish Huntington’s Association.
Pauline Henderson, &shy;prosecuting, said: “The minutes he had been presented with by the accused had been doctored.
“Further, the payee on the cheques made out to SUS had been changed to the name of Susan McMahon.”
Six of the 12 to 15 funds administered by McMahon had paid money to her or her husband’s accounts.
She took &pound;4000 from a trust set up for three children. No money has been repaid.
Sheriff Alan Miller deferred sentence until next month and remanded her in custody.
McMahon and her husband Steven recently moved to a sandstone villa in Newmains, Lanarkshire, that is worth &pound;275,000.
A spokesman for Grant Thornton said the firm and their insurers “are in the course of addressing compensation arrangements with the affected trusts”.
