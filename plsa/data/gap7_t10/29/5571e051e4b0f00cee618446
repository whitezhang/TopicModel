A PENSIONER who admitted walking around his garden naked declared: “I’m no second-rate Jimmy Saville.”
Russell McCreath – known as Rusty – cuts a distinctive figure with his dishevelled looks, bushy beard and long locks.
But after pleading guilty to wandering naked about his garden, Rusty is terrified his reputation as a gregarious eccentric will be left in tatters.
The 70-year-old appeared at Ayr Sheriff Court this week to face three charges.
The colourful character admitted being naked outside his flat in Troon, Ayrshire, on two occasions last May.
A not guilty plea to a charge of repeatedly pulling his pants up and down on was accepted.
Tony Currie, defending, said: “In fact, Mr McCreath was going around his own garden, essentially.”
Former naval architect Rusty worked in Fairfield shipyard in Glasgow after going to university in the city. He has lived in Troon on and off since he was a boy.
The bachelor has a collection of maritime portraits, painted by his own hand and inspired by his love of the sea.
Rusty admitted: “I am different and there’s one or two who don’t like me.
“I’m thought of highly by the young people of the town, who have taken to me, and I hold that dear.
“This is my worst fear – these allegations make me sound like a second-rate Jimmy Savile, which I certainly am not. Things get exaggerated and blown out of proportion.
“I’ve always been regarded as a fairly decent sort of guy and managed to get on with the men at the shipyards, which is a test of anyone’s character.
“This recent legal experience has been quite an eye-opener.”
Rusty will be sentenced on May 26 after Sheriff Norman Macfadyen called for background reports.
