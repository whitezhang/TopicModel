 Martin Canning has confirmed talks with Alex Neil, his predecessor as Hamilton Academical manager, about taking young players on loan from Norwich City. 
 Neil admitted on Tuesday that he would have &quot;absolutely no issue&quot; about sending some of his younger players to New Douglas Park. 
 &quot;That is something Alex and I discussed,&quot; said Canning. 
 &quot;I have been down and watched an under-21s game and Alex has recommended a few.&quot; 
 Canning plans another trip to visit the club who will be involved in the English Championship's promotion play-offs. 
 &quot;I will try to get down there again before the end of the season, if not maybe pre-season,&quot; said the player-boss. &quot;But I would be comfortable if Alex recommended a player. 
 &quot;The good thing is that he knows the level of the league up here and he knows the players we have got. 
 &quot;So he will know if there is someone down there who is capable of improving our squad. 
 &quot;And if we can bring someone in who can do a good job for six months or a year and send them back a better player then it is win-win for both.&quot; 
 Accies have struggled since Neil's departure, Friday's win over Motherwell being their first since 12 January. 
 Canning has stressed that they had found it difficult without Neil's presence in midfield - and the departures of midfielder Tony Andreu to Norwich and Mikael Antoine-Curier to Burton Albion. 
 &quot;We will definitely be looking to bring in players, whether it is Norwich or not, we will be looking to bolster our squad,&quot; he added.
