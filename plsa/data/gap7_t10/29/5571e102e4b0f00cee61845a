A FIFTH of 15-year-olds are performing as if they have been at school for five years less than the top achievers, MSPs were told yesterday.
Opposition MSPs said the worrying figures helped explain why some pupils would struggle to eventually get a job.
The figure from the Improvement Service was quoted during a Holyrood debate on the importance of effective and targeted support for employment.
Conservative Gavin Brown said: “They said the bottom 20 per cent in school at age 15 perform as if they have had five years less schooling than the top 20 per cent.
“What chance does somebody have if they have five years less schooling at that stage and they then want to try and go out to the world of work?”
He called on the Scottish Government to create sustainable employment for those “furthest from the labour market”.
Brown also quoted Inclusion Scotland’s figure that said only 63 out of 25,000 modern apprenticeships went to disabled people.
Labour MSP Siobhan McMahon &shy;acknowledged that the Scottish Government had committed an extra &pound;3million to increase access to apprenticeships for minority ethnic young people, young people with disabilities and care leavers.
She added: “The problem is that it has taken so long.”
Fair Work, Skills and Training Secretary Roseanna Cunningham said: “We’ve certainly taken steps through Community Jobs &shy;Scotland to try and make sure that a slice of that money is targeted exactly on disabled employment.”
