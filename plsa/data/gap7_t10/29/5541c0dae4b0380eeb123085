Concerns about the air quality in Glasgow city centre are nothing new but the latest call make action all the more urgent.The reason for the high level of pollution is laid at the door of the high number of buses driving down main thoroughfares.Anyone who visits the centre of Glasgow knows the main streets of Hope Street Renfield and Argyle Street can be choked with buses.Many sit idling, still belching fumes out while sitting for several minutes at a time.It is clear that the solution to improving the air quality must be at the heart of the city centre traffic management plan.If the plan is for more public transport then it must be ensured the buses are of the highest environmental standards.When cars are routed in certain directions to avoid congestion hot spots it must be ensured it is not merely sending the problem and the pollution to another location.Glasgow is making many efforts to improve health in the city with the council health board and individual citizens playing a part.We must ensure that all efforts are taken to reduce the pollution in our streets to help the health effort.In short it's time to let Glasgow breathe.
