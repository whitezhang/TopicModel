CONTROVERSIAL plans to close a Catholic primary school could be halted tonight.The plans, to close 'under-occupied' St Joseph's in Milngavie and merge it with St Andrew's Primary in neighbouring Bearsden, have angered parents, who accused the council of having &quot;walked away from its responsibilities&quot; to Catholic families.They launched plans to start a government funded community school and saw more than 130 people turn out to a hustings event organised last month, saying the Keep St Joseph's in Milngavie campaign was &quot;stronger than ever.&quot;SNP group leader Ian Mackay will tonight raise a motion at the meeting of East Dunbartonshire council, calling for the closure plans to be suspended.He will ask the council to halt work on the scheme until a report is received from the Equalities and Human Right Commission, which has received a 'case for support' bid against the council from the parents' group.Mr Mackay was not available for comment yesterday. His motion asks the council to &quot;agree, in the light of recent and new developments, to suspend all work on the closure of St. Joseph's and St. Andrew's Primary Schools and the merger into anew primary school in Bearsden.&quot;It said there were also issues surrounding a new community empowerment bill and whether there would be implications from that.More than 500 people in both Milngavie and Bearsden took part in the council's original consultation process, with 87 per cent opposing the merger.The council says the school is under-occupied, with just 45% of places filled.Council leader Rhondda Geekie said: &quot;Following six months of scrutiny, the Scottish Government granted the council unconditional consent to proceed with our proposals to build a new denominational school for Bearsden and Milngavie.&quot;This new building will bring together two school communities - providing an excellent learning environment for pupils that will better support the Curriculum for Excellence, as well as addressing significant maintenance and under-occupancy issues for the existing primary schools.&quot;
