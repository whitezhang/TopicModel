A COUPLE are suing a cruise ship operator after they suffered severe diarrhoea and sickness on their honeymoon.
Colin and Lynsey Young are among nearly 100 passengers who are taking legal action after their holidays were ruined by gastric illness.
The bug struck during a Mediterranean cruise on Thomson’s Island Escape ship in 2013.
Lynsey, 26, said: “Our honeymoon was ruined.
“Colin started to suffer with diarrhoea and vomiting and he spent the rest of the week feeling very lethargic and suffering dehydration.
“I also suffered severe vomiting and diarrhoea.
“I was experiencing agonising abdominal pain and hot and cold sweats.”
Lynsey, of Livingston, said it took the on-board medical team nine hours to arrive with injections and hydration sachets to try to ease the symptoms.
She added: “This was meant to be a relaxing break for us to start our married life and spend some quality time together as a couple.
“Instead, our honeymoon was a disaster.”
Law firm Irwin Mitchell say they have received numerous complaints from passengers.
There have been claims that cutlery and plates on the ship were dirty and food was sometimes served lukewarm and under-cooked.
The firm have represented more than 300 passengers who have travelled on the ship since 2009.
Amandeep Dhillon, of Irwin Mitchell, said: “This is the fourth year in the last six that we have been asked by passengers to help them following episodes of illness on board this liner.”
A Thomson spokeswoman said: “The ultimate priority for our Island Cruises is the health, safety and comfort of all our customers. We operate stringent health and hygiene procedures.
“Island Cruises took over 35,000 passengers on holiday in 2013 and the vast majority had no complaints.”
