SCOTLAND can force a change in how politics is done at Westminster, according to Nicola Sturgeon.The First Minister said on ending austerity, on increased spending and on scrapping Trident the SNP can build alliances across parties to end one party decision making.She said the binary system of government and opposition had delivered the poll tax and Iraq war and said the need to seek consensus can avoid those types of mistakes.Ms Sturgeon spoke to an audience of businesswomen in Glasgow as new opinion polls emerged boosting the SNP popularity, with one week till polling day.One poll put her as the most popular party leader in the UK, another suggested the SNP could win every one of Scotland's 59 Westminster seats.Ms Sturgeon said: &quot;Today I send this message to everyone in Scotland - to those who voted No last year, as well as to those who voted Yes; to people who have never voted SNP in an election before, as well as to those who always do.&quot;On May 7th, if we come together, we can seize this historic moment to shift the balance of power from the corridors of Westminster to the communities of Scotland.&quot;By voting SNP, we can make our nation's voice heard like never before. Together we can unite to make Scotland stronger and Westminster better.&quot;Even though her party, no matter how many MPs it wins, will not be in any government positions with coalitions being ruled out she said alliances can be forged across party's to reflect the range of views held.On issues like ending austerity and increasing spending on the NHS she said Labour particularly would need to &quot;change its tune&quot; in the event of a hung parliament.She said: &quot;We can also seek to force a rethink on the irrational proposal, which in itself exposes the unchallenged nature of too much decision-making at Westminster, to spend &pound;100 billion on a new generation of Trident nuclear weapons system, on unilateral nuclear rearmament, at a time when resources are so scarce.&quot;Let me make the view of the SNP crystal clear, if there is &pound;100 billion to spend, it should be invested in health, education and childcare, not on new nuclear weapons.&quot;Ms Sturgeon said even though Labour and the Tories are committed to Trident renewal there was room for manoeuvre.She added: &quot;We can try to build alliances. Ian Murray, a Labour MP in Edinburgh said 'under no circumstances would I vote for the renewal of Trident'.&quot;There are many people on the Labour benches who wouldn't vote for Trident. That's what politics in a minority parliament is all about, while we won't prevail on absolutely everything that is what we will strive to do.&quot;The latest pollsIpsos MORI shows the SNP on a high of 54% up by 2 points and Labour down 4 points to 20%.Another by TNS for The Herald shows Ms Sturgeon the highest approval rating not just in Scotland but across the UK at +33, David Cameron is on +7 and Ed Miliband on -8.In Scotland her ratings are +55 with Ed Miliband on-2 and Mr Cameron on -7.Labour said the poll if true would be a disaster for Scotland.Kezia Dugdale, deputy Scottish leader, said: &quot;&quot;A vote for anyone other than Labour makes it more likely the Tories will be the largest party across the UK and that David Cameron will walk back into Downing Street.&quot;That would be a disaster for Scotland, but it's what could happen if this poll is repeated on election day. We can't afford to take that gamble with the future of Scotland.&quot;The Tories said they were the only pro union party making ground, up 5 pointsScottish deputy leader Jackson Carlaw said: &quot;With a week to go before we vote, this poll shows that the Scottish Conservatives are the pro-UK party which has won the arguments in the campaign and is now gaining support.&quot;People in Scotland have had a good look at Labour and the LibDems over the last five weeks. They appear to have been left unimpressed and have now decided against them.&quot;
