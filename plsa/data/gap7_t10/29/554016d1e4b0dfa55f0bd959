An international team, including battlefield archaeologists from the University of Glasgow, are getting ready to begin a substantial dig on the Waterloo battlefield. 
Ahead of the bicentenary of the battle, the team has chosen a site near Hougoumont Farm.
It is thought there is a mass grave of soldiers located there. 
Some of the team will be members of the armed forces and veterans who have experienced trauma during service. 
They are part of a project called Operation Nightingale, which encourages armed forces personnel to work alongside experienced archaeologists to help their recovery.
Hougoumont Farm is one of the key sites of the Waterloo battlefield.
During the battle in June 1815, thousands of Napoleon's troops attacked the farm, which was held by British forces under the command of the Duke of Wellington.
Napoleon's forces were eventually defeated and there were tens of thousands of casualties.
He was exiled to the island of Saint Helena, where he died in 1821.
Tony Pollard, director of the Centre of Battlefield Archaeology at the university, said the work would answer many questions that still hang over the site as, he says, many first-hand accounts of the battle are confusing and biased.
