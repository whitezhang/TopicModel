RAIL workers are to strike on bank holiday Monday after a colleague was sacked for telling passengers the reason they couldn’t enjoy a fry-up.
Catering crew leader Mark Doughty revealed full cooked breakfasts were off the menu due to a staff shortage and a broken boiler – and was later fired.
Now furious members of the RMT union on East Coast trains, based at Edinburgh’s Waverley station, are to walk out in protest.
RMT general secretary Mick Cash said: “We are determined to right this outrageous injustice.”
But a spokesman for Virgin Trains East Coast said: “We’re disappointed at this decision.
&quot;However, this action would only affect a number of Edinburgh-based staff and our services will run as normal, so passengers shouldn’t be concerned.”
