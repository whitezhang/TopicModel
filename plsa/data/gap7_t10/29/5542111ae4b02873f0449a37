A driver has escaped injury after the lorry he was driving came off the road and overturned on to rocks at the seafront in North Ayrshire.
Police Scotland said officers received reports that the vehicle had came off the shore road at Skelmorlie at about 13:40 on Wednesday.
A spokesman said there were no reports of anyone being injured.
Recovery crews later lifted the Lowmac Alloys skip lorry from the shoreline and cleared the road.
