A FESTIVAL celebrating Scottish 'mountain man' Tom Weir is to be held next month.The inaugural Weirfest and Red Toorie Festival will take place on Loch Lomondside on May 30, beside the statue of the countryside legend.Around 40 musicians are expected to perform at the open-air celebration, which will feature music, competitions and cooking and outdoor craft demonstrations.It has been organised by the Tom Weir Memorial Group, together with the Friends of Loch Lomond and The Trossachs. Popular Scottish minstrel Alistair MacDonald and rock act The Mighty Sparrahawk will be among those on stage, and there will be stalls showcasing local crafts and foods.Tom, a Glasgow climber, writer and broadcaster who died eight years ago, hosted the STV series Weir's Way from 1976.Susan Taylor, administrator of the Tom Weir Memorial Group, said: &quot;We are very excited about staging our first-ever Weirfest event and hope to see a good turnout of folk wearing Tom's signature red toorie hats.&quot;They were very much to the fore at the statue unveiling in late December and have become a key feature of visits to the Tom Weir statue at Balmaha with a steady flow of visitors wearing them.&quot;We will have plenty red toorie hats on sale on the day as part of our ongoing fundraising efforts and to add to the colour of Weirfest. Hopefully this can be another occasion which recognises why Tom Weir is Scotland's most loved mountain man.&quot;James Fraser, Chairman of Friends of Loch Lomond and The Trossachs, said: &quot;Our plans have come together very quickly and this is an occasion we are very much looking forward to with many musicians and helpers generously offering their services free of charge to make this a special day.&quot;If the visitor numbers to the statue during its first four months are anything to go by, Balmaha will be buzzing on the day of Weirfest and we would invite as many people as possible to come along and perhaps combine their day out with a visit to the nearby Drymen Show too.&quot;Admission and car parking are free.
