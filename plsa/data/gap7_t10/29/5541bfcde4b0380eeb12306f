PETROCHEMICAL giant INEOS are continuing their campaign to persuade locals to get on board with fracking.INEOS are holding another of their community engagement programmes at Greenfaulds High School in Cumbernauld tonight (30 April) from 7-9pm.The event will consist of a presentation on fracking and a Q&amp;A session similar to those held in Bishopbriggs.The Grangemouth company hold a licence to frack an area of 127 square miles, which includes Bishopbriggs and Cumbernauld.They have come under fire in recent months from anti-fracking groups who branded their promise to give a percentage of their profits to local communities as a &quot;bribe&quot;.A demonstration took place in Bishopbriggs on Monday evening before the INEOS presentation with around 60 locals taking part.Donald McDonald, head of Don't Frack the 'Briggs, took part in the demonstration. He said: &quot;This isn't just about Bishopbriggs, it's about what could happen throughout Scotland.&quot;INEOS say that they will give a percentage of their profits to the local communities but at the end of the day, it's one thing getting a new sports hall or community centre but what about 10 or 15 years down the line when people can't get insurance for their homes and their children have health problems.&quot;We want a ban on fracking right across Scotland.Scottish Energy Minister Fergus Ewing announced a moratorium on fracking in January, meaning the company cannot go ahead with its plans.The temporary ban is due to remain in place until the Scottish government carry out a full public consultation which isn't expected until after next year's Scottish parliamentary elections.Operations director for INEOS, Tom Pickering, will give tonight's presentation and answer questions afterwards.Tensions rose briefly during Monday's presentation when some members of the audience shouted out and claimed that the effects of the chemicals used were unknown.Those wishing to attend tonight's Cumbernauld presentation can only do so by registering online at Eventbite.com
