Some celebrity deaths come and go. Michael Jackson's death¡ªparticularly, the investigation into it¡ªapparently lives forever.

More than six months after the King of Pop passed away, the Los Angeles County Coroner's office has amended his death certificate to list his cause of death as "acute propofol intoxication" and "intravenous injection by another."

It also now includes that long-awaited magic word: "homicide."

Which means the world is once again redirecting its collective stink eye to Dr. Conrad Murray.

Perhaps surmising that his own end is nigh, the doctor lawyered up last week, despite the fact that the long-pending involuntary manslaughter investigation has yet to yield any charges against him.

"We have refused to comment on stories involving unnamed sources and will continue to do so," Conrad's attorney, Ed Chernoff, said Friday. "However, we can confirm that we have not received notice of an impaneled grand jury and Dr. Murray has not been invited to testify."

In other words, while Conrad has apparently armed himself for a legal battle, one has yet to be brought against him.

The key word there being "yet."
