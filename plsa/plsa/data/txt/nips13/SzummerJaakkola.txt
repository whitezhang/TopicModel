Abstract 
Modern classification applications necessitate supplementing the few 
available labeled examples with unlabeled examples to improve classi- 
fication performance. We present a new tractable algorithm for exploit- 
ing unlabeled examples in discriminative classification. This is achieved 
essentially by expanding the input vectors into longer feature vectors via 
both labeled and unlabeled examples. The resulting classification method 
can be interpreted as a discriminative kernel density estimate and is read- 
ily trained via the EM algorithm, which in this case is both discriminative 
and achieves the optimal solution. We provide, in addition, a purely dis- 
criminative formulation of the estimation problem by appealing to the 
maximum entropy framework. We demonstrate that the proposed ap- 
proach requires very few labeled examples for high classification accu- 
racy. 
1 Introduction 
In many modern classification problems such as text categorization, very few labeled ex- 
amples are available but a large number of unlabeled examples can be readily acquired. 
Various methods have recently been proposed to take advantage of unlabeled examples to 
improve classification performance. Such methods include the EM algorithm with naive 
Bayes models for text classification [1], the co-training framework [2], transduction [3, 4], 
and maximum entropy discrimination [5]. 
These approaches are divided primarily on the basis of whether they employ generative 
modeling or are motivated by robust classification. Unfortunately, the computational effort 
scales exponentially with the number of unlabeled examples for exact solutions in discrim- 
inative approaches such as transduction [3, 5]. Various approximations are available [4, 5] 
but their effect remains unclear. 
In this paper, we formulate a complementary discriminative approach to exploiting unla- 
beled examples, effectively by using them to expand the representation of examples. This 
approach has several advantages including the ability to represent the true Bayes optimal 
decision boundary and making explicit use of the density over the examples. It is also 
computationally feasible as stated. 
The paper is organized as follows. We start by discussing the kernel density estimate and 
providing a smoothness condition, assuming labeled data only. We subsequently introduce 
unlabeled data, define the expansion and formulate the EM algorithm for discriminative 
training. In addition, we provide a purely discriminative version of the parameter estima- 
tion problem and forrealize it as a maximum entropy discrimination problem. We then 
demonstrate experimentally that various concerns about the approach are not warranted. 
2 Kernel density estimation and classification 
We start by assuming a large number of labeled examples D = { (x, ),..., (XN, N)}, 
where i E {-1, 1} and xi E T½a. A joint kernel density estimate can be written as 
N 
1 
P(x,y) =  E (5(y,)i)K(x, xi) (1) 
i=1 
where f K (x, xi)d/(x) = 1 for each i. With an appropriately chosen kernel K, a function 
of N, P(x, y) will be consistent in the sense of converging to the joint density as N --> oo. 
Given a fixed number of examples, the kernel functions K(x, xi) may be viewed as con- 
ditional probabilities P(xli), where i indexes the observed points. For the purposes of this 
paper, we assume a Gaussian form K(x, xi) = N(x; xi, cr2I). The labels i assigned 
to the sampled points xi may themselves be noisy and we incorporate P(yli), a location- 
specific probability of labels. The resulting joint density model is 
N 
P(x,y) =  E P(yli)P(xli) 
i=1 
Interpreting 1IN as a prior probability of the index variable i = 1,..., N, the resulting 
model conforms to the graph depicted above. This is reminiscent of the a,sTvect model for 
clustering of dyadic data [6]. There are two main differences. First, the number of aspects 
here equals the number of examples and the model is not suitable for clustering. Second, we 
do not search for the probabilities P(xli) (kernels), instead they are associated with each 
observed example and are merely adjusted in terms of scale (kernel width). This restriction 
yields a significant computational advantage in classification, which is the objective in this 
paper. 
The posterior probability of the label y given an example x is given by P(ylx) - 
E P(yli)P(ilx), where P(ilx) cr P(xli)/P(x) as P(i) is assumed to be uniform. The 
quality of the posterior probability depends both on how accurately P(yl i) are known as 
well as on the properties of the membership probabilities P (il x) (always known) that must 
be relatively smooth. 
Here we provide a simple condition on the membership probabilities P(il x) so that any 
noise in the sampled labels for the available examples would not preclude accurate deci- 
sions. In other words, we wish to ensure that the conditional probabilities P(yl x) can be 
evaluated accurately on the basis of the sampled estimate in Eq. (1). Removing the label 
noise provides an alternative way of setting the width parameter cr of the Gaussian kernels. 
The simple lemma below, obtained via standard large deviation methods, ties the appro- 
priate choice of the kernel width cr to the squared norm of the membership probabilities 
P(ilxj). 
Lemma 1 Let Iv = {1,..., N}. Given any 5 > 0, e > O, and any collection of distribu- 
tions Pilk -> O, -iev Pilk -- 1 for k  IN, such that IIp. l112 -< e/V/21øg(2N/d),Vk  
IN, and independent samples !i  {- 1, 1 } from some P(yli), i  then 
P(k ß I 
Ei=z iPil - Ei=z > e) 5 5 where wi = P(y = 11i) - P(y = 
-l l i) and the probability is taken over the independent samples. 
The lemma applies to our case by setting Pil = P(ilxk), {} represents the sampled 
labels for the examples, and by noting that the sign of  wP(il x) is the MAP decision 
rule from our model, P(y = 11x ) - P(y = -11x ). The lemma states that as long as the 
membership probabilities have appropriately bounded squared norm, the noise in the label- 
ing is inconsequential for the classification decisions. Note, for example, that a distribution 
Pilk - 1IN has IIp. - 1/v/- implying that the conditions are achievable for large 
N. The squared norm of P(ilx) is directly controlled by the kernel width cr 2 and thus the 
lemma ties the kernel width with the accuracy of estimating the conditional probabilities 
P(ylx). Algorithms for adjusting the kernel width(s) on the basis of this will be presented 
in a longer version of the paper. 
3 The expansion and EM estimation 
A useful way to view the resulting kernel density estimate is that each example x is rep- 
resented by a vector of membership probabilities P(ilx), i = 1,..., N. Such mixture 
distance representations have been used extensively; it can also be viewed as a Fisher score 
vector computed with respect to adjustable weighting P(i). The examples in this new 
representation are classified by associating P(vIi) with each component and computing 
P(ylx) - E P(yli)P(ilx). An alternative approach to exploiting kernel density esti- 
mates in classification is given by [7]. 
We now assume that we have labels for only a few examples, and our training data is 
{(x,)),..., (xz,,jz,), xz,+,..., xv}. In this case, we may continue to use the model 
defined above and estimate the free parameters, P(1i), i = 1,..., N, from the few labeled 
examples. In other words, we can maximize the conditional log-likelihood 
L L N 
y log P(9tlxt) = Y log y P(9tli)P(ilxt) 
/=1 /=1 i=1 
(2) 
where the first summation is only over the labeled examples and L << N. Since P(ilxt ) 
are fixed, this objective function is jointly concave in the free parameters and lends itself 
to a unique maximum value. The concavity also guarantees that this optimization is easily 
performed via the EM algorithm [8]. 
Let Pilt be the soft assignment for component i given (xt,t), i.e., Pilt = P(ilxt,gt) 
P(jtli)P(ilxt). The EM algorithm iterates between the E-step, where Pilt are recom- 
puted from the current estimates of P(li), and the M-step where we update P(li) 
Yd:0=t Pilt / Yd Pilt ' 
This procedure may have to be adjusted in cases where the overall frequency of different 
labels in the (labeled) training set deviates significantly from uniform. A simple rescaling 
P(uli) - P(yli)/Lv by the frequencies L v and renormalization after each M-step would 
probably suffice. 
The runtime of this algorithm is O(L N). The discriminative formulation suggests that EM 
will provide reasonable parameter estimates P(y Ii) for classification purposes. The qual- 
ity of the solution, as well as the potential for overfitting, is contingent on the smoothness 
of the kernels or, equivalently, smoothness of the membership probabilities P(ilx). Note, 
however, that whether or not P(1i) will converge to the extreme values 0 or 1 is not an in- 
dication of overfitting. Actual classification decisions for unlabeled examples xi (included 
in the expansion) need to be made on the basis of P(ylxi) and not on the basis of 
which function as parameters. 
4 Discriminative estimation 
An alternative discriminative formulation is also possible, one that is more sensitive to the 
decision boundary rather than probability values associated with the labels. To this end, 
consider the conditional probability P(ylx) = Ei P(yli)?(ilx). The decisions are made 
on the basis of the sign of the discriminant function 
N 
f(x) = P(y = llx) - P(y = -llx) = wiP(ilx) (3) 
i=1 
where wi = P(y = 11i) - P(y = -11i). This is similar to a linear classifier and there 
are many ways of estimating the weights wi discriminatively. The weights should remain 
bounded, however, i.e., wi E [-1, 1], so long as we wish to maintain the kernel density 
interpretation. Estimation algorithms with Euclidean norm regularization such as SVMs 
would not be appropriate in this sense. Instead, we employ the maximum entropy discrim- 
ination (MED) framework [5] and rely on the relation wi = E{yi} = Yy=ñ YiP(Y) to 
estimate the distribution P(y) over all the labels y = [yt,..., YN]. Here Yi is a parame- 
ter associated with the i th example and should be distinguished from any observed labels. 
We can show that in this case the maximum entropy solution factors across the examples 
P(Y,..., YN) = Hi Pi(Yi) and we can formulate the estimation problem directly in terms 
of the marginals Pi (Yi). 
The maximum entropy formalism encodes the principle that label assignments Pi (Yi) for 
the examples should remain uninformative to the extent possible given the classification 
objective. More formally, given a set of L labeled examples (x,),..., (xL,L), we 
N 
maximize Yi= H (Yi) - U Yf if subject to the classification constraints 
)f [ Y YiPi(Yi)P(ilxf)] +if_>"/ V/E[1...L] (4) 
i=1 yi=ñl 
where H(yi) is the entropy of Yi relative to the marginal Pi(Yi). Here 3' specifies the target 
separation (3'  [0, 1]) and the slack variables if _> 0 permit deviations from the target to 
ensure that a solution always exists. The solution is not very sensitive to these parameters, 
and 3' = 0.1 and C = 40 worked well for many problems. The advantage of this formula- 
tion is that effort is spent only on those training examples whose classification is uncertain. 
Examples already classified correctly with a margin larger than 3' are effectively ignored. 
The optimization problem and algorithms are explained in the appendix. 
5 Discussion of the expanded representation 
The kernel expansion enables us to represent the Bayes optimal decision boundary provided 
that the kernel density estimate is sufficiently accurate. With this representation, the EM 
and MED algorithms actually estimate decision boundaries that are sensitive to the density 
P(x). For example, labeled points in high-density regions will influence the boundary 
more than in low-density regions. The boundary will partly follow the density, but unlike in 
unsupervised methods, will adhere strongly to the labeled points. Moreover, our estimation 
techniques limit the effect of outliers, as all points have a bounded weight wi = [-1, 1] 
(spurious unlabeled points do not adversely affect the boundary). 
As we impose smoothness constraints on the membership probabilities P(ilx), we also 
guarantee that the capacity of the resulting classifier need not increase with the number 
of unlabeled examples (in the fat shattering sense). Also, in the context of the maximum 
entropy formulation, if a point is not helpful for the classification constraints, then entropy 
is maximized for Pi(l = +1) = 0.5, implying wi = O, and the point has no effect on the 
boundary. 
If we dispense with the conditional probability interpretation of the kernels K, we are 
free to choose them from a more general class of functions. For example, the kernels 
no longer have to integrate to 1. An expansion of x in terms of these kernels can still 
be meaningful; as a special case, when linear kernels are chosen, the expansion reduces 
to weighting distances between points by the covariance of the data. Distinctions along 
high variance directions then become easier to make, which is helpful when between-class 
scatter is greater than within-class scatter. 
Thus, even though the probabilistic interpretation is missing, a simple preprocessing step 
can still help, e.g., support vector machines to take advantage of unlabeled data: we can 
expand the inputs x in terms of kernels G from labeled and unlabeled points as in ½(x) = 
«[G(x, x),..., G(x, xv)], where Z optionally normalizes the feature vector. 
6 Results 
We first address the potential concern that the expanded representation may involve too 
many degrees of freedom and result in poor generalization. Figure la) demonstrates that 
this is not the case and, instead, the test classification error approaches the limiting asymp- 
totic rate exponentially fast. The problem considered was a DNA splice site classification 
problem with 500 examples for which d = 100. Varying sizes of random subsets were 
labeled and all the examples were used in the expansion as unlabeled examples. The er- 
ror rate was computed on the basis of the remaining 500 - L examples without labels, 
where L denotes the number of labeled examples. The results in the figure were averaged 
across 20 independent runs. The exponential rate of convergence towards the limiting rate 
is evidenced by the linear trend in the semilog figure la). The mean test errors shown in fig- 
ure lb) indicate that the purely discriminative training (MED) can contribute substantially 
to the accuracy. The kernel width in these experiments was simply fixed to the median 
distance to the 5th nearest neighbor from the opposite class. Results from other methods 
of choosing the kernel width (the squared norm, adaptive) will be discussed in the longer 
version of the paper. 
Another concern is perhaps that the formulation is valid only in cases where we have a 
large number of unlabeled examples. In principle, the method could deteriorate rapidly 
after the kernel density estimate no longer can be assumed to give reasonable estimates. 
Figure 2a) illustrates that this is not a valid interpretation. The problem here is to classify 
DNA microarray experiments on the basis of the leukemia types that the tissues used in 
the array experiments corresponded to. Each input vector for the classifier consists of the 
expression levels of over 7000 genes that were included as probes in the arrays. The number 
of examples available was 38 for training and 34 for testing. We included all examples 
as unlabeled points in the expansion and randomly selected subsets of labeled training 
examples, and measured the performance only on the test examples (which were of slightly 
different type and hence more appropriate for assessing generalization). Figure 2 shows 
rapid convergence for EM and the discriminative MED formulation. The "asymptotic" 
level here corresponds to about one classification error among the 34 test examples. The 
results were averaged over 20 independent runs. 
7 Conclusion 
We have provided a complementary framework for exploiting unlabeled examples in dis- 
criminative classification problems. The framework involves a combination of the ideas of 
kernel density estimation and representational expansion of input vectors. A simple EM

algorithm is sufficient for finding globally optimal parameter estimates but we have shown 
that a purely discriminative formulation can yield substantially better results within the 
framework. 
Possible extensions include using the kernel expansions with transductive algorithms that 
enforce margin constraints also for the unlabeled examples [5]. Such combination can be 
particularly helpful in terms of capturing the lower dimensional structure of the data. Other 
extensions include analysis of the framework similarly to [9].

A Maximum entropy solution 
The unique solution to the maximum entropy estimation problem is found via introducing 
Lagrange multipliers {,kt } for the classification constraints. The multipliers satisfy ,kt E 
[0, U], where the lower bound comes from the inequality constraints and the upper bound 
from the linear margin penalties being minimized. To represent the solution and find the 
optimal setting of ,kt we must evaluate the partition function

that normalizes the maximum entropy distribution. Here  denote the observed labels. 
Minimizing the jointly convex log-partition function log Z(A) with respect to the Lagrange 
multipliers leads to the optimal setting {A[ }. This optimization is readily done via an axis 
parallel line sech (e.g. the bisection method). The required gradients are given by

(this is essentially the classification constraint). The expectation is taken with respect to 
the maximum entropy distribution P* (y,..., yN) = P (y)... P(yN) where the com- 
ponents are P(Yi)  exp{Et 9tXtYiP(ilx)}. The label averages w = Ep,{ Yi } = 
u Yi P (Yi) are needed for the decision rule as well as in the optimization. We can iden- 
tify these from above w = tanh(E t tX? P(ilxt)) and they are readily evaluated. Finding 
the solution involves O(L 2 N) operations. 
Often the numbers of positive and negative training labels are imbalanced. The MED 
foulation (analogously to SVMs) can be adjusted by defining the margin penalties as 
U+ t:9= t + U- t:9=- t, where, for example, L+U + = L-U- that equalizes the 
mean penalties. The coefficients U + and U- can also be modified adaptively during the 
estimation process to balance the rate of misclassification eors across the two classes.
