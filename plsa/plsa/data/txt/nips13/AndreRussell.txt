Abstract 
We present an expressive agent design language for reinforcement learn- 
ing that allows the user to constrain the policies considered by the learn- 
ing process.The language includes standard features such as parameter- 
ized subroutines, temporary interrupts, aborts, and memory variables, but 
also allows for uns7ecified choices in the agent program. For learning 
that which isn't specified, we present provably convergent learning algo- 
rithms. We demonstrate by example that agent programs written in the 
language are concise as well as modular. This facilitates state abstraction 
and the transferability of learned skills. 
1 Introduction 
The field of reinforcement learning has recently adopted the idea that the application of 
prior knowledge may allow much faster learning and may indeed be essential if real- 
world environments are to be addressed. For learning behaviors, the most obvious form 
of prior knowledge provides a partial description of desired behaviors. Several languages 
for partial descriptions have been proposed, including Hierarchical Abstract Machines 
(HAMs) [8], semi-Markov options [12], and the MAXQ framework [4]. 
This paper describes extensions to the HAM language that substantially increase its ex- 
pressive power, using constructs borrowed from programming languages. Obviously, in- 
creasing expressiveness makes it easier for the user to supply whatever prior knowledge 
is available, and to do so more concisely. (Consider, for example, the difference between 
wiring up Boolean circuits and writing Java programs.) More importantly, the availability 
of an expressive language allows the agent to learn and generalize behavioral abstractions 
that would be far more difficult to learn in a less expressive language. For example, the 
ability to specify parameterized behaviors allows multiple behaviors such as WalkEast, 
WalkNorth, WalkWest, WalkSouth to be combined into a single behavior Walk(d) 
where d is a direction parameter. Furthermore, if a behavior is appropriately parameter- 
ized, decisions within the behavior can be made independently of the "calling context" (the 
hierarchy of tasks within which the behavior is being executed). This is crucial in allowing 
behaviors to be learned and reused as general skills. 
Our extended language includes parameters, interrupts, aborts (i.e., interrupts without re- 
sumption), and local state variables. Interrupts and aborts in particular are very important 
in physical behaviors--more so than in computation--and are crucial in allowing for mod- 
ularity in behavioral descriptions. These features are all common in robot programming 
languages [2, 3, 5]; the key element of our approach is that behaviors need only be par- 
tially described; reinforcement learning does the rest. 
To tie our extended language to existing reinforcement learning algorithms, we utilize Parr 
and Russell's [8] notion of the joint semi-Markov decision process (SMDP) created when 
a HAM is composed with an environment (modeled as an MDP). The joint SMDP state 
space consists of the cross-product of the machine states in the HAM and the states in the 
original MDP; the dynamics are created by the application of the HAM in the MDP. Parr 
and Russell showed that an optimal solution to the joint SMDP is both learnable and yields 
an optimal solution to the original MDP in the class of policies expressed by the HAM (so- 
called hierarchical optimality). Furthermore, Parr and Russell show that the joint SMDP 
can be reduced to an equivalent SMDP with a state space consisting only of the states 
where the HAM does not specify an action, which reduces the complexity of the SMDP 
problem that must be solved. We show that these results hold for our extended language of 
Programmable HAMs (PHAMs). 
To demonstrate the usefulness of the new language, we show a small, complete program for 
a complex environment that would require a much larger program in previous formalisms. 
We also show experimental results verifying the convergence of the learning process for 
our language. 
2 Background 
An MDP is a 4-tuple, (,S, .4, T, T½), where ,S is a set of states, .4 is a set of actions, T is a 
probabilistic transition function mapping ,S x .4 x ,S --> [0, 1], and T½ is a reward function 
mapping ,S x .4 x ,S to the reals. In this paper, we focus on infinite-horizon MDPs with a 
discount factor fl. A solution to a MDP is an optimal policy 7r* that maps from ,S --> .4 and 
achieves maximum expected discounted reward for the agent. An SMDP (semi-Markov 
decision process) allows for actions that take more than one time step. T is modified to 
be a mapping from ,S, .4, ,S, N --> [0, 1], where N is the natural numbers; i.e., it specifies 
a distribution over both output states and action durations. T½ is then a mapping from 
,S, .4, ,S, N to the reals. The discount factor, , is generalized to be a function, (s, a), that 
represents the expected discount factor when action a is taken in state s. Our definitions 
follow those common in the literature [9, 6, 4]. 
The HAM language [8] provides for partial specification of agent programs. A HAM pro- 
gram consists of a set of partially specified Moore machines. Transitions in each machine 
may depend stochastically on (features of) the environment state, and the outputs of each 
machine are primitive actions or nonrecursive invocations of other machines. The states 
in each machine can be of four types: {start, stop, action, choice}. Each machine has a 
single distinguished start state and may have one or more distinguished stop states. When 
a machine is invoked, control starts at the start state; stop states return control back to the 
calling machine. An action state executes an action. A call state invokes another machine 
as a subroutine. A choice state may have several possible next states; after learning, the 
choice is reduced to a single next state. 
3 Programmable HAMs 
Consider the problem of creating a HAM program for the Deliver-Patrol domain presented 
in Figure 1, which has 38,400 states. In addition to delivering mail and picking up occa- 
sional additional rewards while patrolling (both of which require efficient navigation and 
safe maneuvering), the robot must keep its battery charged (lest it be stranded) and its 
camera lens clean (lest it crash). It must also decide whether to move quickly (incurring 
collision risk) or slowly (delaying reward), depending on circumstances. 
Because all the 5 x 5 "rooms" are similar, one can write a "traverse the room" HAM routine 
that works in all rooms, but a different routine is needed for each direction (north-south, 
south-north, east-west, etc.). Such redundancy suggests the need for a "traverse the room" 
routine that is parameterized by the desired direction. 
Consider also the fact that the robot should clean its camera lens whenever it gets dirty.

cles). (b) Three of the PHAMs in the partial specification for the Deliver-Patrol world. Right-facing

PHAM specifies an interrupt to clean the camera lens whenever it gets dirty; the Work() PHAM 
interrupts its patrolling whenever there is mail to be delivered.

Figure 3: The remainder of the PHAMs for the Deliver-Patrol domain. Nav(dest,7)) leaves route 
choices to be learned through experience. Similarly, Patrol() does not specify the sequence of loca- 
tions to check. 
In the HAM language, this conditional action must be inserted after every state in every 
HAM. An interrupt mechanism with appropriate scoping would obviate the need for such 
widespread mutilation. 
The PHAM language has these additional characteristics. We provide here an informal 
summary of the language features that enable concise agent programs to be written. The 
9 PHAMs for the Deliver-Patrol domain are presented in Figure l(b), Figure 2(b), and 
Figure 3. The corresponding HAM program requires 63 machines, many of which have 
significantly more states than their PHAM counterparts. 
The PHAM language adds several structured programming constructs to the HAM lan- 
guage. To enable this, we introduce two additional types of states in the PHAM: internal 
states, which execute an internal computational action (such as setting memory variables 
to a function of the current state), and null states, which have no direct effect and are used 
for computational convenience. 
Parameterization is key for expressing concise agent specifications, as can be seen in 
the Deliver-Patrol task. Subroutines take a number of parameters, 0, 02...0k, the val- 
ues of which must be filled in by the calling subroutine (and can depend on any function 
of the machine, parameter, memory, and environment state). In Figure 2(b), the subrou- 
tine Move(diD is shown. The dir parameter is supplied by the NavRoom subroutine. The 
ToDoor(dest,,7eed) subroutine is for navigating a single room of the agent's building. The 
P0 is a transition function that stores a parameterized policy for getting to each door. The 
policy for (N, f) (representing the North door, going fast) is shown in Figure 2(a). Note 
that by using parameters, the control for navigating a room is quite modular, and is written 
once, instead of once for each direction and speed. 
Aborts and interrupts allow for modular agent specification. As well as the camera-lens 
interrupt described earlier, the robot needs to abort its current activity if the battery is low 
and should interrupt its patrolling activity if mail arrives for delivery. The PHAM language 
allows abort conditions to be specified at the point where a subroutine is invoked within 
a calling routine; those conditions are in force until the subroutine exits. For each abort 
condition, an "abort handler" state is specified within the calling routine, to which control 
returns if the condition becomes true. (For interrupts, normal execution is resumed once 
the handler completes.) Graphically, aborts are depicted as labelled dotted lines (e.g., in the 
DoAll() PHAM in Figure 3), and interrupts are shown as labelled dashed lines with arrows 
on both ends (e.g., in the Work() PHAM in Figure 1 (b)). 
Memory variables are a feature of nearly every programming language. Some previous 
research has been done on using memory variables in reinforcement learning in partially 
observable domains [10]. For an example of memory use in our language, examine the 
DoDelivery subroutine in Figure l(b), where z2 is set to another memory value (set in 
Nav(dest, sp)). z2 is then passed as a variable to the Nay subroutine. Computational func- 
tions such as dest in the Nav(dest, sp) subroutine are restricted to be recursive functions 
taking effectively zero time. A PHAM is assumed to have a finite number of memory vari- 
ables, z,... , zn, which can be combined to yield the memory state, Z. Each memory 
variable has finite domain D(zi). The agent can set memory variables by using internal 
states, which are computational action states with actions in the following format: (set 
z ½(m,0, z, Z)), where ½(m, 0, z, Z) is a function taking the machine, parameter, en- 
vironment, and memory state as parameters. The transition function, parameter-setting 
functions, and choice functions take the memory state into account as well. 
4 Theoretical Results 
Our results mirror those obtained in [9]. In summary (see also Figure 4): The composition 
 o .M of a PHAM  with the underlying MDP .M is defined using the cross product of 
states in  and .M. This composition is in fact an SMDP. Furthermore, solutions to  o .M 
yield optimal policies for the original MDP, among those policies expressed by the PHAM. 
Finally, 74 o .M may be reduced to an equivalent SMDP whose states are just the choice 
points, i.e., the joint states where the machine state is a choice state. See [1] for the proofs. 
Definition I (Programmable Hierarchical Abstract Machines: PHAMs) A PHAM is a 
tuple 74 = (! , O, 6, p, ,Z, !z, .,4, !A, Z, ), where !  is the set of machine states in 74, 0 
is the ,space of possible parameter settings, 6 is the transition function, mapping I x (9 x 
 x X x I to [0, 1], p is a mapping from I x (9 x  x X x (9 to [0, 1] and expresses the 
parameter choice function,  maps from I x (9 x  x X to subsets of l and expresses the 
allowed choices at choice states, Z(m) returns the interrupt condition at a call state,/z (m) 
,specifies the handler of an interrupt, A(m) returns the abort condition at a call state, 
/&4(m) ,specifies the handler of an abort,  is the set of possible memory configurations, 
and (m) is a complex function expressing which computational internal function is used 
at internal states, and to which memory variable the result is assigned. 
Theorem 1 For any MDP, .M and any PHAM, 74, the operation of 74 in .M induces a joint 
SMDP, called 74 o .M. If r is an optimal solution for 74 o .M, then the primitive actions 
,specified by r constitute an optimal policy for .M among those consistent with 74. 
The state space of 74 o .M may be enormous. As is illustrated in Figure 4, however, we 
can obtain significant further savings, just as in [9]. First, not all pairs of PHAM and MDP 
states will be reachable from the initial state; second, the complexity of the induced SMDP 
is solely determined by the number of reachable choice points. 
Theorem 2 For any MDP ./M and PHAM 74, let C be the set of choice points in 74 o ./M. 
There exists an SMDP called reduce(74 o .M) with states C such that the optimalpolicy for 
reduce(74 o .M) corre,s19onds to an optimalpolicy for .M among those consistent with 74. 
The reduced SMDP can be solved by offline, model-based techniques using the method 
given in [9] for constructing the reduced model. Alternatively, and much more simply, 
we can solve it using online, model-free HAMQ-leaming [8], which learns directly in the 
reduced state space of choice points. Starting from a choice state co where the agent takes 
action a, the agent keeps track of the reward rtot and discount tot accumulated on the way 
to the next choice point, co. On each step, the agent encounters reward ri and discount 
i (note that i is 0 exactly when the agent transitions only in the PHAM and not in the 
MDP), and updates the totals as follows: 
rto <- + <- ß 
The agent maintains a Q-table, (](co, a), indexed by choice state and action. When the 
agent gets to the next choice state, w , it updates the Q-table as follows: 
Q(co, a) <- (1 - oz)Q(co, a) + a[rtot + fitot maxQ(co',u)]. 
u 
We have the following theorem. 
Theorem 3 For a PHAM 74 and and MDP 2M, HAMQ-learning will converge to an op- 
timal policy for reduce(74 o .M), with probability 1, with appropriate restrictions on the 
learning rate. 
5 Expressiveness of the PHAM language 
As shown by Parr [9], the HAM language is at least as expressive as some existing action 
languages including options [12] and full-fi models [l 1]. The PHAM language is sub- 
stantially more expressive than HAMs. As mentioned earlier, the Deliver-Patrol PHAM 
program has 9 machines whereas the HAM program requires 63. In general, the additional 
number of states required to express a PHAM as a pure HAM is IT)(Z) x C x O l, where 
72(Z) is the memory state space, C is the set of possible abort/interrupt contexts, and (9 is 
the total parameter space. We also developed a PHAM program for the 3,700-state maze 
world used by Parr and Russell [8]. The HAM used in their experiments had 37 machines; 
the PHAM program requires only 7.

the PHAMs given in this paper. PHAM-easy refers to a more complete PHAM, leaving unspecified 
only the speed of travel for each activity. 
With respect to the induced choice points, the Deliver-Patrol PHAM induces 7,816 choice 
points in the joint SMDP, compared with 38,400 in the original MDP. Furthermore, only 
15,800 Q-values must be learned, compared with 307,200 for flat Q-learning. Figure 5 
shows empirical results for the Deliver-Patrol problem, indicating that Q-learning with a 
suitable PHAM program is far faster than flat Q-learning. (Parr and Russell observed sim- 
ilar results for the maze world, where HAMQ-learning finds a good policy in 270,000 iter- 
ations compared to 9,000,000 for flat Q-learning.) Note that equivalent HAM and PHAM 
programs yield identical reductions in the number of choice points and identical speedups 
in Q-learning. Thus, one might argue that PHAMs do not offer any advantage over HAMs, 
as they can express the same set of behaviors. However, this would be akin to arguing that 
the Java programming language offers nothing over Boolean circuits. Ease of expression 
and the ability to utilize greater modularity can greatly ease the task of coding reinforce- 
ment learning agents that take advantage of prior knowledge. 
An interesting feature of PHAMs was observed in the Deliver-Patrol domain. The initial 
PHAM program was constructed on the assumption that the agent should patrol among A, 
/3, C, D unless there is mail to be delivered. However, the specific rewards are such that 
the optimal behavior is to loiter in the mail room until mail arrives, thereby avoiding costly 
delays in mail delivery. The PHAM-Q learning agents learned this optimal behavior by 
"retargeting" the Nay routine to stay in the mail room rather than go to the specified des- 
tination. This example demonstrates the difference between constraining behavior through 
structure and constraining behavior through subgoals: the former method may give the 
agent greater flexibility but may yield "surprising" results. In another experiment, we con- 
strained the PHAM further to prevent loitering. As expected, the agent learned a suboptimal 
policy in which Nay had the intended meaning of travelling to a specified destination. This 
experience suggests a natural debugging cycle in which the agent designer may examine 
learned behaviors and adjust the PHAM program accordingly. 
The additional features of the PHAM language allow direct expression of programs from 
other formalisms that are not easily expressed using HAMs. For example, programs in 
Dietterich's MAXQ language [4] are written easily as PHAMs, but not as HAMs because 
the MAXQ language allows parameters. The language of teleo-reactive (TR) programs [7, 
2] relies on a prioritized set of condition-action rules to achieve a goal. Each action can 
itself be another TR program. The TR architecture can be implemented directly in PHAMs 
using the abort mechanism [1]. 
6 Future work 
Our long-term goal in this project is to enable true cross-task learning of skilled behavior. 
This requires state abstraction in order to learn choices within PHAMs that are applicable 
in large classes of circumstances rather than just to each invocation instance separately. 
Dietterich [4] has derived conditions under which state abstraction can be done within his 
MAXQ framework without sacrificing recursive optimality (a weaker form of optimality 
than hierarchical optimality). We have developed a similar set of conditions, based on a 
new form of value function decomposition, such that PHAM learning maintains hierarchi- 
cal optimality. This decomposition critically depends on the modularity of the programs 
introduced by the language extensions presented in this paper. 
Recently, we have added recursion and complex data structures to the PHAM language, 
incorporating it into a standard programming language (Lisp). This provides the PHAM 
programmer with a very powerful set of tools for creating adaptive agents.
