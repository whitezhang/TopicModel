DRIVERS who illegally use a blue disabled parking badge could have it confiscated and face court action.New legislation which came into effect last month gives parking attendants the power to remove badges which they believe are being misused.Blue badges allows certain groups of disabled people to park free and for any length of time at on-street parking meters and on-street pay and display areas.But a large number of unscrupulous drivers in Glasgow are using badges which don't belong to them or are fakes.As a result, city council roads bosses have decided to use the new legislation to clamp down on the fraudsters.Glasgow parking attendants are issuing leaflets to all vehicles parked in the city displaying a blue badge warning them of the new powers.Alistair Watson, the city council's sustainability and transport spokesman, believes the new powers will be a huge help in tackling the illegal use of blue badges.He said: &quot;The rules on the misuse of blue badges are very clear. It is an offence to use a blue badge unless it is for the benefit of the badge holder.&quot;Those who abuse blue badges are depriving disabled people of opportunities the rest of society take for granted.&quot;This new legislation means our parking attendants will be able to deal with cases of misuses far more effectively.&quot;When someone misuses a badge, they do not just take a parking space, they also deny a parking space to someone with a disability.&quot;We welcome the new powers and expect to see far fewer cases of abuse taking place as a result.&quot;It is estimated one in three blue badges in Glasgow are being used illegally.Surveys have shown in some areas, more than half the parking bays are occupied by vehicles displaying blue badges.Under the new rules, parking attendants have the power to confiscate a badge they suspect is being misused or is fraudulent.Drivers will be issued with a confiscation card advising them why the badge has been confiscated and what happens next.
