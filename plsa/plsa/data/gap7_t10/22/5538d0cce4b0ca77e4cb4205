A postman filmed himself abusing two babies - including a newborn girl aged just five weeks old.
Johnathan Forshaw claimed he was a &quot;sex addict&quot; after police uncovered more than 21,000 indecent images of youngsters following his arrest last November.
They revealed the 33 year-old had preyed on a tiny boy and girl. The first victim was less than a year old when he was attacked.
The other had been born just over a month earlier when Forshaw first molested her.
He is now behind bars after he admitted a string of charges including sexual assault, using lewd and libidinous behaviour and child porn offences.
Police swooped at Forshaw's home in Campbeltown, Argyll last November.
Officers found thousands of indecent images that had been downloaded from websites and via Skype between 2005 and 2014.
It also emerged that he had recorded footage of him abusing children.
A young boy was molested in the summer of 2009. He then went on to repeatedly attack a little girl between 2011 and last year.
The High Court in Glasgow was told how she was just weeks old when the abuse started.
During the one incident, the girl is heard saying &quot;don't&quot; while Forshaw is with her.
Forshaw also yesterday pleaded guilty to a number of voyeurism charges. He secretly recorded three women visiting his home using the bathroom or while they were partially clothed.
Forshaw also filmed another young girl without her knowledge.
After being held for the crimes, Forshaw wrote a number of letters to his partner and his brother &quot;apologising&quot; for what went on.
He claimed he felt &quot;guilty&quot;, described himself as a &quot;sex addict&quot; and that using cannabis had apparently affected him.
Donald MacLeod QC, defending, said Forshaw had shown &quot;a lot of contrition&quot; for what he had done.
Lord Turnbull deferred sentencing for reports until next month.
