A teenager has been detained for three years for raping a 13-year-old girl in a wooded area in Glasgow.
The 15-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was aged 14 when he attacked the girl in the city's Pollok area in January last year.
He denied the charge but was found guilty of raping his victim, who had drunk alcohol, while she was &quot;incapable of giving or with-holding consent&quot;. 
The rapist showed no emotion as he was led away at the High Court in Glasgow.
Judge Bill Dunlop told the boy: &quot;This young girl must regret the bad luck which brought you to cross her path. 
&quot;What her conduct was not, was an invitation to you to take advantage of her condition.&quot; 
The judge concluded the attack must have been &quot;a very unpleasant experience&quot; for the victim.
