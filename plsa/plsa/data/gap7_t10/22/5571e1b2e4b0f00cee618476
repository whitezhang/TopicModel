 A NINE-year-old boy is to be fitted with a &pound;42,000 bionic arm and hand he can programme with a phone app. 
 Josh Cathcart was born with his right arm missing from the elbow down and has suffered taunts from bullies over the disability. 
Now, thanks to a generous relative in Australia, the delighted youngster is to be fitted with the special hi-tech robo-limb. It picks up signals from nerves when he flexes his muscles.
Josh, of Dalgety Bay in Fife, selects what he wants it to do, from gripping the handlebars of his bike to clasping a mug of tea, using the phone app.
 

 
The index finger is also designed so Josh can use it on touch-sensitive screens for gadgets such as smartphones. Mum Clare, 33, said: “Everyone says what a great smile and laugh Josh has. He’s not had that for a long time.”
 Josh, who loves football , says he hopes his new arm will make him even better at the sport. 
He added: “I’m really excited about it. It will make me feel I’m the same as everyone else. It will make me happy.”
Josh’s uncle, Bill McCartney, put up most of the cash for the robotic arm and hand, called an i-limb. It is being made by Touch Bionics in Livingston.
