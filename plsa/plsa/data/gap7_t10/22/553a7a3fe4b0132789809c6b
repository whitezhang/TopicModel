PLANS to charge visitors entry to Glasgow Cathedral have been put on hold as hundreds of people voiced their opposition.

The Historic Scotland proposal would not have affected worshippers but concerns were raised the fees, earmarked for next April, would hit poorer members of society.
The government agency said the site - also known as St Mungo’s Cathedral - costs more than &pound;500,000 a year to run, to which the church itself does not contribute. Discussion was continuing with the church community, a spokesman told the Evening Times.
A spokeswoman for Historic Scotland said: “Following months of positive discussions with the Cathedral community about alternative means of raising funds to invest in the building, we have decided to suspend plans to introduce admission charges to Glasgow Cathedral.”
Charges for visitor entry to churches is common across Europe but a petition, launched by Mary Thomson, a member of the Kirk Session of Glasgow Cathedral, argued free entry reflected “the humanity and warmth of a great city and country”.
The Kirk Session was opposed to the plans and the petition remains online.
