THE SNP have pledged to save the NHS from privatisation and are calling on Labour to do the same.Nicola Sturgeon announced her party's backing of the STUC in protecting the health service, and also a commitment to boosting the UK's NHS budget.Speaking at a campaign event yesterday, the First Minister demanded Labour also commit to boosting funds for the health service and directly challenged Ed Milliband and Jim Murphy to follow suit.Ms Sturgeon said: &quot;Our NHS is our most important public resource - and the SNP will do everything we can to ensure that it properly funded and protected as a public service.&quot;That's why we've been clear that we will vote to boost NHS funding by &pound;9.5bn across the UK - delivering a total increase for Scotland's NHS of &pound;2bn.&quot;Ed Miliband and Jim Murphy now need to give the same commitment to properly fund our health service - rather than meekly acquiescing to the Tory austerity agenda and selling our NHS short in the process.&quot;The SNP's plans for modest public spending increases would give our NHS staff the support they need and ensure our health service continues to deliver a first-class service for patients - Labour in Scotland now need to back our plans on the health service or explain to people why they are more committed to cuts than to our NHS.&quot;But increasing funding isn't the only way a strong team of SNP MPs will ensure our health service is protected.&quot;People in Scotland and across the UK are rightly worried about the potential impact on the health service from TTIP - that's why today I am backing the STUC pledge to protect our NHS from any effects of TTIP.&quot;This General Election is Scotland's opportunity to elect a team of SNP MPs to put an end to the austerity cuts which are putting real pressure on our public services and to ensure our NHS is protected. &quot;Protecting our NHS will always be at the heart of the SNP's plans - it's now time for Labour to give the same commitment, or they will face the consequences at the ballot box.&quot;Margaret Curran, Shadow Scotland Secretary hit back at the SNP and accused them of &quot;catching up with Labour policy.The Scottish Labour candidate for Glasgow East said: &quot;Yet again the SNP are catching up with Labour policy.&quot;Labour has always been clear that we will protect our protect our NHS from TTIP.&quot;But I have to question the SNP's commitment.&quot;Spending on private companies in our NHS has rocketed under the SNP government with four times as many patients are being treated in private hospitals in Scotland as there were a decade ago.&quot;And their reckless plans to cut Scotland off from taxes in the rest of the UK would mean huge austerity for our NHS, with a &pound;7.6 billion black hole in public spending.&quot;Only Scottish Labour has a better plan to protect our NHS, with &pound;1 billion of fully funded, costed investment through a Mansion tax and closing tax loopholes.&quot;We'll use that funding for 1,000 more nurses and 500 more GPs.&quot;hannah.rodger@eveningtimes.co.uk
