THREE Rangers fans have been convicted of causing a sectarian disturbance at a football match. 

Ryan Maclellan, 17, Brian Robertson, 18, and Gordon Cruickshank, 29, all pleaded guilty at Livingston Sheriff Court today.
Maclellan and Robertson, both from Lesmahagow, South Lanarkshire, and Cruickshank, from Ibrox in Glasgow, had previously denied the charge.
Former co-accused Allan Thompson, 17, from Shotts, North Lanarkshire, was acquitted at an earlier hearing after the Crown accepted his not guilty plea.
The Rangers fans were all charged with engaging in behaviour likely to incite pubic disorder in a designated football ground.
They were accused of shouting, swearing and uttering sectarian remarks during a Scottish Championship tie at Livingston FC’s Energy Assets Arena.
They were also alleged to have sung offensive and sectarian sings and songs in support of a proscribed terrorist group at the match last October, which Rangers won 1-0.
Ryan McIlwraith, 19, of Craigend, Glasgow, maintained his not guilty plea to the charge and will stand trial later.
The Crown amended the complaint against him to allege that he was also singing songs in support of affiliated terrorist groups and making offensive gestures.
The cases were all adjourned until June 24.
Sheriff Martin Edington said he would continue consideration of the Crown’s request for a football banning order against the three who pled guilty to the same date.
