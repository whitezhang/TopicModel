David Cameron has said he would consider a guest appearance on Coronation Street, but admitted he hasn't watched the soap for decades.The Prime Minister insisted he would &quot;love&quot; to go on the show, despite confessing to being more of a fan of American TV than Weatherfield's apparent Labour leanings.Asked if he would ever consider making an appearance on the show, the Tory leader told Manchester radio station Key 2: &quot;I would love to go.&quot;But he added: &quot;I only really watched Coronation Street like thirty years (ago) and I saw Hilda Ogden. I mean I'm that old.&quot;So I haven't really been a big soap fan for... I watched EastEnders in the days of Dirty Den and watched Coronation Street in the days of Hilda Ogden.&quot;Since then I'm afraid I've gone a bit American. A bit of Modern Family, stuff like that. Quite like that.&quot;The station previously put the same question to Ukip leader Nigel Farage who said he would be &quot;happy to go on&quot;.He added: &quot;The beer in the Rovers looks all right to me. I'm a bit worried about the smoking facilities there.&quot;They need a decent shelter out the back for me. But sort that out for me ... and I'm all yours. And I can hold court in the Rovers, and have loads of fun.&quot;Mr Cameron was also asked about his wife Samantha, who he described as &quot;amazing&quot;, adding: &quot;She creates around me and the home a sort of sense of equilibrium.&quot;She manages to sort everything and while having a job herself. So if I'm not too much of a worse man or husband it's down to her, not me.&quot;The full interview with the Prime Minister will be aired on the station's England's Talk In programme on Sunday.
