A THUG threatened to shoot a neighbour - after a dispute about his noisy dog.Lee Morrison brandished an air rifle at Keith Harris and claimed: &quot;I am going to f***ing kill you.&quot;Morrison flew into a rage last December after earlier complaints about Mr Harris's pet and his apparently rumbling washing machine.It lead to the 38 year-old being arrested and he was yesterday locked up for four years and two months at the High Court in Glasgow.A judge heard how Morrison regularly moaned about the noise coming from the upstairs flat at the property in the city's Pollok.He often banged the ceiling and later wrote a letter of complaint to Mr Harris, who lived with 33 year-old Carol Dallas.To try and appease Morrison, they bought a special collar for their dog to try and limit the animal's barking.Just after Christmas last year, Miss Dallas's mum then visited and brought along her new puppy.The two dogs in the flat soon started playing - which again annoyed Morrison and he started thumping at the ceiling.Mr Harris (36) and Miss Dallas went down to speak to Morrison, who yelled: &quot;You are the problem.&quot;He then left for a few moments before returning clutching a silver firearm.Morrison threatened Mr Harris that he was going to &quot;kill&quot; him.Petrified Mr Harris and Miss Dallas then fled back upstairs before calling the police.An armed response team soon arrived and discovered the air gun in Morrison's home along with pellets for the weapon.The court heard Mr Harris and Miss Dallas were so traumatised at what happened, they moved home.Morrison pled guilty to assaulting the pair by presenting the weapon and also a separate charge under the Firearms Act.John McLaughlin, defending, said Morrison had &quot;anger management issues&quot; and &quot;generally regretted&quot; what he did &quot;straight away&quot;.It emerged he was jailed for more than three years in 2008 after he attacked a friend with a hammer.Morrison - wearing his pyjamas at the time - battered James Copeland, who was said to have vandalised his Mercedes.In this latest case, Judge Lord Turnbull yesterday told the thug what he did must have been &quot;terrifying&quot; for Mr Harris and Miss Dallas.
