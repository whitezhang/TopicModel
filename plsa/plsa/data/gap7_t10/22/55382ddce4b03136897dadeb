A motorcyclist has died after he came off the road on the A85 in Argyll.
The 34-year-old man had been travelling east between Taynuilt and Loch Awe at about 11.30.
Police said the man was driving a silver Honda Fireblade motorcycle and they were appealing for anyone who saw the bike in the area prior to that time to contact them.
The road was closed in both directions for about six hours, causing an 80-mile diversion.
