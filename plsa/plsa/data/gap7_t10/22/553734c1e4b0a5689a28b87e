STUDENTS in Glasgow are being offered confidential emotional support with the launch of a new listening phone service.Unite Students, the UK-wide student accommodation provider, has launched Nightline- a confidential listening service, giving critical emotional support to students.Unite will offer the Nightline service to students in all their properties including the five student properties they have in Glasgow.The new service, which is designed to work with and bolster existing support services offered by universities, comes after research from the National Union of Students revealed that one in five students experience mental health issues while at university.Jenny Shaw, Unite Students' head of student services, said: &quot;I believe students in 2015 are under more pressure than any generation which has gone before them.&quot;Teams in the 25 cities where our properties are situated are often called on to support students who are clearly struggling. In rare cases students can present some quite extreme symptoms.&quot;We want to take a truly student-led approach which works in close partnership with specialist services. Nightline is a superb service which puts students who need to hear a friendly voice in touch with someone from their own world.&quot;Unite staff have received training in order to look and listen for warning signs associated with high stress and possible mental health issues.
