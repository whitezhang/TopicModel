ROGUE landlords could force Glasgow's housing stock to return to the days of 1960s slums, according to a new report.Bad management is causing the condition of tenement flats and closes to worsen and risks undoing work carried out since the 1970s to improve sub-standard properties.And the impact of poor housing is felt on the wider community, such as Govanhill where rogue landlords have caused misery for residents.Our Crumbling Tenements says there are at least 17,500 sub-standard flats in the west of Scotland.The report claims many need substantial investment to bring them back up to a decent standard, but such work is no longer being done.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon spoke yesterday at a conference on the topic being held by Glasgow and West of Scotland Forum of Housing Associations (GWSF), which compiled the report after surveying its members.Ms Sturgeon said: &quot;I am pleased that the condition of homes in Scotland is improving under this Government and that is in part down to the hard work of the people working in Housing Associations across Glasgow who are doing their bit to improve the lives of people in their communities.&quot;From the 1970s, grants enabled tens of thousands of tenements to be improved by helping owners who wished to upgrade their property and to housing associations which took over and improved flats.However, the report says &quot;since the start of the 21st century, this work has ground to a halt.&quot;The report says problems are caused by private owners who can't or won't spend the money needed to maintain common areas, by a lack of effective management in many tenements, including unfactored closes, and a policy focus on new provision rather than maintaining and improving existing housing.The study, launched at Govanhill Housing Association, says concerted action is needed from owners themselves and from national and local government, in partnership with local housing associations, to tackle the growing number of badly-neglected privately-owned tenements.David Bookbinder, GWSF director, said: &quot;Everyone recognises that these are challenging times financially, but for some tenements, if nothing is done, it really will feel that we've gone back full circle to the 1960s and 70s.&quot;In some respects there's a temptation to say these are privately owned tenements and it's down to the owners to sort out their own problems. But we know that things can get to a point where housing conditions can blight whole areas.&quot;He said a partnership between the Scottish Government and Glasgow City Council is making and will continue to make a big difference to tenements in areas like Govanhill, Dennistoun, Queen's Cross and Easterhouse.Discussions in Renfrewshire are also being held to address the issue.Mary Taylor, Scottish Federation of Housing Associations Chief Executive, added: &quot;This problem is replicated across towns and cities throughout Scotland.&quot;The SFHA supports any action to address these problems and working to produce guidance on factoring, to be available soon.&quot;
