Sir Alex Ferguson has said he is finding retirement "more exhausting" than managing Manchester United.The Scot stepped down in 2013 after 39 years in management, 27 of which were with Manchester United.He has since got involved in charity work, ambassadorial roles and other projects but said he has struggled to readjust to a new routine.The 73-year-old was in Glasgow today to donate &pound;5,000 to a fund set up to build a statue of Govan heroine Mary Barbour who successfully led rent strikes during the First World War.He was asked about the variety of work he is doing and said: &quot;I'm making sure that I'm active, that's important when you retire and I've got many things on my plate.&quot;It's funny because it's a different type of work, where as at United I would be in every morning at quarter to seven and be there to tea time, it's the one constant thing in your life.&quot;Now, it's different things so that's probably more exhausting.&quot;I don't get up at six in the morning any more that's for sure, I have a long lie now and again.&quot;
