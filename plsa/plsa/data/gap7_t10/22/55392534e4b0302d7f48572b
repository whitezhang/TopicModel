THE first patients to use the new South Glasgow University Hospital will arrive in days and begin nearly two months of transition to the top-notch facility.
Referred to many Glaswegians already as the New Southern General, outpatients will arrive from Sunday, April 26 as the Western Infirmary’s renal dialysis unit moves.
A&amp;E departments at the Western, Yorkhill, Victoria and the current Southern General will all move by the middle of June as the city gets used to a new flow of patients and health care.

NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde are adding 410 extra nursing shifts and 100 portering and domestic staff shifts for the transfer.
The Scottish Ambulance Service (SAS) will have 16 vehicles dedicated to shifting patients to leave the 999 team unaffected.
A ambulance spokesman said: “The move vehicles are not being taken from existing cover but will come from those due to be decommissioned as well as new vehicles that will be used before they are due to replace existing resources.”
Here are the key details for patients:

Health bosses are sending out 561,000 leaflets about the changes, which are also available online.
An NHSGCC spokeswoman said: “The new South Glasgow University Hospital is on track to receive the first outpatients on Monday morning. The new hospitals will be equipped with a combination of new equipment and current equipment, which will be transferred as part of the phased migration.”
