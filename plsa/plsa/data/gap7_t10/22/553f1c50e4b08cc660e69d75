EVERY single candidate in the General Election has been urged to restore dignity to the welfare system.A coalition of charities trades unions and religious groups has united to write to each candidate asking for their backing for the manifesto to protect and improve the social security system.Scottish Campaign on Welfare Reform (SCoWR) has called for benefit rates to be increased to take people out of poverty.The manifesto seeks a roll back of the welfare cuts and punitive agenda that sees people being sanctioned and left with no money to live on.The grouping of around 60 organisations says the sanctions system is as &quot;ineffective, complex, costly and stigmatising&quot;.It wants a move away from means tested benefits and greater respect afforded to welfare claimants and recipients.John Dickie Director of Child Poverty Action Group in Scotland said: &quot;&quot;Over recent years we have seen massive real terms cuts to benefits and tax credits and hopelessly inappropriate sickness and disability assessments.&quot;These changes undermine the support that ordinary families rely on, whether they are in or out of work. But now organisations from across Scotland are united in calling on prospective MPs to back a fundamentally different approach to welfare reform in the next parliament.&quot;Our wellbeing as a nation depends on protecting and enabling people when they face unemployment, ill health, disability or additional caring responsibilities. We must now invest in our social security system, not undermine it.&quot;The manifestos states the welfare reform agenda is &quot;creating a system which is leaving more people without access to any support at all&quot;, lacks compassion, and fails to treat people with dignity and respect&quot;.The coalition involves organisations including Children 1st, STUC, One Parent Families Scotland, Scottish Women's Aid and the Poverty Alliance.
