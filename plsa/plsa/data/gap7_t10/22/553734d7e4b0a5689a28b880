ORGANISERS of a sponsored stride are hoping around 1000 people will put their best foot forward and help them on the road to building a new Â£20m hospice.The annual Clyde Stride walk, in aid of the Prince and Princess of Wales hospice's Brick by Brick appeal, takes place next month and is open to children as young as eight.It comes as the hospice prepares to start preparation work on the site of the new hospice, at Bellahouston Park, also next month.A spokeswoman for the hospice said they hoped to attract lots of families to the event, now in its third year.She said: &quot;It's optional fancy dress and we find that everyone does come in costume.&quot;We've had everything, from Where's Wally to Disney. I think a lot of children will come in Frozen costumes this year as it's been so popular.&quot;Walkers have the option of either a 5K or 10K route, with the 5K taking place around the Riverside Museum, past the Tall Ship to the Pumphouse and down to the Clydeside. After walking over the Arc Bridge, participants will return via Bell's Bridge.Those doing the 10K walk will carry on to the Victoria Bridge, back over the Suspension Bridge, under the railway bridge and then on to the Tradeston Bridge, passing the hospice on the way. Then they zig-zag back over the Arc Bridge, the Bell's Bridge and back to the Riverside Museum.Although the event kicks off at 8.30pm, there will be entertainment at the Riverside Museum, including a DJ and a live Frozen show, starting from 6.30pm.The event first started as the Midnight Walk but more families wanted to take part and the time was brought forward to earlier in the evening to allow children as young as eight to come along.Sponsored by Northern Forklift, employees and their staff have all taken part too and last year the event raised &pound;22,000 for the appeal.Everyone gets a Clyde Stride t-shirt and a medal on the evening.The Prince and Princess of Wales Hospice was set up in Glasgow in the 1980s to provide free specialist palliative care for people with terminal illnesses, primarily cancer, as well as support for families and carers.The Brick by Brick Appeal, which is supported by the Evening Times, will help raise the remaining &pound;7 million of the &pound;20m needed to build the 21st-Century hospice.The spokeswoman said the preparation work was expected to take some time, due to the nature of the ground. Work on the new building is not due to begin until February 2018.Joyce Ross, senior community fundraiser for the hospice, said: &quot;Together, as we walk the streets of Glasgow, we'll lay the foundations for a new hospice.&quot;Registration costs &pound;20 per adult and &pound;10 per child with a family ticket of &pound;50 for two adults and two children.
