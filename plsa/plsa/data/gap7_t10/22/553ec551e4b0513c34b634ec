It will take place at Analeentha, Mallow in north Cork, on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms Buckley, 24, a nurse and student, went missing following a night out at the Sanctuary nightclub in Glasgow on 11 April.

She was an only daughter. Her parents and brothers brought her back to her native Cork on a specially commissioned flight from Glasgow at the weekend.
Her funeral Mass will be held at the Church of St Michael the Archangel in Analeentha at 14:00 BST on Tuesday, before burial at St John's Cemetery in Burnfoot.
