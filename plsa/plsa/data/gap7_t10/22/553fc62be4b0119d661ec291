The UK's only female polar bear is settling in after entering her new enclosure for the first time.Victoria explored her new home by going for a swim in the pond at Highland Wildlife Park, where she is being introduced as a potential mate for Arktos, who lives there with fellow male Walker.Her presence at the Kingussie park has sparked hopes it may see the birth of a polar bear cub in the future.But keepers said Victoria and Arktos will not be brought together until next year, giving her time to get to know her own custom-built enclosure.Douglas Richardson, a head keeper at the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland, said: &quot;She's been very, very responsive with all the keepers, she's an absolute dream to work with.&quot;She's been no problem at all and settled in far faster than I thought she might.&quot;Today is the first time she's gone out into her main enclosure. She came out and completely explored the perimeter, went for a swim in the pond and had a bit of a play with the plastic blue barrel we put in there for her with an ice block in it.&quot;Once she's completely comfortable in the enclosure she'll become more playful and more interactive with her environment.&quot;Victoria's enclosure is completely separate from that of the males, mimicking the behaviour of polar bears in the wild who only come together to mate.Mr Richardson added: &quot;We were thinking we might bring Arktos over for breeding this year but we are actually a bit late in the season and I would prefer her to get plenty of time to settle into her new home without the stress of a strange boyfriend being brought over.&quot;So, we're going to put them together next spring. Then, hopefully they will quite quickly get mating.&quot;The female bear arrived from Aalborg Zoo in Denmark on March 25. She was born in December 1996 at Rostock Zoo in Germany.
