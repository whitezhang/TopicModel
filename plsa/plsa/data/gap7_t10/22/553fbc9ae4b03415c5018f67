COMMONWEALTH Games boxing champion Charlie Flynn will take part in a 10k run through Glasgow later this year.
The 21-year-old helped officially launch the 2015 Bank of Scotland Great Scottish Run which takes place on October 4 by training with veteran runner Charlie Docherty, 71, in the city today.
As the &quot;boxing mailman&quot;, Flynn delivered a Commonwealth gold for Scotland in last summer's Games, with his lively performances and interviews making him one of the home stars of Glasgow 2014.
Flynn enlisted the support of Mr Docherty, who has participated in every Great Scottish Run since the event began, for a training session over the Clyde Arc.
The event incorporates both a 10k and half-marathon route that wind their way through some of Glasgow's best-known streets.
There is also a toddler dash, family mile, mini run and junior event held on the day before the main run.
 

Flynn said: &quot;Running is part of my fitness routine to keep in shape for the boxing ring, but I've never taken part in a large-scale event like this so I'm excited to start training.
&quot;I'm glad I've got someone like Charlie D on hand to help me though; he knows this event inside out so I'm hoping to pick up some good tips today.&quot;
Mr Docherty, who will running the half marathon, said: &quot;The Bank of Scotland Great Scottish Run has been the highlight of my running calendar for over 30 years now and I can't wait to be at the start line again this year.
&quot;Charlie F is a fit young lad, I am sure he will do brilliantly in the 10k and I will certainly be there cheering him on!&quot;
