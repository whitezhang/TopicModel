LABOUR's manifesto will benefit young jobless, low paid workers and the NHs in Glasgow the party has said.With the party behind the SNP in the opinion polls it is looking to retain its seven MPs across the city.The manifesto is an appeal to working people in a bid to prevent support drifting to the SNP in large numbers.The Manifesto for Glasgow Labour said will benefit tens of thousands of people and ensure the NHS is properly funded and staffed to end lengthy waiting times and help cancer patients and people with mental health issues.The Scottish manifesto includes a guaranteed job or training place for Long term unemployed people which Labour says will help almost 3000 in Glasgow.Abolishing zero hours contracts, a key pledge in Scotland and the UK highlighted by Jim Murphy and Ed Miliband will help 6587 workers in the city get regular hours.Increasing the minimum wage to &pound;8 an hour by 2019 would give a pay rise to almost 60,000 workers in Glasgow.Labour plans an extra &pound;1bn of investment in the NHS which it said &pound;200m would be in Glasgow.Glasgow East Candidate Margaret Curran urged people to think of the election as a straight choice between a Labour and Conservative Government.She said: &quot;It has been five brutal years of Tory austerity for Glasgow families. The last thing families struggling to make ends meet now is five more years of David Cameron.&quot;The SNP won't deliver for Glasgow. The SNP Scottish Government has cut Glasgow's budget every year since 2007.&quot;The Labour pledges for Glasgow cover many city council policies and include continuing to pay the Living Wage to all Council staff.It said it will build a rail link to Glasgow Airport using city deal cash from the UK and Scottish governments.Ms Curran added: &quot;The SNP's plans to cut Scotland off from UK wide taxes would be a disaster for Scotland. It would mean Scotland would lose out on &pound;1 billion of investment in our NHS. That's &pound;200 million more for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde turned down because of full fiscal autonomy. And it would mean young Glaswegians losing out on our plans to guarantee them a job or training.&quot;In this election it's a straight choice between a Tory Government or a Labour Government. The way to let Glasgow flourish on 7 May is to vote Labour.&quot;The commitments include abolishing the bedroom tax, protecting tax credits, not raising VAT or the basic rate of income tax.The party said it had achieved successes in Glasgow but admitted too many people hadn't seen the benefit of those successes.It said &quot;centralizing governments in London and Edinburgh&quot; held Glasgow back.The SNP said their spending plans would protect the NHs and accused Labour of broken promises.Glasgow East SNP candidate, Natalie McGarry, said: &quot;Glasgow is fed up with Labour's broken promises and failures in Glasgow. People here in this great city recognise that it is time for a change.&quot;These fantasy figures from Labour are academic and based on current UK government spending. People know that the real and imminent threat of cuts comes from Labour, the Tories and Lib Dems.&quot;This General Election is Scotland's opportunity to elect a team of SNP MPs to put an end to the austerity cuts which are putting real pressure on our public services and to ensure our NHS is protected. Protecting our NHS will always be at the heart of the SNP's plans.&quot;
