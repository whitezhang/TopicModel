SADITSTIC slashers knifed three horses in a twisted attack.One of the helpless animals was mutilated so badly that part of a bone in her head was left exposed - and she may lose her eye.Police, who have been left baffled as to the motive behind the crime, said the three horses were found with gaping knife wounds in North Lanarkshire.Cops were called in after horrified owners discovered the horses had been attacked at the weekend.They were slashed in a field in Cumbernauld sometime between 8pm on Sunday and 4pm on Monday.The animals' owners are sickened by the attacks and told the Evening Times they can think of no reason why their horses have been targeted.One owner, whose horse's face was slashed, said: &quot;She has had surgery, but may lose her eye due to the broken piece of bone that needed removed.&quot;It is a waiting game for them now.&quot;Vets were drafted in to establish that the injuries could not have been caused by another animal and a police probe was launched.The horses had been in a field near to stables on Kilt Farm, Walton Road, Abronhill, when they were targeted.Inspector Phil Rose, from Cumbernauld Police Office, said: &quot;This is a sickening crime on these defenceless animals, and whoever carried out this attack must be caught.&quot;One of the horses received a serious injury to its head and is receiving treatment, and the other two were treated for lacerations.&quot;Fortunately these kind of incidents are extremely rare, but I would ask people to be vigilant and report any suspicious behaviour to police.&quot;Police inquiries are continuing and I would urge anyone with information that may assist this police investigation to contact Police Scotland.&quot;In November, the Evening Times told how thieves broke into a field near Waterhead Farm, in Cumbernauld, and hacked off 15 horses' long manes and tails.Police stressed the two incidents are not linked.Anyone with any information is asked to contact Police Scotland on 101.
