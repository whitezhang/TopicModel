THEY’RE down from five to three and almost 20 years older than they were when the band announced they were splitting, but Take That’s fans are still camping out overnight for the chance to get up close to their idols.
Dozens of fans have been camping out to catch Britain’s oldest boy band as they kick off their UK tour at Glasgow’s Hydro venue, complete with sleeping bags and foil blankets.
Colette McIntyre may be pushing 40 and was just 16 when she first met her idols on the Saturday morning TV show 8:15 from Manchester, hosted by Ross King.
She drove up to Glasgow and camped out at the venue from tea-time on Saturday with 10 other Take That superfans including tutor, Mel Cooke, also from Warrington, near Manchester.
“Some of us are from Warrington, some from Manchester, others from the North West and London,” McIntyre, who declined to give her occupation, stated.
“I’ve been a fan since August 3rd, 1991.”
 

Cooke added: “We drove up because it is opening night and have standing tickets.
“We’re hoping this will get us to the front and checked we are at the right entrance.”
She claimed: “Take That are getting better and better.”

Leisure assistant Hayley McNeil, 29, from the Trossachs, arrived with pals, restaurant managers Feonaidh Gemmell, 26, and Nicola Hibberd, 29.
“We got here at 3am,” McNeil said. “We had a little nap before we left to come here.
“Take That always put on a good show that is the same standard whenever they play.”
 

Gemmell added: “We need to be at the front and within touching distance. It’s nice to have just the barrier between us and them.”
Take That play five dates at the Hydro this week ahead of further UK tour dates.
The shows come amid controversy surrounding a tax avoidance scheme that led them to fall foul of HMRC.
The trio have not appealed against a tax tribunal ruling from last May that the Icebreaker scheme they poured millions into was designed to exploit legal loopholes.
