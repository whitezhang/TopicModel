A PROPOSED admission charge for visitors to Glasgow Cathedral has been put on hold.An online petition launched in October protesting against the Historic Scotland plan reached almost 1700 signatures before the suspension was announced.Historic Scotland say this latest decision was the result of long discussion with the cathedral's community, in which alternative fundraising arrangements were considered.Visitors to the building at present are only encouraged to make a small donation.A spokesman for Historic Scotland said: &quot;The costs of running the building are however considerable - in excess of &pound;500,000 a year - which the church currently makes no contribution to, unlike other places of worship across the country.&quot;We are currently in advanced discussions with the Cathedral community about what fair contribution could be made, specifically to cover some of the costs of the pastoral use of the building.&quot;Any charges would have not applied to worshippers, but they still attracted opposition from cathedral authorities and Glasgow people.Fears were expressed that implementing a charge would deter those poorest in society, and that it would be inappropriate for a place of worship.The petition was launched by Mary Thomson, a member of the Kirk Session, and argued that the free entry reflected &quot;the humanity and warmth of a great city and country.&quot;The building, also known as St Mungo's Cathedral, is home to a notable post-war collection of stained glass windows.Historic Scotland is an executive agency tasked with looking after and promoting Scotland's national heritage.
