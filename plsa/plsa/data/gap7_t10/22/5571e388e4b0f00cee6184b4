A PERSONAL fitness guru walked free from court yesterday – despite punching a woman so hard she was left lying in a pool of blood.
Mike Heatlie, who has trained singer Gwen Stefani, escaped jail and was ordered to pay his victim nearly &pound;8000 in compensation.
He hit Fiona McCartney so hard she lost a tooth and faces thousands of pounds of dental surgery after the attack in Edinburgh on March 29 last year.
Heatlie pleaded guilty to assault at Edinburgh Sheriff Court on March 13.
At a sentencing hearing yesterday, he was also told to carry out 100 hours of unpaid community service unpaid.
Fiona, 43, claimed the sentence was “sending out the wrong message”, adding: “A custodial sentence might have been more suitable.”
Fiona had previously told how Heatlie, who owns a fitness studio in Meadowbank, Edinburgh, punched her outside The Jam House nightclub because she would not give him a cigarette.
Heatlie, 42, refused to comment yesterday.
