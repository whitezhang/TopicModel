A TINY fox cub was found alone and distressed in a garden after becoming separated from its mother.
The four-week-old orphaned female was discovered by a member of the public in Elgin Place, East Kilbride, South Lanarkshire, on Saturday.
She is now being looked after at the Scottish SPCA’s wildlife centre in Fishcross, Clackmannanshire, where she has been nicknamed Blondie due to her unusual pale grey coat.
Staff hope to release the animal back into the wild when she is old enough to survive on her own.
Wildlife centre manager Colin Seddon said: “Blondie was sadly separated from her mother.
“At this time of year fox cubs are beginning to explore outside their den and may not need to be rescued.
“They are also being moved by their mother from earth to earth and sometimes get dropped, but she will come back for the cubs if it is safe to do so.
“In Blondie’s case, her mother was nowhere to be found and she wouldn’t have survived on her own.
“We’re hopeful that Blondie will be released at a carefully selected site with the landowner’s permission when she is at the right age and stage to be able to survive on her own in the wild.
“Our advice is that it if you spot a fox cub, it is best to leave them alone if they appear uninjured and in a safe place.”
