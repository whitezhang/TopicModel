STUNT biker Danny MacAskill has completed his latest challenge, swapping the mountains of Skye for Highland cattle.

Despite suffering a rare puncture, he jumped two Highland cows and their handlers as he promoted the Mountain Bike World Cup in Fort William this summer.
The stunt attracted the attention of dozens of workers in central Glasgow who were out in the sunshine during their lunch hour.
Mr MacAskill said: “I didn’t expect to be jumping around a cow, it’s a bit random, but good fun and we got good weather for it.
“A flat tyre can be pretty standard if you’re on rough ground and really pushing, but I ride here every day and maybe in every 40 rides I’ll get a puncture and it just happened to be today.”
MacAskill stunned viewers last year with a death-defying ride along the hazardous Cuillin Ridge on his native Isle of Skye in a video that has been viewed more than 33 million times on YouTube.
One of his next big projects is a stunt show at the Mountain Bike World Cup, which takes place on June 6 and 7.
“I’ve been going to the Fort William world cup for the last 14 years more as a spectator, but this year I’m lucky enough to be going with the drop and roll team to be doing shows at the event.
“For me that’s a massive deal, it’s going to be so cool to be in front of a home crowd and we’re really going to push the shows to make sure they’re the biggest and best we do this year.
“I’ve never really ridden a lot of downhill. I ride mountain bikes a lot but never a downhill bike specifically. What those guys do and the level they’re at is mind-blowing.
“When you see the guys flying down (mountain) Aonach Mor you can’t quite believe it. It’s like they’re in fast-forward.”
