A cheeky Glaswegian has taken on a household supplies firm after they used an actor in their advert who looked just like him.Joker Paul Kelly, from Bearsden, contacted German firm Karcher via Facebook in a post to pull them up for &quot;unjust exploitation&quot; of his face in an advert for their power washer.He then demanded that the firm compensate him with a lifetime supply of Irn Bru, a six-figure sum of hard cash (Sterling), a spot in their next advert as the evil twin or a free pressure washer.The HGV driver said: &quot;One of the guy's at work said the guy in advert looked like me. So I found it on YouTube and I could see the resemblance.Even my mum and dad were startled by just how much I looked like him. &quot;I like to think I have a good sense of humour so I thought I would post this to their page.&quot;Surprisingly, however, the firm took Paul's case on board and opened up Facegate to their Facebook fans.Gerry Hayes said: &quot;Seems legit.&quot;Paul Hirst added: &quot;Nice to see a bit of friendly humour on Facebook, he deserves a washer for his cheek.&quot;And it seems Karcher agreed with Paul who now has a new pressure washer on his way to him.Paul added: &quot;I have been crying with laughter over this. We have a Karcher in the garage but this is top of the range so I am happy. I was only doing it for a laugh.&quot;I have to admit though I have never been so popular on Facebook.&quot;
