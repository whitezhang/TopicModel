A SCOTS hamlet could be at the centre of a new gold rush.
 Towie, in Aberdeenshire , population 300, doesn’t even have a local shop – but could become Scotland’s answer to the Klondike. 
Hopes of a major find have emerged after Turkish mining giant Koza Altin Isletmeleri teamed up with Scots firm Greenore Gold.
GreenOre, who have been working in the area for two years, said that streams near Towie had been known for many years to contain gold grains.
Managing director Gavin Berkenheger said the development of any gold mine was at a “very early stage” but added there was “enormous potential” at the site.
“This area in Aberdeenshire has all the right hallmarks of a major deposit to be hiding underneath the surface,” he said.
“Our main prospect is on the Dalradian trend, which stretches from Northern Ireland up through Scotland.
“A 3.5 million ounce gold deposit is currently being developed by Dalradian Gold in Northern Ireland. We hope to repeat this success.
“They have seen what we have got and they are happy that this area we have in Aberdeenshire has potential for a large deposit.
“GreenOre Gold is delighted to partner with Koza, a major gold producer. This further supports our belief in the potential for major gold deposits in Scotland.”
 Earlier this year it was revealed Tyndrum was also in line for a &pound;200m gold rush . 
The news has been met with a mixed reaction from locals, with some hoping it would mean extra work in the area while others fear the area could be blighted by any excavation.
