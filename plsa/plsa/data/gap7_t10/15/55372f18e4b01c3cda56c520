RESIDENTS had to be evacuated from a tenement as firefighters battled a blaze in a church next door.
Crews found a “well-developed fire” in the church when they arrived at the scene in Crossloan Road in the Govan area of Glasgow at around 10.20pm last night.
At the height of the incident 35 firefighters were involved in tackling the blaze, which broke through the roof of the building.
A four-storey tenement next to the blazing building had to be evacuated, and three residents were provided with emergency accommodation overnight.
Other residents in the area were advised to keep their windows and doors closed due to the smoke.
Fire crews were still at the scene at 6.30am today.
