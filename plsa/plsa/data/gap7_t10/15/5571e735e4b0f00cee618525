RANGERS have slammed the actions of supporters who set off smoke bombs during last night’s Championship clash at Livingston.
Flares were let off in the away end at the beginning of the match, which ended 1-1, and two people are expected to appear in court today after being arrested at the ground.
Rangers released a statement this afternoon condemning the actions as “unwelcome and dangerous” and have vowed to take action against any supporters involved.
The statement on the club’s official website said: “The club is extremely disappointed at the conduct of a few of our supporters at last night’s match against Livingston.
“We understand that two supporters were arrested for alleged use of pyrotechnics and are appearing from police custody at Livingston Sheriff Court today.
“We also understand from Police Scotland that further investigations are being undertaken to identify further supporters who were involved in this reckless conduct.
“The club will fully assist Police Scotland in this investigation to identify those involved.
“The use of pyrotechnics at football matches is an unwelcome and dangerous distraction that is frightening to some of our vulnerable supporters.
“This is not the manner we expect our supporters to conduct themselves and the Club will take immediate action to identify and take appropriate action against those involved.”
