Maven Capital Partners has acquired the empty Mitchell House office building on Bath Street in Glasgow.
The property, comprising six floors, will be redeveloped as student accommodation with project managers Calmont Group to provide studio accommodation for around 70 students.
Development costs are projected will be in the region of &pound;5.5 million and the work is scheduled to be finished in time for the 2015/16 academic year.
The development of Mitchell House will be Maven’s second venture in the student accommodation sector in Glasgow, adding to a &pound;6.8 million fund raising it led to purchase and convert Claremont House into a new 94 bed student residence.
Maven has now sold Claremont House to a specialist European property fund in an &pound;8.37 million deal.
Commenting on the Mitchell House deal, Ramsay Duff of Maven Capital Partners said: “We are very pleased to be working alongside Calmont Group on this exciting project.
“There is still a shortfall of good quality purpose built student accommodation in the city and this development will help to satisfy that demand.”
