X FACTOR finalist and TV star Stacey Solomon launched her debut album in Glasgow on Monday - and ate her cake too.
The I’m A Celebrity… winner signed copies of “Shy” at intu Braehead’s HMV store and was presented with a special cake with the album cover on it.
Stacey said: “I picked Scotland to launch the album because I love the vibe up here and everyone is so friendly and kind.
“Getting the cake is fab and it looks brilliant. I’ll share it with my team who have been working so hard promoting the album.
“I’ve also got relatives who live in Scotland and I’ll see some of them while I’m here.”
The album, which features collaborations between Stacey, 25, and Lily Allen and Rita Ora, drew big crowds to meet Stacey and get an autograph.
Marketing manager at intu Braehead, Lydia Brown said: “Stacey has had a fantastic career since we first saw her on X Factor and it’s brilliant that she choose to do her first signing session for the new album at intu Braehead.
“We’ve had a listen to the album in the office and we all think it’s great.
“We decided to present Stacey with a special cake to wish her the best of luck with the new release. I’m sure she’ll top the charts with it.”
