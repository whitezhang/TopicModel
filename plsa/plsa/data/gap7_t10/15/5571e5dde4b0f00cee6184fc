YOUNG offshore worker yesterday picked up a &pound;1million lotto cheque – and told how it will pay for the wedding of his dreams.
Catering steward Michael Innes, 29, decided on a whim to try the Monopoly Millionaire instant win game after buying his regular ticket for the main draw – and hit the jackpot.
 Buckie-based Michael celebrated his win with student nurse fiancee  Megan Fulton, 25. 

And as he picked up his cheque at the Mansion House Hotel in Elgin, he said: “This allows us to have the wedding we want, rather than the wedding we would have had to settle for.
“It also gives us the opportunity to look for a house of our own and start married life in an entirely new situation.
“At the moment, we’re living in my mum and dad’s house in Buckie while they are based in Tenerife.
“I’ve spoken to them on the phone and they’re absolutely thrilled.”
Megan has exams next week and still plans to sit them. Michael said: “I’m hoping she’ll be able to focus – after we get used to what this means for us.”
