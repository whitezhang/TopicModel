A teenager has been arrested over a series of alleged laser pen attacks on planes and police vehicles.
 They took place in the Drumchapel area of Glasgow last month, with some involving the targeting of commercial flights heading to land at Glasgow Airport. 
A 17-year-old man has now been arrested by police, who described the act as &quot;extremely dangerous&quot;.
 Chief inspector John McBride said: &quot;The effect of a laser attack within an aircraft can dazzle and distract the crew - it can even cause temporary blindness. 
&quot;Luckily on these occasions no harm was caused and the pilot was able to land the aircraft safely, however the potential for catastrophe should not be underestimated.
&quot;People need to realise the dangers of this reckless behaviour and I would urge anyone to think twice before doing so as this is an offence we take extremely seriously.
&quot;Anyone with information regarding laser attack incidents can contact police via the non-emergency number 101.&quot;
