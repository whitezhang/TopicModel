 ANGIE Allan’s friends thought she was barking mad when she adopted a 10-stone rescue dog from Spain. 
 But the 48-year-old says saving Spanish mastin Tigger from a “horrific death” is one of the best things she’s ever done. 
The mum of three spotted the pooch on a Spanish animal charity website and, realising he was going to be destroyed, set the wheels in motion to bring him to Scotland.
 After a month in his new home, one-year-old Tigger is settling in well to life in Dumfries . 
 Angie said: “A lot of people have been asking me why I’d bring a dog like Tigger to Scotland but the simple reason is  that he’ll have a chance to live here. 
 

“These kinds of dogs are used to protect homes in Spain.
“But if they’re not wanted then they’re usually just dumped in the middle of nowhere and left to die.
“Sometimes they are even beaten to death.
 
“It’s not like Britain where we love our pets and look after as many as we can. Any that are found alive wandering as strays are taken to ‘kill stations’.
“If they’re not claimed or rescued then they are killed to make room for more.”
Angie, who is also the Scottish manager for Birdline UK Parrot Rescue, said some people find Tigger intimidating but he’s really a “gentle giant”.

She told our sister paper the Dumfries &amp; Galloway Standard: “Standing on his hind legs, he is more than 5ft 9in tall.
“Some people do back off from him because of his size but he’s only interested in cuddles. He doesn’t realise how big he is – he’s just a gentle giant.
“Despite what he’s been through, he’s absolutely fantastic.
“He’s named Tigger because he looks like a tiger due to the striped pattern on his coat but we can’t change the name as he was called that in Spain and he only really responds to that.”
