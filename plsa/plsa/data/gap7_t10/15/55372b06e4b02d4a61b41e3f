A KEY section of the second aircraft carrier is preparing to set sail for Rosyth for assembly.
Upper Block 07 - known as the Forward Island - will be the seat of command for HMS Prince of Wales, the second 65,000 tonne Queen Elizabeth Class carrier, playing home to around 100 vital missions systems compartments.
Construction began on the section in Govan in December 2013 and it is now visible from the west end of Glasgow. A single remote control and 144 wheels drove the 680 tonne section to the dock side at a modest half mile per hour, before being loaded on to a barge. It will leave the Clyde on Friday.
The Forward Island has deck-to-deck windows, which are up to two metres tall to ensure a level of visibility far beyond previous aircraft carriers and are designed to withstand a significant impact, such as a helicopter’s spinning rotor blade.
Mick Ord, managing director at BAE Systems Naval Ships, said: “This is a fantastic milestone for HMS Prince of Wales as its Forward Island is delivered ahead of schedule and to an exceptional standard of engineering.
“It’s a proud day for everyone on the Queen Elizabeth Class aircraft carrier programme and an important reminder of their tremendous dedication and skill in naval engineering.”
The transportation team is spending the next few days making sure the huge section is secure before sailing down the Clyde and around the north coast on a five-day journey to Rosyth.
The Queen Elizabeth Class are the first aircraft carriers to use an innovative twin-island design. The second “Aft Island” operates as an airport control tower to co-ordinate aircraft movements, but both islands are designed with the ability to incorporate the other’s role in an emergency, thus increasing the survivability of the ship, explained BAE.
