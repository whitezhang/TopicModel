Youths who smashed windows on a Glasgow to Edinburgh train are being sought by British Transport Police (BTP).
The 06:00 Queen Street to Waverley service was targeted as it passed an embankment between Croy and Dullatur at about 06:15 on 9 April.
The next train through the location was also struck, but not damaged.
BTP said a group of youths - one of whom was described as wearing a red hooded top - were seen throwing stones at the trains.
Constable Gary Ketterer said: &quot;Throwing anything at a train is not only really stupid it is extremely dangerous. 
&quot;Fortunately no-one was injured but the consequences could have been much worse. 
&quot;I am appealing for anyone who saw the youths in the area at such an early time to get in touch as soon as possible.&quot;
The driver's window and a passenger's window were smashed in the first attack.
