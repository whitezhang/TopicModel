A MASSIVE haul of drugs was discovered at a property in Glasgow yesterday.
Police say they found heroin and amphetamine worth &pound;565,000 at an address in the city’s Maryhill district.
It came after a major police investigation into drug dealing in the area.
Detective Inspector Alasdair Anderson of Greater Glasgow Division said: “This significant recovery clearly demonstrates our determination to crack down on drugs in our communities and it will certainly have an impact on those involved in the further distribution of these drugs.”
“We are dedicated to ridding our communities of drugs and will always act on intelligence received.
“By effectively gathering information and with the continuing help and support from the local community we will keep targeting those involved in serious and organised crime.”
Police said enquiries into the find are continuing and a report will be submitted to the Procurator Fiscal.
Anyone with information on drug dealing is asked to contact police or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
