A SCOTS councillor has voiced his concerns over “glorifying violence” after a clip of school kids fighting went viral online.
 In the video, posted on YouTube this week, two teenage boys punch and kick each other and attract a large crowd of onlookers egging them on. 
One of the youngsters falls to the ground while the other continues to throw punches at his head.
The two of them grapple on the grass before the punching begins again.
 The clip shows the group of teenagers, some of whom are in school uniform, gathered on a grassy area outside an Asda store in Kirkton near Dundee . 
Strathmartine councillor John Alexander, the city’s young persons champion, told the Dundee Evening Telegraph that he was worried by the video and the message it was sending out.
He said: “My biggest concern is that these videos are glorifying these acts — it is almost seen as a sport.&quot;
He stressed the power of social media to influence young people's opinions.
He said: “Parents also have a role to play and they need to be aware of what their kids are involved in.
“It really can be quite devastating for parents to see these videos if their own children are involved.”
