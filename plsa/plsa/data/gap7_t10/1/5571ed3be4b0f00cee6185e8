KEZIA Dugdale has had her knuckles rapped by her own dad following a Twitter attack on the SNP.
 

 
The Scottish Labour deputy leader and  columnist had posted a link to a newspaper article claiming First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was secretly backing the Tories to be re-elected in the general election.
Dugdale wrote on Friday night: “Everyone knew the Tories wanted the SNP to win, but now we know the SNP want the Tories to win.”

But her dad, retired teacher and journalist Jeff Dugdale, hit back on the micro-blogging site saying: “Check facts before opening mouth, Kezia!”
It is not the first time Jeff has criticised his daughter’s party but she said: “I know my dad is very proud of what I do, even if he doesn’t agree with it often.”
