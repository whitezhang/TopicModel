A TEENAGER who killed his foster mother heard a voice in his head telling him to “stab her”, an inquiry has heard.
The boy, who was just 13 at the time, said he felt uncontrollable anger when he repeatedly knifed Dawn McKenzie, 34, in her home.
The boy was placed with Dawn and her husband Bryan in Hamilton in November 2010. He killed her in June the next year.
He was jailed for seven years in 2012 after admitting culpable homicide on the grounds of diminished responsibility.
A fatal accident inquiry heard the boy was interviewed by a doctor and said he had snapped over an argument with Dawn about his internet use and other boys he was mixing with.
Forensic psychologist John Marshall said the boy told him after he told Dawn she couldn’t pick his pals she said she was no longer going to answer him.
The boy said a “heatwave” of anger surged through him when Dawn continued to refuse to talk to him after Bryan left the house.
He said: “I was hearing voices saying ‘stab her’ inside my head. I couldn’t control the voices.”
Dr Marshall concluded the boy, who had a chaotic family background, suffered a temporary detachment from reality known as a dissociative state at the time of the killing.
The inquiry, being held in Motherwell before Sheriff David Bicket, continues.
