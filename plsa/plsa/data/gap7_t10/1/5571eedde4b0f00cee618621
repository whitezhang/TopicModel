A COUNCIL chief has threatened to have kids arrested if they play pranks on their last day at school.
South Ayrshire Council education director Douglas Hutchison has written to the parents of all leavers in the area to warn that kids who get involved in horseplay are “risking their future”.
He said: “In some cases it amounts to criminal damage and may result in charges.”
It’s traditional in some schools for kids to play tricks including throwing flour and eggs and smearing sticky substances on banisters.
But Hutchison’s letter makes it clear he intends to stamp out the “negative and destructive” behaviour.
Our sister paper The Ayrshire Post has seen a copy of the letter.
One sixth-year student at Marr College in Troon said: “Pranks are a light-hearted and harmless way to say goodbye and begin the next chapter in our lives.
“He’s patronising us all.”
Hutchison’s department previously banned the serving of mulled wine to adults at a primary school Christmas fair.
