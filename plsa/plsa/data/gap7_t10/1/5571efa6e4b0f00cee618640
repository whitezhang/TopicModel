SCOTLAND'S new railways operator is giving away &pound;1 million worth of free tickets to mark its launch.
Dutch firm Abellio begins the 10-year Scotrail contract today after taking over from former franchisee FirstGroup.
They said the ticket giveway – available on their website – is a bid to attract new customers and thank old ones.
The firm also wants to boost passenger numbers to 100 million a year by 2018 and plans to spend &pound;370 million on new, longer electric trains for the Glasgow to Edinburgh line.
And a &pound;30-40 million refurbishment of old trains is underway.
 

Jeff Hoogesteger, chief executive officer of Abellio Group, said: &quot;Today begins a new chapter in the long story of Scotland's railways.
&quot;The ball is now very firmly in Abellio's court and we have no higher priority than to bring our vision for ScotRail to life.&quot;
The company is also planning free travel for jobseekers attending up to two interviews a month and one month's free travel when they start work, and a Scottish nationwide smartcard to serve an integrated transport network and make travel easier.
It is also looking forward to the launch of the Borders railway, described as the longest new domestic railway in the UK for more than 100 years.
 

Transport minister Derek Mackay said: &quot;The ScotRail franchise is the single biggest contract let by the Scottish Government so it was important to us that the new operator could deliver not only a reliable and successful rail service for the country but also that it would be an enabler for growth in our economy.
&quot;Abellio has promised to contribute to Scottish public life in many ways beyond the railway, from community and third sector engagement to moving their UK headquarters from London to Glasgow.
&quot;I look forward to seeing Abellio ScotRail become the beating heart of this exciting time for the railways in Scotland.&quot;
