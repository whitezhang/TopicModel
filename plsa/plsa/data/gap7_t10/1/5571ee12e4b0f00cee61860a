THE mother of a troubled teenager who trained an air rifle on police marksmen claimed yesterday she could have disarmed her son.
Community nurse Ruth Barlow, 43, passed the cordoned-off scene where 16-year-old Sam was involved in a stand-off with armed officers.
But unaware that her son was at the centre of the drama, she continued on to find her husband locked in a phone conversation with police negotiators.
The autistic teenager had headed into Lerwick with an air rifle after leaving the family croft at Wester Skeld, Shetland, on September 23.
Ruth said: “If I’d known, I could have done something – I could have taken the gun off him.”
She added that the drama “was like any parent’s worst nightmare”.
Sam was locked up for three years after admitting four assault charges and one of threatening and abusive behaviour.
