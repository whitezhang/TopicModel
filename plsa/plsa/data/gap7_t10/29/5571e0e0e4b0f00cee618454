A SKIP lorry has come off a coastal road and overturned onto rocks.
The vehicle crashed through a roadside barrier at Skelmorlie, North Ayrshire, and ended up just yards from the Firth of Clyde.
It is believed the lorry careered down Eglinton Terrace earlier this afternoon before veering across the A78 just south of Wemyss Bay.
 

All emergency services sped to the scene and the northbound carriage was closed.
It is unknown whether anyone was injured in the crash.
