A RIDING school in Glasgow's South Side is up and running again six years after a lack of funding forced it to shut.Horses are once again at the Linn Park Equestrian Centre and lessons have been organised.The centre re-opened its stable doors in February following months of work spent restoring the derelict site.It is now being run by the charity, New Ark Support and Activity Centre.Discussions are currently being held with the Riding for the Disabled Association (RDA), with the aim of running specialised sessions.John McLaren, centre manager, said that riding lessons due to start soon are filling up fast, and that they hope to take some riders out to competitions.He said: &quot;We're not a posh riding centre that's only for people with a silver spoon in their mouth.&quot;There are opportunities for anyone at a disadvantage, whether it's because of a disability, financial reasons or social reasons, it doesn't matter what background.&quot;Workers at the centre had returned to find the area in a state of disrepair. The wood was rotting, debris had been dumped in the car park, and the hay shed had been used to store salt.Glasgow City Council, which had been in control of the land, performed a swift four day clean-up operation which otherwise could not have been afforded.The biggest expense for the re-opening came in at around &pound;10,000, the result of having to refit electrics which had been cut while the centre was not in operation.Funding for the venture came from managing director Lynn Miller, a full-time foster carer who has taught riding for 25 years.Speaking about Linn's connection with RDA, she said: &quot;We're hoping to get it up and running soon.&quot;We've started taking quite a few classes for the disabled and kids with learning difficulties, but in the mainstream lessons for now.&quot;Those running the centre are considering a bid for lottery funding, now that there are schemes which can be shown as working examples of their intentions.Mr McLaren said the community was key to the project's proposal, and in particular the decision to choose his group over five others who had also been competing for the site.Around 40 people volunteered to help sweep up the rubbish from the fields after the lease had been awarded.Immediate plans for the future include opening a dog-friendly community coffee caf&Atilde;&copy;, in an effort to involve those who may not be interested in horses.The RDA is a UK charity with 500 volunteer groups, which aims to bring riding to people with disabilities in both rural and urban areas.
