Fire crews cut the roof off one of the vehicles to allow one of them men to by taken by air ambulance to Crosshouse Hospital in Kilmarnock.
The other man injured in the crash was treated at the scene and taken to Ayr Hospital as a precaution.
Watch Manager Alan Coughtrie, from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, said: &quot;Our crews worked with hydraulic cutting equipment to remove the roof of the vehicle and while this was ongoing a firefighter was inside the car assisting a paramedic in stabilising the casualty. 
&quot;This was a challenging rescue operation and our crews and the paramedic worked extremely closely - constantly sharing information to ensure the casualty's safety while we created the space needed to free him.&quot;
