GLASGOW has been told to clean up its act over a "silent killer" linked to 300 deaths in the city each year.It was one of 16 cities found to be in breach of EU air pollution limits.In a unanimous ruling, five Supreme Court justices ordered the UK Government to take &quot;immediate action&quot; and produce new air quality plans over illegal levels of nitrogen dioxide.Asthma sufferer Mic Starbuck, from Burnside, Rutherglen, called it a &quot;victory&quot;.The 65-year-old said: &quot;I am one of many hundreds of people at risk.&quot;It got so bad for me five years ago that when I went to visit my GP I got sent to hospital because part of my lung had collapsed.&quot;I'm being looked after now and I'm on medication but this pollution hastens death.&quot;If you were caught out without medication, without your inhaler, or your pen then you would fall unconscious and you would choke to death.&quot;Air pollution has been linked to coronary artery disease, heart attacks and strokes.The outcome marks the end of a five-year legal battle by ClientEarth.Emilia Hanna, Friends of the Earth Scotland campaigner, said: &quot;Air pollution is a 'silent killer' with Government figures showing that over 300 Glaswegians die from exposure to it each year.&quot;It's time for Governments to end this disgraceful death toll.&quot;Last week we told how campaigners were calling for zero tolerance over buses idling at the side of city roads.But bus companies hit back saying they were trying to reduce their carbon footprint.Councillor Alistair Watson, Executive Member for Sustainability at Glasgow City Council, said the ruling showed that central government was the &quot;big policy driver&quot; behind emissions, and called for a shake-up of the bus industry.He said: &quot;We know that the main source of air pollution produced within the city is from road traffic and one of the biggest culprits is buses.&quot;Therefore an action we would like to explore with the Scottish Government is re-regulating buses as without this our ability to make any real improvement is hampered.&quot;A spokesman for the Scottish Government said it would study the Supreme Court judgement.He added: &quot;Although there has been very good progress, we recognise that there is more to be done to deliver further health and environmental benefits where areas of poorer air quality remain.&quot;
