Two people have appeared in court charged with breach of the peace at a country estate in Scotland where Prince Charles was visiting.
Steven Stewart, 38, and Mary McDougall, 23, were arrested on Tuesday at the Dumfries House estate in East Ayrshire.
At Ayr Sheriff Court, they were charged with breach of the peace. Ms McDougall was also charged with possessing an item with a blade or point.
Neither made any plea or declaration and both were remanded in custody.
Prince Charles, known as the Duke of Rothesay in Scotland, opened an education centre at the estate during his visit on Tuesday.
He helped save the estate from closure in his capacity as great steward of Scotland's Dumfries House Trust, heading a consortium of charities and heritage bodies which bought the house and its land in 2007.
The purchase stopped the house, contents and estate from being broken up. 
Dumfries House was opened to the public for the first time in 250 years in summer 2008 and Charles has since been a regular visitor to the estate.
Built between 1754 and 1759, Dumfries House is set in 2,000 acres of land near Cumnock and is acknowledged as one of the most architecturally significant stately homes in the UK.
