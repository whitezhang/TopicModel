A LOYALIST group has been told to change the route of a parade through Glasgow following fears of violence and disorder.&nbsp;The Regimental Blues planned to hold a march through Glasgow's east end and into the city centre on May 9.Organisers from the loyalist pressure group have now been told by the council to change the route, following an objection by Police Scotland who want it to avoid large parts of the east end.Council papers reveal the police &quot;considered there are clear risks that if this procession was allowed to proceed&quot; with the original route. They said there would be a &quot;significant likelihood of public disorder with risks to public safety and extended disruption to the life of the local community&quot;.Officers said the route would pose a high risk of violence and public disorder and that only a major police presence, including riot police, could deal with any potential trouble.Organisers orginally wanted to start their procession on Garnock Street in the Royston area, down Royston Road onto High Street and then Gallowgate before moving onto London Road and finishing in Tullis Street.After a meeting of Glasgow City Council's public processions committee on Monday, the route will now change to start on John Knox Street near Glasgow Cathedral, then move onto Duke Street, High Street, down the Gallowgate before finishing on Tullis Street.A council report said: &quot;Police Scotland have made the following comments about the planned procession on May 9. Should this application be granted, community tensions could rise and the threat of serious disorder and violence is very high.&quot;This would not only impact significantly on the local residential and business community but the general public going about their daily business would also be severely affected.&quot;It is considered there are clear risks that if this procession was allowed to proceed as currently proposed, there would be a significant likelihood of public disorder with risks to public safety and extended disruption to the life of the local community.&quot;Minutes from the committee's decision meeting concluded: &quot;The committee agreed to impose an amended route for the procession on Saturday May 9, 2015 to take place with assembly at 1.15pm and march-off at 1.30pm on the following route: John Knox Street, Duke Street, High Street, Glasgow Cross, Gallowgate, Moir Street, London Road, Olympia Street, James Street, McKeith Street, Main Street, Tullis Street and disperse.&quot;
