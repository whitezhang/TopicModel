George Leighton, 23, from Shotts, North Lanarkshire, was held after the shooting of Darren Higgins in the Parkhead area on 23 January 2014.
His not guilty plea to the attempted murder was accepted, but Leighton admitted possessing a pistol, silencer, ammunition and heroin worth &pound;69,000.
He was jailed for a total of seven years and eight months.

The court heard that his DNA was found on the packaging of some of the items.
