A new service station with a Subway, Greggs and Starbucks – creating more than 50 jobs – has opened at Lomondgate.
The &pound;2m Euro Garages, which also includes a Spar convenience store, opened on Friday.
Ilyas Munshi, commercial director of Euro Garages, said the firm was proud to open its first forecourt development in Scotland at the 1.1-acre site.
He said: “ We’d like to express our thanks to West Dunbartonshire Council and the local community for proactively embracing the inward investment on A82. The location will also serve the many tourists who frequent the area.”
Along with some of the 40,000 motorists passing daily, the station will service the residents of the multi-use Dumbarton development which will feature 338 homes, and a 20-acre business park when complete.
Euro Garages’ area manager Gary Fowler said: “It is in a fantastic location en route to Loch Lomond and en route to the heart of Glasgow.”
Lomondgate has been a buzz of activity lately with a new family fish diner due to open.
Last month, Taylor Wimpey West Scotland and Walker Group submitted a planning application to build 58 family homes.
