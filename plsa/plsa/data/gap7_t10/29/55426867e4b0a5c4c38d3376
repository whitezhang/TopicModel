A teenager will appear in court charged with 120 counts of criminal damage across a city as part of a crackdown on graffiti tagging.Officers tracked the 18-year-old from Bristol - where the tagging allegedly took place - to Dundee in Scotland, more than 400 miles away, where he was arrested.Avon and Somerset Police made a public appeal in relation to the tag &quot;WASH&quot;, said to have been sprayed across the city.Damage was allegedly caused to both public and private buildings and is estimated to cost thousands of pounds to remove.Pc Stuart King, of Avon and Somerset Police, said: &quot;Thanks to a public appeal we put out on our website and through local media, people came forward to report more cases of where this tag had been sprayed.&quot;Although acts of graffiti may not be as serious as some other offences that we investigate it does still have an impact on the victim.&quot;This can be both financial and emotional where we often find that victims feel as though they are being targeted.&quot;The arrest comes after the force worked with partners at Bristol City Council to respond to complaints in areas most blighted by graffiti and damage.Daniella Radice, assistant mayor for neighbourhoods, said: &quot;Graffiti is an issue that a lot of people around the city are concerned about.&quot;We are taking a joint problem solving approach, working closely with the police, and this is clearly working well as we already have someone set to go to court.&quot;We are currently working on a new policy, which aims to make it clear exactly what constitutes graffiti.&quot;As a cultural capital, we support street art where the owner of the building has given permission, but we are keen to see the end to tagging across the city.&quot;
