TEENAGE wheelchair racer Shelby Watson has said a special thank-you to a young fan – by giving her a gold medal.
Shelby, 17, who was born with cerebral palsy, finished first in Sunday’s London Mini Marathon.
And when she collected her winner’s prize from England footballer Andros Townsend, she knew exactly where it was going.
Shelby, of Johnstonebridge, Dumfriesshire, explained: “A while ago, we were fundraising at Tesco and a girl called Lucy Glendinning from Dalbeattie Primary gave me a necklace as a good luck charm.
“I decided there and then that if I won a big race I’d give my medal to her as a thank-you.”
After Shelby, who set a Scottish record for cerebral palsy speed racing, returned home, she was quick to head to Lucy’s school to hand over the prize.
She said: “It was great to go to the school on Monday to see Lucy again. When I gave her my medal her face was priceless – she was so happy.”
Nine-year-old Lucy said she was surprised and delighted to be given the prize.
Shelby is still on a high from her triumph in London.
She said: “I was really nervous before the start but as this was the last time I could compete in the under-17s event I knew I really wanted to go for it.
“It was fantastic to win.”
Shelby is the first person with cerebral palsy to ever win the T33 class, finishing in a time of 15 minutes and 55 seconds.
Her dad Russell said: “It’s such a big thing for Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland and cerebral palsy as well.
“We’ve had so much support from people around Dumfries and Arnold Clark very kindly gave us a car to travel down. It was really appreciated.”
