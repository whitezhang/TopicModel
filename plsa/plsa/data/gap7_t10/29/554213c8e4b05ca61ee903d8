Two people have appeared in court charged with breach of the peace at a country estate which Prince Charles was visiting.Steven Stewart, 38, was charged with breach of the peace while Mary McDougall, 23, was charged with breach of the peace and possessing an item with a blade or point.The pair were arrested on Tuesday at the Dumfries House estate in East Ayrshire.Neither of them made any plea or declaration when they appeared at Ayr Sheriff Court yesterday and both were remanded in custody, the Crown Office said.Charles, known as the Duke of Rothesay in Scotland, opened an education centre at the estate during his visit on Tuesday.Yesterday he tried his hand at badminton and table tennis as well as taking part in a spin class when he returned to officially open a new sports centre.His visit came as royal watchers await the birth of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's second child, with reports suggesting the baby is overdue.The Prince helped save the estate from closure in his capacity as great steward of Scotland's Dumfries House Trust, heading a consortium of charities and heritage bodies which bought the house and its land in 2007.The purchase stopped the house, contents and estate from being broken up. Dumfries House was opened to the public for the first time in 250 years in summer 2008 and Charles has since been a regular visitor to the estate.Built between 1754 and 1759, Dumfries House is set in 2,000 acres of land near Cumnock and is acknowledged as one of the most architecturally significant stately homes in the UK.
