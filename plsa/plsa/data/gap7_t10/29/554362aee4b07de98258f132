 Scotland's new football season will start on 25 July with the first round of the Petrofac Training Cup, with the Premiership beginning the following weekend. 
 The top-flight's opening round of fixtures will coincide with the first round of the League Cup. 
 Scottish Championship, League One and League Two clubs will begin their league campaigns on 8 August. 
 The fixture lists for the league season are expected to be announced in June. 
 Either one or two Scottish League Cup first-round matches scheduled for the weekend of Saturday 1 August might be moved because of the involvement of a Premiership club starting their top-flight campaign at the same time.
