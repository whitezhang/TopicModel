A SEA mine sparked an explosives alert after washing up on the shoreline of an Ayrshire town.
Ardrossan Coastguard Rescue Team were called to the scene at about 3pm yesterday after a member of the public spotted the device.
Police cordoned off the area while investigations were carried out.
The coastguard sent pictures of the device to the bomb disposal team at HMNB Clyde for identification.
Experts confirmed the object was a practice mine used during training exercises and that it did not contain any explosive elements and posed no danger to the public.
It is expected the device will be removed today and coastguard incident tape has been placed around it in the meantime.
A coastguard spokesman said: &quot;If you find a suspicious object on the beach which you believe may be some form or ordnance, don't touch or move it.
&quot;If you are unsure or have any doubts at all then don't take any risks and keep yourself and the people you're with safe.
&quot;Keep your distance and dial 999 and ask for the Coastguard.&quot;
