AN SNP campaign poster in Glasgow has been vandalised with a Nazi swastika.
The billboard, in Govan, features a picture of First Minister and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon with the slogan ‘My vow is to make Scotland stronger at Westminster’. 
Channel 4 reporter Alex Thomson tweeted a picture of the poster, with the caption ‘Defaced poster in Govan - things just got nasty’. 
The vandalism comes just weeks after Labour and Conservative party offices were targeted in Aberdeen, with Nazi symbols and ‘scum’ daubed on windows.
And Police Scotland launched an investigation in July last year after pro-UK slogans and Nazi logos were scrawled on the door to SNP MSP Graeme Dey’s Arbroath office, while a Yes campaign shop in Edinburgh’s South Side was vandalised with swastikas and graffiti reading ‘Nazis’ and ‘No thanks’ in the lead-up to the referendum on Scottish independence last year.
