A CARE home supervisor could be struck off after allegedly calling an elderly woman a “bitch” and telling her, “The quicker you die, the better”.
Lynn Sweeney faces a catalogue of charges over alleged abuse of frail patients at Parkhouse Manor Care Home in Barrhead, near Glasgow, between July 2010 and October 2014.
She will attend a hearing at the Scottish Social Services Council’s headquarters in Dundee next month.
Sweeney is alleged to have carried out psychological, verbal and physical attacks.
It is claimed she dumped one patient’s dinner in a bin and told colleagues, “If anyone asks, I fed him”. The victim couldn’t tell anyone he hadn’t been given food as he couldn’t talk.
It is alleged she hit another patient on the head with a slipper, saying, “I hate that old b*****d”. It is also claimed she said, “I can’t stand that woman, she’s a fat lazy excuse of a woman” while speaking about another.
Sweeney is further alleged to have called an elderly man a “d**k” and restrained him after he mistook the nurses’ station for a toilet. She failed to report the alleged incident – breaching the care home’s own policy.
Sweeney is charged by the SSSC of failing to meet relevant standards practice or provide appropriate levels of care to service users who were not named – to protect their identity.
