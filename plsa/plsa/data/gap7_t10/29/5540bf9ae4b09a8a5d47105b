A Glasgow-based doctor who took photographs of vulnerable patients without their consent has been banned from practising for three years.
Dr Christopher Valentine admitted taking 53 photographs while working with Glasgow's Community Addiction team.
He was reported after showing them to colleagues on a night out. 
Dr Valentine initially claimed the photos, taken between January 2012 and April 2013, were for teaching purposes.
But he admitted at a Medical Practitioners Tribunal in Manchester that there was no clinical reason for taking them.
NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said Dr Valentine was no longer in their employment.
