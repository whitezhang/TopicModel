 SCOTS engineering giant Weir Group has announced 125 job losses in its North American oil and gas business due to the plummeting price of oil . 
The move is part of cost-cutting measures by the Glasgow-based company, which makes valves and pumps for the energy and mining industries.
It said oil and gas orders fell 23 per cent in the first quarter.
The job cuts are part of a bid to deliver cost savings of &pound;10million.
Chief executive Keith Cochrane said: “While mining markets remained subdued, the performance of the minerals division once again demonstrated its resilience.
“Trading conditions in oil and gas markets were challenging through the quarter, with a steeper decline in the North American rig count than the market had anticipated.
“Oil and gas activity levels are still falling and we expect a further decline in divisional revenues in the second quarter. In response, the group is taking further actions to support profitability, including additional workforce reductions and service centre consolidations.”
