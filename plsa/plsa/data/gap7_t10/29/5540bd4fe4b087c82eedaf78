A GLASGOW family have turned to Facebook in a bid to identify the bus driver who saved their dad’s life.
Shelley Montague posted an appeal on the social networking site after her father collapsed while running for a bus in Sighthill.
A bus driver reportedly started CPR until an ambulance arrived, potentially saving his life.
She wrote: “We’re hoping the power of Facebook can help us find the person who saved our dads life.
On Saturday morning, 25th April he was running for the 6:10am, number 57 bus at the Calder vaults, Sighthill across from the St Rollox tesco. 
“He collapsed and his heart stopped and we’ve been told the bus driver(s) started CPR and continued that until the ambulance came. 
“We’d really like to find the people who were there helping him in order to thank them... If you could share this post and help us, we’d be very grateful!”
The appeal has attracted attention on Facebook, being shared over 200 times, and has also spread to Twitter, with Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson appealing for Twitter to ‘do its thing’ and help the Montague family identify the bus driver who helped their father.
It is thought that the driver is likely to be employed by First Bus and based at the Caledonia Depot on Cathcart Road.
Are you the First Bus driver who helped Mr Montague, or do you know who he / she is?
