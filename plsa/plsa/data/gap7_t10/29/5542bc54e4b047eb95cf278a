STUDENTS performed a silent dance routine in tribute to Glasgow's Royal Concert Hall steps.They designed the routine - called The Last Steps You Take - in response to Glasgow City Council's plans to demolish the popular public space.Passers-by stopped to watch the dramatic dance on Thursday, performed by students dressed in black outfits and wearing red gloves.The steps are to be flattened as part of a &pound;400million extension to Buchanan Galleries.In February members of the city council planning committee voted 11 to four to allow the demolition to go ahead.It came despite a 14,000 name petition calling for the steps to be saved.The Buchanan Galleries extension, which will be built on the site of the existing shopping centre car park, will provide three floors of shops, a food court floor, a 10-screen cinema on the top level, and create 1500 new jobs.The concrete stairs leading to the Concert Hall will be demolished and replaced with a four-storey-tall glass rotunda.Campaigners have vowed to keep trying to save the steps and several protests have been held since the planning decision.
