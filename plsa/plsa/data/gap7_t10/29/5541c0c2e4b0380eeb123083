EVENING Times sports writer Chris Jack has won a prestigious journalism prize.Chris, 25, became one of the youngest people to win the Jim Rodger Memorial Award after impressing judges with two exclusive Evening Times articles.The award was set up in 1997 to honour the late veteran journalist Jim Rodger and is supported by newspapers and the Journalists' Charity, formerly known as the Newspaper Press Fund.Sports journalists aged 35 and under working on a Scottish daily, Sunday or evening paper are eligible to enter.Chris is one of the youngest to win the award in its 18 year history.The first of his two winning articles was an exclusive on Partick Thistle coach Scott Allison who has founded a charity called ClubWorld Sports to help players who have &quot;fallen out of the game but not out of love with it&quot; get back on their feet.The judging panel said the article carefully examined how players were being helped after the final whistle blows.One judge said: &quot;It is easy to forget that not everyone in football is a household name and what happens to players after the spotlight is turned off made for a great read.&quot;It was an interesting subject to write about telling us something we simply did not know.&quot;Chris' second article was an in depth analysis of the rows of empty stadium seats which have plagued Rangers games and illustrated the crisis at the club.Judges said the article reminded Evening Times readers that fans are the lifeblood of any football club.Malcolm Speed, chairman of the judges, said: &quot;Chris Jack is a worthy winner indeed and was the stand-out entry from this year's field.&quot;He is undoubtedly a credit to the Evening Times.&quot;Chris said: &quot;I am delighted to win the prestigious Jim Rodger Memorial Award this year.&quot;It is an honour to be recognised for my work in the Evening Times and to be one of the youngest winners to receive the award.&quot;I am part of an excellent team on the sports desk and I thank them for their help and support.&quot;The accolade comes with a cheque for &pound;1000 and the Jim Rodger Memorial Trophy.
