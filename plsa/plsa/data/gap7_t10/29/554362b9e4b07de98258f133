 St Mirren midfielder John McGinn is struggling to play again this season after the training ground accident involving captain Steven Thompson. 
 And the 20-year-old could have played his last game for the relegation-threatened club as he is out of contract this summer. 
 Thompson threw a spiked pole that pierced McGinn's thigh. 
 Following a scan, St Mirren have confirmed that he will miss &quot;the next few SPFL Premiership matches&quot;. 
 The Buddies, who are seven points adrift of Motherwell at the bottom of the table and could be relegated this weekend, have four games remaining. 
 Manager Gary Teale told his club website: &quot;It is obviously a blow to lose John for the next few weeks. 
 &quot;But we don't want to rush him back and we need to make sure that his rehabilitation is conducted in the correct manner to ensure he makes a full recovery as soon as possible and can enjoy a few weeks off prior to pre-season training.&quot; 
 Striker Thompson has admitted he was &quot;mortified&quot; to have injured the Scotland Under-21 international. 
 Glasgow-born McGinn is a product of the St Mirren youth system and has already made 97 appearances for the club, 33 this season. 
 If Motherwell win their home game at home to Ross County on Saturday, St Mirren will be relegated if they fail to defeat Partick Thistle in Glasgow.
