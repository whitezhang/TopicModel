The spokesman added: &quot;The loss of life through fire is always a tragedy that impacts many people across a community and our thoughts are very much with the woman's family and friends.
&quot;While we cannot comment on the specific circumstances surrounding this incident, any death through fire must prompt us all to consider fire safety and take steps to reduce any risks to ourselves and those around us.&quot;
