THE family of a doting father, who died after collapsing during a football game, have told his young son “Daddy has gone to heaven”.
Now Kenneth Parry’s devastated wife Isobel and parents Bobby and Moira face further agony as they wait to discover when the former Clyde and Albion Rovers player can be laid to rest.
Kenneth, of Wishaw, Lanarkshire, took ill on the field during an over-35s match last Friday. He was rushed to Glasgow Royal Infirmary but doctors were unable to save him.
 The 39-year-old is survived by Isobel, 31, and their two sons, Logan, six, and two-year-old Millar, as well  as his parents and younger brother Scott. 
Bobby, 68, explained how Isobel was left with the task of explaining to Logan what had happened to his dad.
He said: “She told him that Kenneth was in heaven now. He thought about it for a while then said, ‘Maybe we could find a wishing well to bring daddy back’.”
Kenneth had spent the afternoon before the match with his mum and dad and other family members.
Bobby said: “He was in fine form – cracking jokes with everyone. He waved cheerio to us at 5pm and at 7.15 we got a phone call from one of the guys on his team to say he had collapsed during the match.”
Moira, 66, added: “We were in total shock.”
The family have also been left to cope with a delay in Kenneth’s body being released for burial.
Bobby said that a review of family medical history is to be carried out before the procurator fiscal decides whether to hold a post mortem.
He added: “It’s heartbreaking. All of this delays the grieving process for Isobel and the family.”
