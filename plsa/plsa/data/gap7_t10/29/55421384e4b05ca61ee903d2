A blazing row has erupted between two Glasgow restaurateurs ... over a pig.Bosses of restaurant chain The Butterfly and The Pig hit out at the new owners of their former West End restaurant site for using their name and pig logo on its front.Owner Michele Pagliocca closed the vintage-style eatery on Partick Bridge Street in January this year.It was then taken over by Oran Mor owner Colin Beattie who has opened it up as the 'Pop-up Pig', alluding to its former incarnation.Mr Pagliocca is livid at the signage and branding the pub tycoon is using, claiming it is misleading customers and &quot;piggy-backing&quot; on his brand.Michele said: &quot;We are extremely disappointed the owners of the Pop-up Pig have chosen to mislead customers by falsely advertising itself as part of [the chain].&quot;We have tried to contact the owners to ask that they remove all reference to The Butterfly and the Pig brand, however this has been unsuccessful and the matter is now with our lawyers.&quot;Since opening The Butterfly and the Pig in 2005 we are proud to have developed a strong, honest brand based on delivering high quality food and live entertainment.&quot;That someone is so blatantly trying to &quot;piggy back&quot; on our success is not only insulting, it is deliberately confusing to many loyal customers familiar with our brand.&quot;We encourage [customers] to visit either our Bath Street or Pollokshaws Road venues, and stay clear of what we can only describe as an imposter in the west of the city.&quot;The chain also published warnings about the new venue on their social media page, warning customers it was not operated by them.But Mr Beattie hit back, branding the restaurateur a &quot;skunk&quot; and accused Mr Pagliocca of leaving the place in a state of severe disrepair.Mr Beattie said: &quot;The previous craft beer sign is still up as well, which Michele left up there when he took it over.&quot;The keys were handed back on the January 12 to me, and the place had been vandalised completely.&quot;The Oran Mor owner said that flooring had been taken out, ventilation systems were missing and internal brewer's pipes had been chopped back to the wall when he took the venue over.He said he has spent &pound;50,000 revamping the venue and added: &quot;When it comes to the name I have to have a laugh about it. There's hundreds of pubs up and down the country including the name 'pig' so there's no issue with that. The Pop-up Pig is a modern take on pop-up pub.&quot;We're quite entitled to call it anything we want and I will be calling it that.&quot;
