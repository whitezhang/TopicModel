A CANNABIS farm worth nearly &pound;65,000 was found during a police raid on a kid’s play centre.
Officers recovered cannabis plants from a loft space at the Tiki Tots children’s centre in Nile Grove, Morningside, Edinburgh.
Police executed a warrant at the premises on Tuesday and discovered the drug haul.
The centre features soft play for babies and toddlers.
Police Scotland said they were “currently pursuing a positive line of enquiry to find those responsible for the cultivation”.
Detective Inspector Paul Grainger said: “This building was regularly occupied by young children and their parents who were completely unaware of the cannabis which was being grown within.
“Acting upon intelligence, we executed a search of the premises and made a sizeable drugs recovery.
“Our engagement with the public provides us with invaluable information and by working together we have ensured the safety of local parents and their children, as well as the wider community which these drugs were destined for.”
