A MUM was subjected to a vicious and terrifying attack which left her temporarily blind as she walked in a wood with her young son.
She was grabbed from behind by a man who then pulled her to the ground and sprayed her in the face with a glue-like substance.
The appalling attack took place in Livingston at around 2.15pm on Monday.
The 45-year-old victim had been walking in the wooded area near Almond Court and Stevenson Court with her son and two dogs. She was rushed to St John’s Hospital in the town.
Police say they are hunting a man with a Glasgow accent in connection with the brutal attack.
PC Stuart Ritchie said: “This was a traumatic incident for the victim and her family and we are pursuing all possible lines of enquiry to find the perpetrator.
”We have recovered the offending item and are appealing for anyone who saw the incident, or any suspicious behaviour in the area at the time of the incident, to come forward.
“Likewise, if you know who this man is, please help us keep people safe and get in touch.”
It is thought the woman should make a full recovery.
