A MASKED gang jumped out a car and attacked a man on the street with a meat cleaver.
The 29-year-old male victim was left with injuries to his wrist and shin after being jumped by the four men who then ran off.
A resident in the Dundee street where the incident happened, said: “At about 10.30pm we heard a scream from a woman, so we automatically went to the window to see what was going on.
“Across the road we saw a woman being chased up the street by three men in balaclavas.
“Straight after that another man at the same close was chased by another man in a balaclava.
“All four men had weapons on them.
“One man in a balaclava had a meat cleaver in his hand and stabbed the man he was chasing at the top of the street.”
The attack victim was taken to the city’s Ninewells Hospital for treatment.
A police spokesman said: “There was a scuffle and a bladed weapon was used.
“His injuries were not life-threatening.
“No arrests have been made and inquiries are ongoing.”
