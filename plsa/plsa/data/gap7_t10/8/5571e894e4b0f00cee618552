A Glasgow man has been tested for ebola after returning from west Africa.
He was taken to the Brownlee Centre for infectious diseases at the cityâ€™s Gartnavel Hospital around 2.30am this morning, after showing possible symptoms of the potentially deadly virus.
NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde confirmed the man has been tested and said results were expected at some point on Tuesday morning.
An NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde spokesman said: &quot;A man has been admitted to hospital this morning and is being tested for Ebola. He had come from Liberia.&quot;
He said it is thought &quot;very unlikely&quot; that the man has Ebola.
