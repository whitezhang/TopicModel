Mesh implant victims have launched a website to offer support to fellow sufferers and women considering the op.
Scottish Mesh Survivors’ Hear Our Voice campaign led to controversial mesh procedures being suspended.
But they fear new NHS information leaflets on the ops won’t give women enough advice.
The group also believe a number of doctors still support use of the operation, which has left hundreds of women in pain.
Elaine Holmes , 50, from Newton Mearns, was left crippled following a mesh op.
She said: “We launched the patient-based website because while we welcome the new information leaflets, we believe women still need further advice to be made available.
“That extra bit of info could be vital if they are seeing a surgeon who is pro-mesh.”
The move comes as the Scottish Government await a safety review because of the high number of injuries suffered by women being treated for pelvic organ prolapse and bladder problems.
