MINDLESS bigots daubed a swastika and anti-Islamic graffiti on the wall of a new Sikh Central Gurdwara.
Police are investigating the vandalism at the place of worship near the Mitchell Library in Glasgow.
And politicians and religious leaders yesterday slammed those responsible.
 Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy said: “There is no place for this type of stupid and sickening  offensive behaviour. 
“The Sikh community is an important part of modern Scotland and it is shameful that this iconic building should be targeted.”
The graffiti was found two weeks ago and the Gurdwara decided to publicise the incident after a community meeting.
Surjit Singh Chowdhary, vice-president of Central Gurdwara Singh Sabha, said: “The Sikh community completely abhors the hateful ideology of Islamophobia. We are in shock that such disgraceful words were put on the walls of this great Gurdwara.
“The Sikh community’s gift to Glasgow has been commandeered as a platform for the hateful messages which do not belong in our country.”
 
 

The &pound;15million Central Gurdwara, in the city’s Berkeley Street, is due to open in the summer. Police believe the vandalism took place on March 23 or 24.
Chief Inspector Simon Midgely urged anyone with information about the incident to come forward.
He added: “There is no room in our society for racial abuse and it is not acceptable to treat people in such a manner.
“I have no doubt that this incident caused individuals considerable distress.
“I would like to thank the Gurdwara who contacted police to report the matter, indicating that people in Scotland will not tolerate racism.”
