THE devastated wife of a motorcyclist killed on his way to work has today spoken of her loss.
 John “Jocky” Ogston, 54, died following a crash with a car on the A947 Turriff to King Edward in Aberdeenshire at 7.44am on Thursday. 
The accident, near Plaidy, saw the road closed for several hours at crash investigators examined the scene. Police have appealed for any witnesses.
Aberdeen-born John, who lived in Banff, was riding his prized Victory motorcycle to work at Fisher Offshore in Oldmeldrum.
 

Today John’s wife Lesley said: “Jocky was born in his leathers, and motorcycles have been a huge part of his life since he was 16 years of age.
“He loved his current job at Fisher Offshore in Oldmeldrum and helped out in the evenings at my bakery in Whitehills.
“The whole family is absolutely devastated at the loss of Oor Jocky who had a big heart and forced everyone around him not to take life too seriously.
“His many friends and family will know what a great loss to the world he will be but he will be in our hearts and minds forever.”
Road Policing Inspector Ewan Innes said: “Both vehicles were travelling south on the A947 and we are appealing for anyone who may have seen the vehicles prior to the collision to speak to us.
“Our thoughts are with the family and friends of the man who has died and a full collision investigation will be carried out to establish the circumstances.”
Anyone with information who hasn’t already spoken to police is asked to contact Police Scotland on 101.
