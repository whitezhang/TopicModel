PROSECUTORS probing the deaths of four people during an outbreak of Legionnaires disease have announced no-one will be charged.
The Crown Office said, despite a long-running investigation following the outbreak in Edinburgh in 2012, they have been unable to find the source of the crisis.
A decision has still to be made on whether a Fatal Accident Inquiry will be held.
Gary Aitken, Head of the Health and Safety Division of the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service said: &quot;Following a complex and thorough investigation which involved detailed genetic analysis we can only conclude that there is no scientific basis for any prosecution related to the deaths and as a result no criminal proceedings are instructed by Crown Counsel.
“This was always going to be a difficult and complex investigation due to the number of potential sources in the Gorgie area but we continued on in the hope that the necessary scientific evidence would come to light. Unfortunately that hasn’t happened.
“We will now consult further with the families before making any decision in relation to a Fatal Accident Inquiry.”
Three men and one woman, aged between 47 and 65, died during the crisis which also saw 92 people infected with the disease.
Hundreds more became ill after breathing in the bacteria.
It is believed to have started in the Gorgie area of the capital, and investigations centred around two firms - the North British Distillery and pharmaceutical company Macfarlan Smith.
 

Both were served with improvement notices in relation to cooling towers which can be a source of the legionella bacteria.
