A FORMER boxer who claimed a botched operation robbed him of his manhood has died.
Tributes have been paid to David Porter, 42, after he was found dead at his flat in Aberdeen.
Adam Smith, secretary and treasurer of Aberdeen Amateur Boxing Club, said: “It came as quite a shock as I had spoken to him just a week before I heard the bad news.
“He was one of the best boxers in Scotland and took home a few trophies in his time.”
A police investigation has been launched into the cause of death after David’s body was discovered last week.
The former oil and gas industry worker had to stop coaching amateur boxers after being treated for multiple health problems.
Last June, David claimed a botched operation to remove his appendix and repair a hernia at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary had damaged his bladder and testicles.
He was given hormone therapy to boost testosterone levels but claimed the effect was so severe he started producing the female hormone oestrogen.
It’s understood David had spent the last four years struggling with his medical problems, resulting in a number of trips to the hospital.
Adam added: “Before he fell ill he was always out and about seeing his friends and he will be dearly missed.
“He was popular at the club and always made time to box with the children who come here.”
