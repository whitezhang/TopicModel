A MAN had his girlfriend sitting on his lap when his car killed a pensioner then ploughed into his caravan.
Nathaniel Cooper, 30, faces jail after being found guilty of causing death by dangerous driving.
He was teaching Kylie Johnston how to drive when they lost control of his Daihatsu Terios and crashed at East Balthangie campsite in Aberdeenshire.
The 4x4 ploughed into the side of Andrew MacKay’s static caravan and knocked him down.
Cooper, of Inverbervie, was yesterday found guilty after a five day trial at the High Court in Aberdeen.
His ex-partner Johnston, 26, pleaded guilty in January.
Yesterday, Lord Stewart told the jury that they had helped make legal history because it was the first case of its kind in the UK.
He said: “The word tragedy is rather too frequently used but this case seems to be a real tragedy.”
 

Dad-of-two Cooper had Johnston, of Stonehaven, on his knee as he showed her how to steer and work the pedals.
Giving evidence, 4ft 11in Johnston said she could only reach the pedals when she slid down the seat. She said: “I’ve never driven in my life so it was scary for me. I didn’t know what to do.”
She said she was relying on Cooper to operate them.
Johnston claimed Cooper grabbed the steering wheel after the car veered too close to the campsite toilet block and said the car went out of control.
The 4x4 accelerated, hit a fence then struck Andrew, 65. His partner Mary Dobbin, 58, from Dumbarton, was trapped inside their holiday home.
Lord Stewart deferred sentence until May 8 for reports.
