RESEARCHERS are to investigate why common dolphin sightings off western Scotland have almost doubled.
Hebridean Whale and Dolphin Trust monitoring teams said encounters off the Hebrides are up 68 per cent over the last 12 years.
But the reasons for the rise are still unclear – and they need volunteers to help in their research.
Common dolphins come to the Hebrides in spring to take advantage of seasonal food stocks, sometimes forming “super-pods” of thousands of individuals.
The species – smaller than the resident bottlenose dolphins – were once rare in the Hebrides’ cold waters.
But climate change is causing sea temperatures in the Hebrides to rise by about 0.5C a decade.
Warmer water species appear to be colonising new areas further north or closer to shore, the trust said.
The trust want volunteers to join their research vessel Silurian to help with visual surveys, acoustic monitoring and identification of dolphins, whales and porpoises.
Kerry Froud, the trust’s biodiversity officer, said: “Our research expeditions depend on volunteers. In return, they offer the chance of a lifetime to contribute to a better understanding of cetaceans and basking sharks, while enjoying the scenery and experiencing exhilarating sailing.”
