AN OAP who suffers from elephantitis is hoping to travel abroad for surgery to end his swollen-limbs hell.
Michael Cull, 66, struggles with a leg that weighs four stone but wants to undergo an operation in India which involves compressing his limb and removing tissue and skin.
Mr Cull, of Rosehearty, Aberdeenshire, told the Sunday Post: “It will probably leave my leg like a patchwork quilt and, cosmetically, it will look quite ugly.
“But at least it will get rid of about two-and-a-half stone to put it in proportion with my other leg.”
Elephantitis was said to have affected Joseph Merrick - who became famous in the 19th century as the Elephant Man.
