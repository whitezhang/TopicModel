A SCOTS designer hand-picked by the Queen to oversee renovations at the Palace of Holyroodhouse has died in a cycling accident in London.
Moira Gemmill, 55, who grew up in Kintyre on the west coast, was cycling to work at another royal residence, St James’s Palace, on Thursday when she was struck by a lorry.
She started working there in January in a specially-created role as director of capital programmes at the Royal Collection Trust.
The job also involved spearheading the modernisation of the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh and Windsor Castle.
Jonathan Marsden, director of the Royal Collection Trust, said: “We are deeply saddened and shocked by this tragic news.
“In her very short time with us, Moira had become both a good friend and a highly-respected colleague and we shall miss her very greatly.”
As well as having designed for the Queen, Moira – who studied graphic design and photography at the Glasgow School of Art – was a major figure in the art world and a former director of design at the Victoria and Albert Museum.
Sir Mark Jones, the museum’s former director, said she was “a really exceptional person” and her death was “a terrible loss”.
He added: “She was one of the brightest and best people in the world of art and design, much-liked and respected by all the many architects and designers she worked with and loved by her colleagues and friends in the V&amp;A and elsewhere.”
The Royal Collection Trust was established by the Queen to manage the royal family’s art collection, much of which is on display in royal palaces.
Meanwhile, the lorry driver was questioned by police following the accident but was not arrested.
