THE family of a schoolboy who died from horrific burns have welcomed a report which criticises Police Scotland over the handling of the aftermath of the tragedy.
Seven-year-old Preston Flores died after petrol which he and friends had been playing with ignited, after they took it from an allegedly unlocked council van in Aberdeen, last April.
Preston’s family later hit out over the way they had been dealt with by police following his death, concerns which the Sunday Post reports have been partially upheld by an official police complaints investigation.
It highlights a number of failings centred on family liason, and admits the force failed to ensure council workers had thoroughly cleaned the pavement where Preston had been burned, distressing his family who claimed to have later found fragments of his skin and clothes.
The Sunday Post reports that Police Scotland did not accept every aspect of the complaints report, but did admit there were “several areas” where the force”did not get it right”.
Preston’s father, Keith Will, 33, told the paper: “At least we now have an apology from the police. It is a step forward.”
