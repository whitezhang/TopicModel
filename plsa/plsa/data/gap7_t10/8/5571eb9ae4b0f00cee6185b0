LISA HAGUE and Jay Beatty are joining forces to raise cash for the Lola Commons Fund for SiMBA, which aids the families of babies who have died, been stillborn or miscarried.
Lisa, fiancee of Celtic star Kris Commons, and Jay, who won the SPFL Goal of the Month award after scoring a penalty at half-time in a Hoops match, will be in opposing dug-outs for a charity match next month.

Lisa and Kris lost their baby daughter Lola Grace Commons seven years ago.
Opening her heart to the Record two years ago Lisa, now 30, said: “It’s the worst thing you could ever go through.”
She signed up to be a special ambassador for Scots charity SiMBA, who help families that have suffered the loss of a baby.
Jay, 11, has Down’s Syndrome and is well-known to fans of Celtic and other clubs after appearing on the pitch during the Parkhead side’s matches.

 
The youngster, from Northern Ireland, and Lisa will be opposing managers for the May 31 event at the Donald Dewar Centre in Drumchapel, which is affiliated with Drumchapel United FC.
A poster for the event, posted on Twitter shows pictures of Lisa and Jay, saying “Forget Mayweather v Pacquiao, it’s Team Hague v Team Wee Jay.”
