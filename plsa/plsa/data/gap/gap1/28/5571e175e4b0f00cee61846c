FOUR week-old kittens have been abandoned in a rubbish bag and left to die.
The tiny kittens were found by a member of the public who was walking in the Bathgate hills on Friday.
The bag was also full of wet and dirty towels.
They are now being cared for by the Scottish SPCA at their welfare centre in Edinburgh. Although they were not hurt, they are too young to be away from their mother.
Inspector Jenni Surgeon said: &quot;The kittens are around a week old and were found in a bin bag which was full of wet, dirty towels.
&quot;They are far too young to be away from their mum but despite this they are in okay condition.
&quot;We are very concerned for the welfare of their mother. There is a chance she has died but if not she will be extremely distressed at having her kittens taken away from her so soon.
She added: &quot;The kittens are now receiving round the clock care from one of our staff members, which involves them being syringe fed throughout the night. Once they are old enough we will be looking to find them loving new homes.
&quot;This was an extremely cruel act and if the kittens hadn't been discovered they would have died.&quot;
Anyone who has information about who dumped the kittens is asked to contact the charity on 03000 999 999.
