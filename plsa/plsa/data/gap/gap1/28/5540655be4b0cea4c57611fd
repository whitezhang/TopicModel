A GROUP of 20 MPs and electoral officials from around the Commonwealth will be spending next week in Glasgow to monitor voting.
Representatives from Canada, the Cook Islands, Rwanda and Ghana will observe the general election in Glasgow East from May 3 to 8, watching everything from the opening of polling stations, through voting to the closing and counting.
They will also meet the candidates, returning officers, local officials, community groups and others to assess how the election has taken place and the “environment in which it will take place”, said a statement.
Glasgow East is projected in polls to switch from Labour to the SNP along with much of Scotland.
This is part of a multilateral election assessment mission (EAM) in six sample constituencies in the UK.
After polling day, the mission will issue a preliminary statement and then a detailed report with recommendations for improving future UK elections.
The 2010 report by the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association UK, which is organising the EAM, highlighted postal voting processes and the responsibility for the “head of household” to register the entire household. This has since been reformed by the Electoral Commission.
