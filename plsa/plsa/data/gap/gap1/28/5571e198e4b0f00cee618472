A PLANE carrying dozens of passengers to Edinburgh carried out a dramatic u-turn over the North Sea this morning.
The KLM flight, which left Amsterdam's Schipol airport shortly before 7am, was approaching the UK near Leeds when it declared an emergency.
The flight was due to land in Edinburgh shortly after 8am.
Aviation watchers said it was a 'mystery' why the flight was circling back to Amsterdam when its destination airport was closer.
The pilot sent out the standard 7700 emergency code.
It is understood to be a technical fault.
