DOUGHNUT giant Krispy Kreme is to open a store in Glasgow. 
The firm, founded by Vernon Rudolph in North Carolina in 1937, already has outlets at Edinburgh’s Hermiston Gait and in Livingston.
But Glasgow is set to get its own branch next door to the Braehead shopping centre, and plans have been lodged with Renfrewshire Council’s planning committee covering various alterations to the existing building.
The former Clydebuilt Scottish Maritime Museum, which shut down in 2010 due to a shortage in funding, has been earmarked as the potential location.
As far back as 2011, Krispy Kreme were reported to be interested in opening a branch in Glasgow, but the first Scottish store opened at Hermiston Gait on February 13th 2013, causing tailbacks on the M8 motorway.
And one Krispy Kreme fan even camped outside and queued for nearly 24 hours to be the first in line at the new outlet.
Judith Denby, Krispy Kreme UK’s Chief Marketing Officer, said: “We are excited to say that we are a step closer to bringing Krispy Kreme to Glasgow.
“Following the fantastic response we received for our openings in Edinburgh and Livingston, we have been actively looking at sites for a store in Glasgow and have now found a possible location.
“Details are yet to be confirmed and we’ll reveal information on location and opening plans as soon as we can.”
