WINTRY weather is set to return to Scotland as cold Arctic air ends a warmer spell.
The North East of the country has already experienced cooler temperatures over the past few days, and now the Met Office is warning the cold weather will continue in to May, vastly reducing the chances of a sunny bank holiday.
Met Office spokeswoman Nicola Maxey said: “The weather has started to change and it is coming from the Arctic.
“We have had a long stretch of quite settled weather where high pressure has dominated, but that has moved out. This cold air has moved in from the Arctic and that is moving slowly south.”
Drivers have also been warned to prepare for potentially treacherous conditions as Scotland is expected to bear the brunt of the Arctic blast before it sweeps across northern England, Wales and the east coast.
Simon Williams, a spokesman for the RAC, said: “It’s very easy at this time of year for motorists to feel that wintry conditions have gone for good, but you can be easily caught out by some very changeable conditions.
“Our advice is to simply plan ahead and prepare for adverse conditions with the temperature set to drop this week, leading to more wintry conditions in some parts.
“With the possibility of ice on the roads in parts of the UK, it is also important to leave more time for journeys and drive to the conditions to avoid the possibility of an accident.”
