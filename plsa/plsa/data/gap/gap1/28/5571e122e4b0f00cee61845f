MEMBERS of the public are invited to attend the funeral of a tragic baby found dead on a city path almost two years ago.
The remains of the six-week-old baby boy were discovered on an old railway path in the Seafield area of Edinburgh in July 2013.
Despite extensive investigations and door-to-door inquiries, the baby's mother was never traced.
 

The funeral for the baby will take place at Seafield Cemetery on Friday May 1 at 10am.
It is thought that the infant's body could have lain on the secluded path for up to a month.
A notice thought to have been printed in the Scotsman newspaper read: &quot;With deep sadness, the little baby boy who was found wrapped in his blanket on the walkway/cycle path at Restalrig, Seafield, Edinburgh, will be laid to rest at Seafield Cemetery on Friday May 1, 2015 at 10 am, to which all will be warmly welcomed to come along and pay their respects to this little baby boy.&quot;
Speaking at the time of the discovery of the baby's body, Detective Chief Inspector David McLaren said: &quot;Examinations on the remains have confirmed that the remains are those of a newborn baby boy who may have been up to six weeks old.
&quot;At this time our priority is to trace the mother of the child, who is likely to be in need of medical and emotional support. I want to reassure her that we have her best interests at heart and encourage her to make contact with us.&quot;
