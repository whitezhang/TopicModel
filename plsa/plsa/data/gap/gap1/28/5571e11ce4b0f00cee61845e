A CARER who killed his frail “uncle” after a row over gambling was jailed for 52 months yesterday.
Chef Andrew Harvey, 34, battered gambling addict Christopher Gilruth, 53, to death after hearing he had lost all the money put aside to pay their electricity bill.
Harvey, who was Christopher’s carer, left his victim with 33 injuries to his face, head and body by punching. Police found remorseful Harvey trying to give Christopher CPR in the flat they shared in Murrayfield, Edinburgh, last May.
Harvey, who had been charged with murder, admitted the reduced charge of culpable homicide.
He and Christopher referred to each other as “nephew” and “uncle” although they were not related.
Christopher had serious health problems and had emphysema, the High Court in Glasgow heard.
Jim Keegan QC, prosecuting, said health issues made Christopher “more likely to succumb to injuries that would not prove fatal in a healthy adult”.
Brian McConnachie QC, defending, said: “There had been an argument over money. Mr Gilruth had gambled away money that was for the electricity bill.”
Judge Lady Wolffe told Harvey: “Your victim was physically frail and to an extent dependent on you. I accept you are grief-ridden.”
She cut his sentence from six years and six months for his early plea.
