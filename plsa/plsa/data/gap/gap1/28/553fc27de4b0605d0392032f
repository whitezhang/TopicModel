A special underpass for newts is being planned as part of proposals for a major housing development in North Lanarkshire. 
Banks Property said the underpass would run under a new proposed link road for a 1,040-home development in Glenboig.
The great crested newts would be relocated during the construction phase and then reintroduced to a nearby nature reserve.
Banks said its plans would help boost the protected species' numbers.
The Hamilton-based developer said it had been granted a Great Crested Newt Development Licence by Scottish Natural Heritage following a detailed application.
Banks Property director Colin Anderson said: &quot;Being awarded this important licence is testament to our development with care approach at Banks Property. 
&quot;We are pleased to be doing our bit to safeguard such an important pocket of rare wildlife, including manual investigations of construction routes as well as developing long-term mitigation measures and habitat compensation. 
&quot;What is particularly pleasing is that rather than suffer a loss of habitat, the great crested newt population could continue to grow with the development of habitat and long term management.&quot;
The amphibian is protected under UK and European laws, having been subject to significant habitat loss since World War Two. 
If approved, the Glenboig development would represent a &pound;200m investment. According to Banks, it would help create an estimated 700 jobs.
