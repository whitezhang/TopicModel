SIR ALEX FERGUSON has pledged to return to Glasgow to unveil a statue to rent strike leader Mary Barbour.
The football legend made the vow as he officially handed over &pound;5000 towards a permanent monument to the World War I housewife who fought for vulnerable tenants.
 On a whistle-stop trip to his home city to pay tribute to fellow Govanite Mary, Fergie praised the Sunday Mail coverage for  championing calls for a statue. 
He said: “There’s real inspiration in Mary Barbour’s story and it’s great the Sunday Mail has been supporting the campaign.
“She reminds of me my own mother and my granny – strong women whose job it was to provide for their families.
“If we can get a statue of her at Govan Cross, I’d be delighted to come along and unveil it.”

The Remember Mary Barbour Association need to raise at least &pound;80,000 for a statue to mark 100 years since the mum’s most famous victory.
In 1915, Mary led a 20,000-strong march on George Square. The grassroots revolt against greedy landlords who upped rents while men were away at war brought about a change in UK law. Fergie wished he’d been around to see it.
He added: “It’s like watching a football match. I always want the wee man to win.”
