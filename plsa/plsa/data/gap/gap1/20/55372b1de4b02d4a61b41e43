IT was always only matter of time before The Vamps became one of the biggest pop bands in the country, but launching their tour with a two-night run at The Hydro is still some feat.
A very modern spin on the well-worn boyband formula, the four lads all write their own songs and play not only their own instruments, but each other's too.
They set their still out early with tracks like Wild Heart and Hurricane, big soaring pop numbers shot through with a melodic rocked-up edge. The crowd went predictably ballistic from the moment The Vamps hit the stage, with all four members seeming to have an equal share of the fans.
Their own songs were more than capable of holding their own, but a covers medley really cranked things up, with muscular runs through hits like Uptown Funk, Shake It Off and Seven Nation Army whipping up the crowd even more.
Drummer Tristan Evans came over like a more family friendly Tommy Lee as he fired out an impressive solo on his kit while lifted 50 feet in the air, while frontman Bradley Simpson's talent was in no doubt as he shone on guitar, drums and piano at various points of the night.
 

It was on the more full-on tracks that The Vamps really shone though. Lovestruck, Girls On TV and a raucous cover of MCR's Teenagers all perfectly suited their energetic charm, while Oh Cecelia feature led backing vocals by 13,000 voices who we're loving every minute.
The encore began with Bradley alone at a grand piano for a sparse Risk It All, before he was joined by his mates as the track turned into a towering epic, but they topped it with Can We Dance, an irresistible slice of Summery pop that sums up everything that's good about this lot.
The Vamps have most definitely arrived and on the strength of this show, they're here to stay.
