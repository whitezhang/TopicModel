 A SICK thief has nicked a Hearts strip from tragic soldier Shaun Cole ’s memorial shrine. 
The top was placed outside Shaun’s house in Edinburgh with dozens of other tributes after the 22-year-old was killed in Miami, Florida.
But his friend Jamie Lothian has now been forced to issue an appeal on social media for its return.
Jamie Lothian, who was with Shaun on his Miami trip, wrote: “If anyone can find out who stole the Hearts top from outside Shaun’s house give me a name please and get it back.”
 It’s believed the top was taken at some time between Thursday – the day of Shaun’s funeral with full military honours – and Saturday morning, when it was noticed it was missing. 

Shaun, who served in Afghanistan and helped Ebola victims in Sierra Leone, was found dead in the street while visiting Miami for a music festival.
Police are investigating his death amid fears he was the victim of a hit-and-run.
