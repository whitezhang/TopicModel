STAR Wars will return to cinema screens across the world in December – but it’s arrived in Glasgow already.
That’s if you believe these expertly manipulated images by designer and Star Wars fan Mark Boyle, whose doctored photos show the Millenium Falcon swooping over the Barrowlands and an AT-AT walker wandering past Glasgow Cathedral.
Other pictures show the Imperial Shuttle by the Clyde, and a Star Destroyer ship over Buchanan Galleries.
