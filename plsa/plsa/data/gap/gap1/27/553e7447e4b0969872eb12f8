Take That fans heading to the SSE Hydro tonight will 'Never Forget' seeing this car on the road.For its proud owner Julie McFarlane, from Eyemouth, has designed her entire car around the band's official logo.The 47-year-old, who is known to friends and family as Mrs Take That, has a private registration number featuring the band's logo on the Ford B max.Her brake lights also flash the Take That sign while her bodywork features the logo.And if that is not enough, she has members Gary Barlow, Howard Donald and Mark Owen pictures on a rear screen window tint with a special tribute to the departed Jason Orange and Robbie Williams underneath.Julie said: &quot;It all started a few years ago when I asked my husband if I could get my brake light to say Take That.&quot;And it has just went from there as this is my third Take That car.&quot;The mother-of four, who has followed the band since the early 90s, admits the car attracts attention wherever she goes.She said: &quot;People locally know it is me but everywhere else folk always stop to get their photo taken with my car.&quot;I met Mark Owen a few years ago when he was doing a solo gig and he signed a photo of the car. He told me how much he liked it.&quot;Mark isn't the only member of the band to spot the car as Gary Barlow retweeted Julie's tweet of the car hours before he is due to take to the stage at the SSE Hydro tonight.Counting Rule The World and Never Forget as her favourite tracks, Julie has travelled the UK countless times to see the band, followed the boys' solo tours and she already has two pairs tickets secured for their current tour which kicks off in Glasgow tonight.She said: &quot;Even if they split up. I would keep it going. I followed the boys in the 90s, was devastated when Robbie left and I was in pieces when they split.&quot;But I followed them all individually and even if they split again I will always be Mrs Take That.&quot;
