NURSERY youngsters spent two years building their inner city garden...for it to be trashed in just hours.Tots from Whitecraigs Nursery worked with artists at Glasgow's Wasp Studios to create special stained glass for their garden gazebo.Now mindless vandals have smashed the glass and ransacked the Dennistoun outdoor space, returning a second night to do even more damage.Headteacher Lesley Morrison is appealing for local people to help track down the culprits - and stop more damage being done.She said: &quot;This nursery is seen as a asset to the community. For example, we spent time growing Alpine plants on the roofs of our Portacabins so that the flats opposite would have something nice to look down on.&quot;We very much felt that the neighbourhood was looking out for us and we have never had any trouble before now, which I have always been very proud of.&quot;We hope that they are still looking out for our nursery and will help track down whoever is responsible for this damage.&quot;The nursery moved to its temporary site, behind Whitehill Secondary School, in 2010 and Mrs Morrison was given &pound;10,000 Awards for All cash to develop an outdoor learning space.Harry Potter was the children's favourite book at the time and so teachers turned a garden gazebo into Hagrid's House, named after the famous character.The hut is used for all sorts of activities, such as acting as Santa's post office at Christmas, and has been turned into a planetarium.But the children wanted to make it extra special and so, with &pound;4000 more funding from Awards for All, youngsters designed stained glass panels for the structure.Mrs Morrison added: &quot;Our pupils worked very hard on this. They drew what they wanted their glass panels to look like then four at a time took it in turns to go along to the glass studios to spend half an hour talking with the artists about their designs.&quot;It took about two years from start to finish and is very important to the children - now it has been ruined.&quot;We also have a garden full of glass bottles from people drinking outdoors.&quot;Youngsters are now not able to go out in the garden as the nursery must wait for a specialist team to come and check there is no glass remaining.Instead, they are walked over to Whitehill Secondary to play and have outdoor lessons.Mrs Morrison said: &quot;Summer is fast approaching and, although we are a 52 week nursery, the children move to a different location during the holidays.&quot;We're really worried that worse will happen than the vandalism that has already occurred.&quot;I'm not sure how people can be so thoughtless. Someone must know who is responsible and we hope they take that information to the police.&quot;Councillor Stephen Curran, executive member for education and young people, also hit out at the vandals. He said: &quot;These people should be ashamed of themselves.&quot;The children are devastated and we will not be able to replace this wonderful window the children helped to design.&quot;Anyone with any information on these mindless vandals should contact their local police station.&quot;
