A man has appeared in court charged with attempted murder after a baby girl suffered a serious head injury. 
The three-month-old was taken by ambulance from a house in Kilmarnock, East Ayrshire, to the town's Crosshouse Hospital early on Sunday morning. 
She was later transferred to Yorkhill Hospital in Glasgow where her condition was described as serious but stable. 
Andrew Morrison, 24, of Kilmarnock, made no plea nor declaration and was remanded in custody.
Mr Morrison appeared in private at Kilmarnock Sheriff Court on Thursday.
