A woman has admitted passing &pound;55,000 of cash which she stole from her employer through the books of the Rangers Supporters' Association Boys Club.
Margaret Stewart, 47, embezzled the money from the Canadian firm Ivanhoe Cambridge, which owned Glasgow's St Enoch Centre, over a three-year period.
She used her position as treasurer at the boys club to pay cheques into its account before taking the cash herself.
Sentence on Stewart was deferred and her bail was continued.
Glasgow Sheriff Court heard that Stewart, from Hamilton, South Lanarkshire, worked in the accounts department of Ivanhoe Cambridge UK, which sold the St Enoch Centre in 2013.
Between May 2008 and January 2011 she had managers at the firm sign cheques that were supposed to be used to make legitimate payments.
Stewart would then write over the payee name and insert the football team's name. 
The money would then go to the club before Stewart took it for herself. 
She was caught after a bank spotted a problem with one of the cheques from Ivanhoe Cambridge and phoned her office. 
Stewart then immediately confessed to her superiors and a payment plan was put in place for her to repay the money. 
The court heard that although more than &pound;5,000 was repaid, the plan was not completed and her house was put on the market.
The house was rendered worthless due to Japanese Knotweed, and Stewart was later reported to police.
Stewart pleaded guilty to a charge of embezzling the money.
The Rangers Supporters' Association Boys Club was founded in 1960 for boys between five and 17-years-old. 
Former players include Barry Ferguson, Lee McCulloch, Graham Dorrans and Charlie Miller.
