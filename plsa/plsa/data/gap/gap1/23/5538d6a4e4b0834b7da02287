The minister who will take over as moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland next month has told how he had to withdraw from taking on the role two years ago. 
The Reverend Dr Angus Morrison was diagnosed with prostate cancer weeks before the assembly in 2013.
He was the first Moderator-Designate in history to withdraw from the role. 
Having now returned to fitness, Dr Morrison will step into the moderator role at next month's general assembly. 
In an interview in May's edition of Church of Scotland magazine Life and Work, Dr Morrison expressed regret that he had not consulted doctors sooner.
He said: &quot;I am a man who is very slow to go to the doctor with anything and I would just encourage anyone with worries about the same sort of thing to go as soon as possible and have it checked it. It can be easily treated. The important thing is to have it treated in good time.&quot;
Dr Morrison said withdrawing from the role as the church's ambassador had not been an easy decision but he was confident it was the right move. 
&quot;It all happens for a reason,&quot; he said. 
&quot;It is clear to me, looking back that John (the Rt Rev John Chalmers, who stepped in to take up the role last April) was well prepared and well equipped to address the issues that were prominent during his year. I see God's hand in all of that.&quot;
Dr Morrison, who was born in Glencoe in 1953, was brought up moving between Oban, Stromness and Edinburgh.
His current ministry is to the parish of Orwell and Portmoak, near Kinross.
He will be the first moderator since 1969 to be a Gaelic speaker.
