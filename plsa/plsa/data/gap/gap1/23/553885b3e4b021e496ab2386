A SCHOOL which has operated in the city for 156 years has upset its neighbours over plans for a new sports hall.St Aloysius' College opened in Bridgeton in 1859 but move to Garnethill seven years later where it has been based ever since.The Jesuit school has 1500 staff and students aged between three and 18 but does not have enough indoor sports facilities.It has shared use of the assembly hall and indoor training facilities at Millerston which staff say are limited, distant and time consuming to access.As a result, the school has drawn up plans for a new sports complex on a site next to Glasgow School of Art's new Shona Reid Building and opposite the historic Charles Rennie Mackintosh building.But the move resulted in 21 letters of objection questioning the need for the new building and raising fears about loss of residential amenity and increased traffic and congestion.A report to the city council planning committee said the lack of sports accommodation was a major issue for the school.It added: &quot;Availability of sports accommodation on the Garnethill campus will avoid the need to travel and the time gained will make it possible for certain students to take additional subjects.&quot;Opposition to the proposal seems to have originated partly from the lack of consultation with the Garnethill community but the application proposal is classed as a local development where there is no statutory requirement for pre-application consultation.&quot;There also appears to be an underlying issue generally with the impact of new developments within the Garnethill area where residents have experienced periods of disruption in terms of traffic flow and construction noise and activities.&quot;While this is understandable, it is not the role of the planning process to prevent new development on this basis.&quot;Furthermore, the operation of St Aloysius' College itself evidently impacts on part of the Garnethill community to which it is closest and has resulted in tensions, particularly in relation to traffic movements, congestion and car parking.&quot;The college has been an integral pat of the Garnethill community for 155 years, however some residents feel its more recent popularity and related expansion has challenged the residential character of the area.&quot;Again, these tensions are understandable, however it should also be appreciated that while Garnethill is a residential area, it contains a variety of other existing uses and is located within a thriving city centre location where traffic, construction work and a certain degree of noise are to be expected.&quot;Although the hours of operation of the new sports centre will be from 8am until 9pm Monday to Friday and from 9am until 2pm on Saturdays, the report says it will mainly be used by pupils during the normal school day.Members of the city council planning committee decided to give the new sports complex the go-ahead.
