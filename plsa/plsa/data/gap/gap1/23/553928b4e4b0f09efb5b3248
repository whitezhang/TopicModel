CALMAC is backing a campaign to have one of its ferries produced as a Lego model.
A fan has built a version of the MV Loch Shira, which operates between Largs and the island of Cumbrae, from Lego bricks.
It has been entered in a contest to have the design considered for production by Lego.
The model, by Lego Ideas website user “Lukeebee1”, has attracted some 340 supporters so far and needs 10,000 by next April to be in contention.
CalMac head of marine Guy Dale-Smith said: “We are absolutely thrilled a member of the public has developed and nominated this great model of a CalMac ferry.
“Our ferries and the CalMac brand are iconic sights the length and breadth of Scotland’s west coast and we are really excited to see whether we can build on the enthusiasm of this nomination and get the blocks in place for MV Loch Shira to be on the shelves.
“That would be a ferry impressive achievement for all our friends and fans.”
The model is based on CalMac’s 54-metre-long ferry, which can carry 250 passengers and 36 cars.
The Cumbrae route was CalMac’s second busiest last year with 706,000 passengers.
New ScotRail operator Abellio commissioned a Lego model of one of its trains, which was given to guests at the launch of the franchise in Stirling on 1 April.
A 9ft Lego model of the Forth Road Bridge containing 10,000 bricks was commissioned by the Forth Estuary Transport Authority to mark the crossing’s 50th birthday and went on display at the National Museum of Scotland last August.
