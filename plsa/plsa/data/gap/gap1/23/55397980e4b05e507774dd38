TRAGIC Karen Buckley left a nightclub without her jacket after she had given it to a friend, according to reports.
Police had been trying to figure out why the 24-year-old student, who went missing on a night out with pals, had left Sanctuary club in Glasgow without her coat.
She was last seen alive outside the Dumbarton Road nightspot at 1am on April 12.
Pictures taken on the night showed Karen – from Ireland – wearing a leather jacket over her outfit.
But it has emerged that kind-hearted Karen gave a friend her jacket because a zip in the other girl’s dress was broken, according to newspapers in Ireland.
A judge sparked outrage earlier this week after claiming the occupational therapy student “put herself in a vulnerable position”.
Speaking at Worcester Magistrates Court last Friday, District Judge Nigel Cadbury said: “I find it incredible that young people can get so drunk that they don’t even know who they’re with.
“One only has to think about the horrible situation in Glasgow to see how serious this could have been.”

It comes less than a week after Miss Buckley disappeared in the early hours of April 12 sparking a huge police search.
Her body was discovered at High Craigton Farm on the outskirts of Glasgow on April 16.
Karen’s friends have told police she had a few drinks but was not drunk.
Alexander Pacteau, 21, has appeared in court charged with her murder and attempting to defeat the ends of justice.
Pacteau, from Glasgow, made no plea or declaration and was remanded in custody by sheriff Charles McFarlane QC for a further hearing later this month.
Services have been held in Miss Buckley’s home town of Cork and a vigil in George Square last week attracted 300 people.
