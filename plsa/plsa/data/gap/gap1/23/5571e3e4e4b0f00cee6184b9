A MASSIVE blaze at a primary school in Coatbridge this morning was started deliberately, council chiefs believe.
The fire at Drumpark Primary's old site on Albert Street caused a massive column of black smoke to rise up across North Lanarkshire.
In August 2012, kids and staff moved to a new campus, which they share with Greenhill Primary School.
The building was scheduled for demolition and it has been confirmed that there is a presence of asbestos.
It is thought the fire broke out at around 6.30am but the exact cause is not yet known. Crews from Ayrshire and Glasgow attended the scene.
A spokesman for North Lanarkshire Council, said: &quot;The fire has now been extinguished. However, Scottish Fire and Rescue Service remain on site and are dousing the area affected.
&quot;The fire has caused extensive structural damage to the building.
&quot;We have demolition contractors on standby and will begin work to bring down the remainder of the building as soon as they have permission to access the site.
&quot;We believe the fire was started deliberately and would urge anyone with information to contact the police.&quot;
A statement from the Scottish Fire and Rescue service (SFRS) read: &quot;Initial crews from Coatbridge attended within seven minutes and were faced with a well-developed fire.
&quot;The Incident Commander quickly requested additional appliances from Dreghorn, Cowcaddens, Easterhouse and Springburn fire stations to attend. The school, scheduled for demolition is severely damaged by the fire.
&quot;Crews wearing breathing apparatus are currently fighting the fire with two hose-reel jets. There have been no injuries reported and firefighters will remain at the scene for some time.
&quot;It has been confirmed that asbestos is present in the building and local residents are advised to keep windows and doors closed.
&quot;A joint-investigation will be carried out by the SFRS and Police Scotland investigation teams to determine the cause.&quot;
