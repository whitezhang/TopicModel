POLICE are probing the “unexplained” death of a woman found inside a house.
The body of the 37-year-old - who has not been named - was discovered in a terraced home in Baxter’s Neuk, Tranent, East Lothian.
Officers were called to the address at 5.50am this morning.
Neighbours said two women and their two Staffordshire bull terriers had lived in the house for the past few months.
Although her death is being treated as unexplained, it is not thought to be suspicious.
Droplets of blood could be seen for about 20 yards on a path leading up to the house.
It is the second tragedy to hit the street in recent months. Residents said a man in his 30s died in the house next door in January. It is understood his death was not suspicious.
A neighbour said: “I just knew the women living there to say hello to. They’ve not been here for long.
“The police were here in the morning and stayed until about 1pm. I saw a police van, two officers in uniform and another in plainclothes. Then a private ambulance came to take away the body.”
A police spokesman said: “Police are currently treating her death as unexplained and enquiries are ongoing to establish the full set of circumstances.
“A report has been sent to the procurator fiscal.”
