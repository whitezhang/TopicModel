A 70-year-old man is to stand trial accused of trying to kill his daughter. 
Alexander Mowat is alleged to have choked Jennifer Mowat, causing her to be knocked out, at his home in Newton Mearns, East Renfrewshire, last August. 
He is also charged with committing a breach of the peace and two allegations of behaving in a threatening manner. 
During an appearance at the High Court in Glasgow, Mr Mowat denied the charges against him. Judge Lord Turnbull set a trial due to start in September.
