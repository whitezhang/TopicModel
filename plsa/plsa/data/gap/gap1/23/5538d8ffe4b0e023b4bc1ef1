THE Old Firm will play their youth cup final behind closed doors after trouble erupted at previous games.Rangers and Celtic will meet in the Glasgow Cup Final at Hampden Park on Tuesday at 7pm.The under-17 game will be played without the general public in the ground, although Glasgow FA bosses have decided to allow in a small number of children from local schools.In 2013, trouble flared at the final , which was the first meeting of the Old Firm since Rangers were plunged into financial crisis and relegated to the Third Division.The kick-off was delayed after flares and smoke bombs were set off and seats ripped up in the stands.Fans were also reported to have invaded the pitch at the match, which was attended by around 6500 supporters.The disgraceful scenes led to a series of arrests as police reviewed CCTV in a bid to find the thugs behind the trouble.Last year, more than 8000 people were at the match, and the event was again marred by disorder.But supporters will still be able to watch the match on Rangers and Celtic's television channels, after the decision was made to broadcast the game live.
