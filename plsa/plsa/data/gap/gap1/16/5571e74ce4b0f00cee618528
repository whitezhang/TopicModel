THE grandson of a Gallipoli hero will lead Scotland’s commemorations marking the 100th anniversary of the bloody campaign.
Ian Domingo’s grandfather Richard was one of more than 200,000 allied soldiers killed in the fighting.
 Former soldier Ian will spearhead an event at Edinburgh Castle on April 25 to remember the fallen. 
 The 66-year-old, of Dumfries , said: “I’ve thought of the grandfather I never met,  more so over the last few years, especially as we near the 100th anniversary of his death.” 
 Ian, who served for 22 years in the King’s Own Scottish Borderers, will be joined  at the commemorations by Lieutenant Colonel Andy Middlemiss, 67, who was in the Army for 33 years. 
 

 
Andy’s grandfather George fought and survived Gallipoli. He died in 1934.
The commemoration service at the Scottish National War Memorial inside the castle walls will be beamed on to a screen at the esplanade.
 Kevin Gray, of Legion Scotland, said: “ The Gallipoli campaign had a huge impact on Scotland and it’s important we are able to give up our time to remember those who never returned home, or returned with the scars of war.” 
The disastrous campaign took place between April 1915 and January 1916 on the Gallipoli peninsula near istanbul.
