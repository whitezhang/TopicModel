A BIN lorry driver who was “out cold” at the wheel as his runaway vehicle ploughed through a row of gardens had been deemed fit to drive.
Residents watched in horror as the 21-tonne truck careered down the street and tore through hedges before stopping yards from their homes.
 The shocking scenes were a chilling echo of the bin lorry tragedy in Glasgow last year, when six Christmas shoppers were killed after driver Harry Clark also fell unconscious at  the wheel. 
On Tuesday, a Glasgow City Council lorry swerved into gardens in Croftside Avenue, in the city’s King’s Park area, at around 11am. The driver was taken to hospital after the crash but no one else was injured.
 The council said the driver would have undergone strict health checks like all staff who drive heavy goods vehicles. A spokesman explained: “Health checks are set out in law. We apply the rules as set by the DVLA and we are not in a  position to change those rules. 
“We cannot reveal personal details about the driver, however all of our HGV drivers are fully compliant with DVLA rules.”
Tenant Kerry Callaghan, 26, was yards from the crash but managed to sleep through it.
She first became aware of the dramatic scenes outside her home when she saw images on social media. Kerry was asleep in her flat on Croftside Avenue when the driver fell ill and his lorry smashed into her garden.
 She believes the driver’s colleagues leapt into the cab  and pulled the handbrake. Kerry said: “I slept right through the whole thing. I saw pictures of our house on social media and then a police officer knocked on the door and said, ‘Look outside’. 
 “I couldn’t believe it. My first thought was, ‘I hope the driver  is okay’. It’s so lucky no one  was injured. 
“The only damage is to our hedge – what a lucky escape.”
