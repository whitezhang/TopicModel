SEVEN years on from the death of murdered businesswoman Moira Jones her friends and family are determined not to forget her.This year, a generous couple who live in the same village as Moira's mum, Bea, will take part in a 300-mile cycle to raise cash for the charity founded in her name.Stephen Stone and his wife Donna will set off from Queen's Park, where Moira was killed, on the anniversary of her death.They plan to cycle the 296 miles down the A8 to Weston, in Staffordshire, where Bea will be waiting to welcome them home.Stephen said: &quot;We are really just hobby cyclists, not club cyclists - we go out cycling on Saturday mornings and cycle at the gym - but when we learned about Moira and her mother Bea we we wanted to help the charity.&quot;How could we not?&quot;Moira, 40, was brutally raped and murdered in Queen's Park after being abducted just yards from her home in May 2008.Bea, 73, set up The Moira Fund to give support to other families who have lost a loved one to manslaughter or murder.Postwoman Donna first met Bea when delivering her mail in Weston and became determined to help raise cash for the charity.She and Steve will set off from Queen's Park on Friday, May 29, at 6am and arrive on Weston Village Green on the evening of May 30 - covering nearly 300 miles in less than two days.Steve added: &quot;We've been doing plenty of training - lots of cardiac work and endurance training - but we'll have to see how it goes on the day and what the weather's like. Hopefully no wind or rain.&quot;Donna and I cycled from Land's End to John O'Groats a few years ago but did it in 11 days so this is much harder than anything we've ever done before.&quot;Bea, whose son lives near to Queen's Park, added: &quot;It's just a wonderful thing for them to do, we're so grateful.&quot;We plan to be in Glasgow to wave them off and then to get back to Weston so that we can be part of the welcoming committee to cheer them home.&quot;They'll really deserve a good reception.&quot;The Moira Fund has former Lord Advocate Elish Angiolini, who prosecuted Moira's Slovakian killer Marek Harcar, as patron.Harcar was jailed for 25 years in 2009 after being found guilty of raping, robbing and killing Moira.Stephen said: &quot;Bea is a wonderful woman and we're happy to be helping The Moira Fund. You can tell she is still struggling with it, with what happened, but she is very courageous.To donate to the Moira Fund and support Stephen and Donna on their cycling challenge see www.mydonate.bt.com/events/anniversarycycleride/218006
