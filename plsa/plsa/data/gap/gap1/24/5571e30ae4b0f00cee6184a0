Fourteen police cars ended up chasing one stolen vehicle through the streets of a city... before the two thiefs escaped on foot.
The late-night dash unfurled after officers recognised the stolen Vauxhall Corsa going through Dundee.
But after the chase along the city’s streets around Midnight on Tuesday, the two men inside the car managed to abandon it and run away.
Eyewitness Danny Clifford, 38, said he couldn’t believe how many police cars were chasing it.
He said: “It was like something out of the Grand Theft Auto video game.
“I saw two police cars following with flashing lights and I wondered what was going on.
“Then I saw another police car going past and then another.
“In total, I counted at least 14 police cars including two 4x4s and a police van, which is a ridiculous amount.
“I was gobsmacked. I’ve never seen anything like it in Dundee before and this is normally a quiet area. With all of the police involved, I’m amazed that they didn’t manage to catch them.”
A Police Scotland spokeswoman said: “Police Scotland responded after reports that a stolen Vauxhall Corsa was seen at Forfar Road, Dundee at 11.45pm on Tuesday April 22.
“The car had been stolen from Granton Terrace. A short pursuit took place and the car was abandoned at the St Mary’s area of Dundee. Two men were seen to make off on foot.
“At no time were any members of the public at risk and officers are continuing with inquiries to trace the two men. Anyone with any information is asked to contact Police Scotland on 101.”
