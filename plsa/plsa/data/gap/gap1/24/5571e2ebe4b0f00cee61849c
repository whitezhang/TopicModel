LEADING Labour politician Anas Sarwar has become the latest victim of a sickening death threat.
Police are investigating after a chilling message left on the answering machine of the former Scottish Labour deputy leader warned he would be shot.
Sarwar, who is standing to regain the Glasgow Central seat in next month’s Westminster election, was a prominent voice for the Better Together campaign to keep Scotland in the UK.
The foul-mouthed 12-second message was left on the answering machine of Sarwar’s Glasgow office between April 8 and April 10.

A male with a west coast of Scotland accent says: “You dirty f*****g scummy b*****d. I hope you f*****g rot in hell because I’ll come down with a f*****g bullet and put it in you. You f*****g .... you sell your soul for a bit of money. You cowardly b*****d.”
A fault in the answering machine meant it was not possible to determine the precise time the message was left.
Sources told the Record the police investigation has hit a wall because the caller managed to mask where he was calling from.

Scottish Labour Deputy Leader Kezia Dugdale​ said: “These types of threats have no place in our society.
“No-one, politician or otherwise, should have to face threats of violence. What has it come to when people seeking to be part of the democratic process face threats of this nature?
“Anas Sarwar has a family who will rightly be concerned and staff who should, at all times, be able to go to work without fear of violence.
“In the face of threats we have to stand together and unite in our condemnation of this vile and disgusting behaviour. Anas Sarwar is a popular local figure and this sort of threat will not deter him.”
A source close to Sarwar added: “Anas Sarwar will not be deterred or put off by this vile and disgusting threat. He will always stand up to bullies who seek to threaten and intimidate and will never stop campaigning for Labour values and for Glasgow.”
The incident is the latest in a long line of disturbing threats targeted towards prominent Scottish politicians in recent months.
Both Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon received death threats during the independence referendum campaign, with several incidents being taken to court.
And the Record revealed earlier this month that Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy’s election agent was threatened by a Yes support with an electric saw on the campaign trail.
Paul O’Kane was told: “If you come over here, I am going to cut your f*****g head off.”
A Police Scotland spokeswoman said inquiries into the Sarwar incident were ongoing.
