A controversial plan to charge visitors to Glasgow Cathedral has been suspended following a public backlash.
Historic Scotland, which looks after the medieval building, was considering introducing charges of up to &pound;5 this year to help with maintenance.
The plan was opposed by hundreds of people who signed an online petition.
Historic Scotland said it had suspended the proposal and was now exploring other ways to meet the annual running costs of more than &pound;500,000.
A spokesman for Historic Scotland said: &quot;Following months of positive discussions with the cathedral community about alternative means of raising funds to invest in the building, we have decided to suspend plans to introduce admission charges to Glasgow Cathedral. 
&quot;Incidentally, this would only have applied to visitors and would not have affected worshippers. 
&quot;The costs of running the building are, however, considerable - in excess of &pound;500,000 a year - which the Church currently makes no contribution to, unlike other places of worship across the country. 
&quot;We are currently in advanced discussions with the cathedral community about what fair contribution could be made, specifically to cover some of the costs of the pastoral use of the building.&quot;
