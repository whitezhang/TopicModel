He was a dedicated servant of the Labour movement and was a radical finance minister in the last Scottish Labour government.&quot;First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: ''Tom had an impressive record of public service as an MSP and as a minister in the first post-devolution administration.''He was someone who was widely liked across the political divide and will be remembered as such across Scottish politics.&quot;My thoughts are with his wife and family.''Many Labour politicians took to Twitter to offer their condolences and praise Mr McCabe's contribution.
