A 12-YEAR-OLD boy was bombarded with online requests for sex by a beast sitting a few feet away in a public library.
Sam Roan repeatedly tried to convince the child to go outside Leith Library in Edinburgh and engage in a sex act.
The twisted 21-year-old targeted the boy – who was on a computer looking at Facebook – after signing himself up as one of the youngster’s “friends”.
Roan used a nearby computer to send his victim the sick messages. The pervert – who described himself on Facebook as a former volunteer library worker – admitted grooming the kid on February 18 when he appeared from custody at Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
Roan took charge of the boy’s terminal to sign himself up as his Facebook friend before starting an online chat.
Roan wrote to the victim that he had “done stuff with a guy”.
The schoolboy asked, “What stuff?” and Roan responded, “Don’t find me disgusting for this but sexual stuff.”
Roan added: “Do you want me to show you or tell you? Why don’t I show you? We can go round the back and I’ll only show you if you want me to.”
 The scared youngster wrote back: “I’m not gay. I’m going  out with someone and she’s really hot.” 
Roan replied: “It’s not gay if I do it to you. If you don’t like it, I will stop.” The victim repeatedly told Roan “No” and finally wrote in block capitals: “I don’t want to go outside, so stop asking.”
Roan asked the youngster not to tell anyone but the boy informed a librarian, who called police.
Sheriff Frank Crowe said Roan, a former catering and hospitality student, had admitted a “very serious charge”. He called for reports before sentencing him next month.
Roan, described as a prisoner, was also placed him on the sex offenders’ register, banned from entering public libraries or internet facilities in the city and possessing an internet-enabled device without police approval.
