THIEVES rammed a post office four times with a stolen car before making off with only cigarettes and scratchcards.
A gang of eight men are thought to be behind the attack which is the fourth robbery in less than a decade at Blackford Post Office in Edinburgh.
CCTV shows a black Range Rover being reversed into the shutters at speed until it smashes a window at around 3.20am on Tuesday morning.
The hooded men then ran into the shop to grab the cigarettes and scratchcards and smashed a till off the wall.
Owner Mahmood Hassan said he’s been left with between &pound;15,000 and &pound;20,000 of damage.
And he said it was “a matter of guesswork” how much cash had been taken.
 

He said: “We have got some CCTV footage – there are seven or eight people crammed into the Range Rover. They came out one by one. I don’t know where to start with cleaning this up.
“The damage and inconvenience is the worst thing; I am gutted.
“We have sustained four robberies since coming here.
“Two have been ram-raided, two have been break-ins through the roof.”
 

Local councillor and former police officer, Cameron Rose, said: “It’s just demoralising for somebody trying to provide a service to the public.”
A police spokeswoman said: “Police are appealing for witnesses following a break-in to the post office on Blackford Avenue around 3.20am this morning where a black 4x4 was used to enter the premises.”
The incident comes after a series of ram-raid style attacks on businesses in Musselburgh last month.
