CATS are weird, and they do what they like. Anyone who lives with one knows that.
But this little guy might just have taken kitty  craziness to a new level.
Seven-month-old Purdie goes out at night and nicks things – gloves, dishcloths and diving gear. And they have to be in pairs.
Owner Fiona Campbell-Smith, of Oban, Argyll , said: “He’s brought home eight things in the last month and they are all pairs.
“It’s always under cover of darkness. He comes leaping through the cat flap with  his trophies, purring.
“A knitted glove appeared and I thought somebody had dropped it in the  house. Then the second one turned up.
“He brought two  dishcloths in, and one  diving glove, then one diving sock. Then he came through the door with the other diving glove and on the  next night he came back with the second sock.”
Fiona hasn’t a clue where Purdie is stealing from and she’s hanging on to his hoard in case anyone claims it.
She said: “I’d like to  apologise to the owner – diving equipment is quite expensive.”
Purdie’s not sorry though. He’s delighted.
