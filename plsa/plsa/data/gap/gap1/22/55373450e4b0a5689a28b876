The Scottish Liberal Democrats' launched their manifesto promising a "decade of opportunity".Party leader, Willie Rennie, set out six key priorities and said LibDems stood on their &quot;record of progress&quot; in government.Raising the tax free personal allowance to &pound;12,500, investing an extra &pound;800 million in the Scottish NHS budget and delivering more powers for the Scottish Parliament were the main features on the manifesto front page.Mr Rennie also highlighted commitments to extending free childcare to all two-year-olds in Scotland by 2020 and on Scottish LibDems helping to pass five new green laws.He argued the party's manifesto was deliverable due to their commitment to borrow less than a Labour government and cut less than a Conservative government.Mr Rennie said: &quot;In just five years we have got the economy back on track and done so fairly. We are now closer to our ambition of creating opportunity for everyone.&quot;These are Liberal Democrat ambitions because they build a stronger economy and a fairer society, in a stronger Scotland. It is a positive offer to create a decade of opportunity for everyone in our country.&quot;
