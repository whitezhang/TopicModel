Ex Rangers skipper Colin Hendry has been banned from the road after dropping his fight against a drink-driving charge.
 The former Scotland captain was almost twice the drink-drive limit when he was pulled over driving a blue Ford Focus in Lytham, Lancashire. 
Hendry, 49, had previously argued the reading didn't tally with the amount of alcohol he had consumed on the night of February 20 - arguing his unusual metabolism might be behind the reading.
But he withdrew his case for a 'special reasons' hearing at Blackpool Magistrates Court and was handed the driving ban. He provided a reading of 63 micrograms per 100 millilitres of breath - the legal limit in England is 35 micrograms.
 

Magistrates also fined him &pound;110 and ordered to him pay &pound;200 prosecution costs and a victim surcharge of &pound;20.
 The troubled star, who played 51 times for Scotland , was hit by tragedy in 2009 when his wife Denise died following botched cosmetic surgery. 
The 43-year-old died from meningitis after a routine liposuction operation went wrong - triggering an agonising seven-year battle with illness.
The iconic defender, who won the Premier League with Blackburn Rovers, has since battled with gambling and alcohol addiction and was made bankrupt by an online betting company after running up debts of &pound;2.2m.
 

He then lost his Georgian mansion on Lytham seafront in Lancashire.
Hendry, of Coopers Row, Lytham, also played for Manchester City and Rangers and is currently reserve team manager at Blackburn.
