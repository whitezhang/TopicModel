SCOTTISH Greens have pledged to invest in education and support students.The party is fielding candidates in every Glasgow seat for the first time at a General Election and it said it will promote a range of issues to improve life for young people.Its manifesto includes commitments on a &pound;10 minimum wage, and opposition to any moves to remove benefits from under 25s.Zara Kitson, Scottish Green MP candidate in Glasgow North, said:&quot;Education is one of the most important public goods and access should not be based on ability to pay.&quot;By electing Scottish Green MPs we can help colleagues south of the border win the argument for free university tuition, and we can help those from abroad who choose to study in Scotland stay in Scotland for work.&quot;
