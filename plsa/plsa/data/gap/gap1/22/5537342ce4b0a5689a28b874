JIM Murphy launched a scathing attack on two Prime Ministers during a campaign event in Glasgow.The Labour leader described John Major and David Cameron as a &quot;duet of cheerleaders for the SNP&quot; during his rally in St Enoch's square yesterday morning.Addressing throngs of Labour supporters, the Scottish party leader blasted former Prime Minister John Major for saying Labour would be open to political blackmail if they joined forces with the SNP.Mr Murphy said: &quot;John Major and David Cameron have now turned into a duet of cheerleaders for the SNP.&quot;The Tories can't win here in Scotland, that's the truth, so they have to get someone else to beat the Labour party for them.&quot; I think we'll take lessons from John Major - the man who lost every Tory seat in the 1997 general election- with a pinch of salt.&quot;John Major, who spent his entire time not talking about the Tory party, not trying to persuade people to vote Tory, but spending every moment of his interview trying to get Scotland to vote for the SNP.&quot;A former Prime Minster of the UK standing there, reading out a press release ... Just standing there inciting people in Scotland to vote for the SNP.&quot;[He] has come to Scotland and all he has done us talk about the SNP.&quot;It's cheap and nasty politics, its desperate stuff from the Tories.&quot;Murphy also accused the two Tory Prime Ministers of &quot;tawdry and shameful&quot; behaviour and added: &quot;They know they are losing the election.&quot;The only way they can cling on to power is to try and persuade Scotland to go out and vote SNP.&quot;Admitting Labour were behind in the polls in Scotland, Murphy also emphasised the desire to abolish &quot;exploitative zero hours contracts&quot; in the hope of boosting his party's profile with voters.He said: &quot;Zero hours contracts are utterly unacceptable.&quot;You can't support your family when you go to work in the morning and you've got no hours.&quot;We want to abolish these for good.&quot;It's an undignified way to treat people, it belongs in another century.&quot;He described the SNP as &quot;trigger happy&quot; about independence, and accused them of changing the once-in-a-generation referendum vote to making plans for the next one.&quot;I know we're behind in the polls here in Scotland with 2 weeks 2 days to go.&quot; he said.&quot;You can gamble on getting rid of the Tories by voting SNP or you can guarantee of getting rid of the Tories by voting Labour.&quot;There are many reasons to vote labour - the abolition of foodbanks, the end to exploitative zero hours contracts...&quot;Scotland should vote Labour for social justice, and because it's the last thing David Cameron wants us to do.&quot;Scotland could have the government we want - a Labour government delivering social justice.&quot;Speaking before an audience of around 100 people, Murphy was heckled from passersby including onlookers with megaphones.Many shouted &quot;traitor&quot; and &quot;liar&quot; while others criticised the Labour-run Glasgow City council and Gordon Matheson, who had joined the Scottish party leader at the rally.Murphy responded to one heckler by saying &quot;I won't be silenced by you and neither will anyone else.&quot;When asked if he enjoyed the lively exchanges out on the street he said: &quot;I enjoy it. Politics isn't about stale dull press conferences behind desks, or hitting the retweet button.&quot;It is about passion, patriotism and wanting change.&quot;I'm really enjoying it and I'm really looking forward to doing it more often.&quot;
