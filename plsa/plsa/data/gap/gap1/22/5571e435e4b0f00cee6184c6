TAILBACKS were caused on a busy motorway on Wednesday morning &quot;due to a dog taking control of a tractor&quot;.
The bizarre incident was reported by Traffic Scotland at junction 13 of the M74 near Abington in South Lanarkshire.
The transport body tweeted: &quot;M74 (N) J13-RTC due to dog taking control of tractor... nope, not joking. Farmer and police at scene, vehicle in central res.
It was reported that the dog had leaned on the controls of the tractor, taking it from a field on to the road. It caused a stir on social media and shortly afterwards Traffic Scotland provided an update: &quot;M74 (N) at J13 - Route is clear from earlier incident and dog is fine. Has to be the weirdest thing we have ever reported! No delays in area.
