Talks are to be held on a written offer from Highlands and Islands Airports Limited to resolve a long-running dispute on security workers' pay.
More than 120 staff held a 48-hour strike earlier this month which led to the closure of Dundee Airport.
Hial's other 10 sites continued to operate during the action.
The Prospect union will hold talks on the written offer. Members of the union have been in a dispute over their pay and conditions for the past six years.
Hial operates 11 Scottish airports in Dundee, Inverness, Argyll, the Hebrides, Orkney and Shetland and Wick.
