A NEW text message service is to be launched for women in Glasgow to remind them to attend breast screening appointments.The new service, which will also involve phone calls, comes after new figures showed the number of women attending their screening sessions is falling in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde area.Figures released yesterday at a health board meeting showed 67.1% of women eligible for screening attended, down slightly on the 70.1% in 2009.The figures reflected a national trend, which saw levels drop from 73.5% to 72.9%.Greater Glasgow and Clyde, however, was the only health board in Scotland that did not achieve the target of 70% attendance.The figures also showed the number of new breast cancer cases in the Glasgow area stood at 1082 in 2012 - taking the rate to 178.1 per 100,000 per population, higher than that for Scotland as a whole (167.9).Health chiefs have urged women to attend the clinics, saying the figures showed 1182 of 4145 cases of breast cancer from 2009 to 2012 were found through the screening process.A spokesman for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said: &quot;We recognise there has been a decrease in the number of women attending breast screening appointments. We would urge all women who are invited to take up the opportunity to have a screening.&quot;Breast screening is a very important tool in the fight to cut rates of cancer and other conditions. A number of steps have been taken to make this as easy as possible, such as sending mobile screening units from the West of Scotland Breast Screening Service into those areas where uptake is at its lowest.&quot;Communities which have a relatively low uptake of screening are also targeted by specialist workers to try to raise awareness of the benefits of screening and encourage women to use the service.&quot;Health Secretary Shona Robison said she wanted to see more women take up the invitation to attend screening.She added: &quot;The earlier cancer is detected, the easier it is to treat.&quot;All the evidence shows that more lives can be saved through early detection and breast screening can pick up cancers that women would be unlikely to find themselves.&quot;The figures published show that the overall uptake of breast screening remains high, with nearly three-quarters of Scottish women participating in the programme.&quot;I'd encourage every woman aged 50 to 70 to find out more about the Scottish Breast Screening Programme.&quot;
