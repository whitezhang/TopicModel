SCOTLAND’S schools dealt with more than two cases per day last year where kids were suspended or expelled for drinking or using drugs.
 investigators have learned that there were more than 460 cases across the country in 2013-14. And campaigners last night warned that pupils who drink or take drugs are risking their health and future.
We used freedom of information rules to ask Scotland’s 32 councils for figures for 2013-14.
The 460 cases were recorded over a school year that lasted between 189 and 191 days in different parts of the country, giving a daily figure of approximately 2.4 cases.
The councils split the cases into those involving “alcohol abuse” and “substance abuse”, which includes drugs.
Barbara O’Donnell of Alcohol Focus Scotland said a survey of drinking and drug use among schoolkids last year showed that the scale of the problem was decreasing.
But she added: “The number of young people being suspended or expelled is worrying.
“Drinking in adolescence can have a range of negative impacts on health and wellbeing, such as poor mental health and risky sexual or offending behaviour.”
O’Donnell called for action to protect young people from alcohol marketing and what she called Scotland’s “pro-alcohol environment”.
The Scottish Government said the vast majority of pupils were a credit to schools, but ministers were making sure kids were given “substance misuse education”.
Larry Flanagan, general secretary of the EIS teaching union, said the scale of the problem should not be exaggerated.
He added: “Young people make mistakes. The role of schools is to help them learn from them.”
