LOTTO teen Jane Park has launched a financial business with notorious gangster Mark Richardson.
Jane, 19, teamed up with drug dealer Mark, 28, a few months after he completed a prison term for peddling crack cocaine.
The Hibs fans each own half of Green and White Investments (Scotland) which is registered in Baberton, Edinburgh.
Jane, who scooped &pound;1m on the lottery when she was just 17, uses her mum's surname Restorick on company documents.
Jane initially denied her involvement with Richardson, a friend of murdered gangster Kevin “Gerbil” Carroll.
Asked by the Sun on Sunday newspaper if she had set up the firm using her mum's name, she said: “I don't have a business.”
But she then backtracked and admitted: “The business isn't running any more.”
Jane today told her 3,295 Twitter followers: “The papers talk some s***e like.”
Last month we revealed Jane had he got a job in a chippy because she was “bored spending money”.
Jane started work at the Marmaris Fry in Edinburgh after deciding she preferred a “working routine” to a life of leisure.
And we told how the big-hearted lottery winner stepped in to try and make a cancer-hit boy’s dream holiday to Florida a reality.
The teenager offered financial help to desperately ill Leon Rendle, 15, after insurance firms refused to cover him for a trip to the US to swim with dolphins.
