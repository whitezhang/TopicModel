STUART McCall today thanked big-hearted Rangers fans for helping the Ibrox club reach a major milestone in its bid to pay for one million vaccines.Light Blues supporters have now donated &pound;250,000 to Unicef's global immunisation programme - enough to fund 800,000 vaccines.The Rangers Charity Foundation has a long-standing partnership with Unicef UK and made the announcement as part of World Immunisation Week.The foundation is hoping to finance one million vaccines for children in the developing world by the end of 2015 and is well on course to hit its target.And Gers manager McCall took time out from preparing for the SPFL Championship match with Hearts on Saturday to thank fans for their generosity.He said: &quot;Unicef's campaign to reach every child is so important and the Rangers Charity Foundation is doing a great deal to support that goal.&quot;The fans should be very proud of what they have achieved with the foundation - they really are saving children's lives.&quot;One child in the world dies every 20 seconds from diseases like measles, polio and tetanus which are easily preventable with the use of a cheap vaccine.Unicef is the largest distributor of vaccines to the developing world and immunises one in three children - including in war-torn countries like Syria.McCall added: &quot;We take things like routine immunisations for granted, but when you read some of the World Immunisation Week statistics and stories it really makes you stop and think.&quot;There are kids in war zones or in remote rural locations, living in extreme poverty, who die every day or are left disabled because they did not receive their vaccinations.&quot;I was extremely impressed when I joined Rangers to hear about the work of the Rangers Charity Foundation.&quot;I'm delighted to be part of the Foundation's One in a Million initiative with Unicef UK to support their immunisation programme to protect more children from preventable diseases.&quot;The number of children who can potentially benefit is incredible.&quot;Unicef UK deputy executive director Catherine Cottrell echoed McCall's sentiments and thanked Rangers supporters for their backing.She said: &quot;We would like to thank everyone at the Rangers Charity Foundation and all the fans for their continued efforts to support Unicef's life-saving work.&quot;It is shocking that children around the world are dying from easily preventable diseases, this support will help us to reach and immunise even more children in danger.&quot;The Rangers Charity Foundation has worked in partnership with Unicef, the world's leading children's organisation, since 2008.It contributed to successful projects in India and West Africa before launching its &quot;One In A Million&quot; campaign in 2012.The foundation hopes to fund one million vaccines at a cost of &pound;300,000 by the end of 2015.
