A LORRY driver was trapped in his cab for several hours after his vehicle crashed into an empty house in the Highlands this morning.
The accident involving another timber lorry happened on the A831 between Drumnadrochit and Cannich near Balnain about 8am.
The road was closed with diversions put in place as emergency services rushed to the location.
In total, 51 personnel from the Fire and Rescue Service, ambulance, police and doctors, were involved in freeing the man who suffered head injuries.
He has not yet been identified and his condition is unknown, as is that of the other driver.
A trauma team from Glasgow was also airlifted in to the scene to treat the man while he was being cut out of the vehicle.
The lorry, operated by Larbert based James Jones and Sons Ltd, was embedded in the cottage and specialist teams had to be drafted in with cutting equipment.
It is understood it may have originated from the company's Mosstodloch depot.
The property was being renovated for its owners who are not in the area, and was vacant at the time.
The cause of the collision is not known but it is thought that one vehicle may have clipped the other on the narrow carriageway sending the vehicle careering off the road into the house.
