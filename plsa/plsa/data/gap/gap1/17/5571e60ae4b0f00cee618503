SEVEN councillors have been cleared of misconduct after sending a pro-Union letter to voters before the independence referendum.
The five Labour and two Conservative members of Aberdeen City Council were hauled before the Standards Commission, the local government watchdog.
They were accused of breaching their code of conduct by agreeing to distribute a leaflet encouraging people in Aberdeen to vote No.
More than 100,000 homes received the mailshot.
Labour’s Willie Young, Barney Crockett, Jenny Laing, Ross Grant and Neil Cooney gave evidence before the commission, along with Tories Ross Thomson and Fraser Forsyth.
 Finance convener Young said he and his six colleagues had agreed to send out the leaflets. The message, signed by then council leader Crockett, said Aberdeen was “stronger now and will be stronger in future –  economically, politically and socially – as a partner with the United Kingdom”. 
 

The note led to 84 separate complaints from members of the public.
But Young insisted the letter had been examined by the then chief executive and legal officers, who had no concerns. He also said he’d sought his own independent advice from two solicitors.
The commission ruled the councillors were not in breach of the rules and a detailed report on the reasons behind the decision will be issued later.
Labour said they were “very pleased and relieved”.
 

But SNP Councillor Graham Dickson said: “Many people are going to be astonished by the decision.
“For a long time people have said the Standards Commission are a toothless organisation. I think a lot of people are going to agree.”
