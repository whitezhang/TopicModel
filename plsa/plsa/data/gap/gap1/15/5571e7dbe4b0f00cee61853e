SCOTLAND’s top police officer has been given everything from mangos to an ornament from gay officers while in the job.
Sir Stephen House, who earns more than &pound;200,000 a year, kept mangos given by Glasgow councillor Bashir Maan.
But he has put some perks up for charity raffles and declined other offers.
House said no to invitations to golf’s Open Championship, the Ryder Cup, the Royal Highland Show and a BBC Scotland “world premiere”.
Officers have recorded more than 160 perks since Police Scotland were formed almost two years ago. The gifts came to light after a freedom of information request.
The register says the blue and white figurine of two women was from the European Gay Police Association. House – criticised over the use of stop and search powers and the routine arming of officers – also declined membership of the New Club in Edinburgh, Scotland’s oldest private members’ social club.
 A police spokesman said: “The chief constable and other senior officers are occasionally offered or presented with gifts and these are recorded, whether accepted or not. This information is  available on request.” 
Detective Chief Super-intendent Clark Cuzen, of the counter-corruption unit, added: “All members of Police Scotland are required to adhere to strict guidelines and procedures when an offer of any gift or hospitality is made.
“The people of Scotland expect that we will treat all persons equally, be impartial in dealing with all matters coming to our attention, and that we will not use our public position for personal benefit provided by third parties.”
