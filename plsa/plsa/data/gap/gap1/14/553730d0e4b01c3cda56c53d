A MAN needed hospital treatment following an attack by another man after the pair bumped into each other at a subway station.
The attacker pushed his victim, punched him in the face and knocked him to the ground after they collided with each other at Buchanan Street subway station in Glasgow city centre at around 8.10am yesterday.
The 45-year-old victim went to Glasgow Royal Infirmary where he was treated for an eye injury and later released.
Police will scan CCTV footage taken in the station to try and identify the suspect, who was last seen leaving the station and heading towards Buchanan Galleries.
British Transport Police (BTP) appealed for information from any witnesses.
Inspector Lynda Lang said: “This was a completely unprovoked attack on the victim which has left him injured and shaken.
“I am appealing for anyone who was in the station or surrounding area and has information which can help identify the suspect to get in touch with BTP as a matter of urgency.”
The suspect is described as being aged in his mid to late 30s, with a broad chin and unshaven face.
He was wearing a grey fleece jacket and grey trousers.
