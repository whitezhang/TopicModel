THE family of a pregnant Scots woman allegedly murdered by her African pastor husband have hit out at reports she has taken drugs.
 Charmain Speirs was found dead in a bath in Ghana in March , days after her husband Eric Isiah Adusah checked out of their hotel, telling staff not to disturb her. 
Courts in Ghana have now been told the 41-year-old Scot died of a heroin overdose, with Adusah’s laywers claiming she was a habitual user of the drug.
Adusah, 28, - who has been charged with murder, even told Accra magistrates court that Charmain’s whole family who are from Arbroath, Angus, were heroin addicts.
Charmain’s brother, Paul, 30, admitted he was a recovering addict but told the Mail on Sunday it was “an outright and outrageous lie” to say the family had been drug users.
He said his sister would not have voluntarily taken the drug, adding: “She liked a glass of wine with her dinner - but drugs? No. My sister was always against drugs. And my parents can’t stand the things.”
 Following Charmain's death, her family posted online tributes to the mum-of-one .
