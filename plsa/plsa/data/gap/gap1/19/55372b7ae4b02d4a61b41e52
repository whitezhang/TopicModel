Amy MacDonald has stopped posting pictures of her new &pound;2000 tattoo after being trolled on social media.
The Scots rocker tweeted a string of photos showing the progress being made on a massive skull and roses on her arm.
But she was bombarded with abusive tweets.
Amy blasted the trolls and revealed that she wouldn’t risk posting any future snaps of her inking.

When one fan asked the 27-year-old on Twitter if she had any more work done on the tattoo, the singer revealed: “Loads! Not worth the petty and sexist remarks to post though.”
 Lucy Morgan told the singer, from Bishopbriggs, East Dunbartonshire: “What a shame. Those people are idiots. As long  as you love it that’s all that matters.” The This is the Life singer, who has several tattoos, replied: “Exactly. Bl**dy eejits!” 
Amy is getting the tattoo at Glasgow parlour Otzi.

 She’s already braved around 20 hours of pain but a source said: “Amy’s great. Most people swear because of the pain but  the most she says is ‘flip!’ 
“It’ll maybe take another two sessions before it’s finished.”
