 

A SCOTTISH expat was pranked by his PARENTS after they sent him a birthday wad of Scottish fivers with the message: “Love from Ma and Da. Try spending this in England! Ha ha.&quot;
Chris Smith, from Fort William, was left feeling well and truly had after receiving a witty birthday gift.
The parental pranksters, who live near Fort William posted their 27-year-old son a card with a wad of banknotes worth &pound;50.
But data architect Chris’s heart sank when he realised that the banknotes were, in fact, all brand new Scottish fivers.
In the accompanying card was the message: “Love from Ma and Da. Try spending this in England! Ha ha.&quot;
“It absolutely made my day when I opened it,” Chris explained to STV.
&quot;I actually thought the money was Euros at first because I'm going to Athens in October. Then I looked at them and realised they were Scottish fivers.
“They’re the new plastic notes too, so they're going to be even harder to spend.”
 
 

Despite what the trollish parents claimed, Scottish banknotes are, in fact, legal currency in England.
Speaking to STV, Chris said: &quot;My parents have lived in a wee town near Fort William their whole lives and when they came down to visit my dad didn't get London at all. He just paid for everything on his card.&quot;
