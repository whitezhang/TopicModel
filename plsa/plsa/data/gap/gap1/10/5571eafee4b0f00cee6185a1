A CALLOUS husband who carried out a vicious attack on his disabled wife has escaped a jail term.
James Irvine battered Joanne Hughes at their home after accusing her of stealing from him.
Irvine, 39, had returned from the pub to get tickets for a Hogmanay party.
Joanne told a court how her husband claimed she had nicked his money and called her a “black b******”.
She estimated he hit her on the top of the head 12 to 14 times. He also put his hands on her throat and choked her.
Joanne – who requires a wheelchair after a 2011 road accident left her with spinal injuries – shouted out the front door for an ambulance but Irvine butted her on the head in the hallway.
The attacker then collapsed on a coffee table and had a “seizure”.
Joanne, 41, went into the bathroom where she called police.
 

 When she came out, Irvine was regaining consciousness but was “very confused”. A jury previously found Irvine guilty of attacking Joanne to her severe injury at their home in Farm Road, Hamilton, on December 23, 2013, after a three-day trial at the town’s  sheriff court. 
This week, advocate Lorraine Glancy, defending, told Sheriff Vincent Smith that the writer of the social inquiry report on Irvine did not consider him suitable for the Change Programme, which is aimed at tackling domestic violence.
However, she said a period of supervision would allow him to undertake work in the community and put him in a position to attend the programme “in due course”.
Glancy added that the couple had reconciled and Irvine was motivated to take part in the programme.
 Sheriff Smith sentenced Irvine to a community payback order with the  conditions that he undergoes 18 months’ supervision and carries out 200 hours’ unpaid work within six months.
