DETECTIVES probing a gangland kneecapping and a double abduction believe the attacks may be linked, it has emerged.
 A man was blasted in the kneecaps and thrown down an embankment in Lanarkshire in March before two men were abducted a week later in Glasgow. 
During the abduction one of the men, aged 31, was the victim of an attempted murder.
Police now believe both incidents are connected and have narrowed inquiries to a house in Barnsley, South Yorkshire.

A police investigation, dubbed Operation Draken, has now been mounted.
 Detective chief inspector Gary Boyd, from Police Scotland’s Major Investigation Teams, said: “The attempted murder of a 45-year-old male in the East Kilbride area on March 13, 2015 and the abduction and attempted murder of a 39 and a 31-year-old male in the Glasgow area. 
“Inquires so far have revealed that an address in Barnsley may be of significance in light of these inquiries which are ongoing at present.”
