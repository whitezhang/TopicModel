A FOOTBALL fan was left ruing the autocorrect function on his phone after attempting to buy a Juventus top with Andrea Pirlo on the back went wrong.
The unlucky fan had tried to buy a Juventus top for his brother's birthday using his smart phone. He wanted Italy legend Pirlo's name on the back - but ended up with Pitlochry thanks to good old autocorrect.
Everton fan James tweeted his error from his twitter account - @jamesefc1 - and has so far attracted 613 retweets since he posted the picture last night.
He later tweeted that his brother is yet to find out about the error with his birthday still two weeks away.
