 

SPARE a thought for the poor hen who laid this monster egg.
It weighs 195g, nearly four times that of a normal egg and is almost eight inches in circumference.
But despite possibly being the biggest egg laid by a hen in the UK, farmer Gary Hadden plans to eat it.
Gary, of Airdrie, was stunned by the size of the egg â€“ no doubt the chicken was too.
