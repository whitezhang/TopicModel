 A CONTROVERSIAL plan to abolish the age-old requirement for corroboration in criminal trials has been dropped by the Scottish Government following a review which recommended that it be retained in certain circumstances. 
A review by former High Court judge Lord Bonomy recommended that corroboration should be kept for evidence that is related to a confession or is hearsay - an account given by a witness in court about a statement made by another person before the trial.
In response, Justice Secretary Michael Matheson said he wants to build a consensus on a package of proposals for criminal justice reform, including a full response to Lord Bonomy's review.
He said: &quot;Given this approach, I do not consider there is sufficient time to complete this work before the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill resumes its parliamentary passage.
&quot;On that basis, it is clear to me that proceeding with the removal of the corroboration requirement in that Bill would be neither appropriate nor feasible.
&quot;The Bill should proceed with amendments to remove corroboration provisions from the Bill, and also to remove the related increase in the jury majority required for conviction.
&quot;Removing the corroboration provisions from the Criminal Justice Bill will allow the other provisions in the Bill to go forward as soon as parliamentary timetables permit.&quot;
