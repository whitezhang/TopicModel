A COUPLE whose only child died after battling cancer have launched an appeal in his memory on the anniversary of his death.Cheree and Steven Sharpe, from Kilmarnock, hope Alfie's Wishes will help children and young adults with neuroblastoma have a special wish or treat.Alfie, who died a year ago, was just four when he was diagnosed with the deadly disease.Neuroblastoma is the most common cancer outside the brain in children under five years old. In most cases it is only diagnosed when it has already spread throughout the body.After two years of gruelling treatment, which included chemotherapy and surgery, he was given the all-clear. But last March, Cheree and Steven were given the devastating news that the cancer had returned and this time, as it had spread to Alfie's brain, there was no further treatment available.Cheree said: &quot;Our son was now terminally ill, and so we wanted to make every moment magical as our fairytale was not going to be happy ever after.&quot;Five and a half weeks later, Alfie died.Cheree said: &quot;Alfie is the love of our life and not having him here in person is the most awful hurt imaginable.&quot;We spend so much time thinking and talking about him and all the fun times the three of us had.&quot;The most important thing for Alfie was having fun and we never let neuroblastoma get in his way, right till the very end.&quot;Alfie loved magic, fairies and superheroes and Cheree and Steven believe the appeal is just what he would have wanted.Cheree explained: &quot;We know Alfie would want other heroes and princesses to have opportunities to create happy memories to be treasured forever by their families.&quot;The appeal is being run by the NCCA (Neuroblastoma Children's Cancer Alliance) UK. Chief executive Bettina Bungay-Balwah said: &quot;We are delighted to be part of Alfie's Wishes in memory of this brave little boy.&quot;The NCCA is here to help families affected by neuroblastoma and Alfie with his never ending smile, is an inspiration to us all.&quot;To donate to Alfie's Wishes visit http://www.ncca-uk.org/alfies-wishes
