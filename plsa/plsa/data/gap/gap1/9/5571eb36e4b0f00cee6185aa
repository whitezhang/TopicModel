AS far as celebrity weddings go in Scotland it doesn't get much bigger than Andy Murray tying the knot with long term girlfriend Kim Sears.
The couple have been together for almost 10 years since meeting at a party for the US Open in 2005.
Ten years - and numerous titles including the US Open and Wimbledon championships - later they are finally set to tie the knot on Saturday in Murray's hometown Dunblane.
The couple have certainly seen the world in their time together and it's not often Andy takes the court without the support of Kim just a few feet away in the stands.
A perfect match in our eyes - or should that be an ace couple?
