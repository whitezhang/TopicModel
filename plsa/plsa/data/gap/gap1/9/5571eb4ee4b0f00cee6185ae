THE GRIEVING partner of a man who died from Legionnaires’ disease has slammed investigators for failing to provide any answers after a three-year probe.
 Catherine McDonald said she was “bitterly disappointed” to learn the Crown Office will not prosecute anyone because they could not identify the source of the outbreak in Edinburgh three years ago . 
The epidemic, which lasted from June 5 to July 15, 2012, killed four people including Catherine’s partner Bert Air and affected a further 92.
Last night Catherine, who had been with Bert for 12 years when he died aged 56, said: “I am hurt, angry and disappointed at the outcome of the meeting. It feels like his life means nothing. I still want to know why Bert died.”
Catherine, 57, who lives in the city’s Seafield area, said Bert was diagnosed with a chest infection and struggled into work for two weeks, not knowing he was dying from Legionnaires’.
The dad of two, who worked on a building site at the heart of the outbreak zone in Gorgie, was sent home from work the day before he died.
The next morning Catherine rushed him to hospital, where doctors told her they suspected he may have Legionnaires’.
 He then suffered two heart attacks – the second of which proved fatal and was listed as the  cause of death on his death certificate for six months. 
 

Catherine added: “Then they finally sent me a letter saying he actually died from Legionnaires’.”
Solicitors acting for the families have called for a fatal accident inquiry, which prosecutors said they would consider after consulting the bereaved.
Crown Office spokesman Gary Aitken said: “This was always going to be a complex investigation. We continued on in the hope that scientific evidence would come to light. Unfortunately that hasn’t happened.”
