TWO men are fighting for their lives after an apparent car sale gone wrong in Edinburgh.
Police are looking for witnesses to the two attempted murders which took place at around 6pm on Wednesday evening in the Pilton area.
It is understood that the two victims had travelled from Aberdeen to purchase a car before being involved in an “altercation” within a common stairwell in Wardieburn Street West.
One of the attackers is understood to have fled the scene using the backdoor of the block of flats into a shared grass courtyard.
The two injured men escaped out onto the street with the most seriously injured victim managing to drag himself into his car and driving around the corner.
Passers-by discovered him covered in blood and raised the alarm with his companion being found injured nearby.
It is not known what type of weapon was used by investigators said both men suffered “stab wounds”.
Police are hunting two suspects with the first described as a white man, aged 17-19 years old. He has a central Scotland accent and light coloured short hair, which is shaved at the sides.
He was wearing a light coloured sky blue hooded sweatshirt and grey jogging bottoms.
The second suspect is a white man in his mid-twenties. He has a stocky build and was wearing a striped top.
Detective chief inspector Stuart Houston said: &quot;This was an appalling attack on two men who came to the address in good faith.
&quot;This attack happened in daylight and we believe there may be a number of witnesses who may have seen the suspects in the area.
&quot;Anyone with information that can help with our enquiries is urged to contact police immediately.&quot;
Those with information can contact Police Scotland on 101 or anonymously through Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
