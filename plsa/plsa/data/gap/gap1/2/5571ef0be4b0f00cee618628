A SERIAL protestor who gained infamy by forcing Iain Gray to take refuge in a sandwich shop has been embroiled in a disturbance at a Labour meeting.
SNP supporter Sean Clerkin, who is renowned for hassling Labour and UK Government politicians, caused a commotion after being denied entry to in the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall where Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer Ed Balls was due to address members.
 

Clerkin claims he was assaulted twice by Labour aides as he tried to enter the hall which was said to be full to capacity.
A video of the incident - posted on YouTube - shows Clerkin trying to barge past several Labour aides while a pal recording the drama yells: &quot;Put your hands down!&quot; to event security staff.
 

Clerkin twice appears to fall to the ground claiming he was pushed. He said he wanted to quiz Labour party leaders on their stance on austerity. In 2011, Clerkin hit the headlines when he forced former Scottish Labour leader Iain Gray to take refuge in a Subway sandwich shop ahead of the 2011 Scottish election.
