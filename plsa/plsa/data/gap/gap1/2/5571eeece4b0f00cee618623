CHILDREN are more likely to get flu or tonsillitis if their parents use bleach in the house, according to research.
Passive exposure to the disinfectant increased the chance of a bout of flu by 20 per cent and tonsillitis by 35 per cent, a study published in the British Medical Journal today found.
Overall, the risk of any recurrent infection was 18 per cent higher among children whose parents regularly used bleach to clean the home.
The researchers from Belgium’s University of Leuven studied 9000 children aged six to 12 in Spain, the Netherlands and Finland.
 They said while the findings were “modest”, they were “of public health concern in light of the  widespread use of bleach in the home”. 
The authors admitted they didn’t know why kids were more likely to suffer an infection if their parents used bleach – but suggested “irritants” and “sensitising chemicals” released during the cleaning process may be to blame.
Professor Peter Openshaw, president of the British Society for Immunology, said: “The study is interesting but should be treated with caution. I will continue to sometimes use bleach at home.”
University of Southampton occupational and environmental medicine professor David Coggon added it was difficult to draw “strong conclusions” from the study.
He said: “Use of bleach to maintain good hygiene can have important benefits for health.”
