HEARTS footballer Jamie Walker is to pay the ultimate tribute to a Scots war hero who died on holiday after a hit and run.
The 21-year-old announced his plans to wear a T-shirt emblazoned with “RIP Shaun Cole” in memory of the soldier who died on Sunday in Miami, Florida.
The midfielder also told his followers on social media that he planned to wear a black armband for the 22-year-old, who was a massive Hearts fan.
Posting a picture of the shirt, he wrote: “Proud to say I will be wearing this on Sunday against rangers and a black armband!! Not only was shaun a great guy who served his country he was also a big hearts fan.”
Calls are being made by the soldier’s friends and family to hold a minute’s applause during Sunday’s championship game between the Edinburgh team and Rangers at Ibrox.
They hope to do it during the 22nd minute.
 

Shaun was a private with the 1st Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland and had completed two tours of Afghanistan.
The hero returned from the disease-stricken Sierre Leone in January where he was part of a mission to tackle the deadly Ebola virus.
The Edinburgh man’s family announced on Thursday that Miami Police believe he was mowed down by a vehicle which left the scene.
In a statement released by the Army, Shaun’s family said: “We would like to inform everyone that Miami Police are now following a line of inquiry that would suggest that Shaun was involved in a hit and run incident.
“We would like to thank Miami Police and Consular staff and everyone who has offered support to our family over the last few days.”
