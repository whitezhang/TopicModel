COPS were yesterday hunting an armed yob who attacked and robbed a delivery driver in a town centre street ... all for the sake of a &pound;10 curry.
The desperate thief pounced on his 41-year-old victim in Canal Street, Paisley, late at night.
As the unsuspecting delivery man entered a tenement close, the crook lunged at him, holding a sharpened tool against his neck and demanding cash.
The robber then rifled through the driver’s pockets but he bravely put up a fight and, as the struggle continued, both men tumbled down a stairwell.
When the victim, who works for an Indian takeaway in the town, broke free and ran back to his car, the thief grabbed the &pound;10 curry and fled the scene.
One source told the Paisley Daily Express: “This poor guy was put through a frightening ordeal, just for the sake of a curry.
“The delivery driver was jumped on as he made his way into a close, with the thief holding something sharp against his neck in a bid to get money from him but the driver didn’t have any cash on him.
“When the yob went through the driver’s pockets, he tried to push him away and the pair of them ended up falling down the stairs.
“That gave the guy a chance to run back to his car and his curry ended up being stolen from him.”
The robbery took place shortly after 11.30pm on Monday, with police describing the thief as aged between 45 and 49, around 6ft tall, with a slim build and light brown hair.
He spoke with a local accent and, at the time, was wearing a grey jacket with a hood.
Last night, a spokesperson for Police Scotland said: “The delivery driver was left shaken by the robbery and we are now very keen to track down the man responsible.
“Anyone who was in the area at the time or who recognises the description of the suspect is asked to contact local police immediately.”
Information can be passed on to police by calling 101. Alternatively, ring Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, where anonymity can be maintained.
