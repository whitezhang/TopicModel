A SCOTLAND fan came 500 miles to see his team – and ended up sharing a burger with Gordon Strachan.
Tartan Army stalwart Martin McPhee has identified himself as the mystery fan snapped with Gordon &shy;Strachan in McDonald’s.
The pair met at the burger outlet by chance after &shy;Scotland’s 6-1 win over Gibraltar at Hampden on Sunday.
And Martin has revealed the picture of them was taken by Gordon’s wife Lesley.
The Scotland boss said: “On my way home I met a guy in McDonald’s who had driven from Cornwall to see us.
“I wouldn’t have wanted to see him if we’d messed up against Gibraltar.”
Now we can reveal the fan in question was Martin, &shy;who is originally from Irvine.
Martin, 41, who is in the forces, said: “It was surreal to meet Gordon.
“It was at McDonald’s at a service station on the M6, I couldn’t even tell you which one it was. We just got talking. I told him I’d travelled from Cornwall and that I go to 90 per cent of the home games.
“He seemed impressed. He was just really friendly and down to earth.
“His wife took the photo, she was really lovely.
“It was still a shock to see that Gordon had mentioned meeting me. I saw it in the Record’s sports section.”
 

The McDonald’s meeting happened just south of the Border as Gordon and Lesley made their way home to the Midlands in England.
Martin was taking a longer route to Cornwall.
The only services southbound with a McDonald’s in the area is Killington Lake – 140 miles south of Hampden.
Martin’s wife Maria posted the Record’s coverage of the Scotland boss’s comments on &shy;Facebook, saying: “That’s my hubby, Martin”.
Martin added: “Although Maria is English she’s a big &shy;Scotland fan.”
