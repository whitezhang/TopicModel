A FACEBOOK troll who targeted a disability rights campaigner has been reported to police for alleged hate crimes.
Tony Bain taunted Rachael Monk with vile comments including: “Two mongs don’t make a right.”
But the abusive messages backfired after Rachael, 32, struck back.
She told Glaswegian Bain: “Your comments have made me laugh, they’re nothing new or original.
“Did you know hate crime is a criminal offence? Good luck when the police come knocking!
“Ignorance is a bigger disability.” Yesterday, Rachael said: “Although I was hurt by the comments I wanted to respond in a positive way.”
Rachael, from Annan, has cerebral palsy and can only speak through a computer.
She appeared in a video made by the Now Hear Me campaign, which promotes understanding for those suffering from speech impairment or loss. In a series of posts on an NHS Facebook page, Bain wrote: “Warning you will need an umbrella before watching this video.”
The comments sparked outrage from campaign supporters, who called Bain “worse than disgusting”.
A spokesman for NHS Education for Scotland said: “As soon as we became aware of inappropriate posts, we took action to block the individual. We have also reported the matter to the police.”
Police said they “would assess and investigate as appropriate any complaint made to us concerning comments which could be considered criminal”.
Bain could not be contacted for comment.
