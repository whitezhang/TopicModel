DRUG dealers, drink drivers and people charged under firearms law have walked free because police have been too late in filing reports to prosecutors, it has been revealed.
Thousands of alleged offences have slipped through the net of the criminal justice system because of the blunders which have seen time bars expire.
Figures released under Freedom of Information to the Herald newspaper show that almost 4.000 charges were reported to the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) outwith the statutory time frames over the last six years, leaving prosecutors with no choice but to scrap proceedings.
And while many relate to less serious allegations, crimes such as underage sex, electoral fraud, animal cruelty, drug dealing and firearms charges have also been dropped because they were not prosecuted within a six to 12-month period
Legal experts have said the figures are “astonishing” and have called on Police Scotland to maker improvements. Between 2008/09 and 2013/14 a total of 3,850 were reported to the Crown outwith the six to 12 month period known as the time bar. The first year of the new Police Scotland, 2013/14, saw a total of 763 time-barred cases reported, the highest total since 2008/09.
Police Scotland says it aims to report cases within 28 days, but is sometimes prevented from doing so because all the evidence needed is not always available.
Deputy Chief Constable Rose Fitzpatrick said the percentage figure of late reporting, compared with all crimes reported by police is less than 0.3 per cent.
She said:”In 2013/14 a total of 270,397 were recorded yet only 763 charges were time-barred which is less than 0.28 per cent.
“In a small number of cases, where we require assistance and and information from a third party, despite our best efforts, this information is not received on time.”
