SUNNY Scotland enjoyed cracking Easter weather today – racking up the UK’s hottest day of 2015.
The temperature hit 20.5C (69F) at Aboyne in Aberdeenshire, topping this year’s previous best of 17C (63F), set in Northern Ireland.
Within days of suffering snowfalls, families flocked to parks and open spaces to roll their eggs and pick daffodils.
At Glasgow Green, hundreds of mums, dads and kids queued for the bouncy castle while characters from Frozen kept a smile on their faces.
Laura Gilmour, 19, from Carluke in Lanarkshire, was dressed as Elsa while friend Debbie Cutler, 23, played Anna.
Laura said: “Everyone’s so happy. The kids have loved getting their picture taken with us.”
Five young members of the Henderson family enjoyed the sunshine at Busby near Glasgow.
 

Craig Snell of the Met Office said: “It’s been a cracking day across Scotland.
“You have certainly had the lions’ share of the good weather, with the exception of the Solway Coast, where it has struggled to reach seven degrees Celsius (45F) in the fog.
“Glasgow is 15C (59F) at the moment but Edinburgh is 17C (63F) and Inverness is 19C (66F).
“The only place in England that has come close to the top temperatures in Scotland is Northumberland at 18.3C.”
The east coast will continue to enjoy the best of the weather tomorrow with temperatures of 17C (63F) expected in Edinburgh and Aberdeen, while Glasgow will be slightly cooler at 14C (57F) where cloud could be heavier. Orkney and Shetland could see some rain.
