A MULTI-MILLIONAIRE businessman yesterday vowed to bankroll a battle to force power chiefs to stump up &pound;80million.
Entrepreneur Alan Campbell, 51, has already spent &pound;100,000 on his campaign to pressure ScottishPower to pay refunds for a controversial warranty scheme.
And he said he’s prepared to treble that amount to win money back for shoppers who took out the PowerPlan policies on electrical goods.
Glasgow-born Campbell, who has a range of business interests and specialises in turning round ailing firms, said: “I’m prepared to put in hundreds of thousands of pounds of my own money into this.
“I want to help people to get their money back and for the authorities to bring those personally responsible to account.
“I think it’s a disgrace.”
Alan, a former adviser at ScottishPower, helped to introduce the five-year warranty scheme that was supposed to see customers get their money returned if they didn’t make a claim.
Around 625,000 households – including 290,000 in Scotland – who took out policies between 1997 and 2001 were due a refund.
However, ScottishPower had already sold their chain of stores to a firm called PowerHouse, who subsequently went bust.
As a result, none of the customers got refunds, which would have totalled &pound;79million. ScottishPower have agreed to pay back &pound;6million.
More than 80,000 former customers in Glasgow and 47,000 in Edinburgh are owed money.
A ScottishPower spokesman said: “The PowerPlan scheme, which was one of a number of very similar schemes offered by retailers in the late 1990s and early 2000s, did not involve any wrongdoing by ScottishPower.”
An all-party UK parliamentary group was formed last month to investigate the scandal.
