A MAN accused of serious sex offences in Scotland has been arrested in India.
Former nightclub bouncer Raminder Singh, 28, was arrested in Delhi on Sunday after almost three years on the run and a spell on a Most Wanted list.
Singh fled Scotland on July 23, 2012, the day after he allegedly raped a 23 year-old woman in an Edinburgh hostel.
He was also wanted for attempted murder and sexual assault after he allegedly tried to rape a 27-year-old in a car park, beating her so badly that he broke her jaw.
The next day he jumped on a flight from Glasgow to Delhi, via Dubai.
A Most Wanted notice was issued by Interpol on the day he disappeared and British authorities put in an extradition request with the Indian government.
Police in Delhi found Singh was constantly on the move, shifting from Delhi, Punjab and Chandigarh.
 

It is understood that he had a fake identity and went by the name ‘Jasdeep Singh Bajwa’.
He also ran a restaurant Noor Mehal in Jalandhar, a city in the northwestern state of Punjab.
Singh, who was from Punjab, had stayed for several months with an uncle who was an instructor at the Punjab Police Academy.
He came to Scotland in 2009 on a student visa to study a diploma in hospitality.
Joint Commissioner of Police (Crime Branch) Ravindra Yadav confirmed Singh had been arrested after a tip off that he was heading to a district in West Delhi to buy a false passport.
He said: “Raminder Singh was arrested yesterday (Sunday) from Delhi. Acting on a tip, police nabbed 28-year-old Raminder Singh from Alipur in west Delhi, when he reached there from Punjab to meet one of his acquaintances for procuring a fake passport for himself.”
