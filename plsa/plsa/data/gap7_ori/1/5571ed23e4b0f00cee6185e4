A SCOTS tourist has bled to death in Thailand after cutting himself on a mirror he smashed in a fit of rage.
Iain MacKay, 40, is believed to have been severely injured kicking a mirror in a shop where his girlfriend works, Thai police stated.
They said Iain, from Stornoway, had lashed out because he arrived at the shop and his girlfriend was not there, and that he later died in hospital.
Reports on social media suggested Iain had earlier clashed with his lover and another man after finding them together at a bar in Hua Hin district of Prachuap Khiri Khan province.
After news of his death emerged, his friends commented about posts on social media in which he uploaded photos of a woman who was apparently his girlfriend and another Caucasian man.
One said: “Iain was upset and referred to the woman who seemed to be his own girlfriend and a mystery man as lovers.”
Scots tourist Brian Nicol has died abroad after he was injured in a swimming pool accident.
The Foreign Office said Iain had died on Friday, adding: “We are providing consular assistance to the family at this sad time.”
