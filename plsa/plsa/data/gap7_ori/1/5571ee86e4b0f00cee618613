BOXING promoter Barry Hughes was fined &pound;250 yesterday for using a mobile phone at the wheel.
Hughes, 36, admitted he’d picked up the phone because he couldn’t work the hands-free system in the courtesy car he was driving.
He said he wanted to check who was ringing because his wife had taken their baby to the doctor’s with a high temperature.
Two police officers who spotted him confirmed he said he did not know how to use the hands-free system – but did not mention a sick child.
 

And PC Alastair Murdoch told Paisley Justice of the Peace Court: “He was holding a mobile phone in his right hand at his right ear.
“He appeared to be talking into the phone - his lips were moving.”
Hughes, of Kilmacolm, Renfrewshire, was last year jailed for 43 months for mortgage fraud, but freed after 19 days and fined &pound;45,000 instead.
He accused the police officers of “absolute lies” and insisted he did not answer the phone.
Hughes was also given three penalty points.
