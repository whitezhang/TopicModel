A JILTED wife has accused her husband’s stripper lover of taunting her with abusive texts.
Jacqui Lowe went public with her heartbreak after husband Charles walked out on their 24-year marriage.
He is now with Vici Lorimer, who previously broke up Jacqui’s parents’marriage by having an affair with her dad George. Vici, 43, married George but he died in 2012.
And Jacqui, 49, says she has been sent a string of cruel texts after revealing how her widowed stepmum moved on to her husband.
 

One read: “Your dad would be disgusted with you.” Another said: “Feel sorry for you. What a shame you’ve finally flipped.”
And Charles, 45, also sent her a message, saying: “I’m finally with someone who really loves me. Get a life you very sad lonely person.”
Jacqui, from Glenrothes, said the couple, who work together at Amazon’s base in Dunfermline, were bent on hurting her.
 

She has been left to care alone for her disabled daughter Charley, 18.
She added: “I think he’s having a mid-life crisis and will wake up one day and realise it, but it’s too late.
Charles insists he did not get together with Vici until after he left Jacqui.
