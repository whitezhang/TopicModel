A HILARIOUS video showing a tipsy football fan trying and failing to jump a burn has become an internet sensation.
Iain Michael McKinlay attempted the leap in a park after enjoying a few drinks with pals while watching a recent Celtic v Dundee United match.
His pals - who watched the ill conceived stunt in Dalmuir Park near Clydebank - posted the video on social media.
Dad of two Iain, 38, from Mount Blow, West Dunbartonshire, said: “People have been stopping me in the streets saying they have seen the video.
&quot;We had been in the pub watching the game and then we went for a wander through the park.
 

“I just thought it would be a good idea to jump across the burn but that’s not how it panned out. I got soaked and my mates thought it was hilarious. I am amazed that so many people have seen it.
“It will take a while for me to live it down.”
One viewer Jacqui Dorrington wrote: “Thanks for sharing. It’s the funniest thing I’ve seen in ages lol had to watch again.”
