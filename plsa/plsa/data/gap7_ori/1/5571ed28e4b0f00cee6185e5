SCOTTISH universities have been branded “shameful” for putting money into companies involved in arms trading.
Edinburgh , Glasgow, Strathclyde and Aberdeen’s Robert Gordon universities have nearly &pound;3 million invested between them.
The biggest was &pound;1.3 million invested by Glasgow University in firms including BAE Systems.
Student body NUS Scotland uncovered the figures in a Freedom of Information request which also revealed &pound;15 million of investment in fossil fuel firms and &pound;1.4 million in companies related to sale and alcohol production.
Kirsty Haigh, vice-president of communities for NUS Scotland, said the investments were shameful and added: “At the moment, many of them either don’t know or don’t care what companies their investments are supporting.
“Burning fossil fuels is causing disastrous climate change, and arms companies profit from conflict and human rights abuses.

“Our universities, which are at the forefront of world leading research, innovation and social progress, should know this better than anyone.”
But a spokeswoman for Universities Scotland, which represents university principals, said: “Importantly, institutions will give due consideration to the appropriateness of any investment and keep under review how their investments are being used.
“Scottish universities have been at the forefront of climate change and health research, and have had a major focus on international development, for a number of decades and are continuing with this important work.
“The output of this work is playing a vital role in the global search for solutions to environmental problems as well as addressing health and societal issues at home.”
