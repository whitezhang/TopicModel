<Annotation text=" in article 1rp8p1$2d3@usenetinscwruedu esd3@pocwruedu elisabeth s davidson writes    in a previous article banschbach@vmsocomokstateedu  says least a few enlightened physicians practicing in the us  it's really  too bad that most us medical schools don't cover nutrition because if  they did candida would not be viewed as a nondisease by so many in the  medical profession    case western reserve med school teaches nutrition in its own section as  well as covering it in other sections as they apply ie b12  deficiency in neuro as a cause of neuropathy b12 deficiency in  hematology as a cause of megaloblastic anemia yet i sill  hold the viewpoint of mainstream medicine  candida can cause  mucocutaneous candidiasis and in already very sick patients  with damaged immune systems like aids and cancer patients  systemic candida infection  i think the yeast connection is  a bunch of hooey  what does this have to do with how well  nutrition is taught anyway  elisabeth let's set the record straight for the nth time i have not read  the yeast connection  so anything that i say is not due to brainwashing  by this hated book  it's okay i guess to hate the book by why hate me elisabeth i'm going to quote from zinsser's microbiology 20th edition a book that you should be familiar with and not hate candida species  colonize the mucosal surfaces of all humans during birth or shortly  thereafter  the risk of endogenous infection is clearly ever present   indeed candidiasis occurs worldwide and is the most common systemic  mycosis  neutrophils play the main role in preventing a systemic  infectioncandidiasis so you would have to have a low neutrophil count or  sick neutrophils to see a systemic infection  poor diet and persistent  parasitic infestation set many third world residents up for candidiasis your assessment of candidiasis in the us is correct and i do not dispute  it  what i posted was a discussion of candida blooms without systemic  infection  these blooms would be responsible for local sites of irritation gi tract mouth vagina and sinus cavity  knocking down the bacterial  competition for candida was proposed as a possible trigger for candida  blooms  let me quote from zinsser's again however some factors such as  the use of a broadspectrum antibacterial antibiotic may predispose to  both mucosal and systemic infections  i was addressing mucosal infections i like the term blooms better  the nutrition course that i teach covers  this effect of antibiotic treatment as well as the cure  i guess that  your nutrition course does not too bad     here is a brief primer on yeast  yeast infections as they are commonly  called are not truely caused by yeasts  the most common organism responsible for this type of infection is candida albicans or monilia which is actually a  yeastlike fungus      well maybe i'm getting picky but i always thought that a yeast  was one form that a fungus could exist in the other being the  mold form  many fungi can occur as either yeasts or molds   depending on environment  candida exibits what is known as  reverse dimorphism  it exists as a mold in the tissues  but exists as a yeast in the environment  should we maybe  call it a mold infection  a fungus infection  maybe we  should say it is caused by a moldlike fungus      martin banschbach phd professor of biochemistry and chairman department of biochemistry and microbiology osu college of osteopathic medicine 1111 west 17th st tulsa ok 74107     you're the chairman of biochem and micro and you didn't know   that a yeast is a form of a fungus  shudder  or maybe you did know and were oversimplifying  my my elisabeth do i detect a little of steve dyer in you  if you  noticed my faculty rank i'm a biochemist not a microbiologist candida is classifed as a fungusaccording to zinsser's  but as you point  out it displays dimorphism  it is capable of producing yeast cells  pseudohyphae and true hyphae  elisabeth you are probably a microbiologist  and that makes a lot of sense to you  to a biochemist it's a lot of  greek  so i called it a yeastlike fungus go ahead and crucify me  you know elisabeth i still haven't been able to figure out why such a small  little organism like candida can bring out so much hostility in people in  sci med  and i must admitt that i got sucked into the mud slinging too i keep hoping that if people will just take the time to think about what  i've said that it will make sense  i'm not asking anyone here to buy into  the yeast connection book because i don't know what's in that book plain  and simple and to be honest with you i'm beginning to wish that it was never  written  marty b " confidence="0.2" support="20" types="" sparql="" policy="whitelist">
