<Annotation text="  in article 1p5e0tinnojp@minervacisyaleedu bellpeter@yaleedu peter bell writes my advisor has decided to get a mac for the lab now that we are funded again  the consensus in the lab was that all we really needed was an lciii but  he decided he wanted a centris 610  the lack of an fpu on that machine and the price struck me as making it worth less than an lciii so i have  suggested we get a iivx instead  it seems heavily expandable and for   what do people with iivx's think of them  they seem like good machines to me and i like the nubus slots in case we ultimately decide we want to do work with video on it  the iivxlciii performance at a centris 610 price the only reason to get an iivx is if you really need the fullsize nubus slots keep  in mind that the 610 supports all apple monitors and has optional ethernet this lessens but doesn't eliminate the need for nubus cards and unless you're running fpuintensive software the 610 will blow the doors off the lciii and the iivx the lciii on the other hand is sufficient for most people and has a great price  if you haven't guessed i find halving the bus clock the iivx 32mhz up vs 16mhz bus a throughly bad thing and i hope apple never does it again   ______________________________________________________________________________ |joe finete                                                                   | |jfinete@catsucscedu                                                        |  " confidence="0.2" support="20" types="" sparql="" policy="whitelist">
