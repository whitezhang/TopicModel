 gnuplot, etc. make it easy to plot real valued functions of 2 variables
 but i want to plot functions whose values are 2-vectors. i have been 
 doing this by plotting arrays of arrows (complete with arrowheads) but
 before going further, i thought i would ask whether someone has already
 done the work. any pointers??
 
 thanx in advance
