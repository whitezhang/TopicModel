 psalm85(jps): for the leader. of the korahites. a psalm. o lord, you
 will favor your land, restore jacob's fortune; you will forgive your
 people's iniquity, pardon all their sins; selah; you will withdraw all your
 anger, turn away from your rage. turn again, o god, our helper, revoke
 your displeasure with us. will you be angry with us forever, prolong
 your wrath for all generations? surely you will revive us again, so that
 your people may rejoice in you. show us, o lord, your faithfulness;
 grant us your deliverance. let me hear what god, the lord, will speak;
 he will promise well-being to his people, his faithful ones; may they
 not turn to folly. his help is very near those who fear him, to make his
 glory dwell in our land. faithfulness and truth meet; justice and
 well-being kiss. truth springs up from the earth; justice looks down
 from heaven. the lord also bestows his bounty; our land yields its
 produce. justice goes before him as he sets out on his way.
