 in this parable, jesus tells the parable of the wedding feast. "the kingdom
 of heaven is like unto a certain king which made a marriage for his son".
 so the wedding clothes were customary,  and "given" to those who "chose" to
 attend.  this man "refused" to wear the clothes.  the wedding clothes are
 equalivant to the "clothes of righteousness".  when jesus died for our sins,
 those "clothes" were then provided.  like that man, it is our decision to
 put the clothes on.
