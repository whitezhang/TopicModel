 in the "sex ed" portion of the  high school "health" course i took
 in 1984, it was impressed that the only 100% positive way to *not*
 get pregnant was to *not* have sex.
 
 other methods of contraception were discussed, in the framework of
 a chart which showed both the _expected_ failure rate (theoretical,
 assumes no mistakes) and the _actual_ failure rate (based on research).
 top of the chart was something like this:
 
 
  method                  expected         actual 
  ------                 failure rate    failure rate
  abstinence                 0%              0% 
 
 
 and nfp (natural family planning) was on the bottom. the teacher even
 said, "i've had some students tell me that they can't use anything for
 birth control because they're catholic. well, if you're not married and
 you're a practicing catholic, the *top* of the list is your slot, not 
 the *bottom*.  even if you're not religious, the top of the list is
 safest."
 
 yes, this was a public school and after dr koop's "failing abstinence,
 use a condom" statement on the prevention of aids.
