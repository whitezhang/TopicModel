    here are some books i have read recently that helped me not only
    prepare for a 5 week series i taught in sunday school, but greatly
    increased my knowledge of the qumran scrolls. [...]
 
 one other recent book i would heartily recommend is joseph fitzmyer's
 _response to 101 questions about the dead sea scrolls_ (paulist,
 1992).
 
 fitzmyer is one of the preeminent modern nt scholars.  he was also one
 of the early workers on the dss.  his book is written in a
 straightforward q&a that allows it to serve as a source for a great
 wealth of clearly presented basic, up-to-the-moment information about
 the dss.
 
 (this book is something of a companion volume to raymond brown's
 _response to 101 questions about the dead sea scrolls_.)
