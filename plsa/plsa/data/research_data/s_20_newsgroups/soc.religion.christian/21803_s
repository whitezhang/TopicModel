 i find this remark to be awfully arrogant.  i would venture to 
 say that there are many people who are christians now, who at one
 point in their lives had no intention of ever becoming a christian.
 i was certainly one such person.  i am quite thankful that there 
 were christians who were willing to continue to talk to me, despite
 the appearance that it might have been a waste of their time and 
 mine.  (i even married one of them.)
