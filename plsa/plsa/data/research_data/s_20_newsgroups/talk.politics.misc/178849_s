 considering that clinton received a draft notice and got out of it (he admits it) the political feasibility of him abolishing it is not something he would
 be inclined to risk any extra exposure on.

 if you read aviation week, the c-5 line can be reopened and the c-5s
 would be delivered a year earlier and cost a billion less for the 
 program. politically, though, the c-17 is popular pork.

 agreed. congress took money from nasa and fha to fund the second seawolf.
 the shipyards are still building los angeles class submarines and there
 is a lack of asw foes to contend with. the navy is considering reducing
 the number of attack subs to 40 (navy times) and that would entail
 getting rid of or mothballing some of the current los angeles class.
 
 politically, general dynamics is in connecticut and we will get
 seawolf subs whether we need them or not.
 
 in addition, more bases need to be closed. probably long beach naval station
 and others. the navy is talking about three main bases on each coast being 
 required to home port a total fleet of 320 ships.
 
 the question is whether les aspin and clinton will be able to face down
 a pork happy congress.
