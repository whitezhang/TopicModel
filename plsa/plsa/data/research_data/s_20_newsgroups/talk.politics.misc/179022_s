 it is obvious that mr. cramer has the 'ability' to take the 'leap of faith'.
 i have listened to several of the men involved in this study, and even they
 claim that the men involved will not 'tell the whole truth'.
 
 i put little value in extrapolating from these types of 'studies' or 'surveys',
 they have limited subsets of individuals, and there is alot of skewing due
 to improper selection methods, and the bias of the people involved in the
 studies on both sides- subject and researcher.
 
 would you admit to be part of a group that was not very well liked?  would 
 you admit to having had sex with other people at some considered abnormal
 rate (this applies to heterosexual men).  in fact, as one gay man and one
 straight man put it, "men lie about the number of partners, because that's
 the thing to do"- our culture for the male almost requires this type of
 response.  it may seem harmless and silly, but carries a large emotional
 and mental price tag.
 
 i hear college male students everyday talking about their 'supposed' 
 conquest.  they just have to look good to one another, at least in their
 eyes.  but also know that alot of this does go on, there are many college
 males (hetero) having a lot of sex with different partners.
