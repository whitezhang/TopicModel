 primarily milage.  gas is much more expensive, so people are very
 concerned about it taking a few more liters per kilometer.  this,
 along with narrow old cities, also results in smaller cars with
 smaller engines.  these engines usually don't have the torque to mesh
 well with an automatic.  so, having engines that don't work well with
 autos, and a great concern for milage, the usual euro-car has a
 manual.
 
 (note that not many big benzes come with manuals.  if you've got the
 money for the car, you've got the money for the gas, and the engine to
 drive through the slushbox.)
 
 as automatics become more efficient, the "bigotry" is probably
 reduced.  still, everyone knows how to drive a manual, and cars are
 cheaper with one, and it saves a little expensive fuel.  so there
 aren't compelling reasons to go automatic.
