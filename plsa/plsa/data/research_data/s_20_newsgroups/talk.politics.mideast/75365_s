 i dunno, warren.  just the other day i heard a rumor that "serdar argic"
 (aka hasan mutlu and ahmed cosar and zumabot) is not really a turk at all,
 but in fact is an armenian who is attempting to make any discussion of the
 massacres in armenia of turks so noise-laden as to make serious discussion
 impossible, thereby cloaking the historical record with a tremendous cloud
 of confusion.
