   i am happy to say that some harley riders in our area are better than most
 that are flamed about here: i (riding a lowly sport bike, no less) and my
 girlfriend were the recipient of no less than twenty waves from a group of
 at least twenty-five harley riders.  i was leading a group of about four
 sport bikes at the time (fj1200/cbr900rr/vfr750).  i initiated *some* of the
 waves, but not all.  it was a perfect day, and friendly riders despite some
 brand differences made it all the better...
