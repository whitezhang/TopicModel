 the picture from the press conference on the cover of the times
 that day had prof. altman at the lectern holding a yale pennant
 over his head ... there was a tiny canadian flag pasted atop the
 yale crest.  he may also have had his tongue sticking out, but
 i might be confused with a picture of mark messier holding the
 1987 canada cup aloft.
 
 [heck, i'd be that happy too ... in either case! (-;]
