 >what is pink noise and how is it used in sound experiments?
 
     pink noise has constant power per geometric frequency increment
 (octave, 1/3 octave, etc).  thus the 10khz-20khz octave has the same
 amount of noise power as the 10hz-20hz octave.
     white noise has constant power per arithmetic frequency increment
 (hz, khz, etc).  thus the 10khz-10.1khz band has the same amount of
 noise power as the 10hz-110hz band (both bands are 100hz wide).
     pink noise can be made by passing white noise thru a -3db/octave
 filter (usually approximated by a network of several rc pairs).
 note: you can't get -3db/octave by using half a -6db/octave network 
 :-(
     pink noise is commonly used in audio power response measurements.
 it shows up on audio spectrum analyzers (with octave-related bands)
 as a flat line across the bands.
