 
 i just received a music software winsong for windows and found that it needs
 a midi/sound card (sound blaster pro is preferred) to have its fantastic
 features show up. as i don't have the plan to add a sound card now, i am 
 putting it here for sale. it's listed $79.95 on april issue of windows 
 magazine and i paid $84.95 as the total. i am asking around $70 with shipping
 included.
 
 winsong for windows:
 
 composer, sequencer (tape deck), and juke box all in one.
 
 it's a word processor for music - you can write and edit (cut, paste, move
 and copy, etc) notes and symbols, play and print your composition.
 
 it's graphical user interface works like a multi-track tape recorder.
 up to 64 musical tracks can be arranged for play, record, rewind, fast-forward
 and stop.
 
 it plays music on any midi compatible instrument - piano, guitar, drum set,
 saxophone, clarinet, organ, and many.
 
 you do not need to be a musician to use this software. the on-line manual
 is handy. for musicians, it's great as writing music is not a tedious and
 stifling aspect.
 
 almost new (one week old), unregistered
 $70 (including shipping) obo (please be reasonable)
