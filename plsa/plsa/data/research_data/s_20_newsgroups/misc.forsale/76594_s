 hey,
 
 collection.  i am interested in buying any in good condition.  i am 
 particularly interested in any of the older, exotic models (eg five ] 
 transformers into one etc...  i am looking at paying around $20-$40 depending
 upon the model, size and original cost etc.  i will also pay airmail postage
 and packing.  i am also happy to buy any old sci-fi related toys eg robots,
 rocketships, micronauts etc... there is only one catch.  i live in new
 zealand so you have to be willing to post the items there.  i hop that
 someone can help me out. 
 
 
 cheers
