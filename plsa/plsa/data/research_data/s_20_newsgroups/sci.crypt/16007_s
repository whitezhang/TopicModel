 there are other laws and directives which bear upon the subject.  for
 example, the national computer security act of 1987 specifically directs
 nbs [sic] to work with nsa on developing security standards for civilian
 federal computers.  (pick up the bill from cpsr.org; it also includes
 a report describing it, and some of the legislative history, including
 concerns about nsa's involvement.)  note also that nsa is specifically
 charged with running the national computer security center,  -- to
 quote the aforementioned report -- ``nsa also will work with industries at
 the dod computer security center to develop security standards for private
 sector use.''
 
 it may or may not be a good idea to have nsa tinkering with this, but
 i'm pretty sure it's legal.  (btw -- when it comes to development of
 cryptosystems, there may be two choices.  either nsa helped develop it,
 in which case maybe they can crack it, maybe not, but probably, no one
 else can; or nsa didn't help, in which case they probably can crack it,
 and maybe others as well...)
