SCOTLAND’S first cat cafe is on the move after outgrowing it’s temporary home in Edinburgh .
Maison de Moggy has announced the opening of their new venue which will see the cafe and its furry residents move from Stockbridge to the Grassmarket.
Following four successful months at their current home, owner Laura O’Neill said they’re really excited about the move which will include some new additions to the cafe’s cat crew.
Laura said: “”We are really excited about the new location. We loved Stockbridge and would have stayed in the area, but we outgrew the space.
 

&quot;It's a bigger location and it's great for us near Edinburgh College of Art and Edinburgh University and in the shadow of Edinburgh Castle , it should make it easier for the clientele to find.
&quot;The Grassmarket is quite quirky and the nature of the cat cafe has a speciality feel to it, it's different and suits what the Grassmarket is becoming.
&quot;It will be the same cats with a few new additions, we have a very rare breed that we will be announcing in a few weeks,&quot; Laura said.

&quot;We are open to more additions, but the usual suspects are coming with us.
&quot;They've all really gelled and it's working well so now it's time to get them to their forever home.&quot;
Maison de Moggy will begin its relocation on April 27, with plans to open in West Port in May.
