A SCOTS girl's April Fools' Day text to her boyfriend backfired badly after he agreed they should break up.
Hayleigh McBay messaged her other half on Whatsapp shortly after midnight on April 1 suggesting that they end their relationship.
But her boyfriend was not fooled and shocked her with his response.
Hayleigh said: &quot;I don't want to be with you anymore. I am not happy.&quot;
 
well my April fools backfired :s pic.twitter.com/DhKh3jsWtO

He agreed. He replied: &quot;Thank God you said it first so I didn't have to.&quot;
 
just to clarify me and David did not plan that but he guessed it was April fools so jokingly replied, sad that I have to specify that lmao

Shocked Hayleigh, from Morayshire, tweeted a screengrab of the conversation which has so far received over 11,000 retweets and favourites.
Luckily, she later found out that he had decided to give her a taste of her own medicine by playing along with the April Fools prank.
Maybe this will be a lesson to those who think it is funny to play with people's emotions on April Fools' Day.
